Group stage and knockout stage ...", "text": "Soccer’s marquee event is here.\n\nThe 2022 World Cup will be played by 32 national teams at stadiums in the Middle East country of Qatar. This year marks the first time the quadrennial tournament is held in the winter instead of over the summer.\n\nPlenty of highly anticipated matchups are on the docket in the opening round, including the United States vs. England game on Nov. 25, Mexico vs. Argentina on Nov. 26 and Germany vs. Spain on Nov. 27. Host nation Qatar will take on Ecuador on Nov. 20 to inaugurate the 4-week competition.\n\nIs this your first World Cup? Here's everything you need to know to understand the ultimate display of the beautiful game.\n\nWhere is the next FIFA World Cup?The 2026 tournament is coming to a city near you.\n\nWORLD CUP CENTRAL: 2023 Women's World Cup Live Scores, Schedules, Standings, Bracket and More\n\nWhat is the World Cup?\n\nThe World Cup is international soccer’s – or football depending on where you live – flagship tournament that takes place every four years, where national teams compete to determine which country has the best soccer team in the world.\n\nThe competition dates back to 1930 in Uruguay. Twenty-one World Cups have been played – every four years since, only skipping tournaments slated for 1942 and 1946 because of World War II.\n\nIt's one of the most watched sports competitions globally. More than 3.5 billion viewers tuned into the 2018 World Cup in Russia, and 1.12 billion watched the final, according to the sport's governing body FIFA.\n\nThe reigning champion is France, which beat Croatia in the 2018 final. The tournaments have been dominated by teams from South America and Europe, where the sport is immensely popular.\n\nHuman rights:Migrant workers were deceived and died for Qatar's World Cup. Thousands want compensation\n\nIs the U.S. in the World Cup?\n\nYes. The United States Men’s National Team has never won a World Cup. But it goes into Qatar looking to unlock the promise of a young squad that is widely regarded as its most talented ever. Led by Christian Pulisic, a forward who plays for the English soccer club Chelsea, the team has several young players who compete for teams in the world’s top leagues in Europe.\n\nThe U.S., however, is dominant in the women's competition. The U.S. Women's National Team has hoisted 4 World Cup trophies since the competition started in 1991.\n\nWorld Cup live updates:France makes multiple changes vs. Tunisia; Mexico faces potential elimination\n\nHow were the 2022 teams selected as World Cup Qualifiers\n\nThe tournament is comprised of teams that qualify from each of FIFA’s six regional soccer confederations plus the host nation. In the lead up to the World Cup, each confederation holds “World Cup Qualifier\" matches.\n\nUEFA (Europe): 13 teams qualified.\n\nCONMEBOL (South America): 5 teams.\n\nCONCACAF (North, Central America and the Caribbean): 4 teams.\n\nAFC (Asia plus Australia): 5 teams.\n\nCAF (Africa): 5 teams.\n\nOFC (Oceania): 0 teams.\n\nIts teams play against each other for points – a win equals three points, draw equals 1 point and a loss equals no points. Generally speaking, the teams with the most points at the end of the qualifying period advance to the World Cup tournament where they represent their confederation. The number of teams each confederation sends varies, as do the particulars of the qualifying process.\n\nNot all confederations will be represented. And not all teams clinch a World Cup spot by racking up points in confederation play.\n\nThe Oceania Football Confederation, for example, will not be represented. The top team that emerged from its World Cup qualifying competition, New Zealand, lost a playoff against Costa Rica, which finished fourth in CONCACAF qualifying.\n\nThe playoff system allows some teams, like Costa Rica, that fell just short of initial qualification, a final shot of making it into the tournament by knocking out another team.\n\nThree European teams – Wales, Poland and Portugal – qualified after beating opponents in UEFA's playoff system.\n\nIn some cases, such as the CAF (Africa), the top 10 teams were pared down to the final five by playing two-match playoffs, called two-legged ties. The teams with the cumulative score over the two games earned a World Cup spot.\n\nHow can the USMNT advance at the WC?:Breaking down all the Group B scenarios.\n\nWorld Cup qualifying usually starts the year following a World Cup tournament and typically concludes a handful of months before the start of the next tournament.\n\nWhat are soccer's yellow card rules? How players get red cards, suspensions in World Cup\n\nHow were World Cup groups selected?\n\nThe tournament is split into eight groups (Groups A - H) of four teams. Each group was selected via random draw out of four pots in April. Teams were placed in pots based on their FIFA world ranking. The highest ranking teams went in the first pot and so on.\n\nThe United States Men’s National Team was in pot three and drew into Group B with England, Iran and Wales, which beat Ukraine in a playoff to sneak into the tournament.\n\nWhat happens if a World Cup game ends in a tie? FIFA extra time and penalty shootouts, explained\n\nHow do teams advance to the knockout stage of World Cup?\n\nTeams play one match against the other teams in their group and the top two teams with the most points from each group advance to the knockout stage.\n\nA victory equals three points.\n\nA draw equals one point.\n\nA loss equals no points.\n\nIf the top two teams are tied in points, the first place team is the team with a higher goal differential (the difference between how many goals a team conceded and scored in its games) or whichever team won the head-to-head matchup.\n\nThe first place team of a group goes on to play the second place team of another group (and vice versa) in the first knockout stage, also known as the round of 16. Then the number of teams gets cut to eight, then four in the next stage, then to two, who will play in the final on Sunday Dec. 18. A third place match between the losers of the semi-final games will be played the day before.\n\nWhy is the World Cup in November this year?\n\nIf 2022 was like any other World Cup year, the tournament would have taken place over the summer. But FIFA decided in 2015 the extreme heat of the Persian Gulf nation made it unwise to hold the tournament in the summer, so it decided to push it back in the winter.\n\nWho has won the most World Cups?\n\nBrazil is considered the most decorated football nation with its five World Cup trophies. The South American country consistently produces some of the world’s flashiest and talented players, including Pele, Ronaldinho and Neymar. Brazil is known for its fan-friendly “Jogo Bonito” (\"beautiful game\" in Portuguese) style of play that values creativity and individual skill on the pitch.\n\nThis year’s Brazilian side, led by Paris Saint Germain’s Neymar, is considered a favorite to win it all. But Brazil hasn’t lifted the big trophy since 2002.\n\nWhat is offside in soccer?

Those 16 cities will accommodate an expanded tournament: In a first, 48 teams will participate at the next World Cup.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/football/qatar-world-cup-2022-guide-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "World Cup guide: How to watch Qatar 2022 | CNN", "text": "Doha, Qatar CNN —\n\nIn just over 24 hours, Qatar 2022 will burst into life as the host nation takes on Ecuador in the opening game of the World Cup.\n\nIt’s a tournament that has caused controversy ever since it was awarded to the Gulf nation in 2010 but, after years of waiting, the players are making the final touches to their preparations.\n\nWhile off-field issues continue to make headlines, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights, and the fact no alcohol will be sold at stadiums, the on-field action promises to be unpredictable and thrilling.\n\nHere is all you need to know about the 32 nations competing and the players who could dazzle.\n\nTournament favorites\n\nOnly eight nations have ever won the men’s World Cup, many of which are among the favorites this time around.\n\nBrazil holds the records for most titles, having lifted the trophy five times, and the new generation has a real chance of adding another for what would be the country’s first in 20 years.\n\nThe attacking options speak for themselves. As he has done since stepping onto the world stage, Neymar will carry the expectations of a nation but will have Real Madrid’s Vinicuis Jr. and Barcelona’s Raphinha to support him.\n\nThere is quality all over the pitch, not least in defense, where Chelsea’s experienced Thiago Silva and Paris Saint-Germain’s Marquinhos will likely form a shield for Liverpool’s goalkeeper Allison.\n\nBrazil also has an impressive record to boast, winning or drawing 28 of its past 29 matches, the only loss coming against Argentina in the Copa America final in 2021 and will feel confident of reaching the knockout rounds. It faces a relatively easy group stage, against Switzerland, Cameroon and Serbia.\n\nBrazil has named a strong squad going into Qatar 2022. Justin Setterfield/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nAlongside Brazil, you can’t ignore France.\n\nThe reigning world champion breezed through qualifying without losing a game and has Kylian Mbappe maturing into a global superstar.\n\nHowever, a number of injuries in key positions could harm its chances. Star striker Karim Benzema has been ruled out on the eve of the tournament, while the midfield duo of Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kante – so pivotal to its success in 2018 – miss out. However, central defender Raphael Varane has been included in the squad after recovering from injury.\n\nNielsen’s Gracenote predicts Brazil has a 20% chance of winning the competition, with Argentina, boasting the great Lionel Messi in its squad, the next most likely to lift the trophy with an 18% chance.\n\nSimon Gleave, head of analysis for Gracenote Sports, said: “No other teams have been anywhere near as consistent over the last four years as the two South American giants and this consistency means that there is a good chance of one of them prevailing.”\n\nUnderdogs\n\nIt’s rare that an underdog wins the World Cup but it’s not impossible.\n\nDenmark has its new golden generation. After being knocked out by England in the Euro 2020 semifinals, the team waltzed through World Cup qualification, winning nine of its 10 matches and conceding only three goals.\n\nManchester United playmaker Christian Eriksen is arguably its most important player and his return to the team is nothing short of a miracle.\n\nEriksen collapsed during Denmark’s game against Finland at Euro 2020 and received life-saving treatment on the pitch before being fitted with a Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) device.\n\nSuch trauma seemed to unite the team and the Danes will be a tough proposition for anyone in Qatar.\n\nElsewhere, Senegal is arguably the best African team at the tournament – even without Bayern Munich’s Sadio Mane, who misses out through injury.\n\n‘The Lions of Teranga’ won the African Cup of Nations for the first time earlier this year and have a host of star names playing in Europe’s top leagues.\n\nAlthough Mane will be a massive loss, the team is no longer just reliant on its captain.\n\nChelsea’s Edouard Mendy is a top class goalkeeper and Kalidou Koulibaly is used to dealing with the very best attackers in Europe. It also has the frightening pace of rising star Ismaila Sarr to lean on.\n\nNo African team has ever made it to the semifinals of a World Cup but this Senegal side has a chance, albeit very slim, should the draw be kind.\n\nSenegal celebrated winning the Africa Cup of Nations earlier this year. KENZO TRIBOUILLARD/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nPlayers to watch\n\nSome of the best players in the world will be on show in Qatar and, for many, it’s possibly the last chance they have to get their hands on the famous trophy.\n\nMessi and Cristiano Ronaldo are two of the greatest players to have played the game, but neither have had success on the biggest international stage.\n\nMessi has already confirmed this will be his last World Cup and, given he’ll be over 40 when the next tournament comes around, it’s safe to say Ronaldo is unlikely to play another.\n\nBoth are already their nation’s top goalscorers and both have a reasonable chance of going far in the tournament.\n\nAway from the established superstars, though, this could also be a tournament that unearths some lesser-known talents.\n\nIn addition to making its World Cup debut, Qatar is a relatively unknown quantity with most of its players spending their careers in the nation’s top league. The exception is attacker Akram Afif.\n\nThe wideman spent brief spells in Belgium and Spain before returning to Qatar and signing for Al Sadd in 2020. The 25-year-old has since developed into an exciting playmaker and backs up his trickery with efficiency.\n\nAfif made 11 assists during the team’s Asian Cup win in 2019 and currently has eight assists in just seven appearances in Qatar’s top division. He’s one to watch in the opening game.\n\nAnother rising star is Japan’s Takefusa Kubo.\n\nThe playmaker, 21, has learnt his trade at some of soccer’s most prestigious schools, spending time in Barcelona’s youth academy before joining Real Madrid in 2019.\n\nHe’s since left the Spanish capital but has excelled at Real Sociedad this season. He will be an important player in Japan’s World Cup campaign and has already been dubbed the ‘Japanese Lionel Messi’ back home. No pressure, then.\n\nQatar's Akram Afif could be exciting to watch for the hosts. Ralph Freso/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nAmerican star Gio Reyna could also become a global star.\n\nThe 19-year-old, whose mother and father both played international soccer for the US, joined German club Borussia Dortmund in 2019 from New York City’s youth academy and has made big strides, getting plenty of game time in recent weeks after missing a number of games last season with injury.\n\nSpeaking to CNN in 2020, Ghana’s manager and former Dortmund youth coach Otto Addo said Reyna’s ability was clear from an early age.\n\n“It’s his technique under pressure,” he said. “To make no mistakes under pressure, to change direction under pressure and to accelerate in the midfield.\n\n“He also has game intelligence, to position himself always between the lines, to read the game and he knows what’s next. He brings a lot, way more than other players from his age group.”\n\nGio Reyna could make an impact with the US if he manages to stay fit.

Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCroatia\n\nPerhaps the weakest team on paper in the quarterfinals, Croatia looks like a side struggling to reclaim the control that took it all the way to the final in 2018. The team was held comfortably by Morocco in the group stages, was very lucky to draw with Belgium and had to rely on penalties to beat Japan in the last 16..\n\nFor any other team, that would be a worry. But Croatia has shown that it is the master of navigating matches that go down to the wire. All three of its knockout games in 2018 went to extra-time or penalties, but in every one of those, the Croatians looked like the side in control.\n\nThat experience was on show against Japan. Like its semifinal victory over England four years ago, this was a game in which Croatia looked stronger and stronger as the game went on. That tournament experience and nous will be put to the test as Kockasti face a Brazil team that looks every bit as good as its pre-tournament tag as favorite would suggest.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nMorocco 0-0 Croatia\n\nCroatia 4-1 Canada\n\nCroatia 0-0 Belgium\n\nRound of 16:\n\nCroatia 1-1 Japan (Croatia won 3-1 on penalties)\n\nAccording to Opta, Brazil has a 27.6% chance of winning the World Cup. Carl Recine/Reuters\n\nBrazil\n\nA Seleção, for the first time in 20 years, looks as good as fans expect. The five-time world champion comfortably beat stubborn European opponent, Serbia, before giving the first team a rest against Cameroon. But against South Korea, the world saw what this team is truly capable of.\n\nWithin the first seven minutes, Brazil had already won the match and brought jogo bonito (the beautiful game) back to the World Cup, scoring for fun. Neymar – after missing the final two group stage matches through injury – was back again and playing with a freedom that the star has rarely been able to exhibit in the green and gold shirt.\n\nBrazil will once again be heavy favorite as it faces Croatia, but manager Tite and his team will not be underestimating its opponent. For the last 16 years, Brazil has come to tournaments with hype before crashing out against European opponents in the knockout stages. But this team looks like it could be the first since 2002 to bring the World Cup trophy back to its spiritual home.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nBrazil 2-0 Serbia\n\nBrazil 1-0 Switzerland\n\nCameroon 1-0 Brazil\n\nRound of 16:\n\nBrazil 4-1 South Korea\n\nNetherlands vs. Argentina\n\nWhen: Friday, December 9, 2 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Lusail Stadium\n\nAccording to Opta, the Netherlands has a 8.96% chance of winning the World Cup. Ricardo Mazalan/AP\n\nNetherlands\n\nIn what is expected to be the last tournament of Louis van Gaal’s stellar career, the Netherlands manager is looking to replicate his 2010 accomplishment of reaching the final of the World Cup – and maybe going one step further this time.\n\nLacking the stars of 2014, the Dutch have been a far more practical side, only conceding two goals so far in the tournament. But that did not stop it from scoring one of the goals of the tournament against the US. The team strung 20 passes together in a picturesque advertisement of the beautiful game before Memphis Depay stroked the ball home.\n\nThe Netherlands had arguably the easiest path to the quarterfinal stage, and their resilience will be tested as they play a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina.\n\nGroup Stage:\n\nSenegal 0-2 Netherlands\n\nNetherlands 1-1 Ecuador\n\nNetherlands 2-0 Qatar\n\nRound of 16:\n\nNetherlands 3-1 United States\n\nAccording to Opta, Argentina has a 17.4% chance of winning the World Cup. Molly Darlington/Reuters\n\nArgentina\n\nIn its first game of the tournament, Argentina suffered arguably the biggest upset in World Cup history as Messi and co. lost to Saudi Arabia. But since then, La Albiceleste has kicked into gear, comfortably winning its last three games.\n\nIn what is likely his final World Cup, Messi has slowly grown into the tournament, but against Australia he showed glimpses of why he is widely considered to be the best to grace the game. He scored a trademark goal against Australia, curling home a finish with irresistible ease, and was at his creative best as time and time again he created chances for his teammates.\n\nThis is arguably the least glamorous Argentina squad of the 21st century, but Lionel Scaloni’s side has a functional system that has served the team well. Like the Netherlands, Argentina is facing its biggest test of the tournament.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nArgentina 1-2 Saudi Arabia\n\nArgentina 2-0 Mexico\n\nPoland 0-2 Argentina\n\nRound of 16:\n\nArgentina 2-1 Australia Cup\n\nEngland vs. France\n\nWhen: Saturday, December 10, 2 p.m. ET\n\nWhere: Al Bayt Stadium\n\nAccording to Opta, England has a 18.83% chance of winning the World Cup. Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty Images\n\nEngland\n\nThe Three Lions have had the best start of any team in Qatar, keeping three clean sheets and dispatching African champion Senegal with ease in the last 16. Which begs the question: is this the best England team since 1966, when it last won thee World?\n\nUnder Gareth Southgate, England has become a tournament specialist, playing functional football and restricting its abundance of attacking talent in favor of defensive solidity. But against Senegal, fans were treated to a glimpse of what this England attack can do when given the space and opportunity.\n\nWith the addition of Jude Bellingham to the midfield, England is now playing like one of the best teams in the world, adding goals to a staunch defense. The one criticism of arguably England’s best ever manager is that Southgate struggles against superior opponents. There is no greater test of that theory than facing France in the quarterfinals.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nEngland 6-2 Iran\n\nEngland 0-0 United States\n\nWales 0-3 England\n\nRound of 16:\n\nEngland 3-0 Senegal\n\nAccording to Opta, France has a 14.74% chance of winning the World Cup. Ebrahim Noroozi/AP\n\nFrance\n\nAfter a shaky first half against Australia, the French have quickly dispelled any of the pre-tournament concerns that they would follow the previous three World Cup champions and make a group-stage exit.\n\nLes Bleus have looked irresistible at times, and bar their second-string team losing a dead rubber to Tunisia, the team looks every bit as good as the one that dominated Russia in 2018. Olivier Giroud has become France’s all-time top scorer, Aurélien Tchouaméni and Adrien Rabiot have filled the Paul Pogba and N’Golo Kanté shaped hole in midfield, and forward Antione Griezmann looks back to his best.\n\nBut this team is all about one man: Kylian Mbappé. The PSG forward has looked irresistible and the best player at the tournament. Whether he is sitting defenders down, or curling in stunning goals, it looks like no one on the planet has the tools to cope with the mercurial talent.\n\nFrance faces its neighbor from across the Channel next, but for England to pass into the semifinals, it will have to find a way to stop the world’s best player.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nFrance 4-1 Australia\n\nFrance 2-1 Denmark\n\nTunisia 1-0 France\n\nRound of 16:\n\nFrance 3-1 Poland\n\nMorocco vs. Portugal\n\nWhen: Saturday, December 10, 10 a.m. ET\n\nWhere: Al Thumama Stadium\n\nMorocco\n\nThis Morocco team has been a revelation this tournament, defending valiantly and attacking with verve and is more than deserving of its place in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn Achraf Hakimi, who scored an audacious ‘Panenka’ to win the penalty shootout against Spain, Morocco boasts a bonafide superstar and the Paris Saint-Germain fullback’s boundless energy down the right flank is the Atlas Lions’ greatest attacking threat.\n\nChelsea winger Hakim Ziyech provides Morocco’s creative spark, while Fioretina’s Sofyan Amrabat has undoubtedly been one of the best midfielders so far in this World Cup.\n\nHead coach Walid Regragui has instilled incredible belief and organization into his team and Morocco will justifiably feel confident it can beat Portgual and become the first African team in history to reach a World Cup semifinal.\n\nGroup stage:\n\nMorocco 0-0 Croatia\n\nBelgium 0-2 Morocco\n\nCanada 1-2 Morocco\n\nRound of 16:\n\nMorocco 0-0 Spain (Morocco wins 3-0 on penalties)\n\nGonçalo Ramos scored a brilliant hat-trick against Switzerland as he spearheaded a scintillating Portugal performance. Justin Setterfield/Getty Images Europe/Getty Images\n\nPortugal\n\nA loss in its final group game against South Korea raised questions about Portugal’s ability to progress far into this year’s World Cup, but its demolition of Switzerland in the last 16 answered them with aplomb. Fernando Santos’ side looked unstoppable with 21-year-old striker Gonçalo Ramos bursting onto the world stage with a brilliant hat-trick.\n\nThe youngster was replacing Cristiano Ronaldo, who was dropped to the bench for the crunch tie. It’s not yet clear whether the superstar striker will be installed back into the starting lineup for its quarterfinal tie, but Portugal certainly didn’t miss him on Tuesday.\n\nPortugal faces a potentially tricky opposition, which has already beaten Belgium and Spain at Qatar 2022.\n\nGroup Stage:\n\nPortugal 3-2 Ghana\n\nPortugal 2-0 Uruguay\n\nSouth Korea 2-1 Portugal\n\nRound of 16:\n\nPortugal 6-1 Switzerland", "authors": ["Alasdair Howorth"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/09/football/morocco-portugal-france-england-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "World Cup quarterfinals: Morocco on the verge of history against ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMorocco already caused the upset of the round of 16 when it beat Spain on penalties to make it to the quarterfinals for the first time in its history, but the North Africans will have to replicate their heroics if they want to get past a reinvigorated Portugal.\n\nLater in the day, the blockbuster final game of the quarterfinals will pit old foes England and France against each other.\n\nMorocco looks to continue dream run\n\n“Before it was just the Moroccans who supported us, now it is the Africans and Arabs,” Morocco manager Walid Regragui said about his team’s journey.\n\nThe Moroccans have become the darlings of the World Cup. At the first “Arab” World Cup, they became the first Arab nation to qualify for the quarterfinals of the World Cup and, as the first African side to qualify for the quarterfinals in over a decade, they represent so much more than just their own nation.\n\nBorn in Madrid, Achraf Hakimi scored the goal to knock Spain out of the World Cup. Ulrik Pedersen/DeFodi Images/Getty Images\n\nBut this has not been the heroic performance of an underdog riding its luck.\n\nThe Moroccans have the meanest defense at the competition, conceding only a single own goal so far. Despite having the most difficult run to the last eight of any of the quarterfinalists – playing fellow quarterfinalist Croatia, Belgium and 2010 World Cup champion Spain along the way – only Argentina has conceded less shots than the Atlas Lions.\n\nWhen teams do get shots off, they have to contend with Yassine “Bono” Bounou. The Sevilla keeper has not conceded a goal to an opposition player in over 300 minutes of football, including a penalty shootout where he saved two penalties.\n\nAfter three or four key players were injured in its previous match against Spain and a grueling fixture list which included matches against nations ranked second, seventh and 12th in the world, Morocco is down to its bare bones. But that will not dampen the team’s spirit or ambition.\n\nWhen asked about making a run deep into the tournament, head coach Regragui said, “At some point in Africa, we have to be ambitious and why not win the World Cup?”\n\nIn Morocco’s way of more history is a Portuguese side that looked, for the first time under Fernando Santos, to be fully unshackled and playing to its attack potential as it thrashed Switzerland 6-1.\n\nBut in order to realize the team’s potential, Santos made the hardest decision of his career, dropping the nation’s greatest ever player, Cristiano Ronaldo. Despite his glittering career and a title as the greatest goalscorer international football has ever seen (118 goals in 194 caps), there are signs that age is finally catching up with the five-time Ballon d’Or winner.\n\nRonaldo is yet to score a goal in a World Cup knockout game. lorencia Tan Jun/PxImages/Icon Sportswire/Getty Images\n\nIn contrast to the 37-year-old’s place as one of the most famous athletes, his replacement Gonçalo Ramos was making his first ever start for the national team, and he took his chance with aplomb.\n\nThe 21-year-old Benfica striker scored three goals to help Portugal dominate the Swiss. The last player to score a hat-trick on his World Cup full debut was Miroslav Klose, who is now the competition’s all-time record scorer.\n\nBut Ramos is not the only player who has been set free by the absence of Ronaldo. His former Manchester United teammate Bruno Fernandes was at his creative best and Atlético Madrid star João Félix looked like the player who has been long considered the man to take up the torch from Ronaldo.\n\nThe last time the two teams met was in the group stage of the 2018 World Cup in a frenetic game which Ronaldo settled with the only goal of the contest.\n\nNo team has scored more than Portugal’s 12 at the World Cup, but will the unstoppable Portugal be able to beat the immovable Morocco?\n\nEngland looks to upset Mbappé and France\n\nThe biggest match of the round is left for last as world champion France, looking to become the first country in 60 years to retain the World Cup, takes on an England team on the verge of reaching only its third semifinal.\n\nDespite both sides featuring some of the world’s best players, eyes inevitably turn to Kylian Mbappé. The PSG forward has been nothing short of sensational this tournament. He has scored five goals in just three starts so far, already surpassing his total from 2018.\n\nMbappé has already surpassed Cristiano Ronalo's World Cup goal scoring record and is level with Lionel Messi on nine. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nThe biggest question ahead of the game is whether England can shackle the forward.\n\n“England will have prepared for Kylian, but he is in a position to make the difference,” France coach Didier Deschamps said. “We have other players, but Kylian is Kylian and he can make the difference.”\n\nKyle Walker, who will likely be the defender tasked with stopping Mbappé, was confident when asked about it.\n\n“I do understand what I need to do and that is to stop him,” he said. “It’s probably easier said than done, but I don’t underestimate myself.”\n\nBut Mbappé is not the only French threat going forward. On the opposite flank is Ousmane Dembélé who is not the complete product like Mbappé but is no less dangerous with his blistering pace and dribbling. In between the speedsters is Olivier Giroud, who became France’s all-time record goal scorer earlier in the tournament while operating as a foil for the wide men.\n\nBehind the front three is Atlético man Antoine Griezmann, who after a difficult few seasons, looks back to being the player who took both Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup by storm.\n\nDespite the excellent performances of Harry Maguire and John Stones in the heart of the English defense so far, they have not been tested by anything close to this attack at a major tournament.\n\nHarry Kane is England's all-time top scorer at major tournaments with 11 goals. Dan Mullan/Getty Images\n\nHowever, unlike in previous tournaments, England has plenty of tools of its own to hurt a vulnerable French defense.\n\nAlong with Portugal, the Three Lions are the top scorers in Qatar. They won their previous two matches 3-0, and for the first time this century, come into this match with more depth in their team than their opponents who have been hampered by a host of injuries.\n\nLike Giroud, Harry Kane is on the verge of becoming England’s all-time record goal scorer. He is now only one goal behind Wayne Rooney’s record of 53.\n\nBukayo Saka and Marcus Rashford both have three goals a piece despite neither being guaranteed a starting spot and Jordan Henderson has made an unexpected return to the starting lineup with excellent results. The Liverpool captain scored the opener against Senegal and has added much needed balance to the team.\n\nWith two stellar attacks – and two unconvincing defenses – this game has the potential to be the best of the entire tournament.\n\nWhere and when?\n\nMorocco vs Portugal: Saturday, December 10, 10 a.m. ET at the Al Thumama Stadium\n\nEngland vs France: Saturday, December 10, 2 p.m. ET and the Al Bayt Stadium\n\nHow to watch\n\nUS: Fox Sports\n\nUK: BBC or ITV\n\nAustralia: SBS\n\nBrazil: SportTV\n\nGermany: ARD, ZDF, Deutsche Telekom\n\nCanada: Bell Media", "authors": ["Alasdair Howorth"], "publish_date": "2022/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/20/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-of-firsts-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Qatar makes World Cup debut in a controversial tournament of firsts ...", "text": "Doha, Qatar CNN —\n\nThere have been 21 editions of the men’s World Cup since its inauguration in 1930 but Qatar 2022 is set to be a tournament like no other.\n\nSince it was announced as the host city almost 12 years ago, it was always destined to be a World Cup of firsts.\n\nFrom extreme weather to tournament debuts, CNN takes a look at the ways this year’s competition will be breaking new ground.\n\nQatar debut\n\nThis will be the first time the Qatari men’s national team will participate in a World Cup finals, having failed to qualify through usual means in the past.\n\nFIFA, the sport’s governing body, permits a host nation to take part in a World Cup without having to go through the qualifying rounds, which means the small Gulf state can now test itself against the best in world soccer.\n\nQatar is relatively new to the sport, having played its first official match in 1970, but the country has fallen in love with the beautiful game and the national team has steadily improved.\n\nIn 2004, The Aspire Academy was founded in the hope of finding and developing all of Qatar’s most talented sportspeople.\n\nIn recent years, that has reaped rewards for its soccer team. Qatar won the Asia Cup in 2019, capping off one of the most memorable runs in the tournament’s history, conceding only one goal throughout the tournament.\n\nSeventy percent of the squad that won the trophy came through the academy, and that number has only increased heading into the World Cup.\n\nCoached by Spaniard Felix Sanchez, Qatar will be looking to surprise people and faces a relatively kind group, alongside Ecuador, Senegal and The Netherlands.\n\nQatar will look to spring a surprise at Qatar 2022. Joe Klamar/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘Winter’ Cup\n\nThe World Cup has always been held in either May, June or July but Qatar 2022 will break away from such tradition – more out of necessity.\n\nTemperatures in Qatar can reach over 40 degrees Celsius over those months so, with this in mind, the tournament was moved to a cooler time.\n\nHowever, winter in Qatar is a relative term with temperatures still likely to be around 30 degrees, but organizers hope to combat the heat with multiple methods, such as high-tech cooling systems in stadiums.\n\nThe change in tournament dates has played havoc with some of the biggest domestic leagues in the world.\n\nAll of Europe’s top leagues have had to work a winter break into their schedules, meaning congested fixture lists before and after the tournament.\n\nThis will be the first World Cup played in November and December. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nIslamic country\n\nOne of FIFA’s justifications for awarding Qatar the hosting rights was the ability to take the tournament to a new part of the world.\n\nNone of the 21 previous World Cups have been held in an Islamic country and this month’s tournament will be a chance for the region to celebrate its growing love for the game.\n\nHowever, it undoubtedly raises a few problems that organizers have had to tackle. For many fans, drinking alcohol has, and will continue to be, a big part of the experience of such tournaments.\n\nIn Qatar, though, it’s illegal to be seen drunk in public, which has forced organizers to come up with inventive ways to circumnavigate the issue.\n\nAs a result, alcohol will only be served in designated fan parks around Doha and there will be separate areas for fans to sober up before and after matches.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback World's only openly gay active pro footballer is concerned for LGBTQ community ahead of Qatar 2022 04:39 - Source: CNN\n\nSmallest hosts\n\nAnother question mark around the tournament is how the country will be able to deal with the influx of an expected one million visitors, given it’s the smallest country to host the World Cup, with a population of just under three million.\n\nAs a result, all eight stadiums are in and around Doha, the capital city, and are all within an hour’s drive of each other.\n\nOrganizers say the travel infrastructure – including buses, metro and car hires – will be able to cope with the increased pressure.\n\nOne benefit of the small distances between venues is that fans will be able to see up to two games in one day. Should traffic be kind.\n\nDue to its size, Qatar has also had to be smart with its accommodation. Two cruise ships, MSC Poesia and MSC World Europa, are being moored in Doha to provide some support to hotels.\n\nFans will have the chance to stay on cruise ships in Doha, Qatar. Catherine Ivill/Getty Images\n\nBoth vessels will offer the usual cruise ship experience, but fans won’t be sailing any further than the 10-minute shuttle-bus ride into the heart of Doha.\n\nFor those fans prone to a touch of sea sickness, organizers have also built three ‘Fan Villages’ which will offer a place to stay on the outskirts of the city.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback The Qatar World Cup's migrant worker dilemma 04:31 - Source: CNN\n\nThese include a variety of accommodation – including caravans, portacabins and even camping experiences – and all are located within reasonable distances of the venues.\n\nAlso, for those able to afford a little more, there will be luxury yachts docked in Doha’s harbor, which can offer a place to sleep for, let’s face it, an extortionate price.\n\n‘Carbon neutral’ tournament\n\nFIFA has pledged to make Qatar 2022 the first carbon neutral World Cup, as world soccer’s governing body continues its pledge to make the sport more environmentally friendly.\n\nIt, alongside Qatar, pledged to offset carbon emissions by investing in green projects and buying carbon credits – a common practice used by businesses to “cancel out” the impact of a carbon footprint.\n\nQatar, the world’s largest emitter per capita of carbon dioxide, has said it will keep emissions low and remove as much carbon from the atmosphere as the tournament produces by investing in projects that will capture the greenhouse gases.\n\nFor instance, it will be sowing the seeds for the largest turf farm in the world by planting 679,000 shrubs and 16,000 trees.\n\nThe plants will be laid at stadiums and elsewhere around the country and are supposed to absorb thousands of tons of carbon from the atmosphere every year.\n\nHowever, critics have accused organizers of “greenwashing” the event – a term used to call out those who try to cover their damage to the environment and climate with green initiatives that are either false, misleading or overstated.\n\nCarbon Market Watch (CMW), a nonprofit advocacy group specializing in carbon pricing, says Qatar’s calculations are grossly underestimated.\n\nFemale officials\n\nQatar 2022 will also see female referees officiate a men’s World Cup match for the first time.\n\nYamashita Yoshimi, Salima Mukansanga and Stephanie Frappart have all been named among the 36 officials selected for the tournament.\n\nThey will be joined by Neuza Back, Karen Diaz Medina and American Kathryn Nesbitt, who will be traveling to the Gulf nation as assistants.\n\nFrappart is arguably the most famous name on the list after she wrote her name into the history books in 2020 by becoming the first woman to take charge of a men’s Champions League match.\n\nReferee Yoshimi Yamashita will make her debut at the men's World Cup. Masashi Hara/Getty Images\n\nBut looking to learn from her in Qatar is Rwanda’s Mukansanga, who told CNN that she was excited to embrace the challenge of refereeing at a major tournament.\n\n“I would look at what the referees are doing, just to copy the best things they’re doing, so that one day I would be in the World Cup like this,” she said, adding that her family couldn’t wait to see her take to the pitch.\n\nIt’s not yet decided when the women will be refereeing their first match at the tournament, but there will be some new rules to enforce.\n\nFor the first time, teams will be able to use up to five substitutes and managers can now pick from a squad of 26 players, rather than the usual 23.\n\nQatar 2022 is set to start on November 20.

Antonin Thuillier/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThat means the USWNT will earn $6.5 million for the US Men’s National Team’s (USMNT) exploits thus far in Qatar. If the team defeats the Netherlands in the round of 16 and reaches the quarterfinals or beyond, that figure will continue to increase.\n\nIn contrast, the USWNT earned $6 million in total for its successive World Cup wins in 2015 and 2019 – $2 million in 2015 and $4 million in 2019.\n\nThe 2019 Women’s World Cup total prize money was $30 million, doubled from the $15 million in 2015.\n\nThe US jcocer equal pay agreement means the USMNT will pick up half of the USWNT’s prize money in the future.\n\nMeanwhile, at the men’s World Cup this year, the winner of the tournament will get $42 million and the total prize money is $440 million – over 14 times as much as the women’s edition of the tournament.\n\n“FIFA has always treated the women’s World Cup as an afterthought, which is a big reason why equal-pay deals like the one struck between the USMNT and USWNT are so important,” wrote sports reporter Lindsay Gibbs in her newsletter “PowerPlays.”\n\n“They put more pressure on FIFA to invest in the women’s game, because now the lack of resources given to the women directly impact the men, too. Solidarity truly does matter.”\n\nShe added: “It’s beyond time for FIFA to step up and treat women’s soccer like the money-maker we know it can be.

The gunman was found dead after a police shootout.\n\nThere was increased security at Eden Park stadium, where 42,137 — a record crowd for a soccer match in New Zealand — were on hand to cheer on the home team, co-hosts of the tournament with Australia. New Zealand Prime Minister Chris Hipkins was among those at the game. He went into the locker room after the game and thanked the team for an inspirational performance.\n\nAfter an opening ceremony that honored New Zealand's Indigenous heritage, there was a moment of silence for the victims of the shooting. Five people were wounded in the attack, including a police officer.\n\nWORLD CUP CENTRAL: 2023 Women's World Cup Live Scores, Schedules, Standings, Bracket and More\n\nNew Zealand's Football Ferns had played in five previous World Cups, but hadn't won a match.\n\n“We really wanted to inspire young girls across the nation and I think we did that tonight. We showed that anything is possible,\" said captain Ali Riley, who had happy tears in her eyes.\n\nNorway couldn’t finish off its chances in the first half while the Ferns defended well. Ada Hegerberg’s attempt in the 37th minute was deftly defended by Rebekah Stott and the match was scoreless after the first half.\n\nThe first woman to win the prestigious Ballon d’Or award, Hegerberg has 43 goals in 77 international appearances. Currently playing professionally for Lyon, she has scored a record 59 goals in the Champions League. But she couldn't find the back of the net in Auckland.\n\nInstead, Wilkinson scored in the opening moments of the second half. Jaqui Hand moved up the right side and placed a perfect cross at Wilkinson’s feet for the goal. While the home crowd wildly celebrated, Norway goalkeeper Aurora Mikalson stood with her hands on her hips.\n\nNorway won the World Cup in 1995. At the last tournament in 2019, the team fell to England in the quarterfinals. At the Women’s Euro in 2022, England routed the Norwegians 8-0. In the run-up to this game, winger Caroline Graham Hansen called the World Cup a chance to “start fresh.”\n\n“(It’s) the opening game, they are the hosts. We have talked about this. We knew they were going to go out there and be aggressive,\" Norway midfielder Guro Reiten said. \"We knew exactly how they wanted to play but still, we were so poor, especially in that first half. I’m very disappointed.”\n\nTuva Hansen nearly tied it for Norway in the 83rd but her shot caromed off the crossbar. The Ferns had a chance to double their lead in the 89th after video review awarded them a penalty, but Ria Percival’s attempt hit the post.\n\nStoppage time stretched for more than 10 minutes before the whistle blew and New Zealand’s bench rushed the field in celebration. Riley pounded her chest for the electrified fans.\n\n“It's really hard to put into words, but absolutely surreal,” Ferns defender Katie Bowen said of the droughtbreaking victory. “I mean we made history tonight, but we can't rest on that. Our goal is to get out of the group.”\n\nBowen said she was awakened by an early morning call from her brother, checking if she was OK after hearing about the Auckland shooting.\n\n“I think everyone was just pretty taken aback, because this doesn't really happen in New Zealand,” Bowen said. \"But I think, especially on a game day, down to just each individual doing what they needed to do to process it and make sure they could focus on the game at the same time.\"\n\nNew Zealand got the nod to stage the World Cup’s first game, although co-host Australia’s match against Ireland in Sydney started about an hour after fulltime in Auckland.\n\nConsidered the favorites in Group A, the Norwegians went into the game 5-1-1 all-time against New Zealand, with the only loss coming in a 2019 exhibition match.\n\nNorway coach Hege Riise said her players were not impacted by the shooting, despite the incident happened near their hotel.\n\n“We knew it was under control, we felt safe. Some players slept through it,\" Riise said. \"We had an early morning meeting with everyone. It hasn’t had an effect on how we performed in the game.”\n\nNew Zealand had struggled in the run-up to the tournament on home soil, with just one win in its last 11 matches.\n\nThe two teams had met just once before at the World Cup: Norway beat the Ferns 4-0 in 1991.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nGroup A play continues Friday with Switzerland playing the Philippines in Dunedin.

As the team prepares to play England for its opening World Cup match on 21 November, all eyes will be on its players for more than soccer.\n\nThe protests, referred to by experts as the most significant since the establishment of clerical rule following the 1979 Iranian Revolution, were sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died after being detained by Iran’s morality police allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.\n\nIranian demonstrators take to the streets of Tehran during a protest for Mahsa Amini in September, days after she died in police custody. AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhat began as a clamor for women’s rights has morphed into a movement, still driven by women, demanding the end of a regime that “people no longer believe…is reformable,” Abbas Milani, director of Iranian studies at Stanford University, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour earlier this month. “They want a different social contract without the clergy claiming divine right.”\n\nIranian security forces have unleashed a violent response, killing at least 378 people, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights NGO (IHRNGO) group has claimed, while a UN official says as many as 14,000 people have been arrested across the country, including journalists, activists, lawyers and educators.\n\nCNN cannot independently verify these figures as non-state media, the internet, and protest movements in Iran have all been suppressed. Death tolls vary by opposition groups, international rights organizations and journalists tracking the ongoing protests.\n\n‘The number one sport’\n\nFootball is the “number one sport” in Iran, Iranian-born Canadian coach Mossavat says, giving the team a potentially powerful platform from which to voice its support for the protestors.\n\nIn the past, the national team had been seen as more representative of the Iranian people than the regime, Omid Namazi – Iranian national team’s assistant coach from 2011 to 2014 – told CNN Sport.\n\nWhen the FIFA World Cup Twitter account posted images of the Iranian players smiling and goofing around in a pre-tournament photoshoot, it prompted criticism by some on social media.\n\n“I am so disappointed, so heartbroken by these,” Iranian-born football journalist Sina Saemian tweeted. “The lack of common sense, lack of empathy and insensitivity shown in these pictures is genuinely disheartening. The photo op is absolutely FIFA’s requirement, but the poses are not. There is a clear absence of any sense of awareness.”\n\nAlthough its star forward, Azmoun, has shown his support for the protestors, Namazi says that many of the other national team players have remained relatively quiet, “leaving a bad taste.”\n\n“The perception has really changed about the players, the national team itself,” he adds. “People call it the national team of the Islamic Republic and not the national team of the people of Iran.”\n\nIran's Portuguese coach Carlos Queiroz attends a training session at the Al-Rayyan training facility in Doha on November 20, 2022, on the eve of his side's first match. Fadel Senna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAzmoun, who plays for the German team Bayer Leverkusen, posted multiple times to social media, and changed his profile picture to black in support of the protesters, and indicated that it could have cost him a place in the World Cup squad.\n\n“That is worth sacrificing for one strand of Iranian women’s hair,” he wrote in an Instagram story. “Shame on you who kill people so easily. Long live Iranian women.”\n\nAzmoun was ultimately selected to play in Qatar, but Iranwire, an opposition news outlet, reported that Iranian men’s football team manager Carlos Queiroz had come under pressure from Iran’s Sports Ministry to leave him out the squad.\n\nProtesting at the World Cup, on the biggest stage of all for football, carries potentially huge risks for the current players in the national team.\n\n“The players are under a lot of pressure by the government. It affects their livelihood, their future, their earnings,” Namazi says.\n\nNonetheless, players will be free to protest at the World Cup so long as they do not break FIFA rules, their manager Queiroz has said.\n\n“I don’t know if they’ll do anything,” Iranian football fan Payam, who didn’t give his surname for safety reasons, tells CNN Sport.\n\n“We are all hoping they do something…If they don’t, it’s going to be a big egg on their face, to be honest.”\n\nDefender Ehsan Hajsafi became the first member of the national team to speak out at the World Cup in apparent support of anti-government protests at home. “They should know that we are with them. And we support them. And we sympathize with them regarding the conditions,” he told reporters, per Reuters, on Sunday.\n\nSaeed Piramoon imitates cutting his hair during a match. Telegram/Kanali\n\nCNN has reached out for comment to FIFA regarding its stance on potential player protests but, at the time of publication, had not yet received a response.\n\nFormer player Ali Daei, a soccer great in Iran, has publicly supported the protestors, with Daei refusing to attend the World Cup in solidarity with protestors.\n\nMeanwhile, beach soccer player Saeed Piramoon imitated cutting his hair, signaling his support for the protesters, after he scored the winning goal in the final of the Intercontinental Beach Soccer Cup while his team was seen not singing the Iranian national anthem before the match.\n\nIran’s football authorities vowed that “people who have not followed professional and sports ethics … will be dealt with according to the regulations,” a statement published by Iran’s Football Federation after the beach soccer game said.\n\n“I’ve got goosebumps just telling you the courage that it takes,” Mossavat says. “Their entire team was reported to have been taken away from the airport because they didn’t celebrate.”\n\nA video published on BBC Persian allegedly showed journalists blocked from speaking to the national team when they arrived back at the Imam Khomeini Airport in Tehran. CNN could not verify the video.\n\nThe build-up to the World Cup has been dominated by discussions surrounding human rights, from the death of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nIran faces England in its opening World Cup match. In October the Athletic reported that England didn’t have any plans to “publicly demonstrate its solidarity” with the Iranian protestors. Speaking to CNN, an English Football Association spokesperson said: “We are aware of the protests in Iran, and following the situation. It is obviously worrying, but the best people to comment on it are the Iranian people.”\n\nCNN has also reached out to the Welsh FA and US Soccer, teams also in Iran’s group, but, at the time of publication, had yet to receive a response.\n\n‘Maybe we can show people what’s going on’\n\nIn the wake of the protests and the human rights violations happening in Iran, several groups inside and outside the country have called upon FIFA to ban it from the World Cup.\n\nIn October, a group of prominent Iranian athletes lobbied FIFA via a law firm, urging it to suspend the Iranian Football Federation (FFIRI) and ban it from participating at the World Cup.\n\n“Iran’s brutality and belligerence towards its own people has reached a tipping point, demanding an unequivocal and firm disassociation from the footballing and sports world,” a press release issued alongside the letter reads.\n\nThey were joined in this stance by a human rights group, ‘Open Stadiums,’ which describes itself as “a movement of Iranian women seeking to end discrimination” and allow women to attend football stadiums. “The Iranian FA is not only an accomplice of the crimes of the regime, it is a direct threat to the security of female fans in Iran and wherever our national team plays in the world,” the group wrote in an open letter to FIFA in September.\n\nIranian women were allowed to attend a national football championship match for the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution on August 25, 2022. Hossein Zohrevand/Tasnim News/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Ukrainian Football Association also called on FIFA to “consider excluding” Iran’s national team, citing the “systematic human rights violations” there, and “the possible involvement of Iran in the military aggression of Russia against Ukraine.”\n\nCNN has reached out to FIFA and the FFIRI for comment about calls for Iran to be banned from the Cup but, at the time of publication, had not received a response.\n\nFIFA President Gianni Infantino defended Iran’s participation in the 2022 Qatar World Cup in his pre-tournament press conference, saying it is “two football teams” going head-to-head in matches rather than “two regimes” or “two ideologies.”\n\nInfantino reminded journalists of FIFA’s role as an organization, saying “we’re not the United Nations. We’re not the world police. We’re not… I don’t know the blue helmets.”\n\nSaman Ghoddos, Iran’s only player to play in the English Premier League, and who has publicly supported the protests, also believes that Iran should compete at the World Cup.\n\n“I’ve heard about it and from my point of view, I don’t know if it’s the right direction,” he told CNN’s Don Riddell in October. “Because I always think that football should be outside politics and should not be involved in that.\n\n“But I don’t think it’s the right move to kick out Iran from the World Cup, but maybe we can put a light and show people what’s going on.”\n\nFor Mossavat, the World Cup seems to be operating in an alternate reality to the protests unfolding in his home country.\n\n“While this is happening, I cannot see people being overly excited [about the World Cup] when they’re out on the street fighting for freedom,” Mossavat says. “I think it’s going to be difficult to galvanize people.”\n\nSaman Ghoddos plays for Brentford. John Patrick Fletcher/Shutterstock\n\nThe national team, Queiroz said on Twitter, are seeking to bring “joy, happiness and pride” to the fans in Iran.\n\n“For him to have the audacity to come and say: ‘Oh, our job is to entertain people and make people happy.’ What people are you making happy?” Mossavat says.\n\n“Can Mahsa Amini’s parents, or [the parents] of Navid Afkari…be happy, be joyful to watch you play football? That’s impossible.”\n\nAfkari was a famous Iranian wrestler who was executed by the government in Iran in 2020 for a crime human rights activists, his family and friends say he did not commit.\n\nFootball seems of diminished importance in the wake of such grief that Iranians have experienced in the last few months.\n\n“When you know what’s going on, it’s very difficult to prioritize football,” Ghoddos added. “It’s very difficult and football comes in the second hand because it’s lives that are being lost by fighting for freedom.”\n\nWhen Iran’s football team takes to the field at the World Cup, complete with national anthems, flags and as a tangible manifestation of the country itself, more than progress to the knockout stages is at stake, for it will find itself inadvertently entangled in the fight for Iran’s future.", "authors": ["Issy Ronald"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2022/11/21/world-cup-updates-usmnt-returns-england-iran-senegal-miss-sadio-mane/10745119002/", "title": "World Cup recap: USMNT ties vs. Wales on Tim Weah, Gareth Bale ...", "text": "USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe United States fought out a 1-1 draw against Wales in their 2022 World Cup opener on Monday in Qatar, a game that the Americans will think they should have won after leading most of the way.\n\n22-year-old Tim Weah opened the scoring with a 36th-minute goal for the U.S. in a physical match that featured four yellow cards in the first half. Wales forward Gareth Bale scored a penalty kick in the 82nd minute to draw his side level.\n\nElsewhere in the group, England used its young stars to dominate an overmatched Iranian side, staking its claim as the favorites in Group B.

The Americans led for most of the game after Tim Weah’s first-half goal, but Welsh star Gareth Bale converted a late penalty kick to earn his team a point.\n\nThe U.S. bunkered down in the second half and was able to absorb the pressure until Bale stepped to the spot after being fouled by defender Walker Zimmerman.\n\nThe Americans are back in action on Friday against Group B leader England (who routed Iran earlier), tied for second in the group with one point.\n\nWales ties it up on late Gareth Bale penalty\n\nGareth Bale converted a penalty kick after being fouled in by Walker Zimmerman. U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner guessed the correct way, but Wales’ all-time leading scorer found the back of the net with a powerful shot to make it 1-1 in the 82nd minute.\n\nForward Jordan Morris came on a substitute for Tim Weah in the 88th minute.\n\nMatt Turner makes big save, USMNT makes subs\n\nWales started the second half on the front foot and forced American goalkeeper Matt Turner into making his first save of the game in the 64th minute. Turner, who plays for Arsenal, got a hand on Ben Davies' free header to tip it over the crossbar.\n\nAmerican manager Gregg Berhalter started to make substitutions, bringing on Brenden Aaronson for Weston McKennie, who was on a yellow card. In a 74th minute triple-sub, DeAndrew Yedlin, Kellyn Acosta and Haji Wright replaced Dest, Musah and Sargent.\n\nUSMNT leads Wales 1-0 at halftime\n\nWales bunkered down in the first half allowing the U.S. to dominate possession (66%) – and the Americans were unable to find a way through until Tim Weah’s goal in the 36th minute. The U.S. was tidy with the ball, completing 90% of its passes.\n\nThe last player to score against Wales in the World Cup? Brazilian legend Pele in the 1958 quarterfinals.\n\nThe officiating was a talking point in the first 45 with Abdulrahman Al-Jassim giving yellow cards to Sergino Dest (11’) and Weston McKennie (13’) early. U.S. players grew visibly frustrated, believing Wales should have been carded for similar tackles, but Welsh star Gareth Bale did see yellow for taking down Yunus Musah from behind in the 40th minute. Chris Mepham also picked up a card in first-half stoppage time.\n\nTim Weah puts USMNT ahead with 36th-minute goal\n\nThe United States finally found a way through to score the opening goal, with Tim Weah poking home after getting a perfectly weighted pass slipped through the defense by Christian Pulisic.\n\nWeah, 22, is the first American goalscorer at the World Cup since Julian Green in 2014.\n\nUSMNT has early chances vs. Wales; Dest, McKennie see yellow\n\nIn the ninth minute, the U.S. asked serious questions of the Welsh defense with back-to-back opportunities. First, Tim Weah's driven cross was turned towards goal by Wales defender Joe Rodon, requiring a quick save from goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey.\n\nThe U.S. missed out on a another opportunity a few seconds later, with Josh Sargent's header clipping the outside of the post on a cross from left back Antonee Robinson.\n\nSergino Dest (11th minute) and Weston McKennie (13') both received yellow cards from Qatari referee Abdulrahman Al-Jassim.\n\nUSMNT announces starting lineup\n\nA little more than an hour before their match against Wales, the USMNT announced the starting lineup coach Gregg Berhalter will lead on the pitch, and there were a couple of interesting decisions.\n\nThe move to start forward Josh Sargent over Jesús Ferreira is noteworthy, but the bigger surprise is 35-year-old Tim Ream starting at center back. Ream has not played a competitive match for USMNT since Sept. 2021. Prior to the World Cup, he hadn't been called into the team since October last year.\n\nToday’s Starting XI has an average age of 25 years, 102 days. It is the fourth-youngest USMNT lineup at a FIFA World Cup, behind only the three lineups at the 1990 tournament where the XIs averaged just over 24 years old.\n\nAll 11 players will make their FIFA World Cup debut.\n\nAt 19 years, 358 days, Yunus Musah becomes the youngest player to start a World Cup match for the USMNT.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann: 'There's far more respect now' abroad for U.S. players, coaches\n\nGerman soccer legend and former USMNT coach Jürgen Klinsmann fielded questions from reporters at the FIFA media centre in suburban Doha.\n\nAnd the final query of the session took him back to his old job, as he praised both Major League Soccer and the USMNT's talented generation of youngsters for the growing profile of U.S.-reared managers like Jesse Marsch and Gregg Berhalter.\n\n\"Personally, I think it has changed a lot over the last 10, 12 years, how the world looks at American soccer,\" said Klinsmann, who later reeled off the list of U.S. players contributing at high-level European clubs as he tipped the USMNT as a team to be reckoned with.\n\nNetherlands tops Senegal, 2-0\n\nThe Netherlands matched its Group A foe Ecuador with its own 2-0 victory in its 2022 World Cup opener. Withstanding a competitive Senegal side that ended up with 15 shots, the Netherlands was more efficient in its attacks.\n\nWinger Cody Gakpo, 23, opened the scoring off of a perfectly-timed run in the box, heading home a lob off the right foot of midfielder Frenkie de Jong. Then, with stoppage time waning, Dutch midfielder Davy Klaassen put the match away with a goal off a rebound.\n\nThe Netherlands finished with 10 shots, including three on target. It edged Senegal in possession by a margin of 41% to 39%.\n\nThat puts the Netherlands in a tie at the top of the group with Ecuador, who defeated host nation Qatar, 2-0, in the tournament opener Sunday.\n\nTB12 ready for USMNT\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady enjoyed his bye this weekend in the NFL and appears set to root on the USMNT in its World Cup opener against Wales.\n\nRising star Cody Gakpo scores go-ahead goal for Netherlands\n\nCody Gakpo wants to make sure he’s on any list of breakout young stars at this World Cup.\n\nThe PSV attacker scored what turned out to be the game-winner for the Netherlands in their 2-0 victory over Senegal, heading a chipped pass from Frenkie de Jong home in the 84th minute.\n\nIt’s the latest big moment for Gakpo, who drew intense transfer interest this summer from Manchester United, Leeds, and other clubs around Europe only to end up sticking with PSV. The 23-year-old debuted at PSV at 18, but really started to catch the eye in the 2019-2020 season, producing seven goals and seven assists in the Eredivisie.\n\nSince then, Gakpo has scored 36 goals in all competitions, an excellent record for a midfielder/winger with just over 100 appearances for PSV. And now with this World Cup goal, the spotlight — and winter transfer interest — will likely keep growing.\n\n– Jason Anderson, Pro Soccer Wire\n\nUSMNT shows LGBTQ solidarity at training facility, not jersey\n\nThroughout the 2022 World Cup, the USMNT will showcase rainbow team logos at its training facility and media center in Qatar in a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ community but will not feature any such logo on its jerseys.\n\nThe logo features the traditional shield but has seven different colors in vertical stripes that represent the rainbow.\n\nIn a separate movement known as the \"OneLove\" campaign, a collective of captains from several European nations had committed to wearing an armband that features the rainbow colors, to promote diversity and inclusion in soccer.\n\nFIFA, however, threatened to issue yellow cards to players who wear the \"One Love\" armband, which led to the federations of England, Wales, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland to ask their captains not to wear them.\n\nUSMNT names Tyler Adams as World Cup captain\n\nU.S. men's national team coach Gregg Berhalter named midfielder Tyler Adams as his captain throughout the World Cup on Sunday. Adams, 23, is the youngest player to captain the USMNT at a World Cup since 1950. He has worn the armband nine times out of his 32 caps.\n\n“We’re proud to announce Tyler as the captain for the World Cup. We think he has great leadership capabilities,” Berhalter said at a press conference Sunday. “He leads by his actions and his words, so we’re proud to have him as a captain.”\n\n— Seth Vertelney, Pro Soccer Wire\n\nPlaying in their third World Cup, and doing it without star forward Sadio Mané, Senegal has held its own against one of the world's powers. The match has been fairly even, with possession and play alternating between both halves of the pitch. Even though they applied pressure early, the Netherlands have been sloppy at times on the back end with occasionally careless passes.\n\nMeanwhile, winger Ismaïla Sarr has been the most threatening player for Senegal, which fired six shots, with one on goal in the first half. The Netherlands, by comparison, have five shots, with none on target. Holland, however, has a slight edge in possession: 43% to Senegal's 42%.\n\nIn the 40th minute, the Netherlands had its most dangerous attack, when midfielder Steven Berghuis possessed the ball in front of goal and fired a shot with plenty of pace that zipped over the crossbar.\n\nGareth Bale has Wales dreaming big ahead of World Cup opener vs. USMNT\n\nAL-RAYYAN, Qatar — He’s a teenage phenom turned worldwide superstar who’s won five UEFA Champions League titles, about a dozen other team honors and myriad individual awards. Already long since an icon in his homeland, he was one of the highest-paid players in the world for much of his time at Real Madrid. And earlier this year he moved to sunny Southern California just in time to become an MLS Cup-winning hero for LAFC in Hollywood fashion.\n\nYet you could almost feel sorry for Gareth Bale on Sunday as he recounted the angst he and the rest of his nation felt as their Welsh national team missed out on the sport’s biggest party over and over again for his entire lifetime — and three decades before that as well.\n\n“I think France ‘98 was probably my first memory,” the winger told reporters one day before Wales’ Group B clash with the U.S. men’s national team, their first World Cup match since 1958. “I just remember having this pencil case with the logo on it and everything.”\n\nBale’s dazzling skill has been the crown jewel for his talented generation of Welsh players. And after hauling their nation – which largely favored rugby over soccer until they hit the scene – out of the footballing doldrums with a run to the Euro 2016 semifinals in their first major tournament appearance in over half a century, Qatar ‘22 represents a chance to seal their legacy.\n\nWales faces the U.S. Men's National Team at 2 p.m. ET in Ar-Rayyan, Qatar\n\n— Charles Boehm, Pro Soccer Wire\n\nThe starting 11 for Senegal-Netherlands\n\nThe starting lineups are out for the second match of the day, between Senegal and the Netherlands.\n\nEngland reminds Group B rivals they are all playing for second place\n\nEngland made a major statement in its World Cup opener, hammering Iran 6-2 to lay down a marker in Group B.\n\nThe Three Lions were always favored to finish atop a group that also includes the U.S. and Wales, but the emphatic nature of their win on Monday underlined their status as the class of their World Cup group.\n\nIt was England’s young stars who shined the brightest at the Khalifa International Stadium in Doha, with 19-year-old Jude Bellingham opening the scoring with a header before 21-year-old Bukayo Saka scored a brace in his first World Cup game.\n\nAfter reaching the semifinal of the 2018 World Cup and the final of Euro 2020, England entered the 2022 World Cup as one of the favorites and its performance against an overwhelmed Iranian side did nothing to dispel that notion. But the four-goal margin of victory set England on course to finish atop Group B, with goal differential as the first tiebreaker. Next up for the Three Lions is a showdown with the U.S. Men's National Team on Friday.\n\n— Seth Vertelney, Pro Soccer Wire\n\nFinal: England 6, Iran 2\n\nEngland was dominant from start to finish in its first match of the 2022 World Cup.\n\nNext up for England? That'd be the USMNT on Friday at 2 p.m. ET. Iran will look to bounce back against Wales in Friday's early game, a 5 a.m. ET start.\n\nWorld Cup soundtrack singer walks out on interview\n\nOne of the artists behind a theme song of the 2022 World Cup stopped a live TV interview and walked out after he was asked about the issue of Qatar's human rights record.\n\nDuring a broadcast on Israeli public television in Qatar, Colombian singer-songwriter Maluma left the set calling Israel's KAN News chief international correspondent Moav Vardi \"rude.\"\n\nIn the taping, Vardi asked: \"Don't you have a problem with human rights violations in this country?\"\n\n“Yeah but it’s something I can’t resolve. I just came here to enjoy life, enjoy soccer and the party of soccer,” Maluma responded. “It’s not something that I actually have to be involved with. I’m here enjoying my music and the beautiful life, playing soccer too.\"\n\nVardi then pushed Maluma on the matter, asking if he understands why people might have an issue with his response.\n\n“Do I have to answer that question?” Maluma said, looking off screen.\n\nSomeone heard off set is then heard telling him no.\n\n\"You’re rude,” Maluma told the reporter, then stood up and walked off the set. — Natalie Neysa Alund\n\nEngland extends lead to 5-1\n\nEngland made four subs in the 70th minute after a nervy moment when defender Harry Maguire was evaluated for a concussion. Marcus Rashford came on for Saka and immediately scored a goal in the run of play. The Three Lions are dominating the game so far and have not let up their attack. In the World Cup the top two teams advance on first point total with goal differential as a tiebreaker.\n\nIran finds a goal, England leads 4-1\n\nMinutes after Saka scored a second goal to give England its fourth four-goal game in the World Cup (others were 2018 vs Panama, 1954 and 1966 when they won it all), Iran found the back of the net.\n\nIran overloaded the right side of the pitch to open up space for Mehdi Taremi to score.\n\nSenegal vs. Netherlands — 11 a.m.\n\nTime: Monday, Nov. 21 at 11 a.m. ET\n\nStadium: Al Thumama Stadium in Doha, Qatar\n\nHow to watch: FOX and Telemundo or stream on fuboTV and Peacock\n\nThe top two contenders in Group A face each other when Senegal and Netherlands kick off Monday. Senegal will be without the world-class talent of Sadio Mane due to injury, which is a critical blow. Hope now lies with goalkeeper Edouardo Mendy and Kalidou Koulibaly. The Netherlands have a key absence of their own without veteran Georginio Wijnaldum.\n\nHalftime: England 3, Iran 0\n\nWhy 14 minutes of 'stoppage' time in England-Iran match?\n\nIran's starting goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand fell to the ground after a collision with his teammate. The goalkeeper was on the ground for more than 10 minutes and was eventually stretchered off the field in the 19th minute when Hosssein Hosseini was brought in as a substitute. Because it was a head injury, the substitution does not count against the five player subs for Iran.\n\nThe time stopped was tacked onto the end of the first 45 minutes as 14 minutes of stoppage time.\n\nEngland scores twice in five minutes\n\nEngland made it 2-0 after defender Harry Maguire leapt over Iranian defenders to head a ball into danger. Arsenal midfielder Bukayo Saka, 21, stuck the ball just right, up and over Iran's substitute goalkeeper Hossein Hosseini. Then forward Raheem Sterling took advantage of Iran and scored on a counter attack. It was his 20th goal for the England national team.\n\nEngland gets on scoreboard first\n\nEngland midfielder Jude Bellingham, 19, headed in England's first goal of the 2022 World Cup with his first goal for England and a 1-0 lead against Iran. \"Hey Jude\" chants spread throughout the stadium as the youngest player on England's squad celebrated.\n\nUSMNT vs. Wales — 2 p.m.\n\nTime: Monday, Nov. 21 at 2 p.m. ET\n\nStadium: Al Rayyan Stadium Ar-Rayyan, Qatar\n\nHow to watch: FOX and Telemundo or stream on fuboTV and Peacock\n\nAs long as the eight years since their last run at the World Cup may have felt for fans of the U.S. men's national team, the Welsh have been waiting an actual lifetime for this moment. Their last World Cup appearance was in 1958. Since then, their squad has amassed substantial tournament know-how in the last two European Championships.\n\nAnd that's not including the masterclass of Gareth Bale.\n\n“I’ve said all along, you’ve probably heard me say this, that I think they’re underrated,” USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter said of Wales at a press conference Sunday.\n\nThe political situation back home has been a regular line of questioning for Iran ahead of the team’s opening Group B match against England.\n\nLarge swathes of people in the country have risen up to protest for women’s rights following the death of Mahsa Amini while being detained for allegedly breaking rules regarding head coverings.\n\n“We have to accept that the conditions in our country are not right and our people are not happy,” Iran captain Ehsan Hajisafi said. “We are here, but it does not mean that we should not be their voice or we should not respect them.\n\n“Whatever we are is from them. We have to fight. We have to perform the best we can and score goals and to present the bereaved people of Iran with the results.

The goalkeeper stayed on the ground while the defender walked away seemingly unharmed.

But here our mission is to bring smiles to all people for at least for 90 minutes, that’s our mission,” he said.\n\nSo far, the USMNT has drawn both its games – 1-1 against Wales after letting a lead slip late on, and 0-0 against an England team full of superstars.\n\nTimothy Weah has scored the USMNT's only goal of the tournament so far. Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAgainst England, the USMNT’s young “golden generation” faced its biggest test yet and looked to be the more threatening of the two teams for much of the game before holding firm against late pressure from England.\n\nThere were many bright spots for the US in that game.\n\nIt showed tactical flexibility by switching to a 4-4-2 formation, its defense held for the first shutout of a European opponent at the World Cup since 1950, Tyler Adams, Yunus Musah and Weston McKennie outplayed their English counterparts in midfield, while Christian Pulisic was every bit the creative playmaker that his team needs him to be.\n\nAlthough the USMNT is currently ranked four places above Iran in FIFA’s World Rankings, it will be wary of its opponent who kept its own World Cup qualification hopes alive with a dramatic 2-0 win against Wales on Friday.\n\nIran scored both goals deep into injury time after Wales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey had been red-carded – the first a brilliant strike from Rouzbeh Cheshmi in the 98th minute, and the second a chip from Ramin Rezaeian over substitute goalkeeper Danny Ward.\n\nIran celebrates defeating Wales. Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe result puts Iran’s World Cup back on track after it was derailed somewhat by an opening 6-2 defeat against England and showed a truer indication of the talent contained within the team as it seeks to reach the knockout stages of a World Cup for the first time in its history.\n\n“Now, we need to be sure that we are good enough to go to the second round,” Iran coach Carlos Queiroz said after the Wales match, according to Reuters.\n\n“The US is a brilliant team as well, as we saw them against Wales.\n\n“Our preparation starts with a good rest, refresh the minds and put all the complementary and garbage things outside of our minds and focus on our goal because what we want to do is to give this gift to Iranian fans.”\n\nIran is appearing at the tournament under the shadow of domestic turmoil following widespread protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman who died after being detained by Iran’s morality police, allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code. Iranian security forces have since unleashed a violent response to the protests.\n\nDuring the playing of the national anthems before Iran’s opening match against England on Monday, the Iranian players stood silent in what was widely interpreted as a show of solidarity with those protesting back home, while the players sang the national anthem in their second game against Wales, albeit in a subdued way.\n\nA source involved with the security of the games this week made a shocking admission: the families of the Iranian players have been threatened with imprisonment and torture if the players fail to “behave” ahead of the match against the USA on Tuesday.\n\nFollowing their refusal to sing the nation’s national anthem in their opening match against England, the source said that the players were called to a meeting with members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, where they were told that their families would face “violence and and torture” if they did not sing the national anthem or if they joined any political protest against the Tehran regime.\n\nFans have also weighed in on the domestic situation in Iran.

Colorful pills drive new warnings about ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA new wave of concern has spread across the United States over multi-colored “rainbow fentanyl” pills, powders and blocks – that look similar to candy or sidewalk chalk – being sold and used in several states, and potentially posing a threat to young people.\n\nBut parents of young children should not overly panic, and the emergence of this new product is one small part of the larger ongoing opioid crisis.\n\nRainbow fentanyl comes in bright colors and can be used in the form of pills or powder that contain illicit fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, making them extremely addictive and potentially deadly if someone overdoses while trying to achieve a high off of the drugs.\n\nThis multi-colored fentanyl may appeal to young people or fool them into thinking it’s safe, but experts say illicit fentanyl has been hiding in what appears to be other products for a long time, and fentanyl is fentanyl – it’s all dangerous, rainbow or not.\n\n“Colored fentanyl pills have been around for a few years. Typically, they’ve been blue pills labeled ‘M30’ to counterfeit oxycodone, which is a much weaker opioid,” Joseph Palamar, an associate professor in the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone Health, who has studied trends in illicit fentanyl, said in an email to CNN.\n\n“I think the big difference people are concerned about is with regard to accidental ingestion. People are worried that their kids will take one of these pills thinking they’re another drug or even thinking they’re some sort of candy,” Palamar said. “I don’t think the color of the pills greatly increases danger to people who don’t use fentanyl, but there is always a possibility of someone who uses fentanyl leaving their pills around in the reach of children.”\n\nHe added, “We need to keep in mind that these pills cost money so people aren’t going to be throwing them on the ground for kids to find. I don’t think people will be giving these pills out as Halloween candy.”\n\nWhere rainbow fentanyl warning originated\n\nThe US Drug Enforcement Administration released a warning in August advising the public of this “alarming emerging trend” of “colorful fentanyl available across the United States.”\n\nAt the time, the agency said that it and its law enforcement partners seized the brightly colored fentanyl and fentanyl pills across 18 states. Fentanyl remains the deadliest drug threat facing the nation, according to the DEA.\n\nBut the DEA did not specify in its announcement whether rainbow fentanyl had led to overdoses or deaths among young people.\n\n“Rainbow fentanyl – fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes, and sizes – is a deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults,” DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said in the August announcement.\n\nSince then, some colleges and universities are cautioning students about the presence and dangers of rainbow fentanyl, and the California Department of Public Health has alerted K-12 school administrators in the state about rainbow fentanyl being “a new trend.”\n\nAt Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, physicians have been seeing more fentanyl exposures among both young children and adolescents, Dr. Sam Wang, the hospital’s pediatric toxicologist, told CNN on Friday. While he and his colleagues are aware of rainbow fentanyl warnings, he hasn’t heard any patients or parents mention it.\n\nAfter all, the bottom line, he said, is that fentanyl is fentanyl, whether it comes in the form of rainbow-colored pills or simply a white powder.\n\n“It’s just coming out in a different form to potentially be more attractive, more quote unquote ‘fun’ to use because it looks potentially fun to take,” said Wang, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nAnd when young people use illicit drugs, they sometimes don’t know what they really contain, or how dangerous those substances might be.\n\nWhen it comes to rainbow fentanyl, “the fentanyl itself is going to be the same issue as the counterfeit pharmaceutical fentanyl. We don’t know how much is in it – it can vary. We don’t know the type of fentanyl,” Wang said. “And so those concerns transmit, still, over to this product. It’s just now this looks like it has a potential danger for young children and then also, it’s going to be more attractive for people to use and have consequences from that.”\n\nThe rise of fentanyl\n\nThe United States has been facing an opioid overdose epidemic – and waves of opioid overdose deaths – for decades, starting with a rise in prescription opioid overdose deaths in the early 2000s, followed by a rise in heroin overdose deaths beginning in 2010 and, most recently, a rise in synthetic opioid overdose deaths that started in 2013, fueled by potent fentanyl.\n\nPharmaceutical fentanyl is a synthetic opioid intended to help patients, such as those with cancer, manage severe pain. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and typically prescribed in the form of skin patches or lozenges. But most recent cases of fentanyl-related harm, overdose, and death in the United States are linked to illegally made fentanyl, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe latest data suggest that annual drug overdose deaths have jumped 44% from before the Covid-19 pandemic. There were about 76,000 deaths reported in the 12-month period ending March 2020. The CDC’s latest provisional data show that more than 109,000 people in the United States died of a drug overdose in the 12-month period ending March 2022.\n\nSynthetic opioids, including fentanyl, were involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths in the year ending March 2022. Deaths involving synthetic opioids increased by a staggering 80% over the past two years, CDC data shows.\n\nRainbow fentanyl has been receiving attention due to the bright colors of the products, but the illicit fentanyl that the products contain represents a continuation of the ongoing opioid epidemic. The only difference between rainbow fentanyl and the fentanyl products of the past appears to be the coloring.\n\n“The reason it’s colored is just to differentiate products. If we had a regulated market, they would be differentiated in different ways – we do not. It has nothing to do with marketing to kids at all, period, whatsoever,” said Maya Doe Simkins, co-founder of the Opioid Safety and Naloxone Network and co-director of Remedy Alliance, a collection of harm reduction groups that work to make naloxone more accessible.\n\nSimkins likened the different colors of rainbow fentanyl to how people used food coloring in heroin in the past, and she said the colors are sometimes used to differentiate batches.\n\n“It’s just a differentiation between your product, my product or this batch and the next batch,” she said.\n\nIncreasing fentanyl seizures\n\nIllicit fentanyl has long been hiding in drugs, and its presence appears to be on the rise.\n\nA study, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence in May, found that the number of fentanyl-containing powder and pills seized by law enforcement in the United States rose between 2018 and 2021.\n\nThe weight of powder fentanyl seizures increased from 298.2 kilograms in 2018 to 2,416 kilograms in 2021, and the number of pills seized increased from 42,202 in 2018 to 2,089,186 in 2021, according to the study, of which Palamar was the lead author.\n\n“We found that not only has fentanyl seizures been increasing, but the proportion of pills seized to overall fentanyl seizures has been increasing. The proportion of pill seizures increased from 14% in early 2018 to 29% in late 2021,” Palamar wrote in his email to CNN.\n\n“We don’t have information regarding what these seized pills were purported to be, but we think many were disguised as oxycodone or even Xanax,” he wrote. “Seizures of these counterfeit pills have been increasing at a rapid rate, suggesting increasing availability, and availability is going to continue to increase.”\n\nWith this increase, counterfeit pills have been more difficult to identify, but Palamar said that people can use test strips to detect traces of illicit fentanyl if they have concerns.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“People can purchase fentanyl test strips for as little as a dollar. Most of these strips are meant for urine testing but they can detect the presence of fentanyl if used correctly,” Palamar wrote.\n\n“I highly recommend that anyone who plans to use an illegally purchased pill or an illegal powder like cocaine test the drug before using,” he added. “There are also hundreds of newer fentanyl analogs and other opioids that can be very dangerous that test strips can’t detect. I do worry that test strips will give some people a false sense of security, but they’re something.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/29/health/lecanemab-alzheimers-drug-study/index.html", "title": "Alzheimer's disease: Experimental drug Lecanemab appears to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe experimental drug lecanemab shows “potential” as an Alzheimer’s disease treatment, according to new Phase 3 trial results, but the findings raise some safety concerns because of its association with certain serious adverse events.\n\nLecanemab has become one of the first experimental dementia drugs to appear to slow the progression of cognitive decline.\n\nThe long-awaited trial data, published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, comes about two months after drugmakers Biogen and Eisai announced that lecanemab had been found to reduce cognitive and functional decline by 27% in their Phase 3 trial.\n\nA Phase 2 trial did not show a significant difference between lecanemab and a placebo in Alzheimer’s disease patients in 12 months – but the Phase 3 trial data suggests that at 18 months, lecanameb was associated with more clearance of amyloid and less cognitive decline.\n\n“In persons with early Alzheimer’s disease, lecanemab reduced brain amyloid levels and was associated with less decline on clinical measures of cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse events,” the researchers wrote. “Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of lecanemab in early Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nThe Alzheimer’s Association said in a statement Tuesday that it welcomes and is further encouraged by the full Phase 3 data.\n\n“These peer-reviewed, published results show lecanemab will provide patients more time to participate in daily life and live independently. It could mean many months more of recognizing their spouse, children and grandchildren. Treatments that deliver tangible benefits to those living with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s and early Alzheimer’s dementia are as valuable as treatments that extend the lives of those with other terminal diseases,” it says.\n\nClearing the amyloid\n\nThe Phase 3 trial was conducted at 235 sites in North America, Europe and Asia from March 2019 through March 2021. It involved 1,795 adults, ages 50 to 90, with mild cognitive impairment due to early Alzheimer’s disease or mild Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia.\n\nAbout half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive lecanemab, given intravenously every two weeks, and the others received a placebo.\n\nThe researchers found that participants in both groups had a “clinical dementia rating” or CDR-SB score of about 3.2 at the start of the trial. Such a score is consistent with early Alzheimer’s disease, with a higher number associated with more cognitive impairment. By 18 months, the CDR-SB score went up 1.21 points in the lecanemab group, compared with 1.66 in the placebo group.\n\n“Significant differences emerge as early as the six-month timepoint,” Dr. Christopher van Dyck, an author of the study and director of the Yale Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, said Tuesday during a presentation at the Clinical Trials On Alzheimer’s Disease Conference in San Francisco.\n\n“The lecanemab treatment met the primary and secondary endpoints,” he said.\n\nLecanemab, a monoclonal antibody, works by binding to amyloid beta, a hallmark of the degenerative brain disorder. At the start of the study, the participants’ average amyloid level was 77.92 centiloids in the lecanemab group and 75.03 centiloids in the placebo group.\n\nBy 18 months, the average amyloid level dropped 55.48 centiloids in the lecanemab group and went up 3.64 centiloids in the placebo group, the researchers found.\n\nBased on these results, “lecanemab has the potential to make a clinically meaningful difference for people living with the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and their families by slowing cognitive and functional decline,” Dr. Lynn Kramer, chief clinical officer of Alzheimer’s disease and brain health at Eisai, said in a news release.\n\nEvaluating the safety\n\nAbout 6.9% of the trial participants in the lecanemab group discontinued the trial due to adverse events, compared with 2.9% of those in the placebo group. Overall, there were serious adverse events in 14% of the lecanemab group and 11.3% of the placebo group.\n\nThe most common adverse events in the drug group were reactions to the intravenous infusions and abnormalities on their MRIs, such as brain swelling and brain bleeding called amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA.\n\n“Lecanemab was generally well-tolerated. Most adverse events were infusion-related reactions, ARIA-H and ARIA-E and headache,” Dr. Marwan Sabbagh, an author of the study and professor at the Barrow Neurological Institute, said during Tuesday’s conference. He added that such events resolved within months.\n\nARIA brain bleeding was seen among 17.3% of those who received lecanemab and 9% of those in the placebo group; ARIA brain swelling was documented in 12.6% with lecanemab and 1.7% with placebo, according to the trial data.\n\nSome people who get ARIA may not have symptoms, but it can occasionally lead to hospitalization or lasting impairment. And the frequency of ARIA appeared to be higher in people who had a gene called APOE4, which can increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. ARIA “were numerically less common” among APOE4 noncarriers, the researchers wrote.\n\nThe researchers also wrote that about 0.7% of participants in the lecanemab group and 0.8% of those in the placebo group died, corresponding to six deaths documented in the lecanemab group and seven in the placebo group. “No deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to lecanemab or occurred with ARIA,” they wrote.\n\nThe company aims to file for approval of the drug in the United States by the end of March, according to its news release. The US Food and Drug Administration has granted lecanemab “priority review.”\n\nIn July, the FDA accepted Eisai’s Biologics License Application for lecanemab under the accelerated approval pathway, according to the company. The program allows for earlier approval of drugs that treat serious conditions and “fill an unmet medical need” while the drugs are being studied in larger and longer trials.\n\nIf the trials confirm that the drug provides a clinical benefit, the FDA grants traditional approval. But if the confirmatory trial does not show benefit, the FDA has regulatory procedures that could lead to taking the drug off the market.\n\n“The FDA is expected to decide whether to grant accelerated approval to lecanemab by January 6, 2023,” the Alzheimer’s Association statement says. “Should the FDA do so, the current [Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services] policy will prevent thousands and thousands of Medicare beneficiaries with a terminal, progressive disease from accessing this treatment within the limited span of time they will have to access it. If a patient decides with their health care provider that a treatment is right for them, Medicare must stand behind them as it does for beneficiaries with every other disease.”\n\n‘This is just the first chapter’\n\n“If and when this drug is approved by the FDA, it will take clinicians some time to be able to parse out how this drug may or may not be effective in their own individual patients,” especially since carriers of the APOE4 gene could be at higher risk of side effects, said Dr. Richard Isaacson, adjunct associate professor of neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine, who is not involved in studying lecanemab or its development.\n\n“While this study is certainly encouraging, how this translates to clinical practice, real-world clinical practice, remains to be seen,” he said of the Phase 3 trial data.\n\nOverall, “physicians are starving for any possible therapy out there that can help our patients. I have four family members with Alzheimer’s disease. If I have a family member that comes to me and says, ‘Should I be on this drug?’ In the right patient, at the right dose, for the right duration, with adequate and careful monitoring for side effects, yes, I would suggest that this drug is a viable option,” Isaacson said. “I would say even an important option.”\n\nHe added that the experimental drug serves as an example of the important need for personalized medicine in the United States, especially when it comes to Alzheimer’s disease, such as using genetic testing in clinical practice to identify the APOE gene to better individualize the approach to a patient’s care.\n\n“This is just the first chapter in what I hope to become a really long book in disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer’s disease,” he said.\n\nMore than 300 Alzheimer’s treatments are in clinical trials, according to the Alzheimer’s Association.\n\nAlzheimer’s disease was first documented in 1906, when Dr. Alois Alzheimer discovered changes in the brain tissue of a woman who had memory loss, language problems and unpredictable behaviors. The debilitating disease now affects more than 6 million adults in the United States.\n\nThere is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, but there are several prescription drugs available to help manage symptoms. Last year, the FDA approved Aduhelm for early phases of Alzheimer’s disease. Before that, the FDA had not approved a novel therapy for the condition since 2003.\n\nAlthough lecanemab is being tested as an Alzheimer’s drug, it is not a cure, said Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the trial.\n\n“Both groups in the trial had worsening symptoms, but people taking the drug did not decline as much in their cognitive skills,” Spires-Jones said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre. “Longer trials will be needed to be sure that the benefits of this treatment outweigh the risks.”\n\nIn general, Alzheimer’s continues to be a “complex” disease, Bart De Strooper, director of the UK Dementia Research Institute, said in a statement distributed by the Science Media Centre.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We still have a lot to learn about the underlying causes. It is therefore imperative that we continue to invest in discovery research, and through doing so, we may also identify new targets for which we can develop therapies we could use in combination with anti-amyloid drugs like lecanemab,” said De Strooper, who is a consultant for a series of pharmaceutical companies, including Eisai, but has not consulted on lecanemab.\n\n“This trial proves that Alzheimer’s disease can be treated,” he said. “I hope we will start to see a reversal in the chronic underfunding of dementia research. I look forward to a future where we treat this and other neurodegenerative diseases with a battery of medications adapted to the individual needs of our patients.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/health/new-uti-antibiotic-gepotidacin/index.html", "title": "Gepotidacin: New antibiotic appears to be effective against UTIs ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe first new type of antibiotic developed in more than 20 years to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) appears to be so effective that the pharmaceutical company stopped testing and will soon submit its data to the US Food and Drug Administration for approval.\n\nDrug company GSK said Thursday the new antibiotic, called gepotidacin, works at least as well as nitrofurantoin, a current front-line medication used to treat UTIs.\n\nThe company said it would follow a recommendation from its independent data monitoring committee to stop the study early because the drug had already proven to be effective.\n\nGSK said it would prepare its findings for publication in a medical journal and submit its data to the FDA for approval next year. That’s about a year ahead of the study’s anticipated completion date on the website clinicaltrials.gov.\n\n“Stopping studies in such circumstances is a pretty rare occurrence in the industry. So it’s something I’m absolutely delighted about, both from public health and from a company perspective,” said GSK Chief Scientific Officer Tony Wood, on a call with reporters, Thursday.\n\nGepotidacin works by blocking enzymes that bacteria need to unzip their DNA – their operating instructions – so they can multiply in the body.\n\nIt was developed in partnership with the US government, as one of 19 projects currently funded by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, to combat antimicrobial resistance. Government investment was needed because new drugs are expensive to develop, and antibiotics tend not to turn large profits.\n\nNew antibiotics are desperately needed because over time, many kinds of bacteria have become resistant to the agents used to treat them. A 2021 report from the World Health Organization warned there are not enough new antibiotics in development to overcome the looming threat of antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistant infections kill more than a million people globally each year.\n\n“It’s definitely a big deal,” said Dr. Cindy Liu, chief medical officer at the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center at George Washington University.\n\n“The antibiotic pipeline is what we would call pretty leaky, because, you know, you end up with antibiotics dropping out,” Liu said, meaning many of the drugs don’t make it from the first to second phase of human trials. Another round will drop out between the second and third phase, typically because companies run out of funds to develop them. ” And so this is something that we’ve been dealing with, at the same time when there are increasing numbers of infections that are harder and harder to treat with the drugs that we do have.”\n\nLiu said getting marketing approval for gepotidacin was just the first hurdle. She said she’s seen drugs win approval, only to be abandoned by their manufacturers when they don’t turn a profit.\n\nAntibiotics don’t generate large profits for pharmaceutical companies because patients only take them for a short time. They aren’t maintenance medications like drugs for cholesterol or depression. Eventually, if they are used enough, the bacteria they were developed to kill will develop resistance to them, and the drugs will stop working. So they have a limited lifespan.\n\n“I think it will be really interesting and important to the field to see both how the drug companies sort of market this product and sort of how it does,” Liu said.\n\nUrinary tract infections can happen to both men and women of any age, but are more common in women and girls, who have shorter urethras that are closer to the rectum, making it easier for bacteria to infect the urinary tract.\n\nUTIs are one of the most common infections. Studies show they afflict 1 in 8 women each year and 1 in 5 women over age 65. Somewhere between 30% to 44% of UTIs are recurrent, meaning they come back after treatment. Most are caused by E. coli bacteria, which are becoming more resistant to the drugs used to treat them.\n\nSymptoms of UTIs include frequent urination that is painful or burns, bloody urine, low stomach cramps and the need to urinate even after having just gone.\n\nIn clinical trials of 3,000 women, GSK said gepotidacin met its goals of both resolving the symptoms of a UTI as well as clearing the bacteria causing it. The study compared gepotidacin to nitrofurantoin, which is currently recommended as a first-line therapy.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nGepotidacin is taken as a pill.

At the very least, appetite for the drug has remained steady, with the country still Europe’s biggest cocaine market. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in 2022 compared to 2020 there was no change in the number of people using powder cocaine aged 16 to 59 years (2%) and 16 to 24 years (4%).\n\nGlobally, it appears that the pandemic impacted the use of the drug. Lockdown disrupted global trade due to limited international travel, and demand also decreased – Class-A drugs are mostly taken in social situations. According to the ONS, 40% of respondents reported using ecstasy and cocaine less often than before the coronavirus pandemic. At least 80% reported the reason for doing so was that they have fewer occasions where they would use these drugs.\n\nBut according to a UN report from this year, any slump generated by the pandemic has had little impact on longer-term trends, and the global supply of cocaine is now back at record levels.\n\nWho is using the drug?\n\nThe drug has “never been more accessible” and there is less of a stereotype associated with it, according to one charity, Rehabs UK. Whereas other drugs might be viewed as frowned upon, cocaine is “often viewed by a surprising number of people as ‘not even a drug’”, according to the charity.\n\nThe drug is increasingly being used by a wide section of society, agreed Vice News, and is seen as a “lifestyle choice”, unlike other drugs such as heroin.", "authors": ["Felicity Capon"], "publish_date": "2023/07/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/energy/energy-prices-uk-europe-explainer/index.html", "title": "Why UK energy prices are rising much faster than in Europe | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nMillions of people in the United Kingdom are steeling themselves for colossal rises to their energy bills over the next few months, a coda to a year already marked by record price increases.\n\nThe crisis is not unique to the country. Prices have shot up across Europe since last fall, driven by a spike in demand as countries lifted pandemic lockdowns. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, and the subsequent drop in Moscow’s oil and natural gas exports to Europe, have pushed prices even higher.\n\nBut UK energy prices are now higher than in comparable economies like France and Italy, analysts told CNN Business. And Brits have suffered much bigger price increases than in most European countries, including Germany, where decades of energy policy has been turned on its head by the Ukraine war.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said this week that UK natural gas prices rose nearly 96% in the year to July, while electricity prices are up 54%.\n\nAnnual consumer price inflation for gas and electricity in the United Kingdom is forecast to soar to an average of around 80% this year, compared to an average of 40% across the 19 countries that use the euro, analysis from Deutsche Bank shows.\n\nThe worst is yet to come. Average annual energy bills could exceed £4,000 ($4,820) from January, and £5,000 ($6,000) later in the spring, up from about £2,000 ($2,400) currently. Millions could be forced into poverty as a consequence. Leaders of the UK National Health Service warned Friday of a “humanitarian crisis.” Many people could fall sick this winter as they “face the awful choice between skipping meals to heat their homes and having to live in in cold, damp and very unpleasant conditions,” they said.\n\nOverall UK inflation exceeded 10% in July, compared with 8.9% in the eurozone. Unlike other problems in the UK economy, Brexit doesn’t appear to be a major factor. So why are British energy bills rising so much faster than across much of Europe?\n\nA broken market\n\nAs wholesale costs ballooned last year, 31 smaller UK energy companies — who traditionally offered competitive prices — went bust, forcing millions of customers onto the books of bigger suppliers, and to pay higher bills.\n\nThe way the British government designed the energy market made this more likely, Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group, told CNN Business. Smaller companies were acting like brokers rather than providers of an essential utility.\n\n“Many UK retail energy providers weren’t real energy producers. Instead, they bought electricity and gas in the wholesale market and then sold it on to retail customers like households,” Gloystein said.\n\nThat meant that as soon as wholesale costs increased far above what suppliers could legally charge, they went bankrupt.\n\nEurope operates in a different way. Most countries have tighter regulations on suppliers, Gloystein said, including rules designed to shield them from sudden price spikes.\n\nThe prices UK households pay are subject to a cap, but it is adjusted every six months — a period about to be cut to three — meaning bills rise more quickly in line with wholesale costs.\n\n“There’s a transitional arrangement between now and when we move to that full quarterly model that’s pushing up prices a little bit more,” Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, told CNN Business. “Suppliers are able to pass on the increases in wholesale gas prices a lot more quickly than they were in the past,” he added.\n\nLack of storage\n\nThe United Kingdom has faced a “perfect storm” of events which have bumped up energy bills, according to Raja.\n\nMost homes are supplied with natural gas, he said, whereas electricity, nuclear energy and renewable sources make up a bigger share of the energy mix across the European Union.\n\nThe country also relies on gas to generate 40% of its electricity, compared to less than one fifth for the bloc as a whole, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\n“It’s a double whammy effect and the UK’s overdependence on gas is a big reason why gas prices I think in the UK are a little bit more elevated than elsewhere,” he said.\n\nHigh voltage power lines and cooling towers at the Dampierre-en-Burly nuclear power plant, operated by Electricite de France SA (EDF), in Dampierre-en-Burly, France, on Tuesday, May 3, 2022.

Centrica (CPYYF), a UK energy company, closed the largest gas storage facility in the country in 2017, though it is in discussions with the government to reopen the site this winter. Europe has more storage capacity, and has been rapidly filling it ahead of winter — and a feared total cut off of Russian gas.\n\nUK natural gas contracts for next year’s first quarter are nearly 7% more expensive than European benchmark contract prices, according to analysis by Auxilione. That’s because Europe has now built a buffer for the winter months.\n\nThe lack of storage forces the the United Kingdom to rely on “real-time flows” of gas from the North Sea, Norway, Belgium, as well as liquefied natural gas imports, Tony Jordan, director at Auxilione, told CNN Business.\n\n“We’re much more reliant on the here and now when it gets to winter,” he said.\n\nEurope’s gas is still eye-wateringly expensive. It was trading at €242 ($244) per megawatt hour on Friday, an all-time high, according to Auxilione. That’s much higher than the spot price for UK gas, which is trading at an equivalent of €160 ($161) per megawatt hour, but the differential is driven mostly by greater demand in Europe as it fills up its tanks for winter.\n\nGermany declared a gas crisis in June after Russia cut flows through the vital Nord Stream 1 pipeline by two-thirds, bringing the country one step closer to rationing gas to industry.\n\nMinimal government support\n\nFaced with soaring bills, governments across Europe have stepped in to help ease the financial pressure on households.\n\nBut the “elephant in the room,” said Raja, is that none of the support offered by the UK government so far has directly subsidized consumer energy prices. Earlier this year, the government announced a £150 rebate on a local tax for millions of households to help ease the pain.\n\nMore help is coming soon, but it won’t be anywhere near enough, according to anti-poverty campaigners.\n\nAn electricity transmission tower near residential houses in Upminster, UK, on Monday, July 4, 2022. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIn May, the government announced a £15 billion ($18 billion) package of support, including a £400 ($482) credit to 29 million households from October, which will be spread over six months.\n\nBy comparison, France has capped electricity price increases to 4% until the end of the year.\n\nOther countries “have had more direct intervention when it comes to energy prices, so comparatively UK gas and electricity prices are running a little bit higher,” Raja added.\n\nOn Thursday, Germany announced plans to slash a sales tax on gas to 7% from 19% until March 2024, which is designed to more than offset new levies introduced to pay for gas storage. The government has asked companies to pass the reduction onto their customers, according to a report by German broadcaster ZDF.\n\nLiz Truss, the favorite to succeed Boris Johnson as the UK’s next prime minister next month, has not said how she would provide further help to households beyond cutting taxes.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party is calling for a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to be extended to help fund a freeze on energy bills this winter.\n\n— Mark Thompson contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/20/health/variants-covid-winter-surge/index.html", "title": "Quick and stealthy new Covid-19 variants are poised to drive a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA flurry of new Covid-19 variants appears to be gaining traction globally, raising fears of a winter surge.\n\nIn the United States, these are BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BF.7, BA.4.6, BA.2.75 and BA.2.75.2. In other countries, the recombinant variant XBB has been rising quickly and appears to be fueling a new wave of cases in Singapore. Cases are also rising in Europe and the UK, where these variants have taken hold.\n\nDr. Peter Hotez, who co-directs the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital, says he thinks of them collectively as the Scrabble variants because they use letters that get high scores in the board game like Q, X and B.\n\nAs the US moves into the fall, Covid-19 cases are dropping. Normally, that would be a reason for hope that the nation could escape the surges of the past two pandemic winters. But virus experts fear that the downward trend may soon reverse itself, thanks to this gaggle of new variants.\n\nLumped together, the variants accounted for almost 1 in 3 new Covid-19 infections nationwide last week, according to the latest estimates from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe updated bivalent booster vaccines and antiviral drugs like Paxlovid are expected to continue to be protective against severe outcomes from Covid-19 infections caused by the new variants.\n\nBut the new variants are particularly devastating for millions of Americans who have weakened immune systems. New research suggests that changes in these variants make them impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to help treat and prevent severe cases of Covid-19, and the US government has run out of money to incentivize the creation of new ones.\n\nA crowded field of rising variants\n\nIt’s not clear whether this gang of new variants will continue to run around together, each sharing a piece of the Covid-19 infection pie, or whether one will rise to outcompete the others, as has happened in previous surges.\n\nThough they each descend from slightly different branches of the Omicron family tree, these new offshoots have evolved to share many of the same mutations, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution.\n\nSome experts think this convergence means we’ve entered a new phase of the evolution of the virus, one that will see circulation of several variants at the same time.\n\n“What is likely to happen is that we have several co-circulating, semi-dominate lineages going into the winter season,” said Nathan Grubaugh, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\n“That’s because with convergent evolution, perhaps several different lineages can independently obtain similar transmissibility levels versus a single new variant taking over.\n\n“This is what predominantly happens for most pathogens, such as the flu and RSV,” Grubaugh wrote in an email. “Now that the virus has adapted pretty well to human transmission, most of what is circulating has high fitness.”\n\nMaria Van Kerkhove, the Covid-19 response technical lead for the World Health Organization, said Wednesday that the large mix of new variants was becoming more difficult for WHO to assess because countries were dialing back on their surveillance.\n\n“So we need to be prepared for this. Countries need to be in a position to conduct surveillance, to deal with increases in cases and perhaps deal with increases and hospitalizations. We don’t see a change in severity yet. And our vaccines remain effective, but we have to remain vigilant,” she said.\n\nInaction gives the virus an edge\n\nFor now, the Omicron subvariant BA.5 still holds the top spot in the US. According to CDC estimates, it caused about 68% of new infections in the US last week, but it is quickly being outcompeted by several new sublineages – notably BQ.1 and BQ.1.1.\n\nThe BQs each caused just 6% of new infections in the US last week, but in recent weeks, the share of new Covid-19 infections caused by these viruses has doubled every six to seven days – a rapid rate of growth against BA.5, which is already a highly fit virus, says Dr. Anthony Fauci, who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nAnd these are just two of the new crop of Omicron descendants making a move.\n\n“The projections vary a little, but generally, most people feel somewhere in the middle of November that they’ll wind up being a substantial proportion and have bumped BA.5 off as the dominant variant,” Fauci told CNN.\n\nThese variants are different from BA.4 and BA.5, but they’re descended from those viruses, the result of genetic drift. So they share many parts of their genomes with that virus.\n\nTheir changes aren’t on the scale of what happened when the original Omicron arrived on the scene in November 2021. That strain of the virus, which is now long gone, came out of genetic left field, leaving researchers and public health officials scrambling to catch up.\n\nFauci says that this time, we are as ready as we could be for the latest batch of variants.\n\n“It isn’t that different from BA.5 that it would completely escape the protection that you would get from vaccine” – if people would just get the shot, Fauci said.\n\nThe bivalent booster vaccine, authorized in September, protects against the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\n“We have a BA.5 bivalent updated vaccine as a booster that we’re pushing people to do. It’s matched against the still-dominant variant, which is BA.5, and almost certainly will have a reasonably good degree of cross-protection against the BQ.1.1 and the others, and yet the uptake of these vaccines, as we are already in the middle of October, is disappointing,” he said.\n\nAccording to the latest data from the CDC, 14.8 million people have gotten an updated bivalent booster six weeks into the campaign promoting it. That’s less than 10% of the population that’s eligible to get one.\n\nThe poor uptake of the new boosters, combined with the immune evasiveness of the new variants and the waning of population immunity, is almost surely a recipe for rising cases and hospitalizations in the weeks ahead.\n\n“It’s probably going to be significantly bigger than the BA.5 wave, at least that’s what I expect,” said Mark Zeller, a project scientist who monitors variants at the Scripps Research Institute. But Zeller says he doesn’t expect this winter’s surge to reach heights of January’s Omicron wave.\n\nHotez says people shouldn’t panic about this news but should pay attention.\n\n“We’re underperforming as a nation with people getting their bivalent boosters,” Hotez said.\n\nThe genetic changes these variants share appear to help them escape the immunity created by vaccines and past infections – a recipe for reinfections and breakthrough infections, particularly for people who haven’t had an updated booster.\n\nCritical therapies could soon stop working\n\nCrucially, some of the variants also appear to be impervious to the last lab-created antibodies available to ward off severe Covid-19 infections: an antibody treatment called bebtelovimab, which is made by Eli Lilly, and the combination of two long-acting antibodies in Evusheld, a shot made by AstraZeneca that helps keep people who are immunocompromised from getting sick in the first place.\n\nIf these antibodies stop working against the virus, the United States will still have Covid-19 antiviral drugs like Paxlovid, molnupiravir and remedsivir to help those at risk of severe complications.\n\nBut antibody therapies are particularly important for people with immune function that has been blunted by drugs, disease or age. These are the same people whose bodies don’t respond robustly to vaccines.\n\nThe antibodies are also needed to help people who can’t take antiviral therapies because of possible reactions with other medications.\n\nWhite House Covid-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha says the federal government has been spurring the development of new monoclonal antibodies during the pandemic by promising to purchase new therapies after they’re made.\n\nThe government can’t do that anymore, he said, because Congress has declined to pass additional funding for the Covid-19 response.\n\nAs a result, development of new antibodies – and other new therapeutics – is lagging.\n\n“So even if we got money today, it would take us many months to bring a monoclonal into the marketplace, and we don’t have the money today anyway,” Jha told CNN.\n\nJha said that means the nation is facing fall and winter with a smaller arsenal against the virus, just when it needs to expand its options.\n\n“There is not a monoclonal sitting ready to go tomorrow that we could just buy off the shelf,” he said.\n\nAntibodies are a losing proposition for companies because it takes millions of dollars of investment to make them and because the virus is evolving so fast, they might be effective for only a few months.\n\n“That is a terrible business model,” Jha said.\n\nThe administration has been thinking about ways to commercialize some parts of the Covid-19 response – to get out of the business of buying vaccines and therapies – ultimately passing the costs on to consumers and insurers. But Jha says the process has to be guided by “the needs on the ground and the realities of the virus.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHe says current realities require that the government continue to incentivize the production of new therapies, and he expects that the Biden administration will again try to ask Congress to pass more funding to do that.\n\n“And the truth is that if we want monoclonals to protect high-risk people – which we do – then at this point, given the speed of viral evolution, the US government has to be a major player in that role,” Jha said. “The market cannot take care of it by itself.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/02/middleeast/saudi-drug-capital-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Saudi Arabia is becoming the drug capital of the Middle East | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nLondon and Abu Dhabi CNN —\n\nA grisly drug-induced homicide captivated the media in Saudi Arabia this April, when a man in the country’s Eastern Province set his family house on fire before iftar, the meal that ends the Ramadan fast. Four members of his family were killed.\n\nPolice said he was under the influence of shabu, a methamphetamine, according to local papers.\n\nSaudi media has been sounding the alarm lately over the rise in drug use, with one columnist describing shipments of narcotics to the kingdom as an “open war against us, more dangerous than any other war.”\n\nOn Wednesday, Saudi authorities announced the largest seizure of illicit drugs in the country’s history after nearly 47 million amphetamine pills were hidden in a flour shipment and seized at a warehouse in the capital Riyadh.\n\nThe record seizure demonstrates what experts say is Saudi Arabia’s growing role as the drug capital of the Middle East, driving demand and becoming the primary destination for smugglers from Syria and Lebanon.\n\nThe kingdom, they say, is one of the largest and most lucrative regional destinations for drugs, and that status is only intensifying.\n\nWednesday’s operation was the biggest single smuggling attempt in terms of narcotics seized, according to the General Directorate of Narcotics Control. While authorities didn’t name the drug seized or where it came from, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has previously said that “reports of amphetamine seizures from countries in the Middle East continue to refer predominantly to tablets bearing the Captagon logo.”\n\nCaptagon was originally the brand name for a medicinal product containing the synthetic stimulant fenethylline. Though it is no longer produced legally, counterfeit drugs carrying the captagon name are regularly seized in the Middle East, according to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.\n\nDrug busts of captagon in Saudi Arabia and around the region have grown over time. Earlier this week, A US Coast Guard boat seized 320 kilograms of amphetamine tablets and almost 3,000 kilograms of hashish worth millions of dollars from a fishing boat in the Gulf of Oman.\n\nThe drug was popularized in the kingdom some 15 years ago but has taken off more intensely in the past five years, “perhaps becoming on par with cannabis,” according to Vanda Felbab-Brown, a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, who has written on the topic.\n\nOne of the reasons captagon is spreading in use is “because there is a supply flood now coming mostly from Syria” where it is produced “on an industrial scale in the chemical factories inherited from the [Assad] regime” and supplied by warlords and affiliates of the regime.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Center for International Communication didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nCaptagon can be sold for between $10 and $25 a pill, meaning the latest Saudi haul, if it was the same drug, has a street value of up to $1.1 billion, based on figures from the International Addiction Review journal.\n\n“Captagon’s amphetamine-type properties are sought out as a coping mechanism that can aid users facing food insecurity in staving hunger, and inducing a euphoric ‘rush’ that users have said to help with traumatic stress,” said Caroline Rose, a senior analyst at the New Lines Institute in Washington, D.C. who has studied the captagon trade. “It’s also been said that these same traits for captagon have been sought out by foreign workers in wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, seen to aid work performance.”\n\nWhile hashish and khat are also common drugs in the kingdom, amphetamines are popular among Saudi youth. A 2021 study in the journal of Crime, Law and Social Change cited a user as saying, “captagon is small. My school mates and I like it more than hashish. Not like hashish, we can buy in tablet……Once we get 25 riyals from [our] parents, we can buy one tablet and enjoy it.”\n\n“In wealthier consumer markets, the drug has a different appeal, serving as a recreational activity amongst its growing youth population that, despite social reforms… have reportedly struggled with boredom amidst widespread youth unemployment and a lack of opportunities for leisurely activities,” said Rose. “Some consumers have justified captagon as less of a taboo substance, compared to ‘harder’ drugs like opiates and cocaine.”\n\nSince many young people in Saudi Arabia have been taking drugs as a result of boredom and lack of social opportunities, the increased freedoms introduced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman could help reduce some of that use, said Felbab-Brown.\n\n“The important thing is neither to curtail the freedoms, nor to turn concerts into places of dragnets and raids, but rather to educate young people,” she told CNN.\n\nOver the past few years, a number of drug rehabilitation centers have popped up across the kingdom after the government began licensing private establishments.\n\nKhalid Al Mashari, the CEO of Qaweem, one of the first such centers to open, says around four or five have opened in the past two years. That’s a testament to the government’s recognition of the importance of rehabilitation, he says, but it also shows that the problem is on the rise.\n\n“We’re in high demand, unfortunately,” he told CNN. “But at least people have an option now, instead of having to go to neighboring countries to seek treatment.”\n\nDespite the presence of rehabilitation centers, Rose says there is little public health messaging or campaigning to raise awareness about captagon.\n\n“While this taboo regarding drug consumption in the kingdom is not going anywhere, the government’s tendency to exclusively securitize this issue and downplay its role as a destination market will be harder to ignore,” she said.\n\nFelbab-Brown says drug policies in the Middle East have focused on the harshest of responses.\n\n“Unlike large parts of the world [that] have walked away from such rigid and mostly ineffective or outright counterproductive policies, the Middle East has often doubled down on them,” she said. “Imprisoning users is ineffective and counterproductive.”\n\nThe digest\n\nUS says Iran reply on EU proposal for revival of nuclear deal is “not constructive”\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the US has received Iran’s reply to the US’ response an EU proposal for the revival of the nuclear deal on Thursday. “We are studying it and will respond through the EU, but unfortunately it is not constructive,” said the spokesperson. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani earlier said Tehran’s response was sent after “carefully” examining it and “with the aim of finalizing the negotiations,” according to a statement.\n\nBackground: Earlier this week during a press conference in Russia, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said Iran needs guarantees that the US will not withdraw from the nuclear accord and reapply sanctions as happened under the Trump administration.\n\nWhy it matters: The US and Iran have been trading responses to a “final” EU text aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has said he hopes the talks can be concluded in a matter of days. French President Macron also said on Thursday he hopes to conclude the talks in the next few days. It’s unclear how the talks will move forward from here as Iran continues to increase its uranium enrichment and break commitments under the nuclear deal.\n\nFour killed during Shiite clashes in Iraq’s Basra\n\nClashes between rival Shiite groups killed four people in Iraq’s Basra on Thursday, as the fallout from the country’s worst political violence in years continues, Reuters reported. Basra is the main oil-producing city in Iraq and now violence has spread from Baghdad to the south.\n\nBackground: The violence began earlier this week in Baghdad when powerful Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr announced his resignation from political life. That move set off an intense round of political infighting between Iran-backed Shiite groups and al-Sadr’s supporters. Both sides have been trying to exert control since parliamentary elections in October 2021 saw Iran-backed blocs lose seats to Sadrists . Despite his win, al-Sadr failed to form a government amid opposition from his rivals.\n\nWhy it matters: The episode served as a reminder of the fragility of the government in Baghdad, which remained largely neutral in the crisis, as well as the competing players at home and abroad that seek to control the country’s politics.\n\nTurkish pop star could face up to 3 years in prison for joking about religious schools\n\nSinger Gulsen Bayraktar Colakoglu, known as Gulsen, could face a prison sentence of up to three years over comments made during a concert in April, according to a 48-page indictment. The Istanbul chief prosecutors office brought charges of “inciting the public to hatred and enmity,” the indictment said.\n\nBackground: Last week, Gulsen was jailed pending trial after a video circulating on social media showed her making a comment about religious schools in Turkey, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. During a concert in April, Gulsen said, “[He] graduated from Imam Hatip [religious schools.] That’s where his pervert side comes from,” referring to a person on stage. The singer denied the charge, saying it was a joke, and apologized to those offended by her remarks. She has since been released from custody but placed under house arrest. An Istanbul criminal court will assess the indictment and decide to accept or refuse it. If accepted, the hearings will start and Gulsen will be brought before court.\n\nWhy it matters: Gulsen has previously been targeted by Turkish conservative groups for her revealing stage outfits and support for the LGBTQ community. Her recent arrest sparked outrage and support from fans on social media. Some critics say it’s part of a move by Turkish officials to gain support from their religious and conservative base ahead of elections next year.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Adam Pourahmadi Abbas Al Lawati", "Adam Pourahmadi", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/health/marijuana-potency-addiction-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "Highly potent weed creating marijuana addicts worldwide, study ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHigher concentrations of tetrahydrocannabinol or THC – the part of the marijuana plant that makes you high – are causing more people to become addicted in many parts of the world, a new review of studies found.\n\nCompared with people who use lower-potency products (typically 5 to 10 milligrams per gram of THC), those who use higher-potency cannabis are more likely to experience addiction and mental health outcomes, according to the study published Monday in the journal Lancet Psychiatry.\n\nScientists have established a “standard THC unit” of 5 milligrams of THC for research. That amount is said to produce a mild intoxication for nonregular users.\n\n“One of the highest quality studies included in our publication found that use of high potency cannabis, compared to low potency cannabis, was linked to a four-fold increased risk of addiction,” said study coauthor Tom Freeman, a senior lecturer in the department of psychology and director of the addiction and mental health group at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom, in an email.\n\nIn the United States, about 3 in 10 people who use marijuana have cannabis use disorder, the medical term for marijuana addiction, according to the US Centers for Disease and Prevention.\n\nThe European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction found a 76% rise in people entering treatment for cannabis addiction over the past decade, “while cannabis potency continued to rise during the same time,” Freeman said.\n\nIn addition, “a report by the United Nations found that in the past two decades, the proportion of people seeking treatment for cannabis addiction has risen in all world regions apart from Africa,” he said.\n\nA yearly rise in potency\n\nIn a gram of herbal cannabis, the dried and harvested tops of female marijuana plants that are typically smoked, THC concentrations increased by approximately 2.9 milligrams each year, according to a 2020 study by Freeman and his team at the University of Bath.\n\nThe potency of marijuana has been increasing every year since the 1970s, studies have found. Adobe Stock\n\nIn cannabis resin, the sticky brown sap on the plant from which extracts and concentrations are made, THC levels increased by approximately 5.7 milligrams each year from 1975 to 2017, the study found. Concentrated products can reach extremely high levels of THC.\n\nThis yearly rise in potency may not be clear to consumers, experts fear. While looking at a product label might tell a person the “precise potency” of THC in a store where marijuana is legally sold, “people buying cannabis illegally may not be able to access reliable information about the potency of the product they are using,” Freeman said.\n\n“However, certain types of cannabis are typically more potent than others – cannabis extracts are typically more potent than cannabis flower,” he added.\n\nWhile people do try to adjust their consumption when the potency of their cannabis varies, “such as by adding less cannabis to their joint or inhaling less deeply,” these efforts fail to completely work, Freeman said. That means “higher potency products still deliver a larger dose of THC to consumers than lower potency products,” he said.\n\nMental health affected\n\nAs marijuana became more potent, cases of marijuana-associated psychosis rose, the review found. Psychosis is a “loss of contact with reality” that can be characterized by hearing voices and having delusions, Freeman said.\n\n“The evidence linking cannabis potency to addiction and psychosis was very clear,” he said.\n\nHigh-potency weed users appear to have a significant increase in the likelihood of developing generalized anxiety disorder than those who smoke less robust strains of marijuana, a 2020 study had found.\n\nHowever, the new review of studies found a “more varied” connection between the increase in marijuana potency and depression and anxiety, “meaning that the impact is unclear for these other mental health outcomes,” Freeman said.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/22/health/ba4-ba5-escape-antibodies-covid-vaccine/index.html", "title": "Covid: Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 escape antibodies from ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOmicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5 appear to escape antibody responses among both people who had previous Covid-19 infection and those who have been fully vaccinated and boosted, according to new data from researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, of Harvard Medical School.\n\nHowever, Covid-19 vaccination is still expected to provide substantial protection against severe disease, and vaccine makers are working on updated shots that might elicit a stronger immune response against the variants.\n\nThe levels of neutralizing antibodies that a previous infection or vaccinations elicit are several times lower against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants compared with the original coronavirus, according to the new research published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.\n\n“We observed 3-fold reductions of neutralizing antibody titers induced by vaccination and infection against BA4 and BA5 compared with BA1 and BA2, which are already substantially lower than the original COVID-19 variants,” Dr. Dan Barouch, an author of the paper and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\n“Our data suggest that these new Omicron subvariants will likely be able to lead to surges of infections in populations with high levels of vaccine immunity as well as natural BA1 and BA2 immunity,” Barouch wrote. “However, it is likely that vaccine immunity will still provide substantial protection against severe disease with BA4 and BA5.”\n\nThe newly published findings echo separate research by scientists at Columbia University.\n\nThey recently found that the BA.4 and BA.5 viruses were more likely to escape antibodies from the blood of fully vaccinated and boosted adults compared with other Omicron subvariants, raising the risk of vaccine-breakthrough Covid-19 infections.\n\nThe authors of that separate study say their results point to a higher risk for reinfection, even in people who have some prior immunity against the virus. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 94.7% of the US population ages 16 and older have antibodies against the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 through vaccination, infection, or both.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 caused an estimated 35% of new Covid-19 infections in the United States last week, up from 29% the week before, according to data shared by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are the fastest spreading variants reported to date, and they are expected to dominate Covid-19 transmission in the United States, United Kingdom and the rest of Europe within the next few weeks, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\n‘COVID-19 still has the capacity to mutate further’\n\nIn the New England Journal of Medicine paper, among 27 research participants who had been vaccinated and boosted with the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, the researchers found that two weeks after the booster dose, levels of neutralizing antibodies against Omicron subvariants were much lower than the response against the original coronavirus.\n\nThe neutralizing antibody levels were lower by a factor of 6.4 against BA.1; by a factor of 7 against BA.2; by a factor of 14.1 against BA.2.12.1 and by a factor of 21 against BA.4 or BA.5, the researchers described.\n\nAmong 27 participants who had previously been infected with the BA.1 or BA.2 subvariants a median of 29 days earlier, the researchers found similar results.\n\nIn those with previous infection – most of whom also had been vaccinated – the researchers described neutralizing antibody levels that were lower by a factor of 6.4 against BA.1; by a factor of 5.8 against BA.2; by a factor of 9.6 against BA.2.12.1 and by a factor of 18.7 against BA.4 or BA.5.\n\nMore research is needed to determine what exactly the neutralizing antibody levels mean for vaccine effectiveness and whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of participants.\n\n“Our data suggest that COVID-19 still has the capacity to mutate further, resulting in increased transmissibility and increased antibody escape,” Barouch wrote in the email. “As pandemic restrictions are lifted, it is important that we remain vigilant and keep studying new variants and subvariants as they emerge.”\n\nA separate study, published in the journal Nature last week, found that Omicron may evolve mutations to evade the immunity elicited by having a previous BA.1 infection, which suggests that vaccine boosters based on BA.1 may not achieve broad-spectrum protection against new Omicron subvariants like BA.4 and BA.5.\n\nAs for what all this means in the real world, Dr. Wesley Long, an experimental pathologist at Houston Methodist Hospital, told CNN that people should be aware that they could get sick again, even if they’ve had Covid-19 before.\n\n“I think I’m a little bit worried about people who’ve had it maybe recently having a false sense of security with BA.4 and BA.5 on the increase, because we have seen some cases of reinfection and I have seen some cases of reinfection with people who had a BA.2 variant in the last few months,” he said.\n\nSome vaccine makers have been developing variant-specific vaccines to improve the antibody responses against coronavirus variants and subvariants of concern.\n\n“Reinfections are going to be pretty inevitable until we have vaccines or widespread mandates that are going to prevent cases rising again. But the good news is that we are in, I think, a much better spot than we were without the vaccines,” said Pavitra Roychoudhury, an acting instructor at the University of Washington’s Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, who was not involved in the New England Journal of Medicine paper.\n\n“There’s so much of this virus out there that it seems inevitable,” she said about Covid-19 infections. “Hopefully the protections that we have in place are going to lead to mostly mild infection.”\n\nEfforts underway to update Covid-19 vaccines\n\nModerna’s bivalent Covid-19 vaccine booster, named mRNA-1273.214, elicited a “potent” immune responses against the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, the company said Wednesday.\n\nThis bivalent booster vaccine candidate contains components of both Moderna’s original Covid-19 vaccine and a vaccine that targets the Omicron variant. The company said it is working to complete regulatory submissions in the coming weeks requesting to update the composition of its booster vaccine to be mRNA-1273.214.\n\n“In the face of SARS-CoV-2’s continued evolution, we are very encouraged that mRNA-1273.214, our lead booster candidate for the fall, has shown high neutralizing titers against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, which represent an emergent threat to global public health,” Stéphane Bancel, chief executive officer of Moderna, said in Wednesday’s announcement. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\n\n“We will submit these data to regulators urgently and are preparing to supply our next generation bivalent booster starting in August, ahead of a potential rise in SARS-CoV-2 infections due to Omicron subvariants in the early fall,” Bancel said.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is meeting next week to discuss the composition of Covid-19 vaccines that could be used as boosters this fall.\n\nThe data that Moderna released Wednesday, which has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, showed that one month after a 50-microgram dose of the mRNA-1273.214 vaccine was administered in people who had been vaccinated and boosted, the vaccine elicited “potent” neutralizing antibody responses against BA.4 and BA.5, boosting levels 5.4-fold in all participants regardless of whether they had a prior Covid-19 infection and by 6.3-fold in the subset of those with no history of prior infection. These levels of neutralizing antibodies were about 3-fold lower than previously reported neutralizing levels against BA.1, Moderna said.\n\nThese findings add to the data that Moderna previously released earlier this month, showing that the 50-microgram dose of the bivalent booster generated a stronger antibody response against Omicron than the original Moderna vaccine.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nModerna’s data suggest that “the bivalent booster might confer greater protection against the BA.4 and BA.5 omicron strains than readministering the original vaccine to increase protection across the population. Although the information is based on antibody levels, the companies comment that similar levels of antibody protected against clinical illness caused by other strains is the first suggestion of an emerging ‘immune correlate’ of protection, although it is hoped that this ongoing study is also assessing rates of clinical illness as well as antibody responses,” Penny Ward, an independent pharmaceutical physician and visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, said in a statement released by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Wednesday. She was not involved in Moderna’s work.\n\n“It has been reported previously that the bivalent vaccine is well tolerated with temporary ‘reactogenic’ effects similar to those following the univalent booster injection so we can anticipate that this new mixed vaccine should be well tolerated,” Ward said in part. “As we head towards the autumn with omicron variants dominating the covid infection landscape, it certainly makes sense to consider use of this new bivalent vaccine, if available.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/06/22"}]}

Seven years ago, Drake became the first artist to have a song reach one billion plays on Spotify with his smash \"One Dance,\" from the 2016 album \"Views.\"\n\nAs the streaming service has grown, songs can generate huge streaming numbers quickly. Earlier this month, Miley Cyrus' song \"Flowers,\" released in January, became the fastest song to reach 1 billion streams in Spotify history.\n\nSpotify, which launched in the U.S. in 2011 and went public in April 2018, has grown to 210 million paying subscribers as of March 31, 2023, the music streaming service said in its first quarter financials, released on April 25. The service hit 100 million paying subscribers in 2019.\n\nTaylor Swift setlist:Here are the 44 songs on her epic Eras tour\n\nTina Turner:She spent her final decades in Switzerland: What we know about her life abroad\n\nWhy did it take so long for The Beatles to have a song surpass 1 billion streams on Spotify?\n\nFor starters, the Beatles were among the holdouts when it came to online distribution of music, not making the band's music available on iTunes until 2010. The Beatles' studio albums landed on Spotify and other streaming services on Dec. 24, 2015.\n\nThe ages of the artist, the music and the listener can come into play, too. Many older music lovers still listen to compact discs, albums and other recorded formats. And younger listeners, while they may like The Beatles, are also drawn to artists such as The Weeknd, Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, Bad Bunny, Beyoncé and others.\n\n\"The Beatles have such an incredible catalog, and it's one that continually finds new generations of fans,\" said Tricia Rice, Spotify's lead for label and music partnerships, catalog, told USA TODAY. \"This may be the (band's) first song to cross into the billions club on Spotify, but their listenership continues to stay steady. With over 30 million monthly listeners on platform, the band's music will continue to make impacts for many more decades.\"\n\nThe older the track, the tougher to rack up big streaming numbers, says Guillaume Vieira, webmaster at ChartMasters.org, which tracks online music activity. When you compare \"Here Comes the Sun\" to Ed Sheeran's \"Shape of You,\" the most-streamed song on Spotify at more than 3.9 billion streams, \"Here Comes the Sun\" hits about 630,500 streams daily on Spotify, while \"Shape of You,\" nets more than 1.2 million daily, Vieira said.\n\n\"Here Comes the Sun\" is not only the first Beatles' song to hit a billion, \"it's also the first from the '60s,\" Vieira said, though it could be joined by others soon.\n\nThe 1967 single, \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough,\" from Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell, made it into the club two weeks later. And \"'Fortunate Son' (from Creedence Clearwater Revival) will be the third by mid-June,\" Vieira said.\n\nThere are no songs from the '50s with more than 750 million Spotify streams, while there are several from '70s and '80s, he said. CCR does have one song in the 1 Billion Club: \"Have You Ever Seen the Rain,\" which appeared on the 1970 album \"Pendulum\" and was released as a single in 1971. It joined the club in March 2023.\n\nOf all the Beatles' songs, why does 'Here Comes the Sun' get the most streams?\n\nThe song has been highly ranked for years, even back when downloads were the main method of digital distribution, Vieira said. \"And this song has the advantage of perfectly fitting into feel good/positive vibes' playlists, which have a high replay value,\" he said. \" It's also shorter than the ones it competed with on iTunes like 'Come Together' and 'Let It Be'.\"\n\nThose two Beatles songs will likely surpass 1 billion streams on Spotify eventually, Vieira said, with \"Come Together likely to hit that mark by early 2027, with \"Let It Be\" joining it later that year, too.\n\n'Abbey Road': On album’s 50th anniversary, creative director reflects on making the iconic cover\n\nDrake: Rapper breaks The Beatles' chart record for most top five hits on Billboard Hot 100\n\nHow much money did 'Here Comes the Sun' generate on Spotify?\n\nMusic distribution company Ditto Music, headquartered in Liverpool and New York, estimates that \"Here Comes The Sun\" has generated about $4.37 million from 1 billion Spotify streams, based on U.S. streaming rates. (Royalty rates can vary depending on which country the streams came from.)\n\nSpotify pays artists between $0.003 - $0.005 per stream on average, Ditto Music estimates. That comes out to about $4,000 per 1 million streams. Spotify typically gets 30% of the revenue with 70% going to the song's rights holders – such as the publisher, songwriter and master recording owners – Ditto Music told USA TODAY.\n\nOther streaming services pay more per stream, so the song may not have hit 1 billion on Apple Music or Tidal, but the song could be generating a similar amount of revenue, according to Ditto Music.\n\nDrake, Doja Cat, Metallica and 50 Cent make their own streaming history on Spotify\n\nWhat are the most streamed songs on Spotify?\n\nHere's the top 15 songs streaming on Spotify by total streams and daily streams, according to ChartMasters.\n\nEd Sheeran Shape of You 3.96 billion 1,377,669 The Weeknd Blinding Lights 3.65 billion 1,931,721 Ed Sheeran Perfect 3.53 billion 1,796,585 Luis Fonsi Despacito 3.25 billion 923,404 Lewis Capaldi Someone You Loved 2.88 billion 1,509,457 Tones And I Dance Monkey 2.85 billion 786,893 Post Malone rockstar (feat. 21 Savage) 2.71 billion 852,685 Post Malone Sunflower - Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 2.69 billion 1,284,586 Glass Animals Heat Waves 2.69 billion 1,811,878 Imagine Dragons Believer 2.65 billion 1,464,557 The Weeknd Save Your Tears 2.65 billion 2,317,996 Drake One Dance 2.62 billion 1,166,183 The Chainsmokers Closer 2.62 billion 803,628 Lil Nas X Old Town Road 2.62 billion 758,322 Billie Eilish bad guy 2.61 billion 708,324 Source: Streaming figures from May 9, 2023, on chartmasters.org.\n\nBillie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar among May additions to Spotify's Billions Club\n\n\"Centuries\" Fall Out Boy (2014)\n\n\"Ho Hey\" The Lumineers (2012)\n\n\"Money Trees\" – Kendrick Lamar (2012)\n\n\"My Universe\" – Coldplay and BTS (2021)\n\n\"Somewhere Only We Know \" – Keane (2004)\n\nKeane (2004) \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" – Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell (1967)\n\n\"Happier Than Ever\" – Billie Eilish (2021)\n\n\"Story of My Life\" – One Direction (2013)\n\n\"Let Me Go\" – Hailee Steinfield with Alesso, Florida Georgia Line and Watt (2017)\n\n\"Need to Know\" – Doja Cat (2021)\n\n\"Don't\" – Bryson Tiller (2015)\n\n\"Paradise\" – Coldplay (2011)\n\n\"Grenade\" – Bruno Mars (2010)\n\n\"Talking to the Moon\" – Bruno Mars (2010)\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

The average artist pay rate declined 43% over two years.\n\nMackenzie Miller is a 22-year-old singer based in Seattle. Her single “Peach Lemonade” gained nearly 14,000 in the first few weeks of its release, but her paycheck was barely $5.\n\n“You have to have an enormous amount of streams to even make minimum wage,” Miller says. “If your streams plateau, if people aren’t listening to it as much anymore, you’re not going to get paid anymore.”\n\nMiller’s goal is to one day have her music become her full-time job. But low artist rates on Spotify means she has to share her music elsewhere to make money.\n\n“I have tons of people come up to me after I play (live shows) asking if they can listen to me on Spotify,” Miller says. “And that’s great, and they give me streams, but it’s never enough streams to actually be able to quit my day job.”\n\nIn August 2022, Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib introduced a new resolution calling for new streaming payment systems to fairly and directly compensate artists every time their music is streamed. Tlaib’s release included a staggering calculation. It would take more than 800,000 streams a month to equal a wage of $15 an hour.\n\nGoodbye Heardle:A year after the Wordle craze, Spotify is shutting down online music game\n\nNot guilty:Ed Sheeran did not plagiarize Marvin Gaye classic, jury says\n\nHow do artists get paid from Spotify?\n\nInstead of paying the artists directly, Spotify pays the rights holders, who pay the artists. According to Spotify, roughly two-thirds of the revenue from music goes to rights holders. Rights holders are the licensor the artist pays to represent them and upload their music to Spotify — often record labels or distributors. This money is divided into recording royalties (paid to the artist via licensor) and publishing royalties, which goes to the songwriters or owners of the song. Artists are paid different amounts depending on the contracts they have with their rights holders.\n\nNineteen-year-old singer Ava Mastroianni, who creates music under the name Ava Dallas, uses DistroKid to publish her music to streaming services. At about $20 a year, DistroKid gives all of the stream revenue back to the artist, who is in charge of producing and promoting their music.\n\n“If you’re not attached to a label, then there’s so much more work you have to do and pay for,” says Mastroianni, whose 10,000 streams from the three songs she’s released hasn't covered the upfront cost. “I’ve already paid $20 a year to DistroKid to distribute my music, so I am basically paying to release music.”\n\nPassages 2023:David Crosby, Lisa Marie Presley, C.J. Harris and more stars we lost\n\nHow to cancel Spotify Premium:3 easy steps to end your subscription\n\nHow much does Apple Music pay per stream?\n\nApple Music also does not pay per stream.\n\nApple Music shells out about $0.01 per play, the company self-reports. This doesn’t necessarily mean artists earn $0.01 per stream, though. Like Spotify, Apple Music calculates royalties on a stream share basis, which is the percentage of Apple Music's total streams an individual song makes up.\n\nGetting creative: How artists make money from their music\n\nMastroianni, who is a music industry student at Northeastern University, said she’s learned merchandise and social media are two of the strongest cash cows in the industry.\n\n“The TikTok Creator Fund, people are making so much money off of that and social media in general (with) advertisements, but I would also say merch is definitely one of the biggest sellers,” she says.\n\nCreators with at least 100,000 views in the last 30 days are eligible to earn money from TikTok, which funds TikTokers who generate high views, engagement and content. TikTok even launched into the world of streaming in March 2022 with its distribution platform, SoundOn.\n\nOutside of live gigs, Miller has found success in songwriting, where she says, “most of the money in music is.”\n\nShe makes $100 to write songs for customers of Songfinch, a platform where artists produce an original song based on the customer’s wishes.\n\nMiller says she believes Spotify’s pay rate often dissuades artists from creating more music. She feeds her passion for art in other ways than uploading to Spotify, because when it comes to writing her own songs, hiring a producer is costly.\n\n“Having to possibly spend up to $1,000 to get a song finished and out into the world and then to receive $5 back for it, it doesn’t really make you want to keep doing it,” Miller says. “All the money that I'm going to spend that I'm going to put into creating it and giving it a good quality, that I feel like I want it to represent me on Spotify, I'm not gonna make back.”\n\nHer first 'Era':Revisiting the Taylor Swift album that launched her into superstardom\n\nJust Curious?:We help answer life's everyday questions", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/11/01/spotify-wrapped-2022-music-data/10659843002/", "title": "Spotify Wrapped 2022 stopped collecting your data on Oct. 31", "text": "You better have listened to \"Midnights\" on repeat the past week.\n\nThat's if you want Taylor Swift's newest album to appear in your end-of-year list of what you listened to the most on Spotify.\n\nIt turns out the music streaming service's annual breakdown of yearly activity, called Spotify Wrapped, isn't actually a reflection of your full year.\n\nSpotify has previously confirmed to numerous news outlets, as well as on Twitter, that Wrapped only collects data from Jan. 1 to Oct. 31.\n\nAlthough some have speculated that the cutoff has to do with eliminating the Christmas music some people play on repeat from Nov. 1 onwards from the data, the company has said it's simply about the logistics of getting the product done before the end of the year.\n\nFOMO:What makes Spotify's Wrapped such a popular end-of-year tradition?\n\nWhat is Spotify Wrapped?\n\nLove it or hate it, come late December, your social media feeds are likely filled with colorful boxes declaring which artists, podcasts and genres of music your friends streamed the most in the past year.\n\nIt has been a tradition since the then-titled \"Year In Review\" was released by the streaming service in 2015.\n\nThe feature allows Spotify users – both free and premium – to create social media posts out of slides the app provides detailing their listening data for the year.\n\nFor example, you can display the top musical genres you listened to, the songs you played the most and your top five podcasts for the year.\n\nSome users get very excited to share their lists, while others dread it being revealed that they spent 600 hours listening to the same three early 2000s emo tracks.\n\nWhy is data only collected through October?\n\nBrendan Codey, associate director for Creator Growth and Programs at Spotify, told Newsweek last year that the reason for the hard cutoff is logistics.\n\nSpotify needs time to compile the data and finish creating the graphics for Wrapped, all during a time when Spotify's staff has time off for Thanksgiving.\n\n\"We need to QA the site and we need to finalize assets for Wrapped, all of which takes a while. You throw Thanksgiving into the mix as well and we have even less time,\" Codey told Newsweek.\n\nSPOTIFY PAYS ARTISTS (SORT OF):But not per stream. Here's how it breaks down.\n\nAt least one user previously submitted a request to include the November and December data to Spotify's Community forum.\n\n\"If the wrap has to be prepared beforehand and the data end date has to remain October 31st (although still unclear why), then at least count the November-December in the next year's wrap (start it from November),\" user kalipsobznuni submitted in 2020.\n\nThe submission got 216 votes from other users, but Spotify closed the commenting and voting earlier this year saying, \"We've been keeping an eye on this submission for an extended period of time, and it doesn't seem this will reach the votes necessary to put it forward for prioritization.\"\n\nSpotify's Community guidelines say ideas need to gather 180 votes in under six months to be brought to the attention of the Spotify team. The company says it will also consider ideas that get more than 500 votes in under 18 months.\n\nWhen does Spotify Wrapped come out?\n\nSpotify's website doesn't have a specific date listed for when this year's Wrapped will be released.\n\nIn the past, the feature has launched on Dec. 1 or 2.\n\nFollow Katie Wedell on Twitter: @KatieWedell and Facebook: facebook.com/ByKatieWedell", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/03/30/bad-bunny-latinx-lgbtq-community/11493479002/", "title": "Bad Bunny's LGBTQ allyship, fluidity and impact on Latino fanbase", "text": "Bad Bunny is leading a reggaeton revolution – and a queer one at that.\n\nThe 29-year-old, whose \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" album was the most-streamed worldwide in 2022, has been named Spotify's most-streamed artist three years in a row, won three Grammys and continues to break his own records in a genre that's traditionally hyper-masculine.\n\nHe's also kissed a male backup dancer onstage. He dressed in drag for the \"Yo Perreo Sola\" music video and wore a skirt on a \"Tonight Show\" appearance. He straight-up told the Los Angles Times, \"I don't know if in 20 years I will like a man. One never knows in life.\"\n\nMany have speculated about his sexual identity, but Bad Bunny hasn't allowed himself to be labeled. After all, he's been clear that \"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana\" (\"I Do Whatever I Want\").\n\nHe has artfully challenged homophobia in reggaeton, critiqued masculinity in the Latino community and been an ally to the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"Even though (Bad Bunny) hasn't come out and specified his sexual orientation, he has elevated the conversation on a global stage and in these pop cultural arenas where people are paying attention. Fluidity is his main message,\" says Dr. Nathian Rodriguez, a Journalism and Media Studies professor at San Diego State University.\n\nAs a cisgender man, however, his allyship can only go so far.\n\nBad Bunny's allyship and its importance\n\nThere's a misconception that Latino culture is overly macho. But it's not any more patriarchal than most other cultures.\n\n\"When we're talking about reggaeton specifically, we have to understand how, as a form of culture, it represents patriarchy, just like it represents capitalism,\" says Jessica Lopez Lyman, Xicana feminist scholar at the University of Minnesota. \"So artists who are trying to break against these systems have to be savvy in their maneuvering, because these systems can be so dominating.\"\n\nAnd that's part of Bad Bunny's brilliance.\n\nIn his 2019 music video for \"Caro,\" Bad Bunny gave a \"pointed critique about expectations around gender norms and gender performance,\" says Vanessa Díaz, an assistant professor at Loyola Marymount University, where she teaches the course \"Bad Bunny and the Resistance in Puerto Rico.\"\n\nThe following year, he appeared on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" to call attention to the killing of Alexa Negrón Luciano, a homeless transgender woman who was brutally killed in Puerto Rico. He wore a white T-shirt that read: \"They killed Alexa, not a man in a skirt.\"\n\nWhen fellow reggaeton star Don Omar spewed homophobic comments online, Bad Bunny tweeted: \"Homophobia in this day and age? How embarrassing, man.\"\n\nHis words and actions have made Bad Bunny a \"figure of really necessary change,\" Díaz adds.\n\nGLAAD, one of the country's foremost LGBTQ advocacy organizations, will honor Bad Bunny Thursday at the 34th GLAAD Media Awards with the Vanguard Award for his allyship.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Bad Bunny's representatives for comment.\n\nIs Bad Bunny queerbaiting?\n\nFans often accuse celebrities of \"queerbaiting\" when a straight, cisgender person seems to cash in on LGBTQ fashion, music, acting roles and more.\n\nQueerbaiting can look like veering from gender-conforming clothing choices (remember the accusations against Harry Styles?) to prominent same-sex kisses. What makes something queerbaiting depends on how a celebrity engages overall with LGBTQ issues. These accusations can go awry, though.\n\n\"I don't like or use the term 'queerbaits,' it misses the point,\" says Lawrence La Fountain-Stokes, professor of culture and gender studies at the University of Michigan. \"There is a long tradition in the Hispanic world of flirtatiousness that goes well beyond American obsessions with rigid categories and gender orthodoxies.\"\n\nOf course, no one – celebrity or not – owes anyone an explanation about their sexuality.\n\n\"He doesn't have to say he's queer to demonstrate a queer sensibility,\" Díaz says.\n\nBut those with platforms are simply more scrutinized. \"Just because Bad Bunny is famous, we have certain expectations of him that maybe we don't have of everyday people,\" Lopez Lyman adds. \"And of course, there is a responsibility when you do have a public profile to a certain extent.\n\nIt's a great start, but there's a long way to go\n\nBad Bunny is certainly a transformative figure, but he isn't \"breaking any kind of rainbow ceilings,\" Rodriguez says.\n\nStill, other artists can learn from his example.\n\nBad Bunny has proven \"you don't have to be homophobic or transphobic in order to succeed in the world of reggaeton and música urbana,\" says La Fountain-Stokes. Yet, he \"greatly benefits from being a light-skinned, cisgender, heterosexual male performer.\"\n\nBut it's his authenticity, fearlessness and rejection of societal expectations that empower his fans and drive his artistic message of fluidity and community home.\n\n\"I truly don't think he cares about the value or judgment that others might put on (his choices),\" Díaz says. \"That's part of who he is (and) part of his artistic project.\"\n\nMore on Bad Bunny, Latino culture", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/entertainment/taylor-swift-billboard-top-10/index.html", "title": "Taylor Swift makes the top 10 spots of the Billboard Hot 100 all her ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTaylor Swift is breaking yet another record thanks to the release of her most recent album “Midnights.”\n\nThe entertainer, who already became Spotify’s most-streamed artist over a 24-hour period upon the release of the record earlier this month, now claims all top ten slots of the Billboard Hot 100 at the same time, according to the music charting website on Monday.\n\nSwift is the first artist to ever accomplish the feat in Billboard’s 64-year history.\n\nShe beat Drake, who in September 2021 claimed nine of the Hot 100’s top 10 spots for a week.

China did not say specifically what sanctions it would levy against Pelosi and her immediate family over what it called her “egregious provocations” in visiting Taiwan, an island that China claims as its own territory.\n\nChina acted because Pelosi visited Taiwan “in disregard of China’s strong opposition and serious representations,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\nIn another sign of deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing, the White House summoned China's ambassador to the White House on Thursday to launch a formal protest over Beijing's recent aggressive actions against Taiwan.\n\nChina on Thursday launched threatening military exercises in six zones just off Taiwan’s coasts that it says will run through Sunday. Missiles also have been fired over Taiwan, defense officials told state media.\n\n\"We condemned (China's) military actions, which are irresponsible, at odds with our long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability and across the Taiwan Strait,\" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. \"We made clear to the ambassador that Beijing’s actions are of concern to Taiwan, to us and to our partners around the world.\"\n\nChina has claimed that Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan amounts to an attack by the Biden administration on Chinese sovereignty. The White House has stressed that Pelosi is the head of the legislative branch of government and that it could not stop her visit.\n\nThe White House also has said Pelosi’s visit does not signal a shift in its one-China policy, which acknowledges that Taiwan is part of China.\n\n“China has chosen to overreact and use the speaker’s visit as a pretext to increase provocative military activity in and around the Taiwan Strait,” Kirby told reporters at the White House on Thursday.\n\nIn an effort to ease the tensions, Kirby said the U.S. would postpone intercontinental ballistic missile test scheduled for this week. Kirby said the decision to reschedule the test was intended to demonstrate “the behavior of a responsible nuclear power by reducing the risks of miscalculation and misperception.”\n\nPelosi, the first U.S. speaker to visit Taiwan in 25 years, said in Japan on Friday that China will not be able to isolate Taiwan by preventing U.S. officials from traveling there. The Chinese have tried to isolate Taiwan, Pelosi said, including most recently by preventing it from joining the World Health Organization.\n\n“They may try to keep Taiwan from visiting or participating in other places, but they will not isolate Taiwan by preventing us to travel there,” Pelosi said as she wrapped up a swing across Asia. Pelosi and five other members of Congress arrived in Tokyo late Thursday after visiting Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and South Korea.\n\nChina’s announcement on Friday threatened to accelerate the friction with Washington.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry said dialogue between U.S. and Chinese regional commanders and defense department heads would be canceled, along with talks on military maritime safety.\n\nCooperation on returning illegal immigrants, criminal investigations, transnational crime, illegal drugs and climate change will be suspended, the ministry said.\n\nThe Chinese military exercises launched Thursday involve its navy, air force and other departments and are to last until Sunday. They include missile strikes on targets in the seas north and south of the island in an echo of the last major Chinese military drills in 1995 and 1996 aimed at intimidating Taiwan’s leaders and voters.\n\nTaiwan has put its military on alert and staged civil defense drills, while the U.S. has numerous naval assets in the area. China also flew war planes toward Taiwan and blocked imports of its citrus and fish.\n\n'WE CAME TO TAIWAN TO LISTEN':Pelosi gives strong backing to Taiwan's democracy; US braces for Chinese military drills\n\nEarlier Friday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that China’s military exercises aimed at Taiwan represent a “grave problem” that threatens regional peace and security after five ballistic missiles launched as part of the drills landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone.\n\nKishida, speaking after breakfast with Pelosi and her congressional delegation, said the missile launches need to be “stopped immediately.”\n\nJapanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said five missiles landed on Thursday in Japan’s exclusive economic zone off Hateruma, an island far south of Japan’s main islands. He said Japan protested to China, saying the missiles “threatened Japan’s national security and the lives of the Japanese people, which we strongly condemn.”\n\nJapanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, attending a regional meeting in Cambodia, said China’s actions are “severely impacting peace and stability in the region and the international community, and we demand the immediate suspension of the military exercises.”\n\nJapan has in recent years bolstered its defense capability and troop presence in southwestern Japan and remote islands, including Okinawa, which is about 700 kilometers (420 miles) northeast of Taiwan. Many residents say they worry their island will be quickly embroiled in any Taiwan conflict. Okinawa is home to the majority of about 50,000 American troops based in Japan under a bilateral security pact.\n\nSEE THE HISTORIC TRIP:Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan amid escalating tensions with China\n\nAt the breakfast earlier Friday, Pelosi and her congressional delegation also discussed their shared security concern over China, North Korea and Russia, and pledged their commitment to working toward peace and stability in Taiwan, Kishida said. Pelosi was also to hold talks with her Japanese counterpart, lower house Speaker Hiroyuki Hosoda.\n\nJapan and its key ally, the U.S., have been pushing for new security and economic frameworks with other democracies in the Indo-Pacific region and Europe as a counter to China’s growing influence amid rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei.\n\nDays before Pelosi’s Taiwan visit, a group of senior Japanese lawmakers, including former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba, visited the island and discussed regional security with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen. Ishiba said Japan, while working with the United States to prevent conflict in the Indo-Pacific, wants a defense agreement with Taiwan.\n\nOn Thursday, the foreign ministers of the Group of Seven industrialized nations issued a statement saying “there is no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait.” It said China’s “escalatory response risks increasing tensions and destabilizing the region.”\n\nChina cited its displeasure over the statement for the last-minute cancellation of talks between the Chinese and Japanese foreign ministers on the sidelines of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting in Cambodia on Thursday.\n\nPelosi held talks on Thursday in South Korea, also a key U.S. ally, which stayed away from the Taiwan issue, apparently to avoid upsetting China, focusing instead on North Korea’s increasing nuclear threat.\n\nIn recent years, South Korea has been struggling to strike a balance between the United States and China as their rivalry has deepened.\n\nThe Biden administration and Pelosi have said the United States remains committed to the so-called one-China policy, which recognizes Beijing as the government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei.

Liz Cheney was decided Tuesday after Wyoming voters ousted her from her House seat. “This primary election is over, but now the real work begins,” Cheney said, delivering scathing remarks about former President Donald Trump, after losing to Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman. In her concession speech, Cheney vowed to continue to fight the former President’s election lies and steer the GOP away from his influence. Since the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol, Cheney has become the Republican Party’s most forceful critic of Trump and has helped lead the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot. She is the eighth of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump to now exit the House. Separately, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska is squaring off in the first of what’s likely to be two rounds against the Trump-endorsed Kelly Tshibaka. Former Gov. Sarah Palin, meanwhile, is attempting a political comeback in a special election for the state’s lone House seat.\n\n2. January 6\n\nThe committee investigating the Capitol Hill insurrection on January 6, 2021, has added an unexpected public hearing today. Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and a witness to many critical events and conversations, is expected to testify publicly later today, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Hutchinson’s live testimony would mark a significant moment in the committee’s series of hearings as she has long been considered one of its most consequential witnesses who can speak to former President Donald Trump’s reaction to the Capitol riot. The announcement of the hearing – which will start at 1 p.m. ET – came as a surprise as the committee had said it was not going to resume its hearings until mid-July.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\n3. Amtrak crash\n\nAt least three people were killed and at least 50 injured after an Amtrak train derailed Monday in Missouri, authorities said. The train was traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago and had about 243 passengers on board when it collided with a dump truck near the city of Mendon, about 100 miles northeast of Kansas City, according to the passenger rail company. Aerial footage of the crash showed the train toppled to the side as authorities responded to the scene. Preliminary reports indicate the incident happened at an uncontrolled intersection – without warning lights or motion gates – where a gravel road crossed the railroad tracks southwest of town. The collision was the second in two days in which an Amtrak train hit a passenger vehicle.\n\n4. Immigration\n\nVideo Ad Feedback NASA scrubs Artemis I rocket launch due to engine issues.

Ukraine\n\nWhite House officials are losing confidence that Ukraine will ever be able to take back all of the land it has lost to Russia over the past four months of war, US officials told CNN, even with the more sophisticated weaponry the US and its allies plan to send. The officials emphasized that this more pessimistic assessment does not mean the US plans to pressure Ukraine into making any formal territorial concessions to Russia in order to end the war. There is also hope that Ukrainian forces will be able to take back significant chunks of territory in a likely counteroffensive later this year. Separately, Ukraine has requested a meeting of the UN Security Council today to discuss the Russian strike on a shopping mall as the death toll rose to at least 18. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack “one of the most defiant terrorist acts in European history.”\n\nBREAKFAST BROWSE\n\nMeet Mr. Happy Face, the ‘World’s Ugliest Dog’\n\nA woman used her smartwatch to call 911 after getting stuck in an interesting position at the gym.

Every newspaper and cable channel is filled with thoughts about the move, with much of that opinion tilting toward outrage over the Florida Republican governor treating people like political pawns.\n\n“It’s outrageous,” New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez said of the move. “They lure people, like human traffickers lure people, onto buses and unknowing where they’re going to. They have no concern for – they supposedly are the advocates for human life. They have no concern for the lives of these people.”\n\nDeSantis couldn’t have scripted it any better politically.\n\nThe simple fact is that DeSantis made this Martha’s Vineyard gambit solely to draw attention to himself and his opposition to the border policies of the Biden administration. It was, to be frank, a stunt. And it’s not the first time he’s done something like this.\n\nConsider:\n\n* In the spring of 2022, DeSantis’ administration rejected 41% of proposed math textbooks because they were allegedly “indoctrinating” kids. “Some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,” DeSantis said in a statement explaining the move.\n\n* At a press conference at the University of South Florida earlier this year, DeSantis scolded students for wearing masks while indoors. “You do not have to wear those masks,” he said. “I mean, please take them off. Honestly, it’s not doing anything. We’ve got to stop with this Covid theater. So if you want to wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous.”\n\n* DeSantis revoked Disney’s special self-governance status in Florida following the company’s criticism of the state’s passage of legislation that bans the discussion of gender and sexuality among young people in public schools. “You’re a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you’re going to marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state,” said DeSantis. “We view that as a provocation, and we’re going to fight back against that.”\n\nEach of these incidents drew national headlines. Each of them drew intense criticism from the left. And each of them drew equal amounts of praise from the conservative right.\n\nWhich is exactly how the Martha Vineyard’s stunt has played out. While DeSantis was blasted by Democrats, the right ran to defend him. “DeSantis was right to send migrants to Martha’s Vineyard. We need to bring border crisis to Democrats,” read an op-ed on Fox News’ website.\n\nFor DeSantis, the outrage – on both sides – is the point. He has built a political brand on the idea of standing up to what he views as political correctness and wokeness. (DeSantis signed a bill into law earlier this year designed to “protect Floridians from discrimination and woke indoctrination.”) In order to maintain and burnish that image, he has to do even more outrageous things – like the Martha’s Vineyard move.\n\nThe fact of the matter – whether you like DeSantis or not – is that his outrage machine is humming along. Largely riding his knack for stirring controversy, he has emerged by many measures as the second-most popular Republican in the country – behind only Donald Trump. He is regarded as a heavy favorite to win a second term over his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, in November. And he is widely regarded as the only candidate who could credibly challenge Trump in a 2024 Republican primary.\n\nWhich is somewhat ironic. Because, as Trump likes to remind anyone who asks, he helped make DeSantis by endorsing him in a primary fight in 2018. And DeSantis has quite clearly modeled his approach to politics off of the ripped-from-the-headlines strategy employed by Trump.\n\nIn fact, what DeSantis is offering Republican voters amounts to Trumpism without Trump. In DeSantis, you get all the anti-wokeness that Trump built a presidential campaign and presidency on, but just without some of the more embarrassing personal foibles and tics that the former President brings with him.\n\nAnd, just like Trump, covering DeSantis provides a significant challenge for the media as well. DeSantis wants – and even courts – the scorn of the mainstream media for gambits like the one in Martha’s Vineyard. He knows that the more negative attention he gets, the better liked he is among the Republican base and the more money he can raise for his future political endeavors.\n\nNot covering someone like DeSantis – the governor of a major state and someone with national ambitions – is out of the question. But how DeSantis – and his stunts – are covered is something that the media needs to think seriously on as we move closer to 2024.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/25/politics/liz-cheney-donald-trump-2022-election/index.html", "title": "Liz Cheney is already looking beyond 2022 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nLiz Cheney didn’t come right out and say she expects to lose her primary next month. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, it was pretty easy to read between the lines of the Wyoming Republican’s answers.\n\n“I am working hard here in Wyoming to earn every vote,” Cheney said at one point. “But I will also say this. I’m not going to lie. I’m not going to say things that aren’t true about the election. My opponents are doing that, certainly simply for the purpose of getting elected.\n\n“If I have to choose between maintaining a seat in the House of Representatives or protecting the constitutional republic and ensuring the American people know the truth about Donald Trump, I’m going to choose the Constitution and the truth every single day,” she said at another.\n\nAsked by Tapper whether her service as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 will have been worth it even if she loses next month, Cheney responded that it was “the single most important thing I have ever done professionally.”\n\nIf it sounds to you like Cheney is framing her August 16 primary for Wyoming’s at-large House seat as a sort of fait accompli, and as not the end of the story but as a part of a broader narrative, well, then, you are right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cheney is very unlikely to beat Harriet Hageman in next month’s primary. Hageman has the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as a number of top Republicans including, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile Cheney has tried to recruit Democrats to cross party lines and support her – and some undoubtedly will – it’s hard to see that making a real difference in the outcome of the race in such an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nSimply put: Cheney looks likely to lose – and she knows it.\n\nWhat she also knows is that, at least in her mind, this isn’t the end of her political career.\n\nHere’s how Cheney answered a question from Tapper on whether she is interested in running for president in 2024:\n\n“I haven’t really – at this point, I have not made a decision about 2024. …\n\n“… But I do think, as we look towards the next presidential election, as I said, I believe that our nation stands on the edge of an abyss. And I do believe that we all have to really think very seriously about the dangers we face and the threats we face. And we have to elect serious candidates.”\n\nWhich tells you everything you need to know about Cheney and 2024. She isn’t an announced candidate. But when you hear a politician talking about the country “standing on the edge of an abyss” and the need to elect “serious candidates,” well, it doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out what’s going on there.\n\nThe real question seems to be then not whether Cheney runs – she sounded to all the world like that decision is mostly made – but rather whether she would have any sort of impact on the 2024 race.\n\nIf Cheney runs as a Republican, it will, undoubtedly, be a very tough road for her.\n\nTrump is the clear frontrunner in all polling conducted on the Republican presidential primary and seems very likely to run. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely seen as the only serious alternative to Trump at the moment – and he has positioned himself as a representative of Trumpism without Trump.\n\nThere is no potential candidate garnering any serious support in hypothetical 2024 primary polls who is running expressly against Trump and his four years in office. The Republicans, aside from Cheney, who are signaling an interest in running that sort of campaign – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan being perhaps the most prominent – barely register in polls.\n\nCould Cheney somehow coalesce the anti-Trump vote within the Republican Party? Sure. But even if she was to do so, there’s scant evidence that bloc of voters comprise anything close to a majority of likely Republican primary voters.\n\nThe other – and perhaps more plausible – path for Cheney is to run as an independent in 2024. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, such a candidacy could skim off enough votes to potentially hamstring the former President’s chances of winning. (Presumably Cheney, who is conservative on most issues, would appeal more to Republicans than Democrats.)\n\nEven under that scenario, however, Cheney would function as a spoiler – trying to keep Trump from the White House – rather than as a viable candidate to be president. Which, given what she told Tapper Sunday, might be enough for her.\n\n“I’m fighting hard, no matter what happens on August 16, I’m going to wake up on August 17 and continue to fight hard to ensure Donald Trump is never anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again,” said Cheney.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2022/07/17/british-open-rory-mcilroy-cameron-smith/50499365/", "title": "British Open: Rory McIlroy feels pain of letting victory 'slip away'", "text": "Adam Schupak\n\nGolfweek\n\nST. ANDREWS, Scotland - Rory McIlroy had said all the right things in his post-round news conference and with those duties complete, he slumped into a four-passenger golf cart and buried his head into wife Erica's left shoulder and all the emotions came flooding out.\n\nThe 150th Open Championship, the one McIlroy labeled his Holy Grail earlier in the week, was his to win or lose. After sharing the 54-hole lead with Viktor Hovland, McIlroy had built a two-stroke lead with nine holes to go. The World No. 2 had his strut back this week and was playing chess against the fabled seaside links in a way that would have made past champions here like Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods proud.\n\nMcIlroy could almost taste the alcohol he surely would have consumed from the Claret Jug once he regained possession of the winner's trophy for the first time since 2014 and ended his nearly eight-year winless drought.\n\nOnly problem is Cameron Smith of Australia had other plans and vaulted into the lead by reeling off five back-nine birdies in a row en route to shooting 8-under 64 at the Old Course. McIlroy, who closed in 2-under 70, two shots back, and finished in third, was left to wonder what more he had to do claim his elusive fifth major title.\n\nBRITISH OPEN:Cameron Smith seals victory with spectacular final-round 64\n\nLIVE LEADERBOARD: The Open Championship Tournament Leaderboard Scores, Schedules, Pairings and More\n\nCAMERON SMITH:British Open winner is 'going to find out how many beers' fit in Claret Jug\n\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get daily updates in your inbox\n\n\"I'll be OK,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, it's not life or death. I'll have other chances to win the Open Championship and other chances to win majors. It's one that I feel like I let slip away, but there will be other opportunities.\"\n\nExcept he didn't look OK as he drove off. He rued failing to convert on birdie chances at Nos. 3, 6 and 9, which could have nipped Smith's charge in the bud. McIlroy hit every green in regulation in the final round and had a wonderful sense of speed with his putter, but he picked a bad time for it to go cold. He didn't make a single putt of consequence.\n\n\"I felt like I didn't do much wrong today, but I didn't do much right either,\" he said. \"It's just one of those days where I played a really controlled round of golf. I did what I felt like I needed to just apart from capitalizing on the easier holes - around the turn, 9, 12, 14. If I had made the birdies there from good positions, it probably would have been a different story.\"\n\nThis one will hurt because McIlroy knows he had every chance to stop Smith, but with every birdie by Smith, his confidence grew and the pressure on McIlroy tightened.\n\n\"I can't be too despondent because of how this year's went and this year's going,\" he said. \"I'm playing some of the best golf I've played in a long time. So it's just a matter of keep knocking on the door, and eventually one will open.\"\n\nBut despondent is what he looked like as he hid his face in his wife's embrace. He finished second at the Masters, eighth at the PGA Championship, T-5 at the U.S. Open, and third at the Open - a banner-type year for Rickie Fowler in 2014 but for McIlroy it is close but no cigar. The end result is a failure and like Vesuvius he has to wait until April to begin the quest of pushing the ball up the mountain again.\n\nIt hurt because he admitted that he had dreamed of winning the 150th and allowed himself moments to look ahead and think about what it might be like to hold the trophy and be celebrated on the 18th green as the Champion Golfer of the Year.\n\n\"I'm only human. I'm not a robot. Of course, you think about it, and you envision it, and you want to envision it,\" he said. \"My hotel room is directly opposite the big yellow board on 18 there right of the first. And every time I go out, I'm trying to envision McIlroy at the top name on that leaderboard and how did that feel?

But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}]}

Although Labour stormed to victory in Selby and Ainsty, leader Keir Starmer found himself on the ropes when he promised to maintain a deeply unpopular two-child benefit cap policy. Against all predictions, the Tories managed to cling on to Boris Johnson’s former constituency, Uxbridge and South Ruislip, by just 495 votes after a recount. It seems like the biggest winner there – or loser – was Ulez (the ultra-low emissions zone), the controversial clean-air scheme that Labour mayor Sadiq Khan is about to expand in the capital, which Labour are blaming for their defeat. Tackling Ulez is a priority of Susan Hall, an “outspoken” figure the Conservatives picked as their London mayoral candidate this week. Both parties have committed to maintaining the political hot potato that is the “triple lock” system on state pensions. With inflation still stubbornly high, that could mean a big pay-out for pensioners, which struggling workers might find hard to swallow. Meanwhile in Thailand, conservatives managed to block the “charismatic” young Pita Limjaroenrat from becoming prime minister. His Move Forward Party swept to victory in the general election, on the promise of reform after years of military rule, but he won’t be the new leader thanks to the country’s constitution – ironically, written by the military.

Pandjaitan, who is helping to coordinate the summit, said the Russian President would be represented by “senior officials.”\n\nPutin’s decision not to attend the G20 summit in person saves him the embarrassment of being confronted – or shunned – by other world leaders over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The meeting will take place just days after the Kremlin announced Russian forces would retreat from a large swathe of Kherson – one of four Ukrainian regions Putin previously said Russia planned to annex in violation of international law.\n\nIn the lead up to the event, Western countries and Ukraine have pressured Indonesia, the G20 host, to step up its condemnation of Moscow and withdraw its invitation to Putin for the summit. Since invading Ukraine in late February, western democracies have treated Russia and Putin as a pariah on the world stage.\n\nUS President Joe Biden, who is attending the summit, said in March Russia should be ejected from the G20, a multilateral organization comprised of 19 of the world’s major economies and the European Union. Senior members of Biden’s administration have walked out of G20 events where Russian delegates are present.\n\nWhen asked if he would meet Putin one-on-one in Bali during an exclusive interview last month, Biden said he did not see a good reason to do so but it would “depend on specifically what he wanted to talk about.” Biden said if Putin wanted to discuss the jailed American basketball star Brittney Griner then he would be open to talking.\n\nJakarta has resisted pressure to single out Russia and has sought to remain a neutral position. It has invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the summit as a guest.\n\nZelensky has said that Ukraine would not take part in the G20 summit if Putin attends. The Ukrainian President is expected to join the meetings virtually.\n\nChina’s leader is attending\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping, who met Putin in Uzbekistan in September, is also expected to attend the summit and meet Biden for the first time since the American President took office nearly two years ago.\n\nBeijing has not officially confirmed whether Xi will attend the summit or meet with Biden. But on Wednesday, Biden told a news conference at the White House following the midterm elections that he will be having talks with Xi in Bali.\n\nBiden said he’s not planning to make any “fundamental concessions” and that they will discuss the economy and trade. But he declined to reveal what his message would be on US military support to Taiwan should China move on the self-governing island.\n\n“I’m gonna have that conversation with him,” Biden added, noting that they’ll lay out “what each of our red lines are.”\n\nTheir much-anticipated meeting comes as relations between US and China hit their lowest point in decades in a downward spiral that started under the former presidency of Donald Trump, as the two countries ramp up their rivalry in trade, technology, geopolitics and ideology.\n\nIn recent months, tensions have reached new highs following US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and the Biden administration’s ban on the sale of advanced chips and chip-making equipment to China.\n\nMeanwhile, under Xi, China has moved closer to Russia, united by their plummeting relations with the US and other Western countries. Weeks before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Xi and Putin declared their countries share a “no-limits” friendship. Beijing has since refused to condemn the war in Ukraine, or refer to it as an “invasion.”\n\nAfter G20, Xi will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bangkok, which kicks off next Friday, according to Thailand’s Foreign Ministry.

He, in fact, cannot continue with impunity to talk about the use of a tactical nuclear weapon as if that’s a rational thing to do,” Biden said, before warning of dangerous consequences of such a move.\n\n“The mistakes get made, the miscalculation could occur, no one could be sure what would happen and it could end in Armageddon,” he said, again stressing that a nuclear blast that kills thousands of people could lead to events barreling way out of control.\n\nThe danger of escalation\n\nBiden is stating the fear of some strategists who warn about a ladder of escalation that could occur if a nuclear bomb is used and triggers reprisals by the West – even though any initial US response would certainly go no further than conventional military action.\n\nHe also appears to be trying to create a narrative of deterrence around the specific situation in Ukraine. The logic of the US and Russia’s long-range strategic nuclear arsenals is that the use of them is deterred because a conflict would be suicidal for both sides. That equation does not exist in Ukraine, since the country has no nuclear arsenal and it’s hard to conclude that it represents a vital national interest that would lead Washington to respond in kind to Putin going nuclear. By stressing that even a tactical device – which could be small enough to destroy an airbase or large enough to reduce a city to ruins – could lead to something worse, Biden seems to be almost seeking to create a new chain of calculations in Putin’s mind.\n\nTwo moments in Tapper’s interview brought home the burden now borne by the man who is followed everywhere he goes by a military officer carrying the nation’s nuclear codes.\n\nFirst the CNN anchor asked the President to state the US red line for the US and NATO in Ukraine and what Washington would do if Putin bombed a nuclear plant in Ukraine or set off a tactical nuclear weapon.\n\n“It would be irresponsible for me to talk about what we would or wouldn’t do,” Biden said.\n\nThen, Tapper prodded the President over whether the Pentagon had gamed out scenarios. Biden soberly replied: “The Pentagon didn’t have to be asked.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch the full exclusive interview with President Joe Biden 15:20 - Source: CNN\n\nExpert: nuclear use in Ukraine still ‘not a probable event’\n\nMost experts and strategists estimate that there are many reasons why Putin would stop short of using a nuclear weapon – among them the possible risk of radioactive fallout crossing into Russia or the fact that the use of a tactical nuclear weapon may not actually be a sensible strategic option in the war.\n\nBut the fact he’s pushed himself into a corner, along with his obliviousness to civilian loss of life underscored again by his callous assaults on Ukrainian cities this week, suggests that a humanitarian impulse is unlikely to be part of his calculation. And Biden himself said in the interview that while he believed Putin was a “rational actor,” he had made significant miscalculations and his objectives were not rational. That leaves open the possibility of even more decisions that appear irrational to the West but may seem reasonable in Putin’s warped logic.\n\nThat is why Biden and experts who have dedicated their careers to staving off a nuclear apocalypse say the possibility that Putin may go nuclear must be taken so seriously – even if the chances remain very low and the US would likely be able to detect well ahead of time if Russia’s atomic devices were on the move.\n\n“It’s not a probable event. It’s not even likely,” said Joseph Cirincione, a nuclear non-proliferation expert and former president of the Plowshares Fund, said on CNN’s “Newsroom” on Tuesday.\n\n“But this is a low probability, high consequence event. If he uses even one nuclear weapon, he’s bringing us into a whole new world. He’s causing massive damage. And he’s running the risk of escalation with exchanges from the West that could lead to further exchanges, et cetera.”\n\nCirincione explained that even if Putin’s saber rattling represented a political threat designed to scare the West, it cannot be discounted.\n\n“He has the means. He has the doctrine that allows him to use it. And he has the motive. He is losing this war. He has to do something to try to turn the tide of battle in desperation. He might turn to a nuclear weapon.”\n\nWhile some critics have faulted the President for mentioning words like “Armageddon” and comparing his rhetoric to that of Putin, the motivations of the two men are very different. At a minimum, the Russian leader is boasting about nuclear weapons to scare the world. Biden is speaking publicly to stave off the possibility of disaster.\n\nBiden doesn’t rule out meeting Putin over basketball star\n\nOne reason the war in Ukraine is so dangerous is that nearly eight months in, there remains no prospect of any genuine diplomatic process that could defuse it. Ukraine’s forces, using US and allied weapons systems, are making remarkable progress on the battlefield and are determined to repel an unprovoked invasion that has caused carnage and extensive destruction. Putin has thrown so much personal prestige and Russian blood into the war he can hardly afford any outcome he cannot spin as a win, despite his autocratic grip on Russia.\n\nBiden signaled in the Tapper interview that he saw no real rationale to meet Putin when both leaders are expected to be at the G20 summit in Indonesia next month. But he did leave one intriguing door open to the Russian leader, saying he’d sit down with Putin if he were willing to discuss the fate of US basketball star Brittney Griner, who was sentenced in August to nine years in prison after pleading guilty to drugs smuggling. The US says Griner and another American, former US Marine Paul Whelan, have been wrongfully detained. Washington has offered to swap jailed Russian arms trafficker Viktor Bout for the two Americans.\n\n“Look, I have no intention of meeting with him, but look, if he came to me at the G20 and said, ‘I want to talk about the release of Griner,’ I would meet with him, but that would depend,” Biden said.\n\nThe President also downplayed the idea that more generally there was anything to talk about.\n\n“He’s acted brutally, I think he’s committed war crimes, and so I don’t… see any rationale to meet with him now.”", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/middleeast/mideast-summary-03-16-2022-intl/index.html", "title": "How the Ukraine war revealed Europe's selective empathy on ...", "text": "Abu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nThe West has shown unprecedented coordination and unity in its response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Governments, corporations and individuals have come together to sanction and boycott Moscow, and Europe has opened its doors to a flood of refugees.\n\nAmid this outpouring of empathy, however, stark contrasts have arisen in the way Europe has dealt with Ukrainian refugees over those coming from conflicts in the global south.\n\nUkraine’s refugee crisis is dire. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), more than 3 million people have fled the country since Russia’s invasion. To put that in context, it took six months for one million refugees to leave Syria in 2013, nearly two years after that country’s civil war began.\n\nThe two wars occurred at different times and on different continents, but unlike the Syrians fleeing conflict, Ukrainians are finding a much warmer welcome in Europe.\n\n“It’s extraordinary to see the comparative ease with which they’re being taken in by pretty much every European government, and how their plight against Russian aggression is resulting in overwhelming solidarity,” said H. A. Hellyer, a scholar at the Washington, DC-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nMartin Griffiths, the United Nations’ Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour this week that there is a “shocking different set of priorities for people,” but added that it’s not uncommon for neighboring countries to absorb a large number of refugees, citing Syrians in Turkey and Afghans in Pakistan as examples.\n\nDenmark is known for having some of Europe’s strictest anti-immigration policies. The government has welcomed Ukrainian refugees with open arms and, while saying all refugees are treated the same, it is urging some Syrian refugees living there to return home, despite the ongoing conflict in their country.\n\nThe world has largely come together against Russia's invasion of #Ukraine - but there was another, arguably more important, sense of unity missing from the discourse. I take a closer look at the global reaction to refugees, featuring my colleague's @arwacnn thoughts. pic.twitter.com/FeA6j6JT1z — Becky Anderson (@BeckyCNN) March 14, 2022\n\nSuch examples are plenty across Europe.\n\nIn France, far-right presidential contender Eric Zemmour told BFM TV on March 8 that it would be acceptable to have different rules for refugees coming from Europe and those from Arab Muslim countries.\n\n“Everyone knows that Arab or Muslim immigration is too distant from us and it’s more difficult to acculturate and assimilate them. So effectively, we are closer to European Christians,” he said.\n\nA few days after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when Bulgaria’s Prime Minister Kiril Petkov was asked about the possibility of accepting refugees, he said no European country was afraid of the migration wave that is about to come.\n\n“These are people who are Europeans, so we and all other countries are ready to welcome them,” he said. “In other words, this is not the refugee wave that we are used to, where we don’t know what to do, people with an uncertain past — are they terrorists [or not]?”\n\nThe disparity in the treatment of refugees may be due to Ukraine’s proximity to host countries and the assessment in the West that Russia is threatening Europe’s security through the war, said Hellyer.\n\n“But we cannot underestimate a much more raw and tribal response, and that far too many of us in Europe simply saw refugees when they saw Ukrainians, because they were white and of Christian heritage,” he said.\n\nJudith Sunderland, associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division, told CNN that “empathy and solidarity should stretch to everyone in need, not just the people who may look and pray like us.”\n\n“Europe is doing the right thing this time, keeping its borders open to everyone, and moving quickly to grant temporary protection to Ukrainians, sending very strong messages of empathy and solidarity,” she said. “But this stands in stark contrast to the policies and practices that we continue to see with respect to migrants and refugees from other parts of the world, most of them brown and black.”\n\nAccording to a 2021 UN report – out of the nearly 7 million Syrians forced to flee their country, about 1 million live in Europe, with 70% of them hosted by two countries: Germany and Sweden.\n\nIn 2018, at the height of Europe’s migrant crisis, Central European countries decided to skip an EU summit on migration, with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban saying the issue would become a “pan-European frenzy.” The countries had earlier rejected proposals from other European nations to allow a certain number of refugees into their countries. Now, Central European countries like Hungary and Slovakia are taking in hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees.\n\n“For a continent that tries to pride itself on the superiority of pluralism over bigotry, following the awful experiences of the Holocaust, of the Bosnian genocide, and civil rights struggles across the continent and the West more generally,” said Hellyer, “it’s a sad reminder that far too many of us continue to be immensely tribal and racist.”\n\nThree million refugees have been offered unconditional asylum and protection in neighboring countries across the European Union, the UNHCR said in a statement to CNN. “Our hope is that the same solidarity, compassion and support can be extended to the 84 million other people forced to flee around the world.”\n\nWith additional reporting from Nadeen Ebrahim, CNN\n\nOther top Middle East news\n\nTwo British nationals released after being held for years by Iran\n\nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian charity worker who has been held in Iran for almost six years, has been released and is en route back to the UK. Fellow British-Iranian national Anoosheh Ashoori was also released.\n\nBackground: Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in 2016 and accused of plotting to overthrow Iran’s government (claims she denied). Ashoori was arrested in 2017 on charges of spying for Israel (which he denied).\n\nWhy it matters: Tehran says Britain owes it money that Iran’s former regime paid for tanks and other vehicles which were never delivered after the Islamic Revolution of 1979. While the British and Iranian governments have said there is no connection between the debt and the case of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Iranian state media in 2021 reported unidentified Iranian officials saying she would be freed once the debt was paid, according to Reuters.\n\nBritish Prime Minister visits Abu Dhabi to seek additional oil flows\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday as part of efforts to secure additional oil flows and increase pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin over Ukraine. He flew to Saudi Arabia later in the day.\n\nBackground: The world is facing spiraling energy prices and Western leaders are keen to encourage producers to increase output and secure other supplies to try to help consumers and reduce reliance on Russian exports.\n\nWhy it matters: The visit comes after the Biden administration failed to convince the UAE and Saudi Arabia to ramp up oil production amid rising oil prices on the Ukraine invasion. Johnson has said that the West had made a mistake in allowing itself to become dependent on Russian oil and gas.\n\nUS says Iran deal won’t be an “escape hatch” for Russia to evade sanctions\n\nThe State Department said on Tuesday that striking an agreement that would allow Iran to re-enter the nuclear deal would not become an “escape hatch” for the Kremlin to avoid the sanctions that have hit Russia since it attacked Ukraine last month.\n\nBackground: The Iran nuclear talks in Vienna were paused last week after Russia said that it wanted written guarantees that sanctions over its attack on Ukraine would not impact its future dealings with Tehran. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that Moscow has written guarantees it can carry out its work as a party to the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nWhy it matters: Lavrov’s comments appeared to signal Moscow may have backed off its previous view that Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine were an impediment to salvaging the nuclear deal. Oil prices fell more than 6%.\n\nAround the region\n\nEslam El Ashery has been driving around Ukraine to help people evacuate. Courtesy Eslam El Ashery\n\nAn aspiring dentist from Egypt has become a savior for Arab families stranded in Ukraine thanks to social media.\n\nTwenty-seven-year-old Eslam El Ashery said he was studying to become a dentist in Kyiv while working as a tourist guide for Arabic speaking visitors. He had been in the country just two years when Russia’s bombs started falling in late February.\n\nLike most foreigners, he packed his bags and decided to leave for Poland to return home to Cairo. But on his way, he came across an appeal for help on social media from a stranded Iraqi family. The woman and her four children were stuck in Bila Tserkav, south of Kyiv, without money or a mode of transportation. El Ashery took a detour to get them, he told CNN.\n\nBut soon after, more appeals started streaming in and he found himself adding more rescues to his agenda before his final departure. By Tuesday, he said he had helped around 20 individuals escape the country. Mostly were from mixed Arab-Ukranian families. When he ran out of money for fuel, his parents sent him some.\n\nAbdullah Alsaab, a 29-year-old Saudi sales manager working in Kyiv, had been stuck in the capital for 10 days before social media users put him in touch with Ashery, who began driving from Lviv to take him to the border.\n\nAlsaab eventually found another group that took him out through Romania, but he said he was grateful to Ashery’s determination to help.\n\n“He didn’t ask for money,” Alsaab told CNN, referring to El Ashery. “He was doing it for [a good cause].”\n\nNow El Ashery has one final mission to help an Egyptian man taking shelter with a Ukranian family in Kyiv. Then, he plans to go home, he said.\n\nEgypt’s migration minister Nabila Makram congratulated Ashery on his bravery, said the state-owned news outlet Al Watan, adding that his actions are the result of “the humanity that drives us everywhere.”\n\nBy Nadeen Ebrahim, CNN\n\nPhoto of the day\n\nSyrians in the city of Idlib take part in a protest against the Syrian regime on March 14 to mark the 11th anniversary of the Syrian uprising.

Marine rescuers were called to the site on the Outer Hebridean island at about 7am, but soon discovered that only 15 animals were still alive. One whale was successfully refloated, but the rest were euthanised.\n\nThis was “the most lethal mass stranding of whales in living memory” in Scotland, said The Herald, and the highest number of deaths following a mass stranding of animals in the UK for at least 70 years, according to BBC News.\n\nFinding out the cause would be a “monumental task”, veterinary pathologist Andrew Brownlow told BBC Radio’s “Good Morning Scotland” programme.\n\nWhale strandings are on the rise in the UK, said CNN, but experts “are still looking for a reason behind the increase”.\n\n‘Strong social bonds’\n\nPilot whale strandings “have happened for centuries”, said Brownlow, “not necessarily” due to human impact.\n\nThe species is “notorious for their strong social bonds”, the British Divers Marine Life Rescue charity said in a statement. The current theory is that the whole pod followed a female who was giving birth. One of the dead whales “appeared to have a vaginal prolapse” and a very young calf was found. A similar case in 2015, which left 21 pilot whales trapped on a beach in Skye, was believed to have been caused by a female calving. She died, alongside two others, but the rest survived.\n\nThere are about 2,000 strandings each year worldwide, with most resulting in the death of the animal, said the Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida. The beaching of one animal is usually due to sickness or injury. “Bad weather, old age, navigation errors, and hunting too close to shore” can also contribute.\n\nBut all the reasons “involve the animals being disturbed”, the Scottish Marine Animal Stranding Scheme said. That could be a predator, unfamiliar surroundings that confuse navigation, earthquakes or “anthropogenic disturbances”. The team will examine the animals to rule out human factors.\n\n‘Sonar testing’\n\nSome scientists believe that sonar used by the military to detect submarines, and other underwater noises, may contribute to beachings, as animals try to escape the sound or panic and surface too quickly. “Mass beachings of beaked whales almost exclusively occur alongside sonar testing,” said the Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida.\n\nScotland’s previous largest stranding was in 2011, when 19 out of a pod of 70 whales died at the Kyle of Durness in Sutherland. A government report blamed the noise of four large underwater bombs detonated by the Royal Navy, said The Telegraph, which could have damaged the whales' hearing and navigation skills.\n\nMass strandings could be “an indicator that a population is bouncing back”, said Louise Allan, the Natural History Museum’s cetacean strandings support officer. The increasingly regular strandings of humpbacks along the UK coastline since 2001 could be because numbers are recovering since the 1982 ban on commercial whaling.\n\n“Trends can reflect increased population sizes,” Peter Evans, director of Sea Watch Foundation, told CNN, “or simply improved reporting.”", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2023/07/18"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961718/quiz-of-the-week-15-july-21-july", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 15 July - 21 July | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday, it was pretty easy to read between the lines of the Wyoming Republican’s answers.\n\n“I am working hard here in Wyoming to earn every vote,” Cheney said at one point. “But I will also say this. I’m not going to lie. I’m not going to say things that aren’t true about the election. My opponents are doing that, certainly simply for the purpose of getting elected.\n\n“If I have to choose between maintaining a seat in the House of Representatives or protecting the constitutional republic and ensuring the American people know the truth about Donald Trump, I’m going to choose the Constitution and the truth every single day,” she said at another.\n\nAsked by Tapper whether her service as vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6 will have been worth it even if she loses next month, Cheney responded that it was “the single most important thing I have ever done professionally.”\n\nIf it sounds to you like Cheney is framing her August 16 primary for Wyoming’s at-large House seat as a sort of fait accompli, and as not the end of the story but as a part of a broader narrative, well, then, you are right.\n\nThe simple fact is that Cheney is very unlikely to beat Harriet Hageman in next month’s primary. Hageman has the support of former President Donald Trump, as well as a number of top Republicans including, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nWhile Cheney has tried to recruit Democrats to cross party lines and support her – and some undoubtedly will – it’s hard to see that making a real difference in the outcome of the race in such an overwhelmingly Republican state.\n\nSimply put: Cheney looks likely to lose – and she knows it.\n\nWhat she also knows is that, at least in her mind, this isn’t the end of her political career.\n\nHere’s how Cheney answered a question from Tapper on whether she is interested in running for president in 2024:\n\n“I haven’t really – at this point, I have not made a decision about 2024. …\n\n“… But I do think, as we look towards the next presidential election, as I said, I believe that our nation stands on the edge of an abyss. And I do believe that we all have to really think very seriously about the dangers we face and the threats we face. And we have to elect serious candidates.”\n\nWhich tells you everything you need to know about Cheney and 2024. She isn’t an announced candidate. But when you hear a politician talking about the country “standing on the edge of an abyss” and the need to elect “serious candidates,” well, it doesn’t take an astrophysicist to figure out what’s going on there.\n\nThe real question seems to be then not whether Cheney runs – she sounded to all the world like that decision is mostly made – but rather whether she would have any sort of impact on the 2024 race.\n\nIf Cheney runs as a Republican, it will, undoubtedly, be a very tough road for her.\n\nTrump is the clear frontrunner in all polling conducted on the Republican presidential primary and seems very likely to run. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is widely seen as the only serious alternative to Trump at the moment – and he has positioned himself as a representative of Trumpism without Trump.\n\nThere is no potential candidate garnering any serious support in hypothetical 2024 primary polls who is running expressly against Trump and his four years in office. The Republicans, aside from Cheney, who are signaling an interest in running that sort of campaign – Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan being perhaps the most prominent – barely register in polls.\n\nCould Cheney somehow coalesce the anti-Trump vote within the Republican Party? Sure. But even if she was to do so, there’s scant evidence that bloc of voters comprise anything close to a majority of likely Republican primary voters.\n\nThe other – and perhaps more plausible – path for Cheney is to run as an independent in 2024. Assuming Trump is the Republican nominee, such a candidacy could skim off enough votes to potentially hamstring the former President’s chances of winning. (Presumably Cheney, who is conservative on most issues, would appeal more to Republicans than Democrats.)\n\nEven under that scenario, however, Cheney would function as a spoiler – trying to keep Trump from the White House – rather than as a viable candidate to be president. Which, given what she told Tapper Sunday, might be enough for her.\n\n“I’m fighting hard, no matter what happens on August 16, I’m going to wake up on August 17 and continue to fight hard to ensure Donald Trump is never anywhere close to the Oval Office ever again,” said Cheney.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/07/25"}]}

She beat Mozammel Hossain, a barrister “with virtually no frontline political experience”, in the two-person race after entrepreneur Daniel Korski dropped out “after allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards a woman, which he denied”, said the paper.\n\nHaving previously written “I am the one [Sadiq Khan] fears” in an article for Conservative Home, Hall will vie to become mayor when Londoners vote next May.\n\nWho is Susan Hall?\n\nHall is from Harrow, in northwest London, where she “owns a hair salon and raised her family”, said Sky News. She “originally wanted to be a mechanic” and worked at her father’s garage after finishing school but “struggled to get into technical college as a woman”.\n\nHer political career began when she was elected to Harrow Council in 2006, and she became its leader in 2013-14. Hall is “no stranger to City Hall”, having been a member of the London Assembly since 2017, replacing Kemi Badenoch after she was elected to Parliament.\n\nShe became deputy leader of the London Assembly Conservatives in 2018 and then its leader in 2019 – serving in this role until 2023.\n\nWhat are her politics and policies?\n\nLabour “immediately sought to portray Hall as ‘a hard-right politician’” who is “out of touch with our city and its values”, in light of her support for the likes of Johnson and Trump, said The Guardian. Hall is a “low-tax Tory” who offered “vehement support” to Liz Truss and her “short-lived government”.\n\nOften an “outspoken character”, Hall argued that the storming of the US Capitol by Trump supporters was the “equivalent of UK politicians who opposed Brexit”. This led to criticism from Conservative Party leadership at the time.\n\nHer political slogan is “Safer with Susan”, and her list of priorities include “tackling crime, the housing crisis and Ulez”, Sky News added.\n\nShe has also promised to address the housing crisis by “building a lot more homes in the right places” and will scrap the ultra-low emissions zone (Ulez) “on day one”. She has previously argued that Ulez expansion, due to come into operation on 29 August, will “devastate families and small businesses”. She has also vowed to “lift 20mph speed limits on main roads” in central London, said the Evening Standard.\n\nOn crime, Hall has pledged to “hunt down and lock up muggers and burglars” by creating a special team within the Met Police, Sky News said. As her “main focus”, according to Evening Standard, she would return the Met to “a borough-based structure” and reintroduce borough commanders. She would also make stop and search “less intrusive” by giving frontline officers a “hand-held knife wand” to help them detect weapons.\n\nCan Hall beat Sadiq Khan?\n\nHall is “likely to be seen as an outsider” in the race to become the mayor of London, said The Guardian, with her views on cultural issues also “problematic” in a liberal-leaning city.\n\nShe backed the home secretary, Suella Braverman, when she described small boat crossings as an “invasion”. Last year she was criticised for saying “the black community has ‘problems with crime’” and previously described police officers “taking the knee as ‘embarrassing’”, said Sky News.\n\nNevertheless, “Labour will face the obstacles of incumbency in seeking a third term”, and Hall thinks “I can beat him” and “sort out the mess he has left us”, as she wrote for Conservative Home. Hall “knows City Hall inside out” and has “spent decades knocking on doors, in the pouring rain, listening and talking to residents”.\n\nShe has described Khan as “beatable” and pointed out “he is underperforming Labour in London by a double digit margin”, suggesting “even the most loyal Labour supporters are sick of him”.", "authors": ["Keumars Afifi-Sabet"], "publish_date": "2023/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961718/quiz-of-the-week-15-july-21-july", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 15 July - 21 July | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Protesters plan to continue their campaign until their demands are met, meaning they could go on “significantly longer than the planned two weeks”.\n\nThe group has “thrown its weight behind a new, immediate demand”, Left Foot Forward added , namely that the government “stops all fossil fuel investment immediately”.\n\nThe protest is the beginning of a “new wave of civil disobedience across the UK” from Extinction Rebellion (XR), The Independent said, with the group claiming that the City of London remains an “arch financier” of global carbon emissions. The protests seek to highlight the “considerable” contribution of the UK’s financial sector to the climate crisis, and “aims to draw attention to the government’s role in supporting polluting industries”.\n\nThe protest followed the publication of a major review by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that said the climate crisis was \"unequivocally\" driven by human activity such as burning fossil fuels. It comes just months before the UK hosts the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.\n\nPolice had been “blindsided” when the activists converged on Trafalgar Square on Monday morning, said the paper. And the group’s tactics “further outsmarted” officers by driving vans down two streets close to the Long Acre junction, before activists chained themselves together under the vehicles’ wheels.\n\nLondon’s West End was “paralysed for hours” after climate protesters erected a giant pink table on the junction between Long Acre, St Martins Lane and Garrick Street, reported the Daily Mai l . The disruption marked the beginning of a fortnight of protests that the group has dubbed its “impossible rebellion”.\n\nExtinction Rebellion campaigners blocked one of central London’s busiest junctions yesterday in the first of a new wave of planned protests in the capital.\n\nThe group has performed a raft of stunts and protests since it came to prominence three years ago, including a memorable blockade of London’s Oxford Circus in April 2019. Then, protesters glued themselves to a pink boat daubed with the slogan “Tell the truth”, as well as occupying Waterloo Bridge, Marble Arch and areas close to Parliament Square.\n\nDo XR’s tactics work?\n\nMany have questioned the wisdom of XR’s tactics since it began campaigning in earnest in 2018, but the group enjoys significant public recognition.\n\nAccording to YouGov, it is in the top 100 most famous UK charities and organisations, with 73% of the British public telling the pollster that they have heard of the group. Its popularity, however, is low, with just 19% of the public saying they approve of the group, while 19% say they feel neutral, and 35% disapprove.\n\nA common criticism of XR has been that its tactics, usually acts of mass civil disobedience, are alienating to the British public at large.\n\n“Acts of civil disobedience such as occupying bridges, guerrilla gardening and protest puppetry may appeal to seasoned activists, but are a turnoff for thousands of potential supporters who might walk past such occupations,” wrote Andre Spicer in The Guardian after XR’s occupation of central London in 2019.\n\nAnd it is “not only XR’s tactics that undermine their cause, but a powerful and underrated force we might call tribal distaste,” said Clare Foges in The Times this week.\n\n“When passing one of XR’s flag-festooned protests, middle England wrinkles its nose. It rages at the inconvenience caused, but also recoils from the tie-dyed trousers and tattoos, the piercings and Citizen Smith ramblings, the lexicon of “Empire 2.0” and “climate justice”, the dreadlocks, didgeridoos and drums.”\n\n“In short, if you recoil from the messengers, the message is dead on arrival,” she argued. “This is a huge shame, because middle Englanders like me are finally undergoing an awakening to the urgency of this challenge.”\n\n“But judging Extinction Rebellion by how well-liked they are is to miss the point,” argued Luke Tryl in The Independent. Indeed, the question of whether it is better to be well-liked or well-known “depends on what you’re trying to achieve”.\n\nEvery time the activists cause disruption, they “certainly attract scorn, but they also raise awareness of the climate crisis and get people talking about issues like net-zero targets in a way that no other campaign has been able to match.\n\n“Ultimately, it doesn’t matter if you like Extinction Rebellion because that doesn’t affect how you feel about their issue,” said Tryl.\n\nExtinction Rebellion certainly does not “aim to win a popularity contest,” wrote XR activist Marilyn Spurr in a letter to the New Statesman, “it aims to be effective.”\n\nShe continued: “Many of its activists have spent years signing petitions, writing to politicians, engaging in wildlife projects and going on authorised marches. This has laid the groundwork for our protests.”\n\nBut disputes over the group’s tactics aren’t limited to outside observers. XR’s main internal disputes have been over tactics, said The Economist.\n\nIn recent months, softer wings of the organisation seeking to work more closely with politicians have been sidelined, while more influence has been given over to those wanting to promote “riskier actions” – such as glueing teenagers to tube trains. Some XR activists believed this “would provoke a heavy-handed response from the state, and thus public sympathy”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2021/08/24"}]}

A look ...", "text": "Despite the images of flames and public evacuations after train cars derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, late Friday, railway incidents requiring nearby residents to flee possible explosions or potentially toxic fumes are rare, a USA TODAY analysis of federal government data found.\n\nTechnological improvements to the railcars crisscrossing the nation's tracks to ensure better crashworthiness and temperature regulation, retiring old cars, and a decline in crude oil transport since their peak in 2015 have made railcars less likely to leak or spill hazardous materials, experts told USA TODAY.\n\nYet when wrecks do occur, they may serve as difficult reality checks for the many Americans who live near railroad tracks moving massive amounts of freight, including potentially toxic chemicals, each year. In East Palestine, residents were only allowed to return home after days of evacuation, sometimes under threat of arrest, due to safety concerns around toxic chemical release.\n\nUSA TODAY found that although catastrophic events involving trains and chemicals may be uncommon, hazmat cargo violations caught during inspections of rail shippers and operators appear to be climbing. Over the last five years, federal inspectors have flagged 36% more hazmat violations compared with the five years prior – and fines for those are up 16%.\n\nOne reason for the increase, however, may simply be improved accountability by agency inspectors. A 2016 audit by the Department of Transportation's Inspector General's Office found that inspectors were issuing lax penalties for violators of hazmat cargo regulations and failing to refer bad actors for possible criminal prosecution despite agency requirements.\n\nIn Ohio, 20 railcars out of the 100-car train operated by Norfolk Southern Railway were carrying cargo labeled as hazardous materials when it derailed near the Pennsylvania state line and burst into flames. As many as 2,000 people – a significant swath of the 5,000-person rural town along the northeastern Ohio and Pennsylvania border – evacuated from their homes for days after worries that unstable vinyl chloride in five derailed cars could explode, disbursing toxic fumes and shrapnel as far as a mile away.\n\nEnvironmental officials deployed air and water quality monitors to ensure those chemicals – associated with an increased risk of cancer – weren't being released into the community's air.\n\nPreliminary indications are that a mechanical problem with a rail car axle may have caused the crash, but the investigation is ongoing, National Transportation Safety Board officials said.\n\nWhat is vinyl chloride? Toxic gases connected to Ohio train derailment cause concern\n\nEast Palestine residents and a business owner filed a federal class-action lawsuit Tuesday, alleging the derailment was caused by the railway company's negligence in operating the train, defects in their track system or in one or more of their cars – resulting in the exposure of hundreds of people to \"toxic chemicals, fumes, and carcinogens\" and evacuation orders, court records show.\n\nNorfolk Southern declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nNot only was Friday's incident relatively rare, so too are deaths from incidents involving hazmat cargo rail cars. The last reported death from a hazardous material on a train was in 2011. A railcar loader in Kentucky was \"splashed with 95% sulfuric acid while finishing the final stages of the pressure check before releasing the tank car into transport,\" according to an incident report filed with the Transportation Department.\n\nBut the consequences may still be widespread due to the sheer amount of cargo involved. Hazardous materials have leaked into waterways or caused other kinds of environmental damage. Clean-up often requires specialized training and can be costly.\n\nAuthorities said environmental agencies monitoring air and water quality in East Palestine have not detected anything concerning. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice sounded an alarm about water safety in the Ohio River, though the water ultimately tested safe.\n\nWhy ensuring hazmat train safety can be especially difficult\n\nThe United States has about 140,000 miles of railroad for freight cars, which are owned and maintained by private organizations. Each year, nearly a billion tons of hazardous materials are shipped by rail, according to the American Chemistry Council.\n\nHazardous materials, or \"hazmat,\" are defined by the federal government as \"substances or chemicals that pose a health hazard, a physical hazard, or harm to the environment,\" such as unrefined oil, liquid natural gas and industrial manufacturing chemicals.\n\nThese hazmat railcars are are required to meet additional safety regulations to ensure they can carry chemicals across the country without incident.\n\nThe rules for transporting materials depend on each substance and how dangerous it is. The Federal Railroad Administration describes railroads as \"the safest method\" for moving large amounts of chemicals long distances, yet most hazardous materials are transported by trucks on U.S. highways.\n\nThe Association of American Railroads, an industry trade group, noted in an emailed statement to USA TODAY that 99.9% of all hazmat shipments reach their destination without incident and that the hazmat accident rate has declined 55% since 2012.\n\nHow frequently do trains leak or spill hazardous materials? Not very.\n\nIn the last decade, hazardous materials have spilled or leaked from trains more than 5,000 times in the United States, according to a USA TODAY analysis of federal incident reports. However, other forms of transit notched far more spills. For every rail leak reported last year, there were two involving planes and 67 on highways. The federal reports show the number of incidents involving trains has been declining.\n\nStill, in 2022 alone, rail operators reported 337 hazardous material leaks or spills, only 32 of which were classified as \"serious.\" Only six were reported to have caused an injury.\n\nCrashes are less common than leaks but can have more serious consequences. Railroad derailments counted for 1 in 10 hazmat wrecks in the last decade – and 1 in 4 of those incidents last year, USA TODAY found.\n\nIn the Ohio derailment, the cars carrying the chemical were pressurized and had thermal protection, according to an email from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Such additions are safety measures that provide hazmat cargo with extra protection from flames in case of an accident.\n\nMore:Residents question next steps after train derailment\n\nTrains derail rarely, but can be very costly and dangerous\n\nThe most common reasons trains spill hazmat cargo are equipment failure, like broken valves, or human error such as improperly preparing cargo. Hazardous materials were released in 172 train derailments over the last decade, or roughly 17 each year. But when derailments involve hazardous cargo, the sheer size and amount of materials being transported can make wrecks dangerous and costly.\n\nLast year's 18 derailments involving hazmat cargo resulted in more than 20 times as much financial damage, or $41.6 million, compared with the $2.1 million total cost in damage caused by roughly 300 leaks of hazardous materials from other causes such as loose valves, USA TODAY found. The cost includes the value of cargo lost, damages to the train, tracks and nearby property, and the cost of emergency and clean-up response.\n\nDespite the plumes of black smoke overhead East Palestine, nearby residents and businesses are typically unaffected by hazmat incidents even when there is a serious wreck. Over the last decade, homes or businesses near a hazmat derailment were evacuated at least 24 times, or only once every seven wrecks, USA TODAY found.\n\nHave trains carrying hazmat leaked or spilled near you?\n\nUSA TODAY used federal data from incident reports since 2013 to build this searchable table readers can use to look up how often trains near them have leaked or spilled hazmat cargo.\n\nIf you don't see a search window below, you can find it here.\n\nAgency inspectors dinged for past hazmat cargo accountability\n\nA 2016 audit by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Inspector General found that the agency's inspectors lightly fined shippers and operators for violating hazmat cargo safety regulations and failed to refer cases for criminal prosecution despite agency requirements.\n\nBut an administration spokesman, Warren Flatau, told USA TODAY that the report's recommendations were \"satisfactorily closed\" by the agency and it had since taken steps to remedy all the issues identified. In an emailed statement, the Inspector General's Office confirmed that the Federal Railroad Administration took \"sufficient action to address each of the recommendations we made in our report and we therefore consider those recommendations closed.\"\n\nUSA TODAY's analysis of available public data bears this out to some degree. It found that agency inspectors flagged more violations and on average fined higher amounts annually in the years after the audit.\n\nUSA TODAY found that federal regulators collected an average of $16.5 million in civil penalties annually from railroad shippers and operators, including about $4.5 million for violating hazmat rules, since 2017. In the five years prior, they collected an average of $12.1 million in penalties annually, including $3.9 million for hazmat violations.\n\nThe Inspector General's Office noted that the closed actions included a recommendation that the agency amend its policy and procedures to require all staff to report any \"suspected criminal violations and instances of fraud, waste, and abuse\" to it directly.\n\nAn Inspector General's Office representative declined to provide details on the number of criminal referrals forwarded to it, urging USA TODAY to ask the Federal Railroad Administration for such details. Flatau said the agency doesn't track such referrals because of the change in policy having all staff reach out directly to the Inspector General's Office directly. But he said the agency does not have the ability to arrest or prosecute anyone.\n\nDevorah Ancel, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club Environmental Law Program, noted that the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration adopted new safety rules for hazmat transport by rail several years ago.\n\nThe revised regulations included measures like improved railcar design, which were \"far better from the arcane regulations that had been on the books for decades that did not contemplate movement of highly flammable and explosive materials that are in transit on our rail lines today,\" Ancel said in an email.\n\nShe added: \"Those regulations, however, left some improvements on the table. For example, the agency, in its final rule, chose not to adopt the most stringent of the brake design mechanisms that were proposed at that time.\"\n\nYour life in data: See crucial databases that can help you make everyday decisions", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/10/missing-log-cabin-found/25620667/", "title": "The week's odd news: Washington deputies find cabin that family ...", "text": "Associated Press\n\nSPRINGDALE, Wash. – A log cabin that a family reported stolen off its foundation has been found in rural northeast Washington, authorities say.\n\nStevens County Sheriff Kendle Allen says deputies following a tip found the cabin on the morning of April 9 about 10 miles from its original location.

New owner Laura Aquilina of Loveland says the ultimate goal is to give Brutus the gift of being a dog.\n\nFelix Deurr, an orthopedics professor at Colorado State University who focuses on small animals, says such prosthetics have been developed only in the past 15 years. A study on their effectiveness is due out later this year.\n\nA good Samaritan noticed Brutus’ injuries when he was offered for adoption in a store parking lot in Canon City.

Although a woman’s name usually comes first in an engagement announcement, they decided to flip their names.\n\nA Burger King spokesman says the company felt an overwhelming urge to help the happy couple celebrate their upcoming marriage.\n\nThe Burger-King nuptials will be held July 17 in nearby Jacksonville.\n\nPolice: Des Moines man reports stolen bag of dog poop\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa – Someone who attempted to steal a truck parked outside a Des Moines home instead took a bag of dog poop, police say.\n\nThe Des Moines Police Department responded to a report of an attempted burglary around 4:45 p.m. April 8. Upon arrival, a man told police someone broke into the driver’s side door of his truck sometime last month.\n\nAccording to a police report, the person who tried to steal the truck checked the bed of the vehicle and grabbed what turned out to be “a bag of dog feces.”\n\nPolice say they haven’t identified any suspects in the crime, but that he or she could face third-degree burglary charges.\n\nThe Des Moines Register reports that the dog poop has been valued at $1.\n\nCat survives shock, 25-foot fall from power pole\n\nGRANTS PASS, Ore. – The owner of a 17-pound Siamese cat named Liam says he has nearly used up his nine lives after getting shocked on a power pole in Grants Pass and falling 25 feet.\n\nJennifer Kagay said she and her husband were lying in bed early April 7 when they heard a “bang” and the power went out.\n\nHer husband, Jeff, went outside and the cat was lying still on the transformer at the top of the pole. They were relieved when Liam started to move, but horrified when he fell 25 feet to the ground. On the way down, he snagged a wire with a claw, then landed softly in some brush.\n\nThe Kagays took him to the vet, where he may have to have one leg amputated.\n\nTSA: Travelers left $13,000 in spare change at Boston airport\n\nBOSTON – Transportation Security Administration workers collected more than $13,000 in spare change left behind by travelers at Boston’s Logan International Airport last year.\n\nThe TSA said in a report this week that the change is often abandoned in those plastic buckets used by passengers for personal belongings before stepping through metal detectors at security checkpoints.\n\nTSA spokesman Ross Feinstein says unclaimed money is documented and turned in to the financial office.\n\nIn 2005, Congress gave the TSA the authority keep the unclaimed change and spend it on security improvements.\n\nNationally, the TSA collected more than $675,000 in loose change in the 2014 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.\n\nNew York’s John F.

A man is seen walking up, grabbing the bird by its legs and dragging the animal away. Nearby residents heard the bird’s screeching.\n\nNeighbors say the flock has roamed the area for more than 20 years.\n\nMassive plant that waited 80 years to flower cut down\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. – An American agave’s job is to flower once and then die.\n\nOne of the plants that called the University of Michigan home for an unexpectedly long 80 years accomplished the former last year.\n\nOn April 8, its life came to an end.\n\nMike Palmer, the horticulture manager at the university’s Matthaei Botanical Gardens, used a hand saw to bring down the agave’s 20-plus-foot-tall stalk.\n\n“It was time,” Palmer said after he and some workers carried the fallen stalk away, leaving a stump where it once stood. It’s sad. Many people have said to me though they enjoyed the whole flowering that they were anticipating the sadness of its final days.”\n\nStill, “the agave lives on,” said Palmer, who added new plants will be grown from its seedlings and eventually sold. Plus, university music professor Michael Gould plans to make a flute from the stalk.\n\nOnce the new instrument is created, Gould and a colleague who plays the shakuhachi, or Japanese bamboo flute, plan to perform a concert at the botanical gardens “to give the plant a life again.\n\n“There are instruments that are hundreds and hundreds of years old, so the agave can live on,” Gould said.\n\nAnd a couple getting married this weekend at the botanical gardens have requested a seedling so they can use it as part of their wedding ceremony.\n\nThe agave had called Ann Arbor home since 1934. It grew to 28 feet after a rapid growth spurt in the spring of 2014 that preceded its flowering, which ended later in the year. The agave then went into rapid decline, which is normal for the species, Palmer said.\n\nAlthough it is known as the century plant, the American agave typically lives up to 30 to 35 years. Palmer, who cared for the plant during the past 15 years, said he doesn’t know why it took this agave so long to bloom.\n\nRegardless, “it was time to take it down. It was the natural process for the agave to die after it flowers and sets seeds,” he said.\n\n“We have seedlings now, so they will create the circle of life.”\n\nPuppy rescued after falling 50 feet into old well casing\n\nFRESNO, Calif. – A puppy in California apparently is doing OK after he fell about 50 feet down an old well casing and was rescued by firefighters.\n\nFresno Fire Department spokesman Pete Martinez says the puppy dropped into the uncovered metal pipe April 7 in a Fresno garage. The pipe was about 8 inches in diameter.\n\nThe Fresno Bee reports that it took firefighters about an hour to recover the dog named Timmy, which appeared to be a shepherd mix and only a few months old.\n\nThey lowered a knotted rope into the hole, looped it around the puppy’s legs and torso, and pulled him to safety.\n\nThe newspaper reports Timmy was unharmed.\n\nMartinez says the puppy likely was stuck in the hole for a few hours before his family heard him crying.\n\nThe pipe has since been covered.\n\n— Compiled by Paul H.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/03/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-thursday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "One million refugees flee Ukraine as Russia escalates ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nRussia’s relentless bombardment of residential areas across Ukraine has so far forced more than one million refugees to flee the country in just seven days, according to the United Nations, as fierce fighting continues into its second week.\n\nFilippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said in a statement Thursday: “I have worked in refugee emergencies for almost 40 years, and rarely have I seen an exodus as rapid as this one.”\n\nBy comparison, it took three months for one million refugees to leave Syria in 2013 when departures there were at their height, according to the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency.\n\nHalf a million of the refugees are children, according to UNICEF, which warned Europe could be facing its largest refugee crises since World War II.\n\nMillions more people are likely to be forced to flee Ukraine, Grandi said. He added: “International solidarity has been heartwarming. But nothing – nothing – can replace the need for the guns to be silenced; for dialogue and diplomacy to succeed. Peace is the only way to halt this tragedy.”\n\nIn Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, residents were awoken in the early hours of Thursday by at least one large explosion in the southwest of the city, following a day of heavy shelling. To the south, the mayor of the strategically important city of Kherson on the Black Sea indicated that Russian forces had seized control, though claims remain disputed. And in the port city of Mariupol, home to roughly 400,000, residents are without electricity and water, according to local officials, as Russian troops step up their offensive.\n\nA woman sits in a tent as people take shelter in the Dorohozhychi subway station in Kyiv on Wednesday. Chris McGrath/Getty Images\n\nA resident of Kherson, which has about 300,000 inhabitants, described the situation there as a “humanitarian catastrophe,” telling CNN Thursday there had been chaos and panic in the city as residents tried to get basic necessities.\n\nAccording to the local resident, there is a severe lack of food and medicine – particularly insulin – with pharmacies being looted.\n\nThe resident added that there had been a significant amount of looting by Russian troops, and said that Russian soldiers had been seen arresting men.\n\nThe mayor of Kherson, Ihor Kolykhaiev, said Wednesday the Ukrainian military is no longer in the city and that its inhabitants must now carry out the instructions of “armed people who came to the city’s administration” – indicating that the city has now fallen under Russian control.\n\nIn Mariupol, the deputy mayor said on Thursday morning that the southeastern Ukrainian city had faced 26 hours of continued shelling and warned it now faces a humanitarian crisis.\n\n“They are destroying our city with all weapons, from artillery, from airplane bombing, from tactical rockets, from multiple launch rocket systems,” Sergei Orlov told CNN’s “New Day.” “We do not have electricity in the whole city, we do not have water supplies, we do not have sanitary systems, we do not have heating.”\n\nFurther north, Ukrainian resistance in the country’s second biggest city, Kharkiv, continues to hold out, as Russian strikes hit at least three schools and damaged a cathedral and shops on Wednesday, according to videos and photos posted to social media, geolocated and verified by CNN.\n\nIn a broadcast message Thursday, President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed Russian forces, saying: “You are leaving people without food, you are leaving us without medication. You are shelling evacuation routes, there’s no weapon you wouldn’t use against us, against free citizens of Ukraine.”\n\nA man passes an apartment building hit by shelling in Mariupol, Ukraine on Wednesday. Evgeniy Maloletka/AP\n\nMost of those who have fled the country have gone to Poland, to Ukraine’s west, with large numbers also entering Hungary, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia. Dramatic video filmed Wednesday showed crowds of people on a platform at Kharkiv train station queuing to get on a train to Uzhgorod, in the west, carrying their children and pets as they fled an assault on the city.\n\nWorryingly, a “big number” of those crossing into Poland are unaccompanied children, according to Poland’s Ambassador to the UN Krzysztof Szczerski. Many children crossing the border are leaving behind parents – particularly their fathers, who have been called by the Ukrainian government to stay behind and fend off Russian troops, he said.\n\nHumanitarian corridors\n\nOn Thursday, a second round of talks between Russia and Ukraine ended with an agreement on humanitarian corridors for civilians, but Ukraine said there were no breakthroughs beyond that.\n\nSenior Ukrainian official Mykhailo Podoliak said in a tweet: “The second round of negotiations is over. Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved. There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors.”\n\nThe head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, outlined some of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion to Russian media.\n\n“We have thoroughly discussed three points – military, international and humanitarian, and the third one is an issue of a future political regulation of the conflict. Both positions are clear and written down. We managed to agree on some of them, but the key thing that we have reached an agreement on today was a matter of rescuing civilians who found themselves in a military clash zone. Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministries agreed on providing humanitarian corridors for civilians and on a possible temporary ceasefire in areas where evacuation is happening,” Medinsky told journalists.\n\nAnother member of the Russian delegation, Leonid Slutsky, told Russia 24 that both sides have agreed on the third round of talks, which will happen in the “nearest future.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Czech government has declared a 30-day state of emergency from Friday in anticipation of a major influx of people fleeing the conflict.\n\nThe European Union has made the “historic decision” to grant temporary protection to all refugees fleeing the conflict, said the bloc’s Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, on Thursday.\n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme has launched an emergency operation to provide food assistance to people within Ukraine and in neighboring countries following an official request from the Ukrainian government. The organization is calling for $570 million to help refugees fleeing violence amid Russia’s ongoing invasion.\n\nMichelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement Thursday that, in addition to those who had left the country, one million people were displaced internally.\n\nBachelet said: “Thousands of people, including older people, pregnant women, as well as children and people with disabilities, are being forced to gather in underground shelters and subway stations to escape explosions. Many people in situations of vulnerability are separated from families and effectively trapped.”\n\nWith the scale of the humanitarian disaster becoming ever more apparent, the International Criminal Court announced Wednesday it had opened an immediate active investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement Wednesday his office “had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible.”\n\nThe move came as the United States and other Western officials warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be shifting his strategy to further target cities and civilian infrastructure with heavy weapons and potentially “tens of thousands” of troops.\n\nThe Russian government has “strongly” rejected accusations that it has committed war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war, but the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission estimates there have been 750 civilian casualties. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers but there are fears of further casualties as Russian strikes hit built-up areas.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Kingdom said it was “gravely concerned” by “reports of the use of cluster munitions” by Russia during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. And earlier that day, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine.\n\n“We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs – which are banned under the Geneva Convention,” she said. Vacuum bombs, or thermobaric bombs are filled with high-temperature, high-pressure explosives and when detonated suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine, though CNN saw Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, on February 26.\n\nThe Russian advance in the south of Ukraine shows the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east.\n\n“It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea. I mean that is an obvious objective,” NATO’s former Deputy Supreme Allied Commander for Europe Richard Shirreff told CNN.\n\nHe said he feared the push could cause an increase in civilian deaths as cities become ruins.\n\n“I’m afraid to say I don’t think we have seen anything yet in terms of the destruction that’s likely to happen,” Shirreff added.", "authors": ["Helen Regan Paul P.

Texas-based Johnson Brothers Corp. will get the money if it completes work by Jan. 21 on the new Interstate 59/20 overpasses through Birmingham, state officials told news outlets. But the company will have to pay $250,000 a day if the opening is delayed past March 21. State transportation officials said the work is nearly done, and they will work out a schedule for opening the roads after the holidays. The more than $700 million project is replacing elevated highways built more than 45 years ago to accommodate 80,000 vehicles daily through the heart of downtown. Transportation officials said I-59/20 carried more than twice that number of vehicles before it was closed in January and demolished. The shutdown, which forced drivers to travel around the city on surface streets or Interstate 459, affected a more than mile-long section of I-59/20 from Red Mountain Expressway to Interstate 65. The state said it is keeping an eye on safety as contractors complete work that includes smoothing out the driving surface, installing lighting and adding stripes. Plans call for the area beneath the elevated highway to be used for community spaces including a park and an area for food trucks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A project that maintains seismic monitoring stations in Alaska needs more funding to continue fully operating, officials said. Scientists, lawmakers and federal agencies are promoting the permanent installation of the Transportable Array Network, The Anchorage Daily News reported Tuesday. The National Science Foundation project was installed temporarily beginning in 2014. The stations can monitor earthquake activity and track weather, wildfires and volcanoes. The system can also detect North Korean nuclear testing, officials said. Many of the network’s stations in northern and western Alaska are set to be removed over the next two years if funding is not secured to maintain them permanently, officials said. The Alaska Earthquake Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks took more than 43 stations in southeast Alaska in September, officials said. The center operates through an external grant on behalf of the U.S. Geological Survey, but it will need more funds to support the monitoring network for the long term. Permits for the stations will need to be renewed if they stay in the ground, officials said. The Alaska Earthquake Center requested $2.5 million in state funding to help maintain the network, money that would go to the University of Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:A flash flood watch is in effect for parts of southwestern Arizona through Friday morning as another storm rolls off the Pacific, over California and into the 48th State. The heaviest rainfall was expected Thursday afternoon and evening, according to the National Weather Service. The forecast office in Phoenix said light to moderate rain will spread across southern and central Arizona Thursday night, with some lingering showers and maybe a few thunderstorms on Friday. All of this could be great news for skiers and snowboarders. Another round of snow is forecast to hit northern Arizona late Thursday through Saturday morning, according to the National Weather Service office in Flagstaff, where an additional 4 to 8 inches is expected. The storm that rolled through the state over Christmas dumped 11.8 inches of snow on Flagstaff’s airport as of 5 p.m. Wednesday. Arizona Snowbowl reported 47 of its 48 trails served by ski lifts were open as of Christmas Day.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An optometrist group is asking the state Supreme Court to reconsider its Dec. 12 ruling that directed the state to count all the signatures submitted in favor of holding a referendum on a law that would allow optometrists to perform a broader range of surgeries. Secretary of State John Thurston had not counted all the signatures because canvassers didn’t file paperwork required under a law enacted earlier this year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. However, the court ruled the requirements weren’t in effect when the Safe Surgery Arkansas committee submitted its signatures. The law in question, Act 579, would allow optometrists to perform additional procedures that currently only ophthalmologists can. Much of the debate has focused on whether optometrists have the necessary training. The referendum would allow voters in next year’s general election to decide if Act 579 should take effect. Supporters of the referendum believe eye surgery should only be conducted by medical doctors.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLaguna Beach: A sea lion pup was in critical condition but “still feisty” Wednesday after it fell more than 30 feet from a footbridge onto a highway, officials said. The 33-pound pup, now named “Lords-a-Leaping,” was dehydrated and emaciated when it was rescued Monday night in Laguna Beach by staff from the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, The Orange County Register reported. It did not appear to suffer any fractures or internal injuries. Most animals at the center are considered to be in critical condition for at least a week after they arrive, animal care coordinator Wendy Leeds told the Associated Press. “He is up, he is eating and he is still feisty,” Leeds said. The animal crawled up to the footbridge and jumped onto the shoulder of the highway before staff from Pacific Marine Mammal Center arrived. It was unclear what prompted the pup to head to the footbridge.\n\nColorado\n\nBreckenridge: The town of Breckenridge canceled its New Year’s Eve fireworks display over environmental considerations, officials said. The decision was a continuation of the town’s decision earlier this year to celebrate holidays in ways that have a less environmental impact, Summit Daily reported. The town canceled its 2019 Fourth of July fireworks display, which officials said was a result of concerns about fire safety and potential negative effects on the forest and wildlife. The town council opted to remain consistent with its summer holiday cancellation, Breckenridge spokeswoman Haley Littleton said. Breckenridge Ski Resort has not changed plans to hold its annual New Year’s Eve torchlight parade, in which ski and snowboard instructors carry torches and ride from the top of one of the mountain’s peaks down to the resort village.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Farmers are being asked to suggest ways to improve the state’s Connecticut Grown campaign, an effort to raise awareness about produce and other agricultural products grown and sold in the state. Bryan Hurlburt, the commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Agriculture said his agency plans to embark on an integrated marketing campaign that will promote Connecticut Grown products during 2020 and beyond. The program was developed to assist producers and retailers of Connecticut farm products by raising awareness and increasing direct-to-consumer and wholesale buying. During his visits to over the past few months to numerous farms and businesses, Hurlburt said he heard a clear message that promotion of the Connecticut Grown brand needs to be improved.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The remains of a 33-year-old American soldier killed in combat in Afghanistan have been returned to the United States on Wednesday, arriving at Dover Air Force. Sgt. 1st Class Michael J. Goble of Washington Township, New Jersey, was killed Monday in a roadside bombing in northern Kunduz province. The Taliban claimed they were behind the attack. Goble was assigned to 1st Battalion, 7th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at the Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The Pentagon has said Goble’s unit was engaged in combat operations when he suffered fatal injuries. Multiple U.S. officials, including national security adviser Robert O’Brien and Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, attended Wednesday what the military calls a dignified transfer in which the cases containing the remains are transferred to a vehicle from the aircraft that ferried them to the United States.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Metro admits it “did not follow safety procedures” – or follow a 2015 guideline from federal investigators – when it sent a Red Line train to investigate sparks on the tracks during Dec. 10’s morning’s rush, WUSA-TV reported. Metro safety watchdogs said riders were put in danger. A transit agency investigation of the incident found that a rail operations controller radioed the operator of Train 130 to check out a track problem near Tenleytown, “but failed to instruct Train 130 to offload its passengers before beginning the inspection.” NTSB investigators said trains carrying passengers should not be used to scope out track issues.\n\nFlorida\n\nCocoa Beach: Who needs a sleigh when you have a surfboard? Some 600 surfers dressed as Santa chose surfboards instead of sleighs on Tuesday during an annual Christmas Eve surfing fundraiser in Cocoa Beach. Almost 10,000 spectators turned out for the 10th Annual Surfing Santas event along Florida’s Space Coast. The surfing fundraiser raised $40,000 for the Florida Surf Museum and a nonprofit that helps people with cancer.\n\nGeorgia\n\nColumbus: A manufacturer of plastic stretch film is planning to open a new manufacturing facility in Georgia. Zummit Plastics, based in Phoenix, is expanding with plans to create 50 jobs and invest $25 million into the project in Columbus, according to the Georgia Department of Economic Development. The location and opening date were not announced, The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reported.. “This announcement is a fantastic way to wrap up 2019,” said Russ Carreker, chairman of the Development Authority of Columbus. “We are grateful that Zummit Plastics decided to choose Columbus as the place to achieve business success with their environmentally-friendly stretch film products.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: The Hawaii Police Department has gone $3 million over budget primarily because of the necessity of an increased police presence near the site of demonstrations at the Mauna Kea Access Road, an official said. Assistant Chief Samuel Thomas told the Hawaii County Police Commission of the budget overrun Friday, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Wednesday. Since July, demonstrators have blocked access to the summit of Mauna Kea to prevent the construction of a giant telescope. Demonstrators have said the Thirty Meter Telescope could damage land considered sacred by some Native Hawaiians. The department’s increased presence on Daniel K. Inouye Highway has required an increase in officer overtime payments, Thomas said. The county has accrued more than $5 million in law enforcement expenses related to Mauna Kea demonstrations and increased traffic enforcement on the highway, Thomas said. Thomas told commissioners the police budget for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, is just more than $70 million, adding that a budget meeting with the county Department of Finance is scheduled for January. The state has spent about $15 million to provide safe access to the mountain, Democratic Gov. David Ige said earlier this month.\n\nIdaho\n\nKetchum: The Idaho Public Utilities Commission rejected a proposed settlement for home and small business solar panels, officials said. The agreement would have changed how Idaho Power Co. customers are credited for the solar power they produce and put into the grid, The Idaho Mountain Express reported Tuesday. The proposed agreement reached in October by Idaho Power, utilities commission staff and seven other entities involved net metering, officials said. Net metering records the amount of power produced by a home power producer relative to the amount the home consumes, officials said. The commission’s Dec. 20 order rejected the settlement agreement, finding the record created from the settlement proceedings was insufficient to support the proposal. The public was not adequately notified the agreement might result in significant changes to Idaho Power’s net metering program, the commission said.\n\nIllinois\n\nAlton: Authorities in southwest Illinois made a Christmas-morning rescue after a woman who climbed up bluffs above a city park got stuck on a ledge for hours. Madison County 911 received a call that a woman could be heard calling for help around 1 a.m. Wednesday, according to The (Alton) Telegraph. Alton Fire Chief Jesse Jemison said a woman climbed the bluffs in a part of Piasa Park with thick wooded brush. He estimated she had been there since 4 p.m. Tuesday and was stranded about 30 feet off the ground in an area with loose rock. Crews used a ladder to rescue her after cutting a path to the woman with a chainsaw, Jemison said. The woman did not appear to have serious injuries, according to the newspaper. Authorities said the woman gave no reason for the attempted climb and was able to walk through thick brush before being transported to an area hospital.\n\nIndiana\n\nBedford: State conservation officers are investigating the deadly shooting of a bald eagle in southern Indiana and offering a reward to anyone with information. The investigation began last week after a landowner notified a Lawrence County animal control officer and officials with the Brown County Indiana Raptor Center of an injured bird. It had suffered an apparent gunshot wound and was treated for injuries but died, officials said. Authorities are seeking help from the public for any information and offered a $1,000 reward. The birds are no longer endangered but remain protected by two federal laws. Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, a first offense of killing a bald eagle can bring up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine. The other law is the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Earlier this week, Louisiana wildlife agents said at least one bald eagle might have been killed in the state’s northwest region.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of liquor retailers alleges that the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division illegally marked up the price of their products for years. The lawsuit comes days after the division’s former comptroller filed his own lawsuit alleging he was fired for blowing the whistle on the illegal price markups. Attorney Stuart Higgins represents the plaintiffs in both cases. Division spokesman Tyler Ackerson said Monday the agency is consulting with legal counsel and has no comment. He said last week that the allegations filed by former comptroller Todd Halbur were not true. The new lawsuit was filed on behalf of Class E liquor license holders who purchased products from the agency, Iowa’s exclusive wholesaler and distributor of liquor. Those licensees include nearly 1,700 grocery, liquor and convenience stores. State law allows the division to mark up products by 50% above what it paid before selling them to licensees. The lawsuit alleges that the markups that the agency assessed for years was “in excess of the statutory cap” and seeks reimbursement for the overcharges and other damages. It doesn’t elaborate on the amount involved.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Zoo animals in Topeka will soon be making use of castoff live Christmas trees. The city said in a news release that the trees can be dropped off at a special location at Gage Park, where the zoo is located. Zoo Director Brendan Wiley said animals that can benefit from the trees include lions, tigers, owls, mountain lions, giraffes, black bears and painted dogs. Once the animals make use of the trees, they will be ground up and turned into mulch. The trees must be free of ornaments, hooks, tinsel and tree stands. They also can’t be in plastic bags.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Effective next week, motorists with some special license plates will be required to pay an additional charitable donation to the organization represented on the plate. Currently, $10 donations are optional, but starting Monday, the $10 donation will be required. The change affects 29 special license plates, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said in a news release. Most special plates already have a donation requirement that will not change. The legislation changing the requirement for special plates was passed during this year’s General Assembly. It also requires approved nonprofit organizations to maintain at least 500 registrations annually for the cabinet to continue producing the plate design. New fees for the 29 special plates will be $44 when first purchased and $44 at annual registration renewal. Currently, the cost is $44 at initial purchase and $31 at annual renewal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Two elderly sisters have completed their goal of attending mass at every Catholic church in the Archdiocese of New Orleans. It took them nearly 20 years. Beverly Kelly, 84, and her sister, Pat Mahaffey, 88, crossed the final church off their list on Sunday when they attended 11 a.m. mass at the St. Joseph Abbey Church near Covington, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reported. It was the 160th church where the sisters attended Mass. That’s more than the 120 churches and chapels in the archdiocese. But some churches have closed since they started their journey. They also went to some churches outside the New Orleans area. They aimed for one church a month, figuring that would take them roughly 10 years, according to the newspaper. But they revisited many churches along the way and were delayed when Hurricane Katrina struck. Two other sisters were part of the effort, but they died. That made Sunday’s Mass emotional. “We were a very close family,” Mahaffey, 88, said. “Sybil (one of the sisters) was sort of the instigator in this church quest. I said a prayer: ‘God, I’m sorry you couldn’t spare her to complete this.’ But I feel she is watching us.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A cold snap followed by warming temperatures has left many lakes and ponds in the state with dangerously thin levels of ice, the Maine Warden Service has warned. The service is urging residents to exercise caution before venturing out on any ice-covered Maine waterways. Ice conditions vary widely across the state, and that means residents must check the thickness of ice before going onto it for activities such as ice fishing. The service recommends ice fishermen and others check the ice in different places using an auger or another means of making a “test hole” that gauges thickness. It’s a good idea to make several such holes, the state said. People venturing onto the ice should also bring a partner, avoid areas with currents, look for honeycombed ice and take other safety precautions, the state said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The Solid Waste Division of Worcester County will hold its annual collection of Christmas trees through Jan. 31. Area residents can drop off Christmas trees at the Central Landfill in Newark and the Berlin, Pocomoke and Snow Hill Homeowners Convenience Centers at no cost. Businesses and organizations that sold trees will not be permitted to drop off trees at the convenience centers but can take them to the Central Landfill, where applicable tipping fees will be assessed. The trees will be ground into mulch for use at the Central Landfill. For more information, contact Recycling Manager Mike McClung at (410) 632-3177.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Public health officials are seeking organizations to set up centers where people can be monitored after using illicit drugs. These planned “medical observation and monitoring services” would be staffed by nurses and other clinicians, who would monitor the clients’ vital signs, administer oxygen, intravenous fluids, and the overdose-reversing drug naloxone if necessary, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday. The clients will be able to remain anonymous and receive counseling, treatment for infections and wounds, and help with obtaining primary health care and addiction treatment. People will not be allowed to use drugs inside these centers, a marked difference from the concept of “safe consumption sites.” The state’s Department of Public Health is seeking bids to create three to five monitoring sites. Each would serve five to 10 people who have taken too much of a sedative, such as heroin or fentanyl, or a stimulant, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. The site locations have not yet been determined.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: WOOD-TV reported that doctors in Detroit removed a kidney from Logan Bosselaar on Christmas Eve and transplanted it to Vanessa Bosselaar. The surgery had been in the works for weeks. Doctors were surprised that Logan was a perfect transplant match for his 24-year-old wife, who has a serious kidney disease. They live in Kentwood, near Grand Rapids. It’s been a challenging month: The Bosselaars were in a rollover crash after a medical appointment a few weeks ago but had only minor injuries. “The fact that we were OK from our car accident and then to go in and have a successful surgery – that’s amazing,” Logan said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Before heading out to deliver presents for Christmas, Santa made a special stop last week at the CentraCare – St. Cloud Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit to visit babies who were dressed for the occasion. The March of Dimes provided the outfits – most of them donated – including tiny hats made by one of CentraCare’s NICU nurses. The bows were also handmade, showing how each baby is a gift to their family. Hospital officials said Tuesday that Santa was expected to return overnight to fill Christmas stockings.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: Warren County supervisors voted to delay a decision on hauling away flood debris, which could cost the county more than $100,000. A total of 24 homes at Eagle Lake have been demolished by volunteers following flooding. The delay means the next board of supervisors will decide on the move after they are sworn in on Jan. 1 to begin new four-year terms. Water trapped inside a levee system stood for months this year. A floodgate that allows the water to drain from what’s called the Yazoo backwater region was kept closed because it was preventing even worse flooding from the Mississippi River. Under the plan, the county would place dumpsters in the Eagle Lake area to collect debris. That would cut down on the number of time-consuming round trips to the county’s landfill. But county emergency manager John Elfers estimates nearly 250,000 cubic yards of debris needs to be hauled away, equivalent to 305 dumpsters. That would cost the county more than $137,000. Officials say Warren County must pay for the work itself and isn’t eligible for federal disaster reimbursement. Outgoing supervisors asked county employees to make a new estimate of the amount of debris, as well as determine whether it’s all on public rights-of-way. Mississippi counties are barred by state law from working on private property.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Education officials said they have a plan that would not only increase teachers’ pay but also offer raises and attract them to positions that are challenging to fill. The state has one of the worst teacher compensations in the country, ranking at 40th with the average salary of $48,000, according to data from the National Education Association. But a new proposal could lift Missouri up to 26th with an average salary of about $54,000. Paul Katnik, an assistant education commissioner at the state’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, presented a nearly $400 million proposal to the State Board of Education during its December monthly meeting. The three-part plan calls for increasing the base pay for teachers from $25,000 to $32,000, offering teachers a $4,000 raise and creating a fund to lure teachers to take on hard-to-fill positions. The fund would allocate $75 million to recruit teachers to work in high-poverty or rural schools or teaching subjects such as high school science or English as a second language classes for immigrants. Education officials, teachers and education associations penned the plan.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: State parks across Montana will offer guided hikes on New Year’s Day as part of the “First Day Hikes” annual tradition across the U.S. Some 55,000 people walked more than 133,000 miles in state parks nationwide on New Year’s Day last year, according to the National Association of State Park Directors. This year, among the Montana parks participating, Missouri Headwaters State Park will offer a 3-mile family friendly loop at 11 a.m. Wednesday, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The land had been used for thousands of years by the Bannock, Salish, Shoshone, Crow and Blackfeet tribes, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. The Lewis and Clark expedition camped at the site in 1805 on its way to the Pacific Ocean. Later, the land was used by fur traders as a meeting place. It was also where the state’s first flour mill was built. The mill supplied flour to gold miners throughout southwest Montana. Missouri Headwaters State Park was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Participants can meet at the main picnic grounds near the Gallatin River. The hike will begin at 11 a.m. David Andrus, manager of the 532-acre park, said the event will include hot chocolate and toasted bagels beginning at 10 a.m.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific is continuing its fight against reinstating a train engineer who defecated on a locomotive connection knuckle. The company filed an appeal last week to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the Lincoln Journal Star reported. Last month a district judge in Omaha upheld an arbitration board’s decision that the fired engineer should be reinstated because termination was “excessive discipline.” Union Pacific had sued the employee union to overturn the board’s order to put Matthew Lebsack back on the job. The lawsuit says Lebsack walked past the locomotive cab bathroom on Nov. 20, 2016, when the train was stopped. It said he left the locomotive and defecated on the metal knuckle that connected the locomotive to a rail car. U.S. District Court Judge Brian Buescher said in his ruling that he didn’t understand why the board didn’t think Lebsack’s conduct was worthy of upholding his termination. But Buescher also said the law didn’t let him consider the merits of the arbitration board’s decision, but only whether that decision fell within the board’s discretion under the provisions of railroad-union contract. He said Union Pacific presented no evidence showing the board’s decision was not within its discretion.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Veterans Village has announced plans to add 150 affordable units to the Nevada housing community and change its name to SHARE Village Las Vegas. The master-planned community will also be opened to nonveterans, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported Monday. The nonprofit organization had been planning to expand the affordable housing community, and a fatal fire accelerated the timeline, Veterans Village founder and President Arnold Stalk said. Six people died and 13 were injured Saturday in a fire at Alpine Motel Apartments. A Las Vegas Fire Department official said the blaze was the deadliest in the city’s history. In addition to those killed or injured, 30 to 35 residents were displaced from their homes and were assisted by the American Red Cross. Five of the 13 injured were initially listed in critical condition, including a pregnant woman. The cause of the fire is under investigation, but it appeared to have originated at a stove. There was no evidence of criminal activity, the fire department said. After the Alpine Motel fire, Stalk wanted to “let the public know that we are expanding our mission and services,” he said. SHARE Village Las Vegas also offers year-round crisis intervention centers, medical and mental health services, employment training, nutrition programs, and other services as part of its public-private partnerships.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Two state senators hope to increase accountability and transparency in the budgeting process for the state’s community college system. Sen. Dan Feltes, D-Concord, and Sen. John Reagan, R-Deerfield, sit on the Senate Finance Committee. They expressed concern after the New Hampshire Technical Institute announced that it is laying off 10 people Dec. 27, including senior professors in the departments of English, education, accounting and social science. Although the layoff announcement came after the filing deadline for new legislation, the senators said they will seek some kind of legislative fix to address the issue. College President Gretchen Mullin-Sawicki has said the decision was “very painful, but unfortunately necessary to create a more sustainable institution” at a time when enrollment has dropped 8% in the last year.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWall Township:A home that caught fire Christmas Day reignited early Thursday morning as multiple fire crews were back on the scene in the southeastern corner of town, Capt. Greg Carpino said in a news release. A video of the fire posted by News 12 showed smoke and flames coming from the second floor of the three-story house at 2379 Peter Court. Smoke could be smelled all around the area toward Point Pleasant Beach because of weather conditions preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere Thursday. The fire had been extinguished again as of 9 a.m. and the cause remains under investigation, Carpino said. Township police said the fire first started around 2:05 p.m. Wednesday. Everyone in the home was accounted for and were uninjured, but a family pet died, according to a GoFundMe page set up for the family. As of Thursday morning, more than $2,000 of the $20,000 goal had been raised. On Wednesday, dozens of emergency vehicles blocked off the cul-de-sac on Peter Court as scores of firefighters worked in and around the smoking house into the late afternoon.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: State officials are planning another public meeting focused on the state’s oversight and scientific monitoring of environmental impacts at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Environment Department has scheduled the next meeting for Jan. 9 at the University of New Mexico campus in Los Alamos. The focus will be a 2016 agreement the state signed with the U.S. Energy Department regarding the cleanup of contamination and other responsibilities of the lab. The order spells out milestones the lab needs to meet with its cleanup campaigns and establishes corrective actions for the release of hazardous wastes or groundwater contamination. Watchdogs have been critical of the pace of cleanup projects at the northern New Mexico lab. Earlier this year, environmental groups filed a federal lawsuit over water pollution downstream from the lab. The groups asked the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to issue a permit that would specifically regulate urban stormwater runoff from developed areas at the lab, the town of Los Alamos and the nearby community of White Rock.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed Thursday a study to look into what it would take to bring high-speed rail to New York. Cuomo is proposing bringing together outside experts to look at the state’s past reports on high-speed rail and come up with a new plan. The Democrat’s idea was released Thursday as part of the governor’s 2020 State of the State agenda. Cuomo said previous plans over the last two decades have long said high-speed rail projects would take decades and prove too expensive for New York. The governor said most of New York’s population lives along the Amtrak’s Empire Corridor through New York City, Albany and Buffalo, and those lines often average 51 mph. He has said that makes travel on them the “slowest method available for New Yorkers.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The fight over the critically endangered red wolf has returned to court as Gov. Roy Cooper sought immediate help for the dozen or so remaining in the wild and federal biologists planned to transfer wolves into the recovery area for the first time in years. In late November, Cooper sent the secretary of the interior a sharply worded letter warning that, with no more than 14 known wolves in the wild, “the American red wolf is on the brink of extinction.” He noted that in 2019, no litters of red wolf pups were born in the wild for the first time in the history of the reintroduction program. Red wolves once occupied much of the Eastern U.S. but were driven to near-extinction by trapping, hunting and habitat loss before they were reintroduced to North Carolina in 1987. Their range is limited to five North Carolina counties. Another 200 live in captive breeding programs.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Police Department said it has received numerous reports of mail being stolen from residential mailboxes. Two suspected vehicle descriptions have been provided to police. One is a dark colored-sport utility vehicle and the other is a white four-door sedan, according to police Sgt. Mike Jennings. Police have no further details. Jennings said the thefts have happened in the late night and early morning hours in an area south of 24th Avenue and east of 20th Street South. Police are recommending that residents do not leave outgoing mail for pickup in their mailboxes overnight and that they ask the Post Office to hold their mail then they are out of town.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A New York-based sports network has turned to the federal courts in its trademark dispute with Ohio State University over use of the letter “O.” Overtime Sports Inc., an online network focusing on high school basketball and football, has a capital O with sloping corners as its logo. Its application to trademark the logo is pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Ohio State asked the company in July to stop using the logo, saying it was too close to its own trademarked octagonal “block O” letter. Overtime Sports disagrees with Ohio State’s position and on Monday filed a federal lawsuit in New York City asking that the university be prohibited from trying to stop the use of the logo. The lawsuit noted that Ohio State’s “O” contains neither rounded edges nor a rectangle in the center, as the company’s logo does. It also argued there’s no danger of someone confusing the letters, and that Overtime Sports has not unfairly competed with Ohio State or violated any of its rights. Ohio State declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group seeking a public vote on whether to legalize recreational use of marijuana in Oklahoma has temporarily abandoned its effort. The two proponents of the initiative petition – Amy Young and Vanessa Avery – notified the Secretary of State’s office Monday that they were withdrawing the petition they filed earlier this month. Young said in a statement she grew concerned about the impact that recreational marijuana might have on existing medical marijuana businesses and on children who are able to receive medicinal marijuana. A spokeswoman for the group, Michelle Tilley, said they plan to rewrite the petition to include greater protections for the medical marijuana industry and submit it again. If passed, it would amend the Oklahoma Constitution to allow adult use of marijuana and impose a 15% tax on the sale of marijuana, in addition to state and local taxes. Oklahoma’s medical marijuana program launched last year and has been wildly successful, with more than 220,000 patients and 1,500 dispensary licenses issued so far.\n\nOregon\n\nBend: Authorities are searching for a skier from California who went missing while skiing at an Oregon resort on Christmas Day. The search for Ashlee Gingerich began around 5 p.m. Wednesday when Deschutes County deputies were alerted she had not reunited with her skiing partners at Mt. Bachelor. The Ski Patrol swept all the runs right away and did not find her. Deschutes County Search and Rescue professionals and volunteers then got involved. The search resumed early Thursday. KOIN reported that Gingerich, 30, was last seen around 3:40 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNorth Huntingdon: Police said a western Pennsylvania woman and her boyfriend were both charged with assault for a fight she said began when he found her wrapping presents for another boyfriend. The Tribune-Review said Daniel W. Hill and Diedra L. Dibucci, both 50 years old, were arrested after the incident in the North Huntingdon apartment they shared. Police answered a call about a man with a knife and had to force their way inside. That’s where they said they found Hill on the floor, with injuries and scratches to his face and neck. Dibucci told officers Hill threw a chair at her and grabbed a kitchen knife. Hill was charged with aggravated assault and resisting arrest. He was jailed after failing to post bail. An attorney was not listed for him in court records. Court records indicated Dibucci faces an assault charge. She did not appear to have a listed phone number.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza, who has three years left in his second mayoral term, is considering a run for governor in 2022. He said he still has to consider various factors, including whether he can raise enough money to compete in what will likely be a competitive Democratic primary field, The Boston Globe reported. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo won’t be able to run in 2022 because of term limits. Elorza has more than $600,000 in his campaign account. Treasurer Seth Magaziner, Lieutenant Gov. Daniel McKee, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea are widely expected to run in the Democratic primary for governor in 2022.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAndrews: Members of Spirit Filled Ambassadors for Christ church said someone broke into a building they use for gatherings and set several fires. Someone also broke nearly all the windows on a church bus sometime early Sunday morning, Pastor Deshawn Rouse said. Several tablecloths in the Georgetown County church’s Executive Hall were set on fire. Pictures posted to the church’s Facebook page show burned tables, soot on the walls and other damage. The church’s sanctuary was not damaged, so services went on even with heavy hearts, Rouse told WMBF-TV. The State Law Enforcement Division is helping Andrews Police investigate the fire and vandalism. The state agency has been called in to investigate most church fires in South Carolina since a series of blazes at houses of worship in the 1990s. Rouse said the FBI has also been called in to help the investigation at the predominately African American church, also something that routinely happens in arson cases with mostly black congregations.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nCuster: An acting supervisor has been selected for the Black Hills National Forest until a replacement is named for the outgoing leader. Andrew Johnson, the supervisor of the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming, will manage the South Dakota wildness area for up to four months, the Forest Service said. The current supervisor, Mark Van Every, is retiring next week. Johnson will start on Jan. 6. The Black Hills National Forest covers 1.2 million acres in western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming. Offices are located in Sundance and Newcastle, Wyoming, and Custer, Rapid City and Spearfish in South Dakota.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:A new poll shows Tennessee voters strongly support the spending of federal dollars to provide child care options. As well, voters want to see increased early childhood education opportunities in the state, according to the poll released on Wednesday by Tennesseans for Quality Early Education. The poll comes days after a Vanderbilt University survey also showed similar results – that voters support spending the state’s federal grant reserves to subsidize child care for low-income workers. The TQEE survey found 71% of voters said the state should use all of the federal funding it receives because there are not enough quality, affordable child care options for families. The poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies surveyed 600 likely Tennessee voters from Nov. 18-21 and sampled voters across the state’s political, demographic and geographic lines, according to a news release. Overall, 93% of state voters view early childhood education – including the role of child care – as a bedrock to the short- and long-term success of children.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A Texas woman who drove to Mexico to deliver Christmas gifts to a sprawling refugee camp housing people waiting for U.S. court dates said Wednesday she was detained by authorities there for two days. Anamichelle Castellano said she and another volunteer for her nonprofit group were stopped Monday at a bridge crossing from Brownsville, Texas, to Matamoros, Mexico. She said authorities discovered a small box of ammunition inside the car she was driving, which she said was left inside by her husband. Mexico has strict laws against entering the country with guns or ammunition. Those laws occasionally ensnare Americans crossing the border. Castellano said she spent Monday night sleeping on a couch with her 9-year-old daughter in a government office. She gave a statement Tuesday to someone she believed to be a prosecutor, then was allowed to leave a few hours later. The prosecutor’s office in Mexico’s Tamaulipas state did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah firefighters are among the U.S. federal and state personnel who have traveled to Australia to help stop brush fires that have prompted a national emergency, officials said. Five federal agencies and 10 states including Utah have sent 21 firefighters to Australia, The Deseret News reported Tuesday. The state of emergency was declared because of a massive fire near Sydney, with other national park and mountain fires expected to fuse as brush fires continue to spread across 1,563 square miles of Australia, authorities said. The fires have been fueled by 25 mph winds amid temperatures reaching 113 degrees, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: Two women have started a pet food pantry to assist animal owners in need. Linda Groce and Theresa Jones opened the pantry Dec. 17 and plan to keep it open until January, the Rutland Herald reported. Groce said she was inspired by a similar effort in another city. The pantry will accept pet food donations Monday through Thursday. If the pantry continues to do well, and if space permits, the pair would like to bring it back next year, Groce said. Leftover donations will be donated to the Rutland Cupboard, local rescue organizations and the Feline Connection.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A lawmaker has filed a bill that would scrap the state’s Lee-Jackson holiday celebrating two Confederate generals and add one on Election Day. Del. Joseph Lindsey’s measure is one of hundreds lawmakers will consider when they convene next month for the start of the 2020 legislative session. Lee-Jackson Day, established more than 100 years ago, is observed annually on the Friday preceding the third Monday in January. It honors Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, both native Virginians. For a time, the holiday was merged with the one celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But the 2000 General Assembly brought an end to Lee-Jackson-King Day when it voted to create a separate holiday for King. Critics of the Lee-Jackson holiday view it as a celebration of the state’s slave-holding history that’s offensive to African Americans. Many cities and counties have opted not to observe it. Lindsey, a Democrat whose district includes Norfolk and Virginia Beach, is the new chair of the House privileges and elections committee. He is the first black lawmaker to serve in that role, according to the legislative black caucus.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that drivers must use their signal every time they turn or change lanes on a roadway. Thursday’s ruling reverses a Court of Appeals ruling that said a signal is required only when public safety is affected. The high court ruled that the plain language of the law requires drivers “to ensure turns and lane changes are done safely and with an appropriate turn signal.” The ruling was issued in the case of David Brown, who was arrested for driving under the influence in Kennewick in March 2015. State patrol officers pulled him over after he briefly turned on his left turn signal while approaching a light in a designated left turn lane but turned it off and did not reactivate it while at the light or making the turn. He was arrested after his breath test showed .26 breath alcohol content, more than triple the legal limit. Brown had argued that the evidence of the breath test should be suppressed because the underlying traffic stop was without cause, and a lower court agreed and dismissed the case. The only issue before the Supreme Court was whether Brown violated traffic laws. The case now goes back to the lower courts to proceed in accordance with the high court’s guidance on the initial stop.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: The city isn’t going to force retired police officers and firefighters to return miscalculated and overpaid pension payments. The City Council decided Monday to keep the overpaid pensions where they are and correct any underfunded pensions, The Herald-Dispatch reported. Those whose pensions were underpaid will also receive back pay. Mayor Steve Williams said the city’s pension funds are now the strongest they have ever been, and the fund is making payments on time after having been late for months. In 2013, the police officer fund’s net worth was about $22.3 million. It has nearly doubled since then. The firefighter fund was about $13 million in 2013 and now sits at about $30 million. A 2017 review of the city’s pension calculations found that some workers were being paid too much and some were being paid too little.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A large number of people donated kidneys this year at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison – and in each case, it was a donation to a stranger. It’s unclear why there was a surge in kidney donations this year – 28 in all – but a staffer at the hospital has a simple theory: “Society in general just wants to do good right now,” Leza Warnke, a UW Hospital transplant coordinator, told the Wisconsin State Journal. “We’re hurting for some ‘feel good.’ ” The 28 people who donated their kidneys are a rare type of donor known as “nondirected donors” because they’re willing to give to anyone, regardless of whether they know the person. Of the 28 donors, 22 were women and six were men. The ages of donors ranged from 23 to 78. Garet Hil, founder and CEO of the National Kidney Registry, said there were about 300 such donors nationwide this year, which still makes the act unusual. “We don’t know what’s driving it,” Hil said. “It’s still about one-in-a-million. These are very special people.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A woman from Alaska has donated body armor to a Wyoming K9 officer, the Laramie County Sheriff’s Office said. The bullet and stab protective vest for K9 officer Arie comes from a donation by Denise Nading of Anchorage through a nonprofit organization called Vested Interest in K9s, Inc. Nading made the donation in memory of Mel Nading, an Alaska State Trooper and pilot who died in a helicopter crash in March 2013 while returning from rescuing a stranded snowmobiler in Talkeetna, Alaska, according to news reports. The vest is embroidered with: “In memory of Mel Nading, Pilot of Helo 1,” the sheriff’s office said in a Facebook post on Tuesday. Arie, who joined the sheriff’s office this fall, is trained in narcotics detection, suspect tracking and apprehension, building search and officer protection.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/30/us/uvalde-texas-elementary-school-shooting-monday/index.html", "title": "A 9-year-old describes escaping through a window as anger mounts ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs a gunman entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and started firing, one student said his wounded teacher texted 911 for help.\n\nDaniel, 9, alongside his mother, Briana Ruiz, told CNN the gunman fired several shots into his classroom after being unable to enter. The door had been locked by his teacher, and the bullets fired struck the teacher as well as a classmate.\n\nThe deadly rampage at Robb Elementary marked at least the 30th shooting at a K-12 school in just the first five months of this year. It was the deadliest school shooting since the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.\n\nDaniel survived by first “hiding under a table next to the wall.” He said he could see the gunman through the door’s window.\n\n“I could still see his face,” the boy said. “I could see him staring at people in front of me.”\n\nThe area around the Robb Elementary School signs has become a memorial dedicated to the victims of the May 24 mass shooting.

She was one of 19 children and two teachers killed in the worst school shooting in a decade, and less than a week later, major questions remain about the timeliness of the law enforcement response and whether more children could have been saved.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety has laid out a timeline of the Tuesday shooting, showing the gunman was in a classroom with students for more than an hour before he was shot and killed by a Border Patrol tactical response team. Officers arrived at the school within minutes, but the commander on scene decided to wait over an hour for reinforcements, even as children locked inside the room with the gunman called 911 and begged for police help.\n\nVideo taken from the outside of the school during the incident, obtained by ABC News, includes what appears to be dispatch audio informing officers on scene a child is calling 911 from a classroom.\n\n“Advise we do have a child on the line,” the dispatcher says. “Child is advising he is in the room full of victims.”\n\nThe video indicates police at the scene were informed at least one child remained alive inside the classrooms.\n\nCNN has not been able to independently confirm the video/audio. The source of the video is unclear and it is unclear at what point in the incident the audio is heard. CNN has reached out to authorities to answer questions about this audio.\n\nTexas DPS Director Steve McCraw told reporters Friday there were at least eight 911 calls from at least two separate callers from inside the school, covering a span of nearly 50 minutes. The decision made on scene to treat the incident like a barricaded suspect, rather than an active shooter, was “wrong,” he said.\n\nAlso on Monday, funeral services for two victims are set to take place at local funeral homes. Visitation and Rosary for 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza will take place Monday at Hillcrest Memorial Funeral Home, and services for 10-year-old Maite Yuleana Rodriguez will take place at Rushing Estes Knowles.\n\nLaw enforcement response called into question\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Shimon Prokupecz lists unanswered questions about Uvalde 02:45 - Source: CNN\n\nAlfred Garcia, whose daughter was killed in the shooting, told CNN he was in “disbelief” over how much time elapsed during the shooting before it ended and shared his frustration with authorities’ response.\n\n“It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that it just took too long to get in there and, you know, had they gotten there sooner, and someone would have taken immediate action, we might have more of those children here today, including my daughter,” he said.\n\nLaw enforcement officers in Texas are trained to intervene quickly, according to active shooter guidelines in the state’s commission on law enforcement 2020 training manual obtained by CNN. The manual states an “officer’s first priority is to move in and confront the attacker.”\n\n“As first responders we must recognize that innocent life must be defended,” it says. “A first responder unwilling to place the lives of the innocent above their own safety should consider another career field.”\n\nSeven officers arrived at the scene within two minutes of the shooter firing in the classroom. Three officers approached the locked classroom where the gunman was, and two officers suffered graze wounds from bullets fired from behind the door, DPS said. Officers then stationed down the hallway.\n\nBorder Patrol agents belonging to a specialized unit arrived at the scene around 12:15 p.m., roughly 45 minutes after the gunman began shooting. The officer in charge had already made the determination the subject was barricaded in the room, according to a source familiar with the situation.\n\nThe team then did not breach the classroom for at least another 30 minutes, according to the timeline provided by DPS. A 911 call placed at 12:16 p.m., according to DPS, from a girl in one of the classrooms told the operator eight or nine students were still alive.\n\nThe delayed police response in Uvalde runs contrary to well-established, commonly taught active shooter protocol established after the Columbine school shooting of 1999, experts said.\n\n“Even under fire, officers are trained to go to that threat because every second counts,” said Jonathan Wackrow, a CNN law enforcement analyst. “What we saw here was that delay cost children their lives, full stop.”\n\nAt the request of Uvalde’s mayor, the US Department of Justice announced it will conduct an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the shooting.\n\n“The goal of the review is to provide an independent account of law enforcement actions and responses that day, and to identify lessons learned and best practices to help first responders prepare for and respond to active shooter events,” the DOJ said in a statement Sunday.\n\nThe DOJ is expected to select someone in the next few days to lead the review, according to two sources familiar with the process. The Justice Department has traditionally relied on people outside the DOJ with law enforcement expertise and on-the-ground experience with mass-casualty events to conduct such reviews.\n\nThe department conducted similar reviews after mass shootings in San Bernardino, California, in December 2015, and at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016.\n\nBiden hopeful ‘rational’ Republicans can agree to gun reform\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden visited Uvalde Sunday to pay their respects, attending Mass and laying flowers at a memorial for the victims. The two also met privately with family members of the victims as well as first responders.\n\nIn an interview with CNN affiliate KSAT, Texas state Senator Roland Gutierrez said Biden told him “we’re going to look to raze that school, build a new one.” Gutierrez said there is a federal grant process for schools like Columbine and other schools to raze these schools. Sandy Hook Elementary was rebuilt after the 2012 shooting, for example.\n\n“What kind of world are we living in that legislation was created for razing these schools?” Gutierrez asked during the interview.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Texas lawmaker: You can get an AR-15 in Texas faster than you can get baby formula 02:21 - Source: CNN\n\nAccording to Gutierrez, Biden also told him, “I’m not going away … I’m gonna bring you resources … look to getting real money for mental health care.” There is only one psychiatrist in Uvalde, according to the senator.\n\n\n\nBiden voiced optimism on Monday certain “rational” Republicans could agree to some type of new gun restrictions.\n\n“I think things have gotten so bad that everybody’s getting more rational about it. At least that’s my hope and prayer,” Biden told reporters at the White House.\n\nBiden, in his most extensive comments about gun control since last week’s murders, said he was limited in steps he could take alone.\n\n“There’s the Constitution. I can’t dictate this stuff. I can do the things I’ve done, and any executive action I can take I’ll continue to take. But I can’t outlaw a weapon, I can’t change the background checks. I can’t do that,” he said.\n\nCommunity comes together\n\nIn the wake of the shooting, an outpouring of support to those in the community is being provided.\n\nCarlos Hernandez, whose restaurant is a mile from Robb Elementary, wrote on Facebook hours after the shooting, “There’s no possible way I can open my kitchen with a broken heart and have fun doing it.”\n\nOn Thursday – his 33rd birthday – Hernandez decided to cook for the community, whipping up favorite dishes, including wings, mac-and-cheese and fried fish tacos.\n\nWithin two hours, Hernandez had given away more than 60 family-sized platters to feed mourning families and neighbors who are still learning how to cope with the tragedy inflicted on their tight-knit community.\n\n“It’s a real tough situation, I’m just trying to show the kids that they do have us as their backbone and a support system,” Hernandez told CNN. “We always provide, whether there is an incident or no incident.”\n\nElsewhere in Uvalde, the El Progreso Memorial Library has become a place of healing.\n\nOn Wednesday, just a day after the shooting, children’s librarian Martha Carreon sat in front of rows of little faces, reading, singing, and giggling with the children, taking them away to a safe place far from the school where many of them became witness to horror.\n\n“We want our building to be a safe space, a refuge that is a quiet, calm and cool haven,” El Progreso Memorial Library director Mendell Morgan told CNN.\n\nAlong with psychologists who will be available every weekday for children and adults to talk to, there will also be massage therapy practitioners, volunteers for arts and craft activities, pianists to play soothing music, and even magicians to hold professional magic shows.\n\n“This is a strong community where we have true care and concern for one another,” Morgan said. “Many, if not most here, hold fast to their faith believing in God, that good is stronger than evil and light is stronger than dark.”", "authors": ["Travis Caldwell"], "publish_date": "2022/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/09/11/hanover-police-search-two-robbery-suspects-considered-armed-and-dangerous/2287015001/", "title": "Hanover robbery suspects turn themselves into authorities, police say", "text": "Updated, Sept. 23:\n\nHenry Michael Zientek and Amanda Ruth Hendrickson-Cozio turned themselves into authorities on Sept. 18, according to a Hanover Borough Police news release.\n\nThey were arraigned and taken to York County prison.\n\nZientek is being held in lieu of $50,000 bail and Hendrickson-Cozio is being held in lieu of $25,000 bail, the release states.\n\nBoth have preliminary hearings scheduled for Oct. 29.\n\nPreviously reported, Sept. 11:\n\nHanover Borough Police are searching for two robbery suspects who allegedly forced their way into a home in the 100 block of Pleasant Street, struck the occupant in the face with a firearm and stole the occupant's money.\n\nPolice say the two should be considered armed and dangerous, according to a police news release.\n\nOn Sept. 10 at about 11:30 p.m., police responded to a report of a home invasion and made contact with a male victim, who was not identified by police, according to an affidavit filed with District Judge Dwayne Dubs.\n\nHenry Michael Zientek, 28, of Harrisburg, and Amanda Ruth Hendrickson-Cozio, 26, of Hanover, are both charged with robbery, criminal trespass, aggravated assault, simple assault, terroristic threats, recklessly endangering another person, theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property and criminal conspiracy.\n\nZientek was also charged with persons not to possess a firearm.\n\nThe victim told police he was on the couch when he heard a knock at the door.

This will be the first state visit of the Biden-Harris administration,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during Monday’s press briefing.\n\nThe state visit, which will include a state dinner, “will underscore the deep and enduring relationship between the United States and France – our oldest ally,” Jean-Pierre said.\n\n“Our close relationship with France is founded on our shared democratic values, economic ties and defense and security cooperation. The leaders will discuss our continued close partnership on shared global challenges and areas of bilateral interest,” she added.\n\nBiden is holding his first state dinner more than halfway through his term in office – later than previous US presidents. Jean-Pierre acknowledged Monday that “Covid certainly has delayed many of the in-person events a president traditionally hosts at the White House,” but highlighted previous White House visits by world leaders earlier in Biden’s term.\n\nThe tradition of the White House state visit – which is typically a multi-day affair that entails formal ceremonies, meetings and a glitzy black tie dinner – has been dwindling.\n\nThe Trumps welcomed the Macrons for their administration’s first state dinner in 2018. Their second and final state visit took place in 2019, when the White House hosted then-Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The Trumps were also slated to host the King and Queen of Spain in 2020 – an event that was postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic.\n\nMacron and Biden have spoken to one another several times since Biden took office in January 2021. Most recently, they met last week in New York as world leaders gathered for the United Nations General Assembly. The two discussed the ongoing war in Ukraine, Iran, the Indo-Pacific and challenges posed by China, according to the White House.\n\nBiden and Macron held their first formal meeting in June 2021 during the G7 Summit in England, walking away having relayed that they were on the same page. Macron heaped praise on Biden as being “part of the club” following a more fraught relationship with former US President Donald Trump.\n\nMacron, now in his second term, has emerged as the leading voice to advocate for the European Union. Since the warm G7 meeting, a number of global challenges have emerged, setting Macron up to distinguish himself on the world stage.\n\nA failed deal for France to produce nuclear-powered submarines for Australia caused a major international rift.\n\nIn September 2021, the French government recalled its ambassadors to the US and Australia for consultation in response to an announced national security partnership that would provide the US-produced submarines to Australia – abandoning a $90 billion existing deal with France to provide their submarines to the country.\n\nLater that fall, Biden admitted that his administration was “clumsy” in its handling of the deal, saying he was “under the impression that France had been informed long before that the deal was not going through.” And earlier this summer, France’s defense minister said the country aimed to rebuild its relationship with Australia.\n\nWestern leaders, including Biden and Macron, have broadly united in their opposition to combat Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine.\n\nFrance has also been a key player in negotiations to curb Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nPressed on Monday whether the decision to host France was about mending ties following some rifts earlier in Biden’s term, Jean-Pierre responded, “We deeply value our relationship with France. … We work closely with France on the full range of global challenges, as you all know, including the war in Ukraine. It is for these reasons that the President and first lady thought it was important to welcome this close and valued partner to the White House for their first state visit.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Jim Acosta", "Maegan Vazquez", "Jim Acosta"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/politics/biden-us-africa-leaders-summit/index.html", "title": "Biden welcomes African leaders for summit as China and Russia ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden welcomed nearly 50 leaders from Africa on Wednesday for a summit intended to reset Washington’s commitment to a region where China and Russia are also working to expand their influence.\n\n“When Africa succeeds, the United States succeeds. Quite frankly, the whole world succeeds as well,” Biden said during his first appearance at the multi-day US-Africa Leaders Summit, being held in Washington.\n\nThe gathering, coming nearly two years into Biden’s term, will focus on issues critical to the continent’s future, including climate change, public health and food security. Already, the administration has announced billions of dollars in economic aid and voiced support for a permanent seat at the Group of 20 for a representative from the African Union.\n\nIn his speech, Biden announced billions of dollars in new trade investments and an effort to help expand internet access on the continent, which the President said was necessary to boosting economic growth.\n\n“Improving Africa’s infrastructure is essential to our vision of building a stronger global economy that can better withstand the kinds of shocks that we’ve seen in the past few years,” Biden said during his remarks.\n\nLater this week, Biden is also expected to unveil plans to travel to the continent – he hasn’t visited Sub-Saharan Africa since taking office – and to appoint a new special representative for implementing the summit’s commitments.\n\nFollowing his speech Wednesday, Biden was hosting a small group of African leaders at the White House “for a discussion on upcoming presidential elections in 2023 in Africa and US support for free, fair and credible polls across the continent,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Monday, a sign of Biden’s focus on issues of democracy on the continent.\n\nFour nations’ leaders were excluded from the summit invite list following recent coups. But otherwise, all of the continents’ countries will be represented, including some with dire human rights records. The gathering is one of the largest collection of foreign leaders in Washington in recent years, and has led to traffic jams and tightened security for the dozens of motorcades and officials.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Biden will host the heads of delegation and their spouses for a dinner at the White House before kicking off Thursday’s program and closing the day “with a discussion on food security and food systems resilience” in Africa, which Sullivan said has been disproportionately affected by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe goal, according to senior administration officials, is to build more robust ties with African nations in the hopes of addressing the significant challenges the continent faces and to cultivate beneficial economic and security partnerships.\n\n“The United States is all in on Africa’s future,” Biden said in his speech.\n\nIt’s not the first time African leaders have heard a similar message from an American president. President Barack Obama held his own US-Africa Leaders Summit in 2014, complete with gala dinner under a tent on the White House South Lawn. He promised then to take action to help build more prosperity and security in Africa.\n\nBut his predecessor Donald Trump largely ignored Africa, never visiting the continent and even rudely disparaging certain African nations in a 2018 meeting as “shithole countries.”\n\nMeanwhile, other nations have made inroads on the continent. China has worked to grow trade relations with African nations and has developed major infrastructure projects there. Russia has expanded its military influence, including through mercenaries like the Wagner Group.\n\n“We see Russia continuing to peddle cheap weapons,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Tuesday at a summit session. “And also, we see Russia employing mercenaries across the continent, and that is destabilizing as well.”\n\nThose countries, along with the European Union and Turkey, have each held their own summits for African leaders in recent years.\n\nIn previewing this week’s US summit, American officials have been careful to avoid framing Africa as a pawn in a larger geopolitical strategy. Instead, they have sought to emphasize Biden’s interest in cultivating ties that would benefit both the US and Africa, and finding ways to harness the continent’s potential.\n\n“The Summit, just to take a step back, is rooted in the recognition that Africa is a key geopolitical player,” Sullivan said. “The continent will shape the future, not just of the African people, but also the world.”\n\nYet the creeping leverage that Beijing and Moscow have exerted in Africa is a source of growing concern in Washington, particularly amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some African nations have been wary of criticizing the invasion, even as they are burdened by its aftereffects, including global food shortages and high energy costs.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/12/01/joe-biden-emmanuel-macron-state-visit/10790838002/", "title": "Memorable moments from Emmanuel Macron's state visit to ...", "text": "WASHINGTON — When the French come calling, you aim to impress.\n\nWith pomp and pageantry, President Joe Biden welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, to the White House on Thursday for an official state visit and dinner — the first of Biden’s presidency.\n\nThe official reason for the French leader’s visit was to celebrate the historic bond between the two longtime allies and strategize about world affairs like Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nBut the visit also comes after a diplomatic spat caused by a submarine partnership struck last year between the U.S., Australia, and Britain. The agreement cost the French its own submarine deal with the Aussies and dealt a serious blow to French national pride\n\nThat transatlantic tiff may not be forgotten, as far as the French are concerned, but Thursday was a day to focus on friendship and fraternité (brotherhood).\n\nHere are some memorable moments from Macron's visit:\n\nA 21-gun salute and a French kiss\n\nBiden and first lady Jill Biden strolled out of the White House and down a red carpet at 9:18 a.m. on the chilly, late-fall morning to await the arrival of the guests of honor. A minute later, the Macrons pulled up in a black stretch limo. The couples exchanged greetings — in true French fashion, Macron kissed Jill Biden on each cheek — and then the festivities began in earnest.\n\nThere was a military procession, a 21-gun salute, and a formal inspection of the troops. A band played “The Star-Spangled Banner” and the French national anthem, “La Marseillaise.” As the two world leaders waited to begin their remarks, the Army’s Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps — decked out in long red coats and white pants — paraded in front of the stage.\n\nAfterward, the presidents and their spouses headed to the Truman Balcony, where they waved to the crowd that had assembled on the South Lawn to watch the affair.\n\nThe war in Ukraine:Biden open to talks with Putin about ending Ukraine war as US, France show united front\n\nThe handshake(s)\n\nBody language can often reveal what people aren’t willing to say out loud. In this case, it just seemed to reinforce what Biden and Macron have said over and over again: They genuinely like each other.\n\nWhile Biden waited for his remarks to be translated into French, the two men clasped hands for several seconds. They shook hands again and shared a prolonged embrace after Macron finished speaking. Both times, a big smile stretched across the French leader’s face.\n\nThat’s a stark contrast to Macron’s awkward, white-knuckled handshake with former President Donald Trump at a NATO summit in Brussels in 2017. That handshake — which Macron reportedly practiced after watching videos of Trump’s technique — came across like a test of wills, with the French president seeming determined to demonstrate to the American president that he’d met his match in the transatlantic quest for dominance.\n\nGift exchange\n\nShowing up at a fancy affair empty-handed is très gauche (or as Americans would say, tacky). So naturally, the first families exchanged gifts.\n\nThe Bidens presented the Macrons with a custom mirror made of fallen wood from the White House grounds. The mirror, by an American furniture maker, is a reproduction of a looking glass from the White House collection that hangs in the West Wing.\n\nThe president gifted his French counterpart with a custom vinyl record collection of American musicians and an archival facsimile print of Thomas Edison’s 1877 Patent of the American Phonograph. Jill Biden gave Brigitte Macron a gold and emerald pendant necklace designed by a French-American designer.\n\nThe Macrons came bearing multiple gifts for their hosts, including a vinyl record and CD of the original soundtrack of director Claude Lelouch’s \"Un Homme et une femme,” the 1966 film the Bidens went to see on their first date.\n\nThe Bidens also got a cup from Christofle, a French manufacturer of fine silverware; a sweater from House St. James; and a watch from LIP Horlogerie. Jill Biden got copies of Gustave Flaubert’s “Madame Bovary” and Albert Camus’ “The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays.”\n\nFrench tiff:Macron, in Washington, slams Biden climate incentives as 'super aggressive' to French firms\n\nA constellation of guests\n\nThe Bidens and the Macrons weren’t the only big names at the state dinner. A constellation of stars from the world of politics, business, and entertainment scored an invitation to the glitzy soiree on the White House South Lawn.\n\nAmong the well-known attendees: Vice President Kamala Harris; actresses Jennifer Garner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Ariana DeBose; Apple CEO Tim Cook; cabinet secretaries Antony Blinken (secretary of state), Pete Buttigieg (transportation) and Lloyd Austin (defense); House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Republican who hopes to succeed her, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California; Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour; and musicians Jon Legend and Jon Batiste, who provided the night’s entertainment.\n\n\"It's going to be fire,\" Batiste promised reporters ahead of his performance.\n\nFrench fashion designer Christian Louboutin, who also made the cut, smiled when reporters asked how many of the night's guests might be wearing his fancy footwear.\n\n\"Let me check,\" he said.\n\nMoving on:Can U.S. and France move past tensions triggered by submarine deal? C'est possible.\n\nHaute cuisine, American style\n\nWhat do you feed the guests of honor when they happen to hail from the place that introduced the world to haute cuisine? If you’re the Bidens, you stuff them with American gastronomy.\n\nInside a heated pavilion on the South Lawn, more than 300 guests sat at a mix of square and rectangular tables with dark blue silk cloths, red candles, and arrangements of red, white and blue flowers, including white irises, the official flower of France.\n\nThey gorged on butter-poached Maine lobster, beef with shallot marmalade, and a selection of American cheeses. For dessert, there was orange chiffon cake with roasted pears — and in a nod to the French — crème fraiche ice cream.\n\n'Vive la France, and God bless America'\n\nIn the spirit of friendship, Biden and Macron saluted each other with a traditional toast of American sparkling wine.\n\nBiden noted that France was the United States' first ally and the first to fly an American flag after the Revolutionary War.\n\n“Vive la France, and God bless America,” he said, clinking glasses with the French leader.\n\nMacron stressed that the longtime relationship between the two countries “means a lot” to the French.\n\n“We come from the same values, principles,” he said, warning that those principles are now in jeopardy by people looking to reverse them.\n\nMichael Collins and Francesca Chambers cover the White House.

But now that he’s the leader of the world’s largest democracy, the Biden administration has been embracing him more closely as it seeks to counter China’s global influence.\n\nGiven Modi’s history with the U.S., there were bound to be some unusual, and even awkward, moments during his state visit:\n\nPomp and pageantry:Here's why Democrats and Republicans welcome a visit from right-wing Indian PM Narendra Modi\n\nRed carpets and yellow yoga mats\n\nNot many state visits start with yoga.\n\nBut Modi not only walked the red carpet, he stretched out on a yellow yoga mat.\n\nModi, a yoga enthusiast, and roughly 1,000 other practitioners of the Hindu spiritual and aesthetic discipline demonstrated their technique on Wednesday, Day One of Modi’s four-day visit to the United States.\n\nThe 72-year-old grey-bearded prime minister took his place on a mat on the grassy North Lawn area outside the United Nations headquarters in New York. For the next half hour, he practiced breathing exercises, meditation, backbends and other poses.\n\n\"Namaste,\" he told the crowd before the exercises began.\n\nThe event was held in recognition of the International Day of Yoga, which Modi persuaded the U.N. to observe annually not long after he became India’s leader in 2014. This year’s event set a Guinness World Record for most nationalities – 135 – at a yoga session.\n\nModi’s message to his fellow yoga enthusiasts: \"Let's use the power of yoga, not only to be healthy, happy, but to be kind to ourselves and each other.”\n\nYoga diplomacy:Ahead of U.S. state visit, India's leader takes to his mat at the U.N.\n\nThe first lady and Modi take a field trip\n\nThe first couple of times the Bidens hosted a foreign dignitary for a state visit, Jill Biden arranged an outing with the leader’s spouse.\n\nShe took Brigitte Macron, wife of French President Emmanuel Macron, to the interactive Plant Word museum just a few blocks from the White House. Kim Keon Hee, wife of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, got a private tour of the National Gallery of Art.\n\nBut Modi’s spouse didn’t accompany him on the trip to Washington. What’s more, Joe Biden wasn’t in town for Modi’s arrival on Wednesday. He was traveling back to Washington from California, where he had been raising money for his reelection campaign.\n\nSo the first lady and the prime minister took a quick field trip to National Science Foundation in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, to highlight workforce training programs.\n\nModi, who arrived late, missed a demonstration of a robot creating abstract art on paper and another showing how an underwater robot can be used to aid fishing. But in brief remarks, he said his government has established labs in schools to encourage young entrepreneurs.\n\nHis goal, he said, is to make this decade a “tech decade.”\n\nA plant-based feast\n\nThe night before the official state dinner, the Bidens hosted Modi for a private dinner at the White House, where they dined on a few of the president’s favorite foods, including pasta and ice cream.\n\nThe menu for the official state dinner on Thursday catered to Modi’s palate.\n\nModi is a vegetarian, so the 400 invited guests were served an entirely plant-based meal: A salad of marinated millet. Corn and compressed watermelon. Stuffed portobello mushrooms and saffron risotto. Strawberry shortcake infused with rose and cardamom.\n\nThe first lady enlisted the help of chef Nina Curtis, who specializes in plant-based cooking, to work with White House chefs to come up with the menu.\n\nGuests were given the option of adding fish to the main course.\n\nModi (finally) meets the press\n\nIt’s not unusual for Biden to hold a joint news conference with foreign leaders when they visit the White House.\n\nBut when Modi took the dais in the White House East Room on Thursday for a Q&A with Biden, it was a remarkable turn of events.\n\nModi, who tries to avoid unscripted moments and has presided over a steady decline in press freedom in his country, has never held a solo news conference and often avoids questions by deferring to others on stage with him.\n\nBiden and Modi each answered two questions – one from an Indian journalist who asked Modi about climate change, the other from a Wall Street Journal reporter who pressed him on human rights concerns. It was the first time Modi had fielded a question at a news conference since he came to power in 2014.\n\nThe news conference was a scaled-down affair compared with those usually held as part of a state visit. Even so, Modi’s advisers were far from thrilled with the idea. Administration officials advised his team that taking questions from the media was standard protocol for White House state visits.\n\nModi’s people finally relented and agreed to the news conference – but not until the day it was to be held.\n\n'No space for discrimination':India's leader claims government doesn't have a human rights problem\n\n'No space for discrimination' in India\n\nModi’s state visit infuriated human rights advocates who blame him for widespread attacks against India’s Muslims and other minorities.\n\nBiden’s administration has accused India’s government of participating in unlawful and arbitrary killings, restricting freedom of speech and allowing violence against religious, racial and ethnic minorities. A group of more than 70 lawmakers asked Biden in a letter Tuesday to raise the human rights concerns during Modi’s visit.\n\nBut during his joint news conference with Biden, Modi insisted there was no discrimination in India and argued that democracy is in India’s DNA.\n\n“Democracy is our spirit, democracy runs in our veins – we live democracy,” he said, speaking through an interpreter.\n\n“There's absolutely no space for discrimination,\" he insisted, which must have been news to his detractors.\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers and The Associated Press\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

It comes a year after the US announced a surprise US-Australia submarine partnership – upending France’s own submarine deal with Australia and infuriating French officials. The perilous relations are no small matter, given the array of major challenges facing the larger western alliance.\n\n“If you look at what’s going on in Ukraine, look at what’s going on in the Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China, France is really at the center of all those things,” said John Kirby, the National Security Council’s coordinator for strategic communications. “President Macron has been the dynamic leader inside the G7 … so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country to start with for state visits.”\n\nIn an early sign of that diplomacy, the Elysee confirmed to CNN on Thursday a series of gifts exchanged between the world leaders and their spouses.\n\nMacron gifted his US counterpart a centerpiece from French goldsmith and tableware house, Christofle, the Elysee said. The present, crafted in 2012, is a tribute to the French transatlantic liner, the “Normandie,” which sailed with a Christofle silverware collection in the interwar period, per the Elysee.\n\nBiden was also presented with a vinyl record and CD of the soundtrack of the film “A man and a woman,” directed by Frenchman Claude Lelouch. The Elysee described the gift as a “nod to the personal history of the Biden couple” as they watched the 1966 film during their first date. The film also won France’s highest film award, the Palme d’Or at the Cannes film festival.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden received two French literary works: a copy of “Madame Bovary,” by Gustave Flaubert, as well as a collection of essays written by Albert Camus, per the Elysee.\n\nFinally, Biden received two gifts from the Elysee Palace gift shop, a watch from watchmaker LIP and a jumper from the French brand Saint James.\n\nButter-poached Maine lobster and calotte of beef, shallot marmalade, are seen at the White House during a media preview of the state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron. Yuri Gripas/Abaca/Sipa USA/AP\n\nThe dinner has domestic political overtones, as well. As the Bidens roll out the red carpet for Macron and his wife Brigitte, there’s word they have two more state dinners in the works along with several other social events to come. Several people with knowledge of White House planning and operations, who spoke to CNN for this story, confirmed this State Dinner will be one of several hosted by the Biden administration in upcoming months.\n\nIt may suggest, said those familiar with the thinking around future state dinners, Biden indeed wants to run for a second term, something he has said he intends to do, but a decision that also hinges on the consent and support of his wife and extended family.\n\n“These are intricate – and expensive – events,” said one of the people, who has worked in the White House, of state dinners. “If the administration is willing to sink budget dollars into them, there’s probably a larger strategy at play.”\n\nThe guest list for Biden’s first state dinner was big from the start, made extra-large to include all of the people who have missed out on key social time with the president due to Covid-19 restrictions. Having done the mental calculations months ago as planning began, said two people familiar with the dinner’s details, the East Wing, the West Wing, the State Department and the National Security Council’s lists ballooned.\n\nAmong those attending the state dinner were celebrities and musicians, as well as top lawmakers, according to a printout of guests from the White House. Stephen Colbert, Anna Wintour and John Legend were among the invitees to rub shoulders with the likes of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy.\n\nTwo guests of Macron – the head designers for fashion house Oscar de la Renta, Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia – confirmed to CNN that Jill Biden wore the luxury label at the dinner.\n\nGarcia said they collaborated with the first lady for about two months on the dress, getting her input on what she wanted for the look, which included “a sense of ease.”\n\nThis first State Dinner offered the opportunity to finally make amends to VIPs and diplomats, members of Congress and deep-pocketed donors. A decision was made to hold the dinner in a tent on the South Lawn, which would allow them to comfortably seat the more than 400 guests expected to attend. (The White House is referring to the tent as a “pavilion,” as it has clear panels on the sides.)\n\nAn indoor dinner in the State Dining Room is limited by space restrictions – only about 120 guests can be accommodated. The second and last Trump administration State Dinner, for Australia, was held in the Rose Garden, which could seat approximately 200 for a formal dinner.\n\n“We’ve always expected a larger guest list as it’s the first state dinner of the Biden Administration,” Vanessa Valdivia, Jill Biden’s press secretary, told CNN.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe dinner for France was actually supposed to take place months prior, said the two people, but scheduling conflicts, including campaign trips for midterm elections, foreign travel and the wedding of Naomi Biden, meant the date was pushed back more than once. Thursday evening was ultimately where the schedules of several executive branch agencies landed with clear calendars.\n\nUnfortunately for the White House social offices and usher’s office, the final date also meant pulling off the ritual of holiday decorations and dozens of White House holiday parties in tandem with a debut State Dinner, something that has not been done before during a modern presidency. The White House calligraphers, kitchen staff, service teams and floral shop all worked to juggle the demands of overlapping, high-caliber events.\n\nAncillary kitchen space has been added with refrigeration units placed outside the White House kitchen area, as is usually the case for multiple or large social events, especially during the busy holiday party season where there can be as many as two or three receptions per day. (Three of the industrial-sized refrigerators outside earlier this week were labeled with the word “cheese,” in black magic marker – unclear whether for the French dinner, or holiday party nibbles.)\n\nFor the State Dinner, the Bidens have opted to use rental dishes, glasses, flatware, table accoutrements and linens. The venue, though on the White House grounds, does not allow for the official White House china services to be used for the dinner, said White House social secretary Carlos Elizondo. White House curators, who oversee the use of all items in the White House collection, do not count the temporarily installed tent as part of the campus – and thus the china of presidents’ past would not be part of the service.\n\nThe overall design and the floral arrangements were put together by an event planner, Jung Lee, and her company, Fete, a posh party design outfit favored by celebrities.\n\nA stage and dance floor was erected in the tent for the evening’s entertainment from singer Jon Batiste, a New Orleans native, a city Jill Biden said Wednesday is “shaped by both French and American culture.” The Macrons will visit New Orleans after Washington, before returning to France.\n\nWhite House Executive Chef Cris Comerford presents the menu during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe décor for the dinner was inspired by red, white and blue, the shared colors of the American and French flags, and “our common values: liberty and democracy, equality and fellowship,” said Biden at a preview of the table settings and menu.\n\nThe trick of a successful State Dinner format, says a former White House social secretary, is to seamlessly and organically combine elements from both the United States and the visiting country, an offering of hospitality on the side of a main course of diplomacy. But without being too hokey about it.\n\nThe flowers on the tables Thursday night were mostly roses; American Beauty varietals and Piano Roses, deep red blooms because, as Elizondo said, Emmanuel Macron likes the piano. French-made Champagne flutes were used for toasting, but filled with American sparkling wine. Tall candelabras holding blood-red candles are meant to mimic the Statue of Liberty, France’s gift to the United States. And so on.\n\nThe table setting is something the first lady has said is always her first consideration when hosting anyone for a meal, a memory from her childhood and her mother. “Even if we were only having fish sticks from the freezer, she always made our dinners feel special,” said Biden, who is expected to make remarks at the dinner.\n\n“The first lady has been involved since the beginning, it’s been important to her that the dinner reflects the warmth and approachable hospitality that the Bidens are known for,” Valdivia said.\n\nA person with knowledge of the first lady’s hands-on approach to the dinner said she was involved with all aspects of the planning, down to doing tastings of each dish and overseeing the seating chart, much like her immediate predecessor, Melania Trump, whose first state dinner also happened to be for the Macrons. Unlike the Trump dinner, the Bidens served caviar and butter-poached lobster for a first-course, Calotte of beef and watercress and sunchoke salad for the main. Trump went with goat cheese gateau with tomato jam, and a rack of lamb. Though the two dinners would share a dessert: crème fraiche ice cream.\n\nA table is set during a media preview ahead of the State Dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on November 30, 2022. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnother common thread with Biden’s immediate predecessor is the lack of a high number of state dinners by this time in his presidency. However, for much of it, Biden has not been able due to the pandemic to host parties. Trump had a third State Dinner in the works – for the King and Queen of Spain – but canceled it as the pandemic took hold around the world.\n\nBiden is also not as inclined socially to host big events at the White House, Covid-19 restrictions or not. The first couple has notably spent most weekends away from Washington in Delaware or Camp David, and as a closely bonded family, there are few occasions where guest lists for dinners expand beyond relatives.\n\nPrevious presidents have used the White House frequently to entertain, typically with a subtext, whether political or cultural. In recent history, Barack and Michelle Obama hosted birthday parties and music concerts, bringing together celebrities and politicians for fun-filled, late nights of elbow-rubbing and bonding. The Obamas’ State Dinner for then-French President Francois Hollande in 2014 brought a star-studded guest list that included Bradley Cooper, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Stephen Colbert and Elon Musk.\n\nSinger Mary J. Blige entertained at the dinner. By contrast, Trump’s two state dinners lacked bold-faced guests and headliners, as his political leanings were often antithetical from those of mainstream Hollywood. (For the Trump State Dinner for Macron, the Washington National Opera performed, which a guest told CNN was lovely, “but it wasn’t Beyonce.”)\n\nUS President Gerald Ford dances with Britain's Queen Elizabeth II during a state dinner in Washington, DC, in 1976.

Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images In pictures: White House state dinners Prev Next\n\nGoing back further, presidents accumulated State Dinners as a means to help soothe icy relationships, or build support on geopolitical crises.\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt, for example, continued to hold State Dinners during World War II, to pull in allies. Dwight Eisenhower in 1959 hosted Nikita Khrushchev, the first State Dinner for a Soviet leader, to help quell concerns of escalating nuclear tension. Jimmy Carter was not a big party guy – the State Dinners hosted by the president and Rosalyn Carter did not include hard liquor, just beer and wine – but he had held 33 State Dinners by this time in his tenure. After the signing of the Panama Canal treaties, Carter hosted one state dinner for 18 Latin American heads of state, according to data collected by the White House Historical Association.\n\nAs time went on, guest lists for the dinners routinely grew, observed by the orders for presidential china sets, which went from accommodating about 100 people, to the most recent official set for the Obamas, which accommodated 320 people. Biden, in other words, still has the time and the space to showcase the highest form of diplomacy this country can offer another world leader. And he intends to.\n\n“There are more being planned and in the works for the future,” said one of the people with knowledge of the larger Biden State Dinner strategy. “This is just the start.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/biden-macron-state-visit/index.html", "title": "Biden and Macron affirm commitment to Ukraine but diverge on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nUS President Joe Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday demonstrated a united front in addressing the ongoing war in Ukraine but offered divergent answers over their willingness to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin, relaying that they spent much their recent meeting discussing the invasion.\n\nBiden told reporters during a joint White House news conference with Macron that he “has no immediate plans” to contact Putin, but added that he’s prepared to speak with the Russian leader if he’s looking for a way to end the war in Ukraine. Biden also clarified that Putin has not done so yet.\n\n“He’s just miscalculated across the board,” Biden said of Putin following his bilateral meeting in the Oval Office with the French president. “And so the question is … how does he get himself out of the circumstances in? I’m prepared, if he’s willing to talk, to find out what he’s willing to do, but I’ll only do it in consultation with my NATO allies. I’m not going to do it on my own.”\n\nMacron said that once Ukraine sets conditions for a peace agreement, he’s willing to speak with Putin. The French leader told ABC’s “Good Morning America” earlier Thursday that he intends to speak with the Russian president in the coming days.\n\nFirm US support, Macron also relayed, “is very important, not just for the Ukrainians … but for the stability of our world today. Because if we consider that we can abandon the country and abandon the full respect of these principles, it means that there is no possible stability in this world,” pledging France’s own increased military, economic, and humanitarian support.\n\nThe French president’s trip to the White House alongside his spouse, Brigitte Macron, marks their second time as the guests of honor for a state visit, having first done so during Donald Trump’s administration in 2018. Thursday’s agenda for Biden’s first state visit since taking office has been filled with formal fanfare, with a list of events intended to highlight the strength of the critical relationship between the US and its oldest ally.\n\nAt the start of the news conference, Biden called the US and France the “strongest partners and our most capable allies,” taking care to note that “Emmanuel has also become a friend, as well as President of that great country.”\n\nIn his opening remarks, Macron praised Biden for fulfilling campaign commitments linked to addressing international challenges, saying “we’re being able to re-engage with you.”\n\n“I can only tell you once again how pleased we were with your choices that very much matched your history and your campaign commitments. The fact that you’re back on international challenges such as health and climate – it is really a New Deal,” the French leader said.\n\nEarlier Thursday morning, the Macrons had stepped onto the South Lawn of the White House for an official arrival ceremony, where a long slate of top French and US officials as well as thousands of other attendees greeted them. The pomp-filled program included military honors, a 21-gun salute, both countries’ national anthems, a review of troops and remarks by both leaders.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Biden referred to the Macrons as “close friends,” remarking that it is a “genuine honor to host you for the first state visit of my administration and to celebrate the current strength and vitality between France and the United States of America.”\n\nFrance, Biden said, is the United States’ “oldest ally” and an “unwavering partner,” referencing the history of the relationship from Lafayette to the beaches of Normandy. He said the alliance will “grow stronger for decades to come.”\n\nMacron referenced common values of the US and France, referring to the nations as “sisters in the fight for freedom” and calling for their countries “to become brothers in arms once more” in the midst of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Macrons’ return for another state visit also follows a dramatic bounce-back in US-French relations compared to just a year ago, when Macron took the extraordinary step of recalling his ambassador to Washington over a US-Australia submarine deal that blindsided the French and cost them a multi-billion dollar defense contract. The rift appears to largely be behind them, and Biden and Macron have deepened their ties even more over the last year in their united efforts to combat the war on Ukraine.\n\nElysée announced that Macron gave the president four gifts: a vinyl and CD of the soundtrack to the film the first couple saw on their first date – “Un Homme et une Femme”, a cup from the house Christofle symbolizing links between France and the US, a sweater from the House Saint James and a watch from LIP Horlogerie. He also gave the first lady copies of “Madame Bovary” and “The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays.” He gifted Vice President Kamala Harris a model of the Ariane 5 rocket – a reference to common interests on space shared by the US and France.\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden and White House staff present the menu during a media preview ahead of the state dinner in honor of French President Emmanuel Macron, in the State Dining Room of the White House. Oliver Contreras/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe American president and first lady presented a custom mirror made of fallen wood from the White House grounds that’s a reproduction of a mirror that hangs in the West Wing, according to the White House. Additionally, the French president was gifted a custom vinyl collection of great American musicians along with “an archival facsimile print of Thomas Edison’s 1877 Patent of the American Phonograph,” the White House said. And the first lady gifted Mrs. Macron a pendant necklace designed by a French-American designer.\n\nAfter the official arrival ceremony at the White House, Biden and Macron began bilateral discussions for an Oval Office meeting which lasted just under three hours. Kicking off the meeting, Biden reiterated the importance of the alliance.\n\n“Things are changing rapidly, really rapidly. And it’s really important we stay in close communication. Doesn’t mean that every single solitary thing we agree on. That does mean we agree on almost everything,” he said, adding that they would work toward strengthening “security and prosperity.”\n\nMacron said the Russian invasion in Ukraine will be one of their main topics of discussion and that “sustainable peace” is about respecting sovereign nations.\n\n“We want to build peace and a sustainable peace means full respect of sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine but at the same time a new architecture to make sure we have a sustainable peace in the long run,” Macron added.\n\nUS and French officials had not expected the visit to yield any major deliverables, but both sides see it as an opportunity for the two countries to deepen their partnership on a slew of global challenges. The two sides expected to advance working group discussions that were launched in the wake of last year’s submarine affair to step up cooperation on space, cyberspace and energy issues.\n\nIn a joint statement following their meeting, the two leaders “outlined a shared vision to strengthen security and increase prosperity worldwide, combat climate change, build greater resilience to its effects, and advance democratic values.”\n\nOf particular note, the two leaders wrote they “strongly condemn Russia’s illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and stress that intentionally targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure constitutes war crimes whose perpetrators must be held accountable.”\n\nOn the Indo-Pacific, the two leaders pledge to “continue to coordinate on our concerns regarding China’s challenge to the rules-based international order, including respect for human rights, and to work together with China on important global issues like climate change.”\n\nThere are areas of disagreement that were expected to come up.\n\nOne of the biggest points of tension will be over billions of dollars in electric vehicle subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act, which applies only to those manufactured in North America. Macron has slammed the measure as protectionist and French officials said he intends to raise the issue in meetings with Biden and congressional leaders. During Thursday’s news conference, Biden confirmed that they discussed the matter in detail.\n\nHe said the US makes “no apologies” for the Inflation Reduction Act, but he admitted there were “some glitches” and changes that may need to be made to the law.\n\nMacron agreed with Biden and reiterated his belief that they’re going to “resynchronize” and said he was not searching for an exemption for his economy but to “discuss the consequences of this legislation.”\n\nIn their joint statement, the US and France said they “reaffirm their shared goal of accelerating the global green energy transition. They look forward to the work of the U.S.-EU Taskforce on the Inflation Reduction Act to further strengthen the U.S.-EU partnership on clean energy and climate through mutually beneficial ways.”\n\nFollowing their morning at the White House, Jill Biden and Brigitte Macron also visited Planet Word, a language-focused museum in Washington. President Macron also attended a lunch at the US State Department.\n\nThursday evening, the Macrons returned to the White House for the first state dinner of the Biden administration. French guests include film director Claude Lelouch, Louvre Museum Director Laurence des Cars and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault, according to the French official.\n\nA White House list of state dinner attendees also included comedian Stephen Colbert, MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, fashion designer Christian Louboutin, Laurene Powell Jobs, ABC’s Robin Roberts, musician John Legend, Chrissy Teigen, Vogue’s Anna Wintour, film director Baz Luhrmann, as well as actresses Jennifer Garner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Ariana DeBose. Biden family members, Cabinet members, politicians and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle – including Republicans Steve Scalise and Kevin McCarthy – were also on the list of attendees. New Orleans native Jon Batiste is performing musical selections.\n\nOn Wednesday, Harris welcomed President Macron to NASA to celebrate the cooperation of both nations in space.

Some 54,246 Americans were killed in the conflict.\n\nThe Bidens and their guests strolled quietly through the memorial, which features 7-foot stainless steel statues of soldiers standing in patches of juniper bushes and polished granite strips symbolizing the rice paddies of Korea. They made no public remarks, but Yoon spoke of the visit during the White House arrival ceremony the next day.\n\n“Why did they sacrifice their lives for this faraway country and for the people they never met?” he asked of the Americans killed in the war. “That was for one noble cause: to defend freedom.”\n\nShow of force:US-South Korea military drills begin after North Korea submarine missile tests\n\nGifts for the South Korean guests\n\nWhen there’s a state visit, there are usually gifts.\n\nThe Bidens presented the South Koreans with a small, handcrafted table by an American furniture maker. Made of mahogany wood and inlaid with historical White House wood, the table was inspired by traditional Korean soban tables. The gift included a vase filled with handmade paper hibiscus and rose flowers by a Korean American artist and a brass plaque to commemorate the state visit.\n\nBiden also gave Yoon a shadow box set with custom and vintage baseball memorabilia.

In exchange, Yoon reaffirmed his nation's commitment that it would not develop its own nuclear weapons.\n\nThe so-called Washington Declaration is the centerpiece of the new initiatives on cybersecurity, economic investments and more that the leaders rolled out during Yoon’s visit.\n\nA State Dinner with South Korean flair\n\nThe main event for every state visit is the dinner, the most coveted diplomatic honor – and one reserved for the U.S.'s closest allies.\n\nNaturally, this one had a decidedly Korean flair.\n\nSome 200 invited guests walked by a screen evoking traditional Korean ink brush painting. Dining tables were decked out with 6-foot-tall centerpieces of blossoming cherry tree boughs intended to suggest Washington's Tidal Basin in the springtime or the streets of Jeju. The menu featured braised beef short ribs – an American take on galbi-jjim – served with butter bean grits, sorghum-glazed carrots and pine nuts.\n\nAt the start of the soirée, Biden and Yoon toasted each other. Biden raised a glass \"to our partnership, to our people, to possibilities\" and added, \"May we do it together for another 170 years.\"\n\nYoon brought a smile to Biden's face by paying homage to his Irish roots. Speaking through an interpreter, Yoon quoted an old Irish saying that goes: \"A good friend is like a four-leaf clover.

After a bit of coaxing from Biden, Yoon took the microphone and belted out the first few stanzas – in English. The crowd gave him a standing ovation.\n\nBiden, who said he had no idea Yoon could sing, joked that he was going to tap the South Korean crooner to provide the entertainment for the next state dinner. Then, he surprised Yoon with another gift: A guitar signed by McLean.\n\nWho scored a coveted dinner invitation?\n\nThe Bidens and the guests of honor weren’t the evening's only big names.

David Hoyle, the Dean of Westminster, at Westminster Abbey. UK Prime Minister Liz Truss and Patricia Scotland, the Commonwealth Secretary General, read lessons. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby delivered a sermon. Toward the end of the service, the Last Post sounded before a two-minute silence was observed. The state funeral was brought to a conclusion by the Queen’s Piper, who played a Reveille, the National Anthem and a Lament.\n\nInvitations were sent over the weekend to the heads of state of countries with whom the United Kingdom has diplomatic relations. The list of leaders who attended the state funeral was long, and included leadership across the Commonwealth and around the world. Representatives of Syria, Russia, Belarus, Myanmar, Afghanistan and Venezuela were absent. For most nations with an invitation, attendance extended to the head of state plus a guest.\n\nFollowing Monday’s state funeral, the coffin will be conveyed from the hall to Wellington Arch before making its final journey out of London to Windsor. The Queen’s journey will end at St. George’s Chapel, within the grounds of Windsor Castle, where her coffin will be lowered into the Royal Vault below the chapel.\n\nBiden was one of the few world leaders to arrive in his own motorcade at the Queen’s funeral, but for the last 10 days, his aides have worked behind the scenes to ensure he had as small of a footprint as possible while she was laid to rest.\n\nA person familiar with the planning said the White House was very conscious about not making the trip about Biden, reviewing protocol closely in recent days as to avoid any missteps that could potentially distract from the funeral itself. Biden traveled with a smaller staff than is typical for an overseas visit, and his aides decided against scheduling even an informal meeting with Truss while in London.\n\nInstead, the only events on Biden’s schedule were those planned in coordination with the palace, the person said.\n\nMonday’s ceremonial events are the culmination of nearly two weeks of public arrangements, codenamed “Operation London Bridge.”\n\nPlans for the Queen’s funeral have been in place for years, allowing American advisers greater insight into precisely what will happen over the coming days as they make security arrangements. The White House said it received an invitation only for the President and first lady, making for a slimmed-down American footprint.\n\nSecurity in the British capital is at its highest level in memory as dozens of world leaders have convened over the weekend and into Monday to remember the late Queen, who met 13 sitting US presidents during her reign.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News last week, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said of the scale: “If you think about the London Marathon, the carnival, previous royal weddings, the Olympics – it’s all that in one.”\n\nBiden is scheduled to fly back to Washington on Monday afternoon after the funeral. During their brief visit to London, the President and first lady Jill Biden paid their respects to the Queen as she was lying in state, signed condolence books and attended a reception with other leaders and King Charles III.\n\nThe funeral takes place the same week world leaders are slated to convene for the United Nations General Assembly in New York, where Biden will hold his first bilateral meeting with Truss on Wednesday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and reporting.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/politics/white-house-pacific-island-summit/index.html", "title": "Biden hosts first ever US-Pacific Island Country Summit in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden is hosting the first ever US-Pacific Island Country Summit this week, a multi-day event in Washington focused on cooperation with the United States’ countries in the Pacific region.\n\nBiden’s effort to strengthen ties with the nations by having the summit comes amid the US’ increased focus on countering China’s global influence, and the gathering has already challenged American efforts to engage in strategic partnerships in the region.\n\nIn remarks on Thursday at the State Department with the Pacific leaders, Biden said, “A great deal of the history of our world is going to be written in the Indo-Pacific over the coming years and decades. And the Pacific islands are a critical voice in shaping that future. And that’s why my administration has made it a priority to strengthen our partnership with your countries.”\n\nLater Thursday, Biden will host the Pacific leaders for dinner at the White House and participate in an official family photo. A senior administration official told foreign pool reporters who cover the White House that the leaders will also on Thursday meet with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of Congress, as well as business groups at the US Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe summit kicked off on Wednesday when Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed leaders at the State Department and took part in events with several senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Gina Raimondo and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.\n\nWhile other presidents in the past have held summits with Pacific nations and the US, all Pacific Island countries have been invited to Washington for Biden’s summit. Leaders or representatives will be present from the Cook Islands, Fiji, French Polynesia, Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Nauru and Vanuatu. Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General are attending as observers.\n\nOn Wednesday, amid a broad set of announcements about new commitments to the Pacific region, the White House said that “the United States has directly provided over $1.5 billion to support the Pacific Islands over the past decade and today has announced over $810 million in additional expanded programs.” The US will also recognize the Cook Islands and Niue.\n\nThe White House unveiled a nine-point declaration outlining the commitments, which focus on: supporting the US-Pacific partnership, building American capacity in the region, coordinating with allies and partners, climate, the economy, security and maritime cooperation, cyber security and connectivity, Covid-19 and health security and addressing war legacies.\n\nThe administration released a US-Pacific Island Strategy for the first time on Wednesday – a plan meant to complement the earlier release of the Indo-Pacific strategy.\n\nNotably, the strategy includes efforts to expand US diplomatic missions in the Pacific and commits to deploying additional personnel across the region. The strategy would also establish the first US envoy to the Pacific Island Forum and make several climate commitments, increasing the presence of Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Department of Defense in the area.\n\n“The purpose of this document is to make it obviously consistent with the goals and objectives of our larger framing. But this is specifically aimed at the concerns and the objectives in the Pacific as a whole,” a senior administration official previewing the summit said.\n\nThat official said that the summit is meant to address the most “daunting challenges of the Pacific” including on climate change, health concerns, education training, jobs, challenges associated with recovery from Covid-19 and overfishing. The White House has worked closely in the last months with Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Great Britain and others on these issues, the official added.\n\nThe Marshall Islands earlier this month suspended talks to renew its security partnership with the US, citing the longstanding impact of US nuclear testing in the area some 70 years ago.\n\nThe declaration unveiled on Thursday indicates that the US is “exploring (unexploded ordnance) assistance options for Kiribati and the Marshall Islands in late 2022 and maintains a Quick Reaction Force to support (unexploded ordnance) engagements across the Pacific at the request of host nation partners.”\n\nChina has been expanding its ties to countries in the Pacific Ocean in recent years, and Beijing signed a security pact with the Solomon Islands in April, promising cooperation in trade and education.\n\nNations including the US and Australia expressed concerns following the announcement, and the Chinese government has denied that the country will set up a military base on the Solomon Islands.\n\nDespite earlier reports suggesting the Solomon Islands would not sign onto the declaration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday that the leaders involved in the summit have come “come together around a declaration of partnership between the US and the Pacific, one that shows that we have a shared vision for the future and a determination to build that future together.”\n\n“So I’m very pleased that we have this today, that we’ve agreed on it, and it will give us a road map for the work that we’re doing in the future,” he added.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/17/politics/white-house-easter-egg-roll-party-normalcy/index.html", "title": "The White House finally gets to throw a party | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nOn Monday the White House will become something it has yet to become while Joe and Jill Biden have been in residence: A party house.\n\nAt 6:45 a.m. ET, the first of what will ultimately be an anticipated 30,000 guests, who won tickets via a public lottery, will pour through the south gates and onto the lawn for the 142nd White House Easter Egg Roll.\n\n“Joe and I look forward to welcoming thousands of families to join us for this year’s White House Easter ‘EGGucation’ Roll!” the first lady tweeted Friday.\n\n“The Bidens are excited to open the People’s House back to the American people, after being closed to the general public because of the pandemic,” Jill Biden’s communications director, Elizabeth Alexander, told CNN, adding that preparation for the Easter Egg Roll has been months in the planning. The first lady chose the theme of “EGGucation,” a riff on her decades spent as a teacher.\n\n“The President and first lady will give remarks and kick off the egg rolling for the kids,” said Alexander, who added that Jill Biden will also read to kids at the Easter Egg Roll’s outdoor reading nook.\n\nThe day’s festivities are further evidence that life at the White House is slowly returning to a pre-pandemic version of normal, something that the Bidens have yet to experience.\n\nOn Friday, a limited schedule of White House tours resumed for the public, with tickets arranged via the visitors’ Congressional representative, and last weekend saw the return of the Spring White House Garden tours, which saw almost 30,000 ticketed members of the public over the two-day period. A White House official told CNN that, barring any significant shift in Covid-19 spikes or rising cases regionally or nationally, the hope is to build the tour schedules back up to a pre-pandemic norm of several days a week.\n\nA quieter White House\n\nBy this juncture in an administration, the White House has typically hosted two Easter Egg Rolls, a large Halloween trick-or-treat party, several significant dinners or luncheons for dignitaries, members of Congress, or other VIP leaders, as well as at least one State Dinner.\n\nDue to Covid-19, the Biden White House has been quiet.\n\n“We have worked hard over the past year to bring the White House to the American public through a variety of interactive and creative ways, on as many digital platforms as possible,” says Wayne Skinner, director of the White House Visitors Office. “But nothing can replace experiencing the history and the magic of the White House in person.”\n\nIt is Skinner’s team who has overseen and implemented the planning of the Easter Egg Roll, which is customary for the Visitors Office.\n\nThe basement-level floral workshop, run by chief White House floral designer Hediah “Roshan” Ghaffarian – who was hired by Michelle Obama in 2015 – has generally focused on day-to-day needs, such as keeping arrangements in many of the White House’s public and private room freshly rotated, says one person familiar with the operations.\n\nThe White House cooking team has also had a relative break from the mad hustle of preparing and serving hundreds of hot dinners for some of the most important guests in the world. The Chocolate Shop, one of several White House kitchens, is tasked with making and prepping the major centerpieces used when the President and first lady entertain.\n\n“It’s never ‘slow-slow,’ with nothing to do,” said a former White House official who worked closely with the White House staff and chief usher for several years to plan and oversee social events.\n\n“These are professionals who every day make food and desserts and snacks and buffets – anything that is needed. But there is a profound loss in the use of their skills, that there has not yet been entertaining needs that rise to the level of their talents,” says the person.\n\nPlans for a state dinner underway\n\nCNN has learned the plans for the first state dinner of the Biden administration are indeed underway, though it is unclear for which world leader the dinner will occur.\n\nThe former official familiar with the social activities of the White House adds a second state dinner is likely to follow quickly on the heels of the first. Alexander would not confirm the details of any upcoming state dinners, or their specific planning status, but she did say the Easter Egg Roll likely marks a jumping-off point for the resumption of such events.\n\n“The first family is looking forward to continuing to share the White House – with state dinners, celebrations, by commemorating parts of history that are coming up – events they haven’t been able to host because of the seriousness of the pandemic,” she said.\n\nStewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association – the non-profit, non-partisan organization established in 1961 by Jacqueline Kennedy to assist in the preservation and legacy of the White House – told CNN state dinners are much more than fancy dinner parties attended by celebrities and titans of industry.\n\n“State dinners often set the scene for much of the diplomatic work that an administration is trying to accomplish; they are strategic in the country that is hosted, right down to who is sitting next who in order to advance a dialogue about a certain topic,” said McLaurin.\n\nAs the global balance of power becomes more fragile, the lack of Biden state dinners, while not a crisis, have hamstrung the social, diplomatic dance done for decades behind the scenes at the White House.\n\n‘A sense of joy’\n\nHowever, McLaurin heralds the Easter Egg Roll, which is funded in full by the White House Historical Association, as a return to party normalcy.\n\n“As in regular years, the ceremonial wooden eggs – with colors selected by the first lady – are ready to go,” he said of the annual, signature eggs, which are individually hand-tooled each year by a company in Maine.\n\nHundreds of boxed sets of the commemorative eggs are sold ahead of the Easter Egg Roll by the White House Historical Association, with that money put towards the roll itself, as well as the organization’s myriad of educational programs, books and other outlets for preservation and public interest of the White House.\n\nLast year, although the Easter Egg Roll was canceled, there were wooden eggs made, but the bunny drawn on the side donned a surgical mask to mark the ongoing pandemic. This year’s eggs feature the Biden’s new pets – Willow the cat and Commander the German Shepherd puppy.\n\nThere is also a new egg color, “Biden Blue,” a rich, royal blue chosen by the first lady.\n\nFifty thousand real, hard-boiled eggs have also been prepped and readied for the stalwart egg activity: The race of kids holding an egg on a wooden spoon, with the hopes they can run fast and not drop and break their eggs. The former White House official familiar with social activities notes clean-up of the real eggs post-Egg Roll is thorough and imperative, or else the pungent smell of fetid eggs fills the air on the South Lawn.\n\nLike Biden, McLaurin says he is most excited to see the children who attend the Easter Egg Roll, and to watch their faces fill with fascination at being in the backyard of the house of the President.\n\n“A member of our board of directors, who is a native Washingtonian, said that as a child, his father used to come and sit outside the north gate of the White House the morning of the Easter Egg Roll, because adults in Washington wanted to go, but you had to have a kid to get in,” said McLaurin, recounting one of his favorite Easter Egg Roll fun facts. “These kids would rent themselves out to childless adults to go into the Egg Roll.”\n\nThere remains a healthy dose of hesitancy over whether the country is fully in the clear from the ravages of Covid-19, and the White House Visitors Office continues to monitor the latest guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and health officials, as well as regional case numbers. But continuing a tradition that has only been interrupted a handful of times since its inception in 1878 is worth the spilling of a few eggs and the chance to sip lemonade and eat snacks in the shadow of history.\n\nOnly one mystery remains: Alexander would not reveal the identity of which staff member will don the bunny suit and play the role of official White House Easter Bunny, a tradition that began with a staffer from Patricia Nixon’s East Wing.\n\n“There is a sense of joy to be able to share the White House again,” Alexander said.", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/04/17"}]}

The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other issues.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction.\n\nAfter a three-hour meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G-20 summit in November, President Joe Biden said both countries share a responsibility to \"manage our differences, prevent competition from becoming anything ever to near conflict, and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation.\"\n\nXi responded that the world \"expects that China and the United States will properly handle the relationship.\"\n\nMaintaining a dialogue\n\nBlinken was set to travel to China as an outgrowth of Biden’s meeting with Xi.\n\nBoth leaders had agreed to get their teams together to try to restore some of the lines of communication. Beijing had suspended or canceled eight official military dialogues and cooperation channels with the U.S. after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., visited Taiwan in August.\n\nLast month, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with her Chinese counterpart in Switzerland to work on repairing relations.\n\nBut senior State Department officials said it wouldn’t have been constructive for Blinken to go to China right now.

Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\n“Today I feel Qatari. Today I feel Arab. Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled. Today I feel a migrant worker,” FIFA chief Gianni Infantino said in a fiery tirade on Saturday, comparing his own plight as a redhead son of migrants to that of marginalized communities.\n\nHis ostensible empathy with Qatar was due to the barrage of criticism the nation has faced in Western media for hosting the tournament.\n\nBut it’s hypocritical of the West to be giving lessons in morality to others, he said.\n\nThose statements on the eve of the World Cup went viral, inviting much anger and ridicule. But to many Arabs and Muslims, they resonated strongly.\n\nUS actor Morgan Freeman (2nd L), Qatari singer Dana al-Fardan (2nd R), and Qatari YouTuber Ghanim al Muftah (R) perform during the Qatar 2022 World Cup opening ceremony on Sunday. Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOmar Alsaadi, a 21-year-old Qatari, told CNN that Infantino vocalized “from a Western point of view” what many of his compatriots have felt about being targets of racism.\n\nIn the run-up to the tournament, Western media coverage has been dominated by the controversies surrounding the event rather than the sport itself, including the Gulf nation’s treatment of migrant workers, its rules on LGBTQ people and its tight social restrictions. Britain’s public broadcaster, the BBC, refrained from airing the opening ceremony on television, opting instead to cover criticism of the host nation. The BBC said it did broadcast the ceremony on their video-on-demand service.\n\nThis year’s World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.\n\nThe Bedouin-themed opening ceremony on Sunday began with a female singer donning a traditional burqa, a kind of face covering that has been banned in several European countries. It also cited a verse from the Quran about God creating humanity into “nations and tribes” so they can get to know each other.\n\nAccording to social media reports, some hotel rooms in the country offer visitors QR codes to learn about Islam, and Muslim volunteers have been teaching visitors about Islamic fashion.\n\nQatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), which is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nBut in an earlier statement to CNN, the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nThe visibility of Islamic symbols in Qatar hasn’t escaped those attending. An on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of “a lot of mosques” in the country caused outrage among Muslims on social media.\n\nWestern news outlets have also been accused of peddling stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.\n\nThe Times of London on Monday said “Qataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country” in a photo caption that was later deleted after being flagged on social media. Around 87% of the country’s population of 2.9 million is made up of expatriates, many of whom are Western.\n\n“I think that the Western media is biased because they don’t want to see an Arabic success, a Muslim success in the delivering and hosting of a global cup for football in a third [world country],” Najd Al-Mohanadi, a 20-year-old Qatari, told CNN.\n\nBut some in the Western media have spoken out against stereotyping and alleged biases. Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host who previously worked for Qatar’s Al Jazeera, said recent coverage of Qatar shows “the depths of Western prejudice, performative moral outrage and, perhaps most significantly, gross double standards.”\n\nThe Economist and the New York Times have also run articles defending Qatar’s right to host the tournament. The Times of London ran an essay saying criticism of Qatar was “laced with hypocrisy.”\n\n“I always question the timing [of the criticism], as migrants throughout the region endure poor living arrangements for meager pay, while also working under strenuous physical and mental conditions,” said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher from the UAE who is studying at Oxford University in England.\n\n“Scrutiny is overdue and it makes no sense to tie it to global events where virtue-signaling becomes deeply problematic,” Al Hussein told CNN.\n\n“Especially when it comes from non-NGO entities that are themselves embroiled in human rights violations within and across their borders.”\n\nJames Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Qatar, said that while some of the coverage around Qatar in the West has reinforced negative stereotypes about the Arab Muslim world, most of the criticism has been “fair and proportionate.”\n\n“It’s absolutely right to call out instances of that kind of coverage, but wrong to generalize from those examples to imply that all, or most, criticism is driven by racism,” he said.\n\nWorkers in the country continue to “face harsh, abusive working conditions and severe exploitation, with domestic and construction workers among those most at risk,” he said, adding that Qatar’s women and LGBTQ people “face serious discrimination and repression, both in law and practice.”\n\nCritics of Western media coverage of Qatar have countered that other countries with questionable human rights records didn’t receive such scrutiny when hosting global sporting events.\n\n“At the risk of engaging in whataboutism… Qatar’s human rights records, as poor as they may be, cannot possibly be more outrageous than other countries, such as Russia, China and Israel,” said Al Hussein. “Qatar is certainly not engaging in ethnic cleansing, nor are migrants living in concentration camps, despite the poor living conditions.”\n\nMaryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said some of the recent rhetoric around Qatar shows that some Western critics have been more concerned with feeding into an “orientalist discourse,” referring to language aimed at imposing Western worldviews, than human rights.\n\n“This should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,” she said. “Rather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.”\n\nShe noted however that some over-zealous defenders of the government on the Qatari side have neglected the country’s human rights shortcomings.\n\n“Many of the people defending Qatar are also using terrifyingly pro-government language,” she said, adding that it reaches a point that doesn’t help the cause of Qatar’s migrant workers.\n\n“The plight of migrant workers in places like the US or the UK does not take away from the fact that we have problems in Qatar,” AlHajri told CNN. “It shouldn’t be about whataboutism.”\n\nWith additional reporting from Mariam Dirar Alqasem in Doha\n\nIran protests\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN hears testimony from women who say they experienced sexual violence by Iranian regime 06:31 - Source: CNN\n\nSocial media videos have emerged allegedly showing Iranian security forces sexually assaulting female demonstrators on the streets.\n\nWith media access inside Iran severely constrained, CNN went to the region near Iraq’s border with Iran, interviewing eyewitnesses who’d left the country and verifying accounts from survivors and sources both in and outside Iran.\n\nThe covert testimonies revealed sexual assaults on male and female activists as a women-led uprising spreads throughout Iran.\n\nUS Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley on Tuesday tweeted it is “a reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people - and of the lengths to which the regime will go in its futile attempt to silence dissent.”\n\nRead the article here.\n\nHere’s the latest on the protests in Iran:\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Tuesday that the rising number of protest-related deaths highlights the “critical” nature of the situation in the country. The UN said its sources had reported over 40 deaths “in mainly Kurdish cities in the past week.”\n\nForty foreign nationals “affiliated in riots” have been arrested in Iran since protests started in September, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Masood Satayshi said without revealing their nationalities.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday the US is taking steps to “push back against actions Iran is taking to repress its own people.”\n\nMobile internet was restored in Iran after a major disruption on Monday, according to internet watchdog NetBlocks, which said that cellular data was down for about 3.5 hours as security forces cracked down on protesters in the Kurdish region of Iran.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nSaudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.\n\nMany had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.\n\nWatch CNN’s Becky Anderson speak to celebrating fans of the Saudi team:\n\nAlso read:\n\nThe digest\n\nTeenage student dies in twin explosions in Jerusalem\n\nTwo explosions shook Jerusalem early Wednesday, killing one person and injuring 18 others in a suspected “combined terror attack,” according to an Israeli police spokesperson. The first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance of Jerusalem, killing a 16-year-old student at a Jewish seminary, his family told local media. The second explosion occurred almost half an hour later at the city’s Ramot junction. Initial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects, the police spokesperson said.\n\nBackground: The attack brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side of the conflict to at least 29 this year. This year has also been the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015.\n\nWhy it matters: Jerusalem has not seen a double bombing like this one in many years. Prime Minister Yair Lapid said after participating in a situation assessment with security officials that the incident was “different from what we have seen in recent years.” The explosions come after months of tensions in the occupied West Bank.\n\nRussia to build attack drones for Ukraine war with the help of Iran, intelligence assessment says\n\nIran and Russia have reached an agreement to begin the production of attack drones in Russia, according to a new intelligence assessment from a country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program. Iran is beginning to transfer blueprints and components for the drones to Russia after the initial agreement was struck earlier this month, said a source familiar with the assessment.\n\nBackground: US officials have said that Russia has received hundreds of drones from Tehran which have had a deadly effect in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the Iranian government acknowledged for the first time that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhy it matters: The move would further cement the partnership between Tehran and Moscow and likely provoke significant anger from Ukraine and its western allies including the US. Sources explained that the goal is for Russia to produce thousands of new attack drones using Iranian components and blueprints.\n\nSaudi Arabia says it may take steps to balance market\n\nOil rose on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ was sticking with output cuts and could take further steps to balance the market, outweighing global recession worries and concern about China’s rising Covid-19 case numbers, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday was also cited by state news agency SPA as denying a Wall Street Journal report that said OPEC was considering boosting output.\n\nBackground: The Wall Street Journal earlier on Monday reported an output increase of 500,000 barrels per day was under discussion for the next meeting of OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on December 4. The report cited unidentified OPEC delegates. The report sent oil prices plunging by more than 5%.\n\nWhy it matters: The oil cartel last month cut production by 2 million barrels per day in an effort to stabilize the market “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” The oil cut was made despite strong US pressure against it. Potential further cuts could exacerbate already tense relations between the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim Abbas Al Lawati", "Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/11/biden-brokers-middle-east-deal-israel-lebanon-mediterranean/10469175002/", "title": "Biden: Middle East deal will boost gas extraction in Mediterranean ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – A maritime agreement the U.S. brokered between Israel and Lebanon will make the region more stable while boosting worldwide production of natural gas, President Joe Biden said Tuesday.\n\nIf the agreement is ratified, Lebanon could explore for natural gas in the Mediterranean, a development that could ease its energy and economic crisis.\n\nIsrael could continue to extract gas amid expected lower tensions with Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group, according to the White House.\n\nThe Biden administration hopes increased energy production can also help ease the global energy crunch caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe latest\n\nThe agreement is a major breakthrough in relations between Israel and Lebanon, which formally have been at war since Israel’s establishment in 1948.\n\nThe dispute over their shared maritime border goes back decades.\n\nU.S. efforts to negotiate an agreement began in the Obama administration and restarted about a year ago, according to a senior administration official who discussed the mediation on condition of anonymity.\n\nIsrael and Lebanon have agreed to a permanent maritime boundary. The approximately 330 square miles of the Mediterranean Sea that both claim would be divided along a line straddling the Qana natural gas field.\n\nWhat's about to happen\n\nIsrael and Lebanon need to ratify the agreement. Administration officials said they’re optimistic that will happen because it delivers “critical wins” for both sides.\n\nBut former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who hopes voters will return him to power in next month’s election, opposes the agreement and has vowed to cancel it if he wins.\n\nBecause there are no formal diplomatic relations between Israel and Lebanon, the deal is not a bilateral agreement but arranged through the United States. Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid and President Michel Aoun of Lebanon that the U.S. will help mediate any implementation disputes that arise, according to the administration's descriptions of Biden’s calls with the leaders Tuesday.\n\nTop takeaways\n\nThe White House described the agreement as an outgrowth of Biden’s attempts to foster a “more stable, prosperous, integrated” region in the Middle East.\n\nThe Lebanese, most of whom have less than two hours of electricity a day, must solve its energy crisis to have any hope for an economic recovery. While gas exploration will take time, Lebanon could benefit in the short term from foreign investment, the senior administration official said.\n\nAnd Israel needs security and stability in the eastern Mediterranean to continue to rely on those waters for most of its electricity and to be able to export energy, according to the White House.\n\nWhat they are saying\n\n“The agreement announced by both governments today will provide for the development of energy fields for the benefit of both countries, setting the stage for a more stable and prosperous region, and harnessing vital new energy resources for the world,” Biden said in a statement.\n\n“This is an historic achievement that will strengthen Israel’s security, inject billions into Israel’s economy, and ensure the stability of our northern border,” Lapid said in a statement.\n\n\"It might help create and strengthen the mutual deterrence between Israel and Hezbollah,\" Yoel Guzansky, a senior fellow at Israel's Institute for National Security Studies told The Associated Press.\n\n“I just have one question: what are the specific terms of the deal? Absent disclosure, the discussion is childish and meaningless,” tweeted David M.

His administration also released an intelligence report last year that directly accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of orchestrating Khashoggi’s killing.\n\nBut officials say Biden, who is under immense pressure to crack down on Russia and lower domestic gas prices amid inflation that’s rising at the fastest pace since 1981, has set aside his moral outrage to pursue warmer relations with the Kingdom amid the dramatic global upheaval spurred by the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“Both sides have decided that for the sake of achieving peace and stability in the Middle East, we need to move past it,” said one senior US official, referring to Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudis, for their part, consider the Khashoggi case closed—and have made that clear to the US, officials said.\n\nThat doesn’t mean forgiving and forgetting, the sources noted. Biden, they said, does plan to raise Khashoggi’s murder directly with MBS, as the crown prince is known, when they meet as soon as next month. And some officials inside the administration still believe more should be done to hold MBS accountable for the crime. But the shift is now well underway after months of meetings in Riyadh between two of Biden’s top national security advisers, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein, and Saudi officials, including MBS. And it is already sparking outrage, with Khashoggi’s fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, accusing Biden of losing his moral compass.\n\n“President Biden’s decision to meet MBS is horribly upsetting to me and supporters of freedom and justice everywhere,” she said in a statement to CNN.\n\nA human rights defender in Washington close to the administration, who was also a close friend of Khashoggi’s, told CNN that he believes moving on and doing nothing more to hold MBS accountable for Khashoggi’s killing will deal a huge blow to the prince’s opposition and Arab dissidents around the world.\n\n“The promise of accountability was the only check on this guy [MBS], now it’s gone,” he said. “When the President of the US goes to this murderer’s hometown to appease him, he’s not only glossing over his past heinous crimes with stunning impunity but enabling his future ones. It’s a wink-wink nudge-nudge to commit the next crime in a cleaner, less messy fashion.”\n\nUS officials told CNN that the decision to meet with MBS has been a tough pill to swallow for the President, who said in 2019 that Saudi Arabia had “no redeeming social value.” But they said the countries have agreed that the relationship cannot be held “hostage” by the murder, especially given how dramatically the world has changed since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nAmong the US’ most important foreign policy goals now is to isolate Russia politically and cut off funding for its war machine by banning Russian oil exports – two objectives that officials believe will be nearly impossible if Saudi Arabia is not on the US’ side, particularly when it comes to increasing oil production to try to stabilize global oil markets. The President and his senior national security advisers therefore believe that to “shun” Saudi Arabia over the murder of Khashoggi would be shortsighted.\n\nThe troubling economic trends, particularly when it comes to record high domestic gas prices and soaring inflation, have also come to dominate the priorities of the administration and shunted others aside, said a US official outside the White House.\n\n“I do think the desperation of the trajectory of the global economy is driving everything,” the official said. “They [the White House] are anxious, they are desperate.”\n\n“Their fear, and their anxiety, is making them throw principle out the door,” the official added. “The worst [economic] outcomes on this are really bad and would devastate any hopes the Democrats would have in November.”\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN en Español on Wednesday that the administration never sought to fully “rupture” US-Saudi relations, even after releasing the report last year that put MBS at the center of Khashoggi’s murder. But he said that the US would continue “to make sure that human rights is fully reflected in our foreign policy.”\n\nOil prices driving the reset\n\nBiden’s advisers have said openly that the need to increase oil production to stabilize prices is a key driver of the Saudi reset.\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday that “there is no doubt that Saudi Arabia has to account for what they did with Jamal Khashoggi.” But, she added, “there is also no question that we have to increase global [oil] supply. And OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, is at the head of the pack for that.”\n\nThere are of course things the Saudis want in return from the US, including a viable strategy for dealing with Iran – the Kingdom’s biggest regional enemy – as the US struggles to finalize a new nuclear deal. The Saudis also want security commitments, like the continued provision of missile defense systems, officials said.\n\nBut White House officials argue that Saudi Arabia has been working with the US in good faith over the last several months, which has made the White House more confident that a meeting between Biden and MBS will be fruitful.\n\nUS officials have repeatedly pointed to the fragile ceasefire in Yemen reached in April and the Saudi’s ouster of Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who was viewed by many officials in the region and in the US as an impediment to peace, as major diplomatic victories that would not have been possible without US engagement. The two-month-old ceasefire, which was extended last week, is the first between the warring Saudis and Houthis in six years.\n\n“I’m not going to change my view on human rights,” Biden said last week. “But as President of the United States, my job is to bring peace if I can. And that’s what I’m going to try to do.”\n\nWorking on a ‘significant agenda’\n\nA National Security Council spokesperson noted that the Khashoggi murder took place during the Trump administration, telling CNN that the US is “not looking past any conduct that took place before we entered office.” The spokesperson pointed to the sanctions the US has imposed on Saudi individuals believed to have been involved in Khashoggi’s murder and others implicated in human rights abuses.\n\nBut the spokesperson also said the US has “a significant agenda with Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the other countries of the Middle East. That agenda is focused on delivering results for the American people as well as ending wars and leading through diplomacy to bring stability to the Middle East region.”\n\nLast week’s agreement by OPEC+ to increase oil production by 200,000 barrels per day in July and August, a decision spearheaded by Saudi Arabia, was another show of good faith by the Saudis, officials believe. And with help from the United States, relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia are also slowly but steadily improving, officials noted – discussions are underway now, for example, to expand Israeli commercial planes’ access to Saudi airspace, the sources said. One regional official briefed on the discussions said Israel wants the Saudis to allow Israeli Arab Muslims to fly to the Kingdom for religious pilgrimages.\n\nIsrael has been pushing heavily for the Biden-MBS meeting to happen, multiple officials said. And underscoring the changing nature of the Israel-Saudi relationship, Biden is expected to make an extraordinarily rare flight directly from Tel Aviv to Riyadh on Air Force One while in the Middle East next month, according to two regional officials briefed on the plans.\n\nStill, those developments are unlikely to satisfy activists and American lawmakers who continue to call for further accountability and justice for Khashoggi.\n\n“The highest levels of the Saudi government, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are culpable in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, and there is no escaping that stark truth laid bare in the U.S. Intelligence Community’s 2021 public assessment,” top House lawmakers wrote in a letter to Biden earlier this week. “We must continue to insist on justice for this horrific crime.”", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Alex Marquardt", "Natasha Bertrand", "Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/06/state-of-the-union-biden-inflation-war-immigration-economy/11154261002/", "title": "State of the Union 2023: Biden to focus on war, immigration, inflation", "text": "WASHINGTON – A divided Congress.

Before and after: In the week before the speech, Biden traveled to Maryland, Pennsylvania and New York to tout transportation and other projects funded by his major infrastructure package. Biden and his Cabinet members are expected to travel to at least 20 states in the days after the address to talk up the administration’s economic agenda. The president will be in Wisconsin on Wednesday and Florida on Thursday.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine\n\nBiden devoted the first 11 minutes of last year’s hourlong address to supporting Ukraine, a rallying cry delivered just days after Russia’s invasion. The war probably will figure prominently this year as well. Biden will be speaking in the run-up to the one-year anniversary. And while Russia did not have the swift success many anticipated a year ago, the longer the fighting continues, the harder it will be for Biden to maintain support for Ukraine at home and abroad.\n\nMany GOP House members are calling for greater scrutiny – or even a curtailment -- of U.S. involvement. That reflects eroding support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents nationwide. The share of Republicans who say the U.S. gives too much aid to Ukraine has steadily increased since March, according to the Pew Research Center. Also, unlike at the start of the war, there’s now a wide partisan gap over whether Russia’s invasion of Ukraine poses a major threat to U.S. interests.\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine:As Biden seeks to avoid wider war, delivery of M1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine escalates conflict\n\nChinese spy balloon\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\nSunday shows:Joe Biden's downed China spy balloon deepens political fight ahead of State of the Union\n\nFederal spending and debt ceiling\n\nExpect to hear a lot about the federal budget. The dispute between Biden and congressional Republicans over the federal deficit and whether budget cuts must be agreed to before the debt limit is raised will dominate the debate in Washington over the next few months.\n\nBiden is expected to amplify his argument that Republicans are holding the economy hostage by not automatically agreeing to paying the bills the U.S. already owes. House Republicans don’t want to raise the debt limit without cutting future spending. Biden, who will lay out his budget plan March 9, has been challenging Republicans to specify what they want to cut. He has also been comparing his record on deficit reduction with Republicans’.\n\nU.S. hits debt ceiling: Amid fears of debt default, Treasury begins 'extraordinary' measures\n\nCall for bipartisanship in Washington\n\nFacing a GOP-controlled House that can block his legislative agenda and is launching investigations into his family and administration, Biden is nonetheless likely to make a case for getting along. Always eager to burnish his bipartisan bona fides, Biden is expected to highlight issues he has worked on with Republicans over the past two years, including a major infrastructure package in 2021.\n\nAfter the midterm elections, Biden said he was “ready to compromise with Republicans where it makes sense.” But he flatly ruled out fundamental changes to Social Security and Medicare, or compromising in other areas such as abortion rights, prescription drug costs and climate change.\n\nA new Congress with new priorities:What to know about Speaker McCarthy and the fate of Biden's agenda\n\nImmigration reform\n\nBiden called for immigration reform during last year’s State of the Union, telling lawmakers, “Let’s get it done once and for all.” It didn’t happen, so look for him to mention immigration again in this year’s address.\n\nJust last month, Biden traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border, where he heard pleas for help in addressing the migrant crisis. The number of migrants crossing the border – some lawfully seeking asylum, others entering illegally – has risen dramatically during his first two years in office. Republicans blame the surge on Biden’s border policies. Last week, the GOP-led House Judiciary Committee opened the first in a series of hearings it is calling “Biden’s border crisis.”\n\nBiden could use his speech to remind Americans of steps his administration has taken to the secure the border and to once again urge Congress to pass immigration reform.\n\nA legal morass:As Biden hunts for answers to migrant crisis, his policies are increasingly tied up in court\n\nInflation and the economy\n\nBiden celebrated when the government reported last month that inflation eased substantially for the third month in a row. “My economic plan is actually working,” he said. You can bet he'll emphasize that point again in Tuesday's address.\n\nIt’s not hard to see why. Fifty-four percent of Americans listed inflation and the economy as their No. 1 and No. 2 concerns in a USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll in December. Americans have been struggling for nearly two years through a historic spike in inflation that has driven up the price of food, housing and energy. Though inflation seems to be cooling, fears that the country could slip into recession this year persist. Despite those concerns, the Labor Department reported Friday that employers added a booming 517,000 jobs in January, suggesting to some economists that inflation could continue to decline even while employers keep adding jobs.\n\nCoping with inflation:Even with a mild winter, more Americans struggle to pay their energy bills\n\nCrime and police brutality\n\nBiden devoted a substantial chunk of last year’s State of the Union to crime, gun control and policing, saying Americans should not have to choose “between safety and equal justice.” In the year since, a wave of mass shootings and high-profile cases involving allegations of police brutality has kept those issues in the public consciousness.\n\nBiden can point to bipartisan gun control legislation that he signed into law last summer as an example of the steps taken in the past year to keep guns away from dangerous people. The law, approved in the aftermath of a mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, was the largest gun control package passed in 30 years.\n\nAdvocates are now pushing Congress to revisit federal police accountability legislation after the brutal beating death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee. Five Memphis police officers have been charged with second-degree murder and other crimes in connection to Nichols' death. Advocates also are urging Biden to again address police brutality in Tuesday’s speech. RowVaughn and Rodney Wells, the mother and stepfather of Nichols, are expected to attend the address.\n\nMareen Groppe and Michael Collins cover the White House.

Without it, nothing is,” he said.\n\nBiden introduced Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was violently attacked in their home by an intruder, saying the assailant was “unhinged by the Big Lie” that the election was stolen.\n\n“Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get. My friend, Paul Pelosi,\" he said. “But such a heinous act never should have happened.”\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nPaul Pelosi attack:Video footage of violent home attack on Paul Pelosi released\n\nBiden gets personal and celebrates Cancer Moonshot initiative\n\nBiden celebrated the Cancer Moonshot initiative, aimed at advancing cancer prevention and treatment,\n\n“Our goal is to cut the cancer death rates at least by 50% in the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases. Provide more support for patients and their families.” The issue is also deeply personal to Biden, as one of his sons, Beau Biden, passed away due to brain cancer. “It’s personal to so many of us.”\n\nBiden also singled out Maurice and Kandice Barron, a pair of guests invited by First Lady Jill Biden. Their daughter, Ava Barron, was diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer when she was one year old. “She turns four next month,” Biden said to wide cheers from the audience. “They just found out Ava’s beating the odds and is on her way to being cured from cancer.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCancer treatment:New cancer therapy takes personalized medicine to a new level\n\nBiden says US stood up to China\n\nFacing Republicans who’ve accused him of being too soft on China, Biden said he responded clearly last week when a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States.\n\nChina knows that if U.S. sovereignty is threatened, Americans will act to protect the country.\n\n“And we did,” Biden said, an apparent reference to his decision to shoot down the balloon.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChinese spy balloon:Chinese spy balloon went over other US missile and nuclear weapons sites, lawmaker says\n\nBiden: Stop production, trafficking of fentanyl\n\nCiting Americans’ growing dependence on prescription drugs, Biden called for a major campaign to stop the production, sale and trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nBiden noted that fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year. But his remarks were met with contempt from some members of Congress.\n\n“It’s your fault!” several Republicans shouted.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nBiden says VA working to end 'the silent scourge of suicide'\n\nBiden said when he first appointed Denis McDonough to run the Department of Veterans Affairs, the country was losing up to 25 veterans a day to “the silent scourge of suicide,” and continues to lose 17 per day.\n\n“The VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need,”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nMilitary suicide:Amid suicide crisis, the Army says it will rush mental health providers to Alaska\n\nBiden calls for higher teacher pay\n\nBiden hasn't touched much on education issues during the address but did take a moment to outline several priorities on that front. Among them: expanding access to preschool and raising teacher pay.\n\nIn 2021, teachers made less than 77 cents on the dollar compared with other college graduates. Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far. In some states teachers make less than $50,000 on average.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nTeacher shortage:Amid crippling teacher shortages, some schools are turning to unorthodox solutions\n\nBiden urges lawmakers to protect abortion rights\n\nBiden called on lawmakers to “restore” abortion rights after the Supreme Court last year overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.\n\n“The vice president and I are doing everything to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient safety,” Biden said, noting that states across the country have implemented abortion bans and restrictions.\n\n“Make no mistake about it.

Tsay, who is in attendance, received a standing ovation from lawmakers as Biden acknowledged him.\n\n“He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons once and for all.”\n\nMass shootings typically lead lawmakers to call for such actions but it’s unlikely that a ban will pass in a divided Congress with many Republican lawmakers who have vowed that they will not waver on gun control.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'Still too high':Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin orders independent panel to study military suicide\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene yells at Biden multiple times\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a fervent opponent of Biden who has called for his impeachment, yelled at him twice during the State of the Union address.\n\nThe first time came as Biden said Republicans want to cut Social Security and Medicare – an accusation that Greene refuted when she stood up yelled “Liar!”\n\nGreene later yelled, “China spied on us!” near the end of Biden’s speech.\n\nShe also yelled to “close the border” and “it’s your fault” when the president talked about the fentanyl crisis.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nHeckling lawmakers:Marjorie Taylor Greene, other Republicans spar with Biden over Social Security, Medicare\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden on Tyre Nichols’ death: ‘Something good must come from this’\n\nBiden used his speech to pay tribute to Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBiden called for more police training and more resources to reduce violent crime, along with more investments in housing, education and training.\n\nNoting that Nichols’ mother and stepfather were seated in the first lady’s box, Biden urged lawmakers to commit themselves to making the words of Nichols’ mother come true: “Something good must come from this.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTyre Nichols killing:7 more Memphis police employees under investigation in Tyre Nichols' death, city attorney says\n\nBiden invokes Uvalde massacre in call for gun reform\n\nIn a call to action on gun violence, Biden invoked his trip to Uvalde, Texas, after the Robb Elementary School shooting where 19 students and two teachers were killed.\n\n“Do something, do something. That was the plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde, I met with everyone.” Biden said, then pointing to the bipartisan gun reform law he signed. “Thank god we did. Passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nUvalde shooting:Her daughter was killed in Uvalde. She's suing police, the school district and a gunmaker.\n\nCOVID is under control but vigilance necessary, says Biden\n\nWhile COVID-19 deaths are down nearly 90%, and the end of the public health emergency is close, Biden said the country will remember the pain of losing loved ones will never go away for many.\n\n“Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table. We remember them, and we remain vigilant,” he said.\n\nBiden said it was important to remain vigilant and monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.

That’s because the enhanced CTC, which parents could also opt to receive in installments rather than waiting to receive it in a lump sum payment when they file their taxes, expired.\n\nThe enhanced CTC increased payments from $2,000 per qualifying child to $3,600 for children ages 5 and under and $3,000 for children ages 6 through 17. This year it will go back to $2,000 for qualifying children of all ages.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden vowed to “restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.”\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nChild tax credit this year:How much is the Child Tax Credit for 2023?

McCarthy said Republicans aren’t going to cut those programs, but Democrats say the math will force those cuts if the GOP demands lowered government spending.\n\nBiden in his speech said Republicans want to cut the programs, to which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled “Liar!” as other members booed the president.\n\n“OK, so we agree,” Biden said. “Social Security and Medicare is off the books.”\n\nBipartisan cheers returned to the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nMedicare:Medicare launches plan to negotiate prices for the costliest drugs. Here's what to know.\n\nBiden takes credit for deficit cuts\n\nBiden celebrated the government’s deficit cuts seen under his administration in his State of the Union address.\n\n“For the last two years, my administration has cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion, the largest deficit reduction in American history,” Biden said. The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?:Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said. The law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year.\n\nHe also promised to veto any attempts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCredit fees:Biden moves to limit credit fees to $8 for missed payments in latest \"junk fee\" crack down\n\nBiden tangles with GOP lawmakers over Social Security and Medicare\n\nBiden got into an unusual back and forth with Republicans over whether GOP lawmakers want to end the automatic continuation of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWhen some vocally protested, Biden responded: “Anyone who doubts it, contact my office.

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nHe also had plenty of jeers from the Republican side of the chamber when he slammed former President Donald Trump’s fiscal record and accused the House GOP of trying to cut Social Security and Medicare. The latter attracted loud boos.\n\nRep.

Biden then announced, “new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.”\n\n“American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables,” he said. “And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.”\n\nBiden’s message echoes former President Donald Trump’s prior State of the Union addresses where he boasted about initiatives to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the years.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nInsulin costs:Medicare caps insulin costs at $35 a month.

Factories at home closed down.

That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements.

Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine?

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov.

Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/25/cold-war-fears-rise-russia-pauses-nuclear-treaty-china/11337806002/", "title": "Cold War fears rise as Russia pauses nuclear treaty, China may help", "text": "WASHINGTON – Moscow suspending a nuclear arms treaty. The possibility of China arming the Russian military.\n\nEven as the U.S. and its allies celebrated this week that Russia has been thwarted thus far in its attempt to take over Ukraine, certain developments could have repercussions far beyond whether Kyiv stays standing.\n\nIf the last remaining arms treaty between the world’s two largest nuclear powers collapses, there will be no limits on U.S. and Russian nuclear forces for the first time since the 1970s. The risks of a nuclear launch – intentional or otherwise – would rise.\n\n“A world without nuclear arms control is a far more dangerous and unstable one,” said U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.\n\nAnd if China turns its economic and diplomatic support for Russia into full-blown military assistance, it would be a major change in how China has approached foreign policy, supercharging the already high tensions between the U.S. and China and making the world more dangerous.\n\n“It would also return us to…the kind of things we saw in the Cold War where you have all these major countries interfering in conflicts and proxy wars,” said Brian Hart, who studies the evolving nature of Chinese power at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nHere’s what you need to know:\n\nWhat did Russia do?\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced Tuesday he is suspending Moscow’s participation in New START, the last remaining nuclear arms reduction deal between the U.S. and Russia. It limits the number of long-range nuclear warheads Russia and the U.S. can have, including those that can reach the U.S. in about 30 minutes.\n\nWhat’s the concern?\n\nWithout arms control, the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals could double in size, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Each nation could dramatically and quickly increase the number of nuclear weapons ready to launch on short notice, said Hans M. Kristensen, director of the federation’s Nuclear Information Project.\n\n“Such an increase would be extraordinarily destabilizing and dangerous, especially with a full-scale war raging in Europe and Russia buckling under the strain of unprecedented sanctions,” Kristensen wrote last year.\n\nIs it time to panic?\n\nNo. Putin hasn’t yet pulled the plug on the treaty.\n\nHe’s said Russia won’t participate in the inspections and other mechanisms to enforce the limits on nuclear weapons. But the Russian Foreign Ministry said Moscow would respect the treaty’s weapons caps. And there’s no sign that Putin will suddenly produce new weapons, according to Joe Cirincione, an arms control expert and member of the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nCirincione thinks Putin is raising the nuclear specter to scare away Ukraine’s allies.\n\n“He understands that he’s losing this war,” Cirincione said on MSNBC. \"He has to convince Western publics that they risk nuclear war by continuing to aid Ukraine.”\n\nHasn’t Putin done this before\n\nYes. Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces on high combat alert shorty after invading Ukraine last February. In December, he said Russia would continue maintaining and improving the combat readiness of nuclear weapons that can be fired from land, air and sea.\n\n“Russian president Vladimir Putin has come to rely on nuclear weapons for coercion and bullying and will continue to make nuclear threats,” Heather Williams, and arms control expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a recent analysis. “The West may not be able to stop Putin from threatening to use nuclear weapons, but countries can work to prevent him from following through on those threats.”\n\nEven if Putin’s latest move is a gambit, said Ben Rhodes, who was a top national security adviser to President Barack Obama, “it does just point to the fact that we’re in this kind of period of escalation with Russia where we don’t quite know where it’s going to end.”\n\nWhat’s going on with China?\n\nSince the invasion, China has helped Russia economically by buying its oil and gas. China has also sold Russia drones, microchips and other technologies that have both commercial and military applications. But Beijing hasn’t allowed Russia to buy ammunition, artillery, armed drones and other weapons.\n\nThat could change. Top Biden administration officials warned this week they have intelligence suggesting China is considering providing lethal support to Russia.\n\nIn response, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman accused the U.S. of “chasing shadows and smearing China.”\n\nBut while the White House hasn’t made its evidence public, the warnings are reminiscent of the administration’s pre-invasion intelligence of Putin’s plans.\n\nWhat could make China directly aid Russia?\n\nThe war in Ukraine has in many ways been good for China, said Hart of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It’s made Russia more reliant on China and has distracted the U.S. – China’s main rival. But China doesn’t want Russia, its most powerful partner on the global stage, to be severely weekend by the war.\n\n“Overall, Beijing’s alignment with Russia is first and foremost fueled by collective concerns about the United States and competing with the United Sates. The more you have direct competition between Beijing and Washington, the more you’re going to see a willingness for Beijing to strengthen ties with Moscow,” he said. “That’s the triangle that their facing.”\n\nHow would the U.S. react?\n\nThe Biden administration has warned of “severe consequences” if China helps Russia replenish its military supplies.\n\n“We’ll not hesitate to target Chinese companies or individuals that violate our sanctions,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price.\n\nChina’s economy is already struggling. But major sanctions against China – which is a much bigger economic player than Russia – would also have blowback effects on the U.S. and other nations.\n\nWhat would it mean for the geopolitical order?\n\nChina’s direct involvement would mark a huge shift in its approach to foreign policy, one so shocking that China expert Oriana Skylar Mastro said she would “have to rethink everything I know about China.”\n\nChina has looked at the U.S.’s foreign military interventions as expensive endeavors that haven’t made the U.S. more powerful. They’ve taken a different approach.\n\n“I would be much less concerned about what it means for Ukraine and much more concerned about what it means for the world if we’re dealing with a China now that engages in intervention and foreign conflicts, which is a key thing that they have argued for decades and decades is the reason for the U.S. decline, is a stupid thing to do, something that they would never do,” she said.\n\nBut if China does make that radical shift said Mastro, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and at Stanford University, it would “absolutely” make the world a more dangerous place.\n\nWhile China makes it harder for the U.S. to coerce autocrats by not, for example, joining in sanctions, she said, “that’s very different from them actively providing support.”\n\nA new Cold War?\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. Even before the Biden administration shot down a Chinese spy balloon off the coast of South Carolina this month, the nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other issues.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But that may become increasingly difficult.\n\n“We have to make sure that the competition that we're clearly engaged in does not veer into conflict, into a new Cold War,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” when discussing the new threat. “It's not in our interest. I won't speak to theirs, but it's not in ours.”\n\nIn a vaguely worded proposal China released Friday calling for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia, it also called for an end to “Cold War mentality” — China’s standard term for what it regards as U.S. hegemony, and maintenance of alliances such as NATO.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nWant to know more?

But even more than the policy announcements and the formal discussions, it was the personal interactions between the US President – who once promised to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” – and the kingdom’s de facto ruler that drew the most attention.\n\nThe President was fiercely criticized for fist bumping the Crown Prince during their first in person interaction by human rights groups and fellow Democrats, as well as the publisher of the Washington Post. Those images of Biden and the Crown Prince, also known as MBS, were quickly promoted by the Saudi government, including on Saudi state TV and Twitter.\n\nBiden came to Jeddah seeking solutions to one of his top political problems at home – high gas prices – as diplomacy with the kingdom and other allies in the Middle East was seen as one of the few routes he could take to ease the pain at the pump.\n\nCritics argued the fist bump validated bin Salman on the world stage just over a year after the US declassified an intelligence report concluding the Crown Prince personally ordered Khashoggi’s killing. Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan said Biden’s fist bump was “shameful” because it “projected a level of intimacy and comfort that delivers to MBS the unwarranted redemption he has been desperately seeking.”\n\nIt was also a stunning gesture for a President who argued on the campaign trail that he would make Saudi Arabia “the pariah that they are” on the world stage and “make them pay the price.”\n\nBut the President said he was “straightforward and direct in discussing” Khashoggi with the Crown Prince on Friday, and said “I made my view crystal clear.”\n\n“For an American President to be silent on the issue of human rights is inconsistent with who we are and who I am. I’ll always stand up for our values,” Biden told reporters after his meetings with Saudi leadership.\n\nBiden said the Crown Prince again denied his involvement in the murder when he raised the issue with him.\n\n“I indicated I thought he was,” Biden said.\n\nUS President Joe Biden poses alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Bahraini King Hamad bin Isa bin Salman al Khalifa, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Jordanian King Abdullah II for a family photo in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Saturday, July 16.

Turkish officials said at the time the journalist was beaten, tortured and dismembered.\n\nAhead of their hours-long meeting, bin Salman on Friday ignored questions from reporters about whether he would apologize to Khashoggi’s family, and Biden did not answer whether he still considered Saudi Arabia a “pariah.”\n\nBiden attended a formal meeting with Saudi King Salman, but – given the king’s deteriorating health – the working session was conducted by the Crown Prince.\n\nWhite House officials had accepted they would be heavily criticized for the meeting, including by members of Biden’s own party, but decided to move ahead because they saw it as the most practical option, acknowledging it was much easier to work with the Saudis than without them.\n\nThe President repeatedly defended his decision to travel to Saudi Arabia and meet with MBS, maintaining his administration wants to lead in the region and not create a vacuum for Russia and China to fill.\n\nBiden had stopped short of committing to raise Khashoggi’s murder directly with leaders in Saudi Arabia and said he “always” brings up human rights and that his views on the murder have been “absolutely, positively clear.” US officials had told CNN ahead of the trip that Biden was expected to raise Khashoggi with MBS.\n\nThere was much speculation ahead of the trip whether Biden would shake the Crown Prince’s hand or be pictured with him. That speculation only grew when the White House said the President was looking to reduce contact with others amid the spread of a transmissible subvariant of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, and would be offering fist bumps instead of hand shakes.\n\nA White House spokeswoman denied the guidance was issued in order to give Biden an excuse to avoid shaking MBS’ hand when he arrived in Jeddah. Biden noticeably shook hands on multiple occasions during his two days in Israel, which only added to the scrutiny of his first greeting with MBS.\n\nFor weeks, Biden and other White House officials had tried to downplay his meeting with the Crown Prince. The White House did not officially acknowledge Biden will be meeting directly with MBS until publishing the President’s schedule the night before.\n\nThe decision to meet with MBS, as well as the fist bump, was criticized by Biden’s fellow Democrats.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California had sharp words for Biden and tweeted, “If we ever needed a visual reminder of the continuing grip oil-rich autocrats have on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, we got it today. One fist bump is worth a thousand words.”\n\nRep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey said in an interview on CNN’s “Newsroom” that though he believed Biden has been “honest, unlike his predecessor” about Saudi Arabia’s involvement in Khashoggi’s murder, “I’m still not entirely comfortable with the image of this meeting.”\n\nWhite House announces policy agreements with Saudis\n\nWhile no explicit announcement on raising oil production is expected immediately after Biden leaves Jeddah, officials anticipate one could be announced in the coming weeks, in addition to progress on the Yemen ceasefire. Biden’s working visit with MBS is seen as a chance to reset the relationship, and officials say, depending on how the meeting goes, Biden could begin communicating with MBS directly during calls, which he has declined to do so far.\n\nOvernight, Saudi Arabia confirmed an expected announcement that its airspace would be opened to Israeli airlines. Biden hailed the “historic decision” that followed “months of steady diplomacy,” noting he would become the first US President to fly from Israel to Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe trip comes amid high gas prices and widespread inflation in the US and across the globe, in part due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though the President and other officials have dismissed Saudi Arabia’s rich oil supply as a key motivator for the trip. The US praised Saudi Arabia for its commitment “to support global oil market balancing for sustained economic growth,” a White House official said, pointing to the step as a move that would drive prices down over the coming weeks.\n\n“We have welcomed the increase in production levels 50% above what was planned for July and August. These steps and further steps that we anticipate over the coming weeks have and will help stabilize markets considerably,” the official said.\n\nThe two countries will also sign a memorandum of cooperation on 5G and 6G technology, part of the administration’s push toward expanding infrastructure across the globe. It will “connect US and Saudi technology companies in the advancement and deployment of 5G using open, virtualized, and cloud-based radio access networks and the development of 6G through similar technologies.”\n\nThe set of announcements also touts sustaining and extending the United Nations-mediated truce in the war in Yemen.\n\n“President Biden welcomed Saudi Arabia’s strong commitment to the truce, particularly leading, in tandem with the Yemen government, in helping to resume direct commercial flights from Sana’a to Amman and Cairo for the first time in seven years and supporting Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, which will help improve basic services and economic stability to ease the suffering of Yemenis,” the official said.\n\nThe US and Saudi Arabia also signed a memorandum of understanding between the US Department of Health and Human Services and the Saudi Ministry of Health on public health. The two countries will collaborate on “health information systems, capacity building in the delivery of health services, disease surveillance, emerging infectious diseases, addressing the health-related concerns of women and special needs populations, and public policies oriented to disease prevention and health promotion,” the official said.\n\nThere will also be strengthened cooperation on clean energy, with Saudi investments to combat climate change, and an agreement on cybersecurity where the two countries will share information about threats and collaborate on best practices, as well as cooperation on space exploration, per the official.\n\nBiden also welcomed Saudi Arabia efforts to strengthen relations with Iraq, particularly in areas to help fortify the Iraqi power grid by linking it with Saudi and Gulf Cooperation Council countries, the official said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Friday.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein Kaitlan Collins", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/europe/ukraine-conflict-russia-losses-intl/index.html", "title": "Pro-Russia media slam war setbacks as Putin predicts annexed ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said he expects the situation to stabilize in four war-torn regions of Ukraine after signing legislation to annex them on Wednesday, despite the fact that Russia’s military does not fully control those areas.\n\nWhile Russian state television hailed Putin’s inking of the annexation process, pro-Kremlin pundits delivered rare dispatches on the growing setbacks faced by Moscow’s troops on the ground.\n\nRussian forces appear to be buckling under growing pressure as Ukraine continues to regain territory in the south, where Russian soldiers have been forced to retreat from previously-held settlements as Kyiv progresses with its counteroffensive towards the Russian-occupied city of Kherson.\n\nDespite losing territory in the south to Ukrainian military at rapid pace, Putin on Wednesday signed several laws ratifying the Russian Federation’s claimed annexation of four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\n\nIn a bid to celebrate the news, Putin took the opportunity in a televised meeting for Teachers’ Day to congratulate educators from “all 89 regions of Russia,” a number that includes the newly annexed territories.\n\nPutin said he was “pleased” and “surprised” by the referendums’ results and claimed that the regions will now be stabilized and developed while “helping strengthen the country as a whole.”\n\nThe annexations are illegal under international law. World leaders have said they are the result of “sham” referendums that will never be recognized.\n\nDonetsk and Luhansk are both in eastern Ukraine, and fighting against Moscow-backed breakaway republics in each region has been raging since 2014. Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are in southern Ukraine and have been occupied by Russian forces since shortly after the invasion began in late February.\n\nRussia has vowed to take control of all of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but its goals in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are less clear, which has created confusion about the boundaries that Russia is claiming.\n\nAmid the uncertainty, Russia and Ukraine on Wednesday also issued conflicting announcements over the management of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Putin signed a decree to claim the plant, the largest complex of its kind in Europe, as under Russian state control; meanwhile the head of Energoatom, Ukraine’s state nuclear energy company, said that he was taking charge.\n\n“Undoubtedly, our work, our destiny, our homes and our future are with Ukraine, as always. We will continue to work in accordance with Ukrainian legislation, in the Ukrainian energy system, in Energoatom. Don’t doubt it!” Petro Kotin said in a video address to the plant’s employees.\n\nThat Russia does not have full control of the regions it claims to have seized was made clear by a map used by the Russian Defense Ministry in its daily briefing on Tuesday. The map confirmed significant Russian losses in Kherson compared to a map of the same area used in a ministry briefing a day before. It reinforces reports from Ukrainian and pro-Russian officials, as well as pro-Russian military analysts, of significant Ukrainian gains towards Kherson, down the western bank of the Dnieper River.\n\nLieutenant General Igor Konashenkov, who spoke while the map was shown full-screen, did not mention the losses. However, he said that Russian military destroyed Ukrainian armor and killed Ukrainian forces in the area of several towns that are now understood to be under Ukrainian control – a tacit acknowledgment of Kyiv’s push.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the military for their “fast and powerful advances” in his Tuesday evening address, before celebrating that “dozens of settlements have already been liberated” this week.\n\nIn Kherson region, he said that Liubymivka, Khreshchenivka, Zolota Balka, Biliaiivka, Ukraiinka, Velyka, Mala Oleksandrivka, and Davydiv Brid had all been reclaimed, “and this is not a complete list.”\n\n“Our warriors do not stop. And it is only a matter of time when we will expel the occupier from all our land,” the president added.\n\nZelensky on Wednesday assembled his top military and security staff to consider plans for “further liberation of Ukrainian territories,” according to the readout of the meeting from the President’s office.\n\nIn addition to Ukraine’s successes in the south, Kyiv’s forces made gains in Luhansk in the east with forces approaching the region from several directions, and over the weekend liberated the strategic city of Lyman, a key operational hub in Donetsk which the Russian army had used to funnel troops and supplies to the west and south.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it was forced to cede Lyman or risk encirclement of its troops there, allowing Ukrainian forces to potentially use the city as a staging post to push troops further east.\n\nAsked by CNN how to interpret the language of the laws signed by Putin – which refers to the borders of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions as “the territory which existed on the day of its adoption in the Russian Federation” – Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, “I will leave this question unanswered.”\n\nWhen pressed to clarify by CNN, Peskov added: “You should read the decree; there is a legal wording there. On the whole, of course, we are talking about the territory in which the military-civilian administration operated at the time of its adoption [as part of the Russian Federation].”\n\n‘Painful as getting thumped on your melon’\n\nThe Russian-appointed deputy leader in the occupied Kherson region explained Ukraine’s rapid advance in recent days by saying that the Russian military was “regrouping.”\n\n“The Russian army is conducting maneuvers,” Kirill Stremousov told Russian state news RIA Novosti. “The regrouping of the front in the current conditions allows us to gather strength and strike.”\n\nThe phrase “regrouping” was also used by the Russian Defense Ministry in September to describe the retreat of the Russian military in response to Ukraine’s offensive that recaptured the key city of Izium, in the Kharkiv region.\n\nStremousov on Wednesday claimed that Ukraine’s advance had been stopped, and that it was “impossible” for them to enter the occupied city of Kherson.\n\nUkrainian soldiers adjust a national flag on an armored personnel carrier on a road near Lyman, Donetsk region on October 4, 2022. Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHowever, pro-Russian media has been uncommonly critical of the war effort in recent days, delivering gloomy reports that Russia’s campaign is suffering an operational crisis while Ukraine takes advantage on the battlefield.\n\n“In the Kherson region, we have lost 17 settlements,” Alexander Sladkov, a leading Russian war correspondent, conceded on state TV Tuesday, before placing the blame on “fat” US weapons deliveries and “intelligence gathered via satellite reconnaissance.”\n\nSladkov is just one of several Russian correspondents to convey the losses Russia is suffering.\n\nAlexander Kots, a correspondent for pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, who is embedded with Russian forces in the occupied eastern city of Svatove, told his Telegram followers Wednesday that the military lacks the manpower necessary to hold off a further Ukrainian advance into the Luhansk region.\n\n“The Russian troops do not have enough manpower to stop the enemy attacks,” Kots said in a video. “The recent Russian losses are directly connected to that. It’s a very difficult period of time on the front line at the moment.”\n\nHe said that “we expect a serious fighting here very soon,” and that “it remains to be seen if it could stop the enemy advances.”\n\nKots confirmed that Russian forces were trying to fortify their defense at the line connecting the occupied cities of Kreminna and Svatova. Yuriy Podolyaka, a pro-Russian military blogger said on Monday that Russian troops had withdrawn to the Zherebets River, which runs just west of Kreminna and Svatova.\n\nHe said that Ukrainian forces are “on the high and enjoying a numeric advantage.”\n\n“They don’t have problems with the intelligence data or high-precision weapons which they are constantly using. We are just waiting for our reserves to become fighting fit and join the battle.”\n\nMeanwhile, state media reporter Evgeniy Poddubnyy, a correspondent for Russia 24, said Tuesday that “we’re going through the hardest time on the frontline” and that “for the time being it will become even harder.”\n\nSladkov, for his part, tried to put a positive spin on things.\n\n“This doesn’t mean that we’ve collapsed like a house of cards. These mistakes aren’t gigantic strategic failures. We are still learning. I know this is hard to hear in our eighth month of the special operation. But we are reporters. We are waiting for reinforcements.\n\nHost Olga Skabeeva appeared visibly angry, before asking Sladkov if the entire Kherson region was in danger of being lost.\n\n“We don’t have enough troops at the moment to move on Kyiv or to quickly take Kharkiv, but they are sufficient to continue protecting the territories that we are already protecting,” he responded. “In straightening out our front line, we’ve had to retreat from these settlements.”\n\nHe added: “It’s as painful as getting thumped on your melon. We’ve suffered losses. But it’s war. And these kinds of things happen in war. [Reinforcements] are coming, along with their equipment. I don’t lie or engage in propaganda. I’m just a regular reporter who is describing what is happening.”\n\nSladkov’s admission on State TV was his second in less than a month, after he previously admitted that Russian forces had endured heavy losses on September 13, a Tuesday. At the beginning of this Tuesday’s interview, Sladkov quipped: “I only tell the truth on Tuesdays, and for other days I just make everything up.”", "authors": ["Lauren Said-Moorhouse Mick Krever Uliana Pavlova", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Mick Krever", "Uliana Pavlova"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}]}

In one case, the president's son will plead guilty to the tax charges, which allege willful failure to pay federal income tax. In another case, he agreed to enter a pretrial diversion agreement for the gun offense, in which he acknowledged unlawful possession of a Colt Cobra 38SPL revolver, despite being addicted to drugs.\n\nThe Justice Department will recommend probation for tax charges, according to The Associated Press, based on an unnamed source. The diversion program could eventually lead to dismissal of the gun charge.\n\nWeiss asked the court − a judge has not yet been assigned − to set a date to formally process the plea agreements. Weiss began in 2018 with questions about taxes on overseas business deals, after his work in Ukraine and China drew federal scrutiny.\n\nBiden's lawyer, Christopher Clark, said his understanding is that the agreements resolve the five-year investigation.\n\n\"Hunter will take responsibility for two instances of misdemeanor failure to file tax payments when due pursuant to a plea agreement,\" Clark said. \"I know Hunter believes it is important to take responsibility for these mistakes he made during a period of turmoil and addiction in his life. He looks forward to continuing his recovery and moving forward.\"\n\nBiden himself disclosed the inquiry in December 2020.\n\nAsked Tuesday if he had spoken with his son, President Biden said, \"I’m very proud of my son.\"\n\nThe White House has previously said the president hasn't discussed the investigation with Attorney General Merrick Garland or the Justice Department.\n\n“The President and First Lady love their son and support him as he continues to rebuild his life,\" Ian Sams, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement. \"We will have no further comment.”\n\nThe case has political implications. Former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans have attacked Hunter Biden as a potentially bad influence on his father. Trump appointed Weiss. IRS agents say they were removed from the probe. Hunter Biden has sued a laptop repairman for allegedly distributing private personal information to Trump supporters and reporters.\n\nHere is what we know about the inquiry:\n\nWhat are the tax charges?\n\nOne of the court filings explained the basis for the tax charges against Hunter Biden.\n\nHe allegedly received more than $1.5 million in taxable income during 2017, when he lived in Washington, D.C., and owed the federal government more than $100,000, according to a court record. He was required to pay the tax by April 2018 but didn't, according to the document filed by Leo Wise and Derek Hines, two special assistant U.S. attorneys in Weiss's office.\n\nBiden again received more than $1.5 million in 2018 and failed to pay his taxes by April 2019, according to the document.\n\nIRS investigators recently removed from probe\n\nCongressional Republicans have questioned Biden's overseas business deals. A whistleblower at the Internal Revenue Service, which has been investigating Biden for potential tax violations, told lawmakers in May his entire team was removed from the probe, according to a letter from his lawyers obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nMark Lytle, the attorney for the IRS whistleblower, wrote to lawmakers that his client has information about a “failure to mitigate clear conflicts of interest in the ultimate disposition” of a criminal investigation related to Biden’s taxes and whether he made a false statement in connection with a gun purchase.\n\nThe letter said the IRS criminal supervisory special agent \"was informed that he and his entire investigative team are being removed from the ongoing and sensitive investigation of the high-profile, controversial subject about which our client sought to make whistleblower disclosures to Congress.\" The Justice Department informed the whistleblower about the change.\n\nAnother charge involves allegedly false statement when buying a gun\n\nAnother charge in Weiss's inquiry alleges Biden made a false statement on a federal form when he bought a gun in 2018.\n\nThe Gun Control Act prohibits drug users from possessing firearms. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ruled the ban applies to \"a conviction for use or possession of a controlled substance within the past year.\"\n\nBiden filled out a federal form when he bought a handgun in October 2018 in which he replied “no” to a question of whether he was “an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance,\" according to the Washington Post.\n\nBy his own account in his memoir “Beautiful Things,” Biden battled drug addiction and for periods during 2018 smoked crack “every 15 minutes.”\n\nBut Biden could potentiallly challenge the law under his Second Amendment right to bear arms. The Supreme Court overturned a New York gun law in June 2022, in a decision that threatened a variety of firearms regulations.\n\nHow does Hunter Biden's laptop figure into the probe?\n\nA laptop became a focal point of congressional inquiries because it contained a trove of documents and pictures of Hunter Biden.\n\nWhen Trump raised questions about the laptop at a 2020 presidential debate, Joe Biden initially replied that it was Russian disinformation. The laptop’s legitimacy has since been confirmed by CBS News and The Washington Post, but the contents remain under investigation.\n\nBiden drug addition:Hunter Biden's drug use back in public eye as criminal charges could be around the corner\n\nA computer repairman, John Paul Mac Isaac, gave the laptop information to the FBI after Hunter Biden failed to pick up the MacBook Pro following repairs in April 2019. Mac Isaac later gave a copy of the laptop's contents to Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who shared the material Trump's political supporters and with reporters.\n\nHunter Biden filed a claim in federal court alleging Mac Isaac violated his privacy, took part in a conspiracy and helped others invade his privacy. The filing was in response to a $1.5 million lawsuit for alleged defamation that the repairman filed in Delaware Superior Court against Biden, CNN, Politico and Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. The case has been moved to U.S. District Court in Delaware.\n\nBiden became lightning rod for political conflict between father's administration and House GOP\n\nThe inquiry carried political implications from the start because of his father's ambition as a former vice president to return to the White House and because of clashes with congressional Republicans.\n\nHouse Republicans led by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., have argued that Hunter Biden peddled influence on the administration through lucrative business deals and the sale of art. For example, the House Oversight and Accountability Committee released a report in March saying Hunter Biden and other relatives received $1.3 million from a business associate after he received a wire transfer from a Chinese company.\n\nBiden paternity case:How the Biden family name became latest wrinkle in Hunter Biden's paternity battle\n\nComer called the charges a \"slap on the wrist\" and said they reflect a \"two-tiered system of justice.\"\n\n\"Hunter Biden is getting away with a slap on the wrist when growing evidence uncovered by the House Oversight Committee reveals the Bidens engaged in a pattern of corruption, influence peddling, and possibly bribery,\" Comer said. \"These charges against Hunter Biden and sweetheart plea deal have no impact on the Oversight Committee’s investigation. We will not rest until the full extent of President Biden’s involvement in the family’s schemes are revealed.”\n\nTrump, who has been indicted on federal charges over classified documents and New York state charges over business records, said in a post on Truth Social the Justice Department gave Hunter Biden \"a mere 'traffic ticket.' Our system is BROKEN!\"\n\nThe White House has dismissed the inquiries into Hunter Biden’s business deals as hyperpartisan and politically motivated. Joe Biden has defended himself and his son from attacks by Trump since the 2020 campaign.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has told Congress that the department’s decisions in the case would not be politicized.\n\n“I stand by my testimony, and I refer you to the U.S. attorney for the District of Delaware, who is in charge of this case and capable of making any decisions that he feels are appropriate,” Garland said at an unrelated news conference May 2.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/05/11/ex-us-rep-corrine-brown-guilty-18-fraud-tax-charges/15754535007/", "title": "Ex-U.S. Rep.

Twelve jurors unanimously convicted her on 18 of 22 counts, a raft of crimes that also includes filing false tax returns in 2012 through 2014 and making false claims on income disclosure forms reported to the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThose financial crimes could put Brown, 70, in prison for years or potentially the rest of her life.\n\nAfter the verdict, Brown left the federal courthouse in unusual silence and in locked arms with Bishop Rudolph McKissick Sr. — one of Brown’s closest friends and a leader at one of Jacksonville’s prominent black churches — while a mob of reporters shouted questions and a news helicopter hovered overhead. She got into the back seat of a black Mercedes S550.\n\nJames Smith III, Brown’s defense lawyer, said he will file motions in the coming weeks requesting a new trial. He said Brown respects the jury’s decision but disagrees with it. “This is just part one,” he said.\n\nU.S. District Judge Timothy Corrigan did not set a date for a sentencing hearing but said it would happen in about 90 days. Until then, Brown will remain free.\n\nThe remarkable unraveling of the 12-term former congresswoman — who in 1992 became one of the first black candidates elected to Congress from Florida since Reconstruction — was aided in large part by her former chief of staff, Ronnie Simmons, who set his 30-year relationship with Brown on fire after he decided in February to plead guilty and become the government’s star witness.\n\nSlideshow: Evidence shown in the trial of former Congresswoman Corrine Brown's fraud trial\n\nProsecutors called other witnesses with long ties to Brown — former aides, donors and heads of businesses, churches and nonprofits — some of whom seemed reluctant to appear in court. Brown still considers some of those witnesses friends, even after they gave testimony that would ultimately prove damning.\n\n“It wasn’t as complicated as it was difficult to be a prosecution witness [when] one of the most respected persons in my lifetime [was] the defendant,” said Nat Glover, president of Edward Waters College and a former Jacksonville sheriff. He told jurors that he found no records of Brown donating to the college, even though she claimed tens of thousands in donations on her tax records over several years.\n\n“I just found myself in a difficult place where I had to adjust to the reality of the situation. In other words, the reality of what the evidence showed,” Glover said.\n\nIn other cases, Brown’s relationship to former confidants remains less clear.\n\nFew represent that better than Von Alexander, a former public-relations professional and part-time staffer in Brown’s congressional office who handled many of the former congresswoman’s personal affairs for years. Alexander told jurors Brown repeatedly directed her to turn checks from the sham charity One Door for Education and other sources into cash that could be deposited into Brown’s personal Bank of America account.\n\nSince her indictment, Brown has been banned from speaking with Alexander.\n\nCORRINE DELIVERS\n\nBrown’s gambit to take the stand herself didn’t undo the damage caused by the government’s case. Her testimony was forceful, humorous and at one point explosively emotional. But it was also unfocused and often perplexing.\n\nHer personality has failed her few times in the past.\n\nUntil her indictment last year, Brown hadn’t lost an election since 1982. She gleefully enraged critics but always had unwavering support in her congressional district, which encompassed predominantly African-American neighborhoods from Jacksonville to Orlando.\n\nShe willed the Republican Party into submission after several failed attempts to field credible challengers against her. She earned a reputation among local elected leaders from both parties as an effective advocate in Washington, D.C. — the basis for the infamous campaign slogan slapped on Jacksonville billboards, “Corrine Delivers.”\n\nIn an ironic twist, Brown often claimed credit for securing the money that paid for the federal courthouse in downtown Jacksonville — the site where 12 jurors sealed her fate Thursday.\n\nBrown’s eagerness to exert influence over the city’s government agencies — particularly the Duval County School Board and the Jacksonville Transportation Authority — was so well known there was a cottage industry of for-hire consultants who could act as intermediaries with the congresswoman. Alexander was once one of those figures.\n\nThe ballot-style endorsement fliers she issued every election cycle — her “Quick Picks” — were legendary, and long a source of rumored, but unsubstantiated, corruption.\n\nUnder the weight of federal indictment — and running in a newly redrawn congressional district she unsuccessfully filed a legal challenge over — Brown lost re-election last year to U.S. Rep. Al Lawson of Tallahassee.\n\nPOLITICAL TREMORS\n\nThe downfall of such a towering figure will have a seismic effect on the region’s Democratic politics. Brown headed a substantial political machine and was the titular head of the party’s turnout efforts.\n\nState Sen. Audrey Gibson, who chairs the Duval Democratic Party, acknowledged the power vacuum.\n\n“I think there is a void right now without question because of all the activities she’d put together,” she said. “It has to be filled … she always said failure is not an option.”\n\nThe trial also wrapped Jacksonville City Councilman Reginald Gaffney into Brown’s misdeeds.\n\nFor jurors, Gaffney was a mysterious figure.\n\nHe heads organizations that prosecutors say were also sources of secret cash padding Brown’s pockets. Gaffney told the Times-Union he gave Brown money because he loved her like a mother, and an attorney representing Gaffney’s nonprofit said such giving is not illegal.\n\nBut jurors never heard from him. Prosecutors and Brown’s defense lawyer indicated they wanted to call him to testify. For unexplained reasons neither side ultimately called him.\n\nGaffney has not been charged with any crimes.\n\nTHE TRIAL\n\nThe government’s case cut at the heart of the working-class image the Democratic icon spent years cultivating.\n\nJurors were told Brown received $141,000 in untraceable cash over several years through sources including One Door for Education and her Friends of Corrine Brown campaign committee.\n\nAn FBI accountant testified Brown, who earned around $175,000 a year as a member of Congress with a pension from the Florida Legislature, spent an average of $1,438 per month more than her reported income.\n\nBrown couldn’t explain many of these deposits.\n\nSmith, Brown’s lawyer, tried to pin most of the blame on Simmons, who he presented to jurors as a charismatic but devious operator who preyed on women who came to trust him. Brown was simply another victim, he argued.\n\nSimmons’ one-time girlfriend — a Virginia woman named Carla Wiley — started One Door for Education with noble intentions in 2011. With Simmons’ help, it would anchor a criminal conspiracy the following year.\n\nThe charity billed itself as a scholarship fund, and under those auspices Brown raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the organization by tapping into her network of donors and political allies. Only nominal amounts went to actual charity.\n\nBrown, Simmons and Wiley got the rest.\n\nWith that cash, Simmons, who made about $168,030 a year, could afford to live in the Washington suburbs, own a boat (called the Black Diamond) and treat Wiley to expensive dinners and at least one Miami vacation.\n\nWiley pleaded guilty last year and admitted during Brown’s trial that she stole well north of $100,000 directly from One Door.\n\nMore than $300,000 paid for elaborate events held in Brown’s honor. Sometimes they took the form of annual receptions held the week of the Congressional Black Caucus’ yearly conference. The money paid for a luxury box at a Jaguars-Redskins game, and for a Beyonce concert.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, One Door cash financed a golf tournament at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach. Donors were told their checks would pay for scholarships and help local charities. No money did.\n\nProsecutors say donors wrote more than $800,000 worth of checks to One Door from 2012 through 2015.\n\nStill, Brown pleaded ignorance.\n\nShe didn’t know why Simmons was making regular $800 withdrawals from One Door’s bank account, then placing money into her own account.\n\nBrown said Alexander, her former aide, owed her money. But the former congresswoman didn’t know why those payments were coming from One Door checks or cash derived from other organizations that didn’t know their money was being put into in Brown’s pockets.\n\nThe Department of Justice says it knows why.\n\n“Former Congresswoman Brown chose greed and personal gain over the sacred trust given to her by the community that she served for many years,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Stephen Muldrow in a statement. “These guilty verdicts underscore our office’s resolve in holding public officials at all levels of government accountable for their actions. In this case, former Congresswoman Brown stole money that was donated on the false promise of helping further the educational goals of underprivileged children.”\n\n‘WE DON’T GIVE A DAMN’\n\nFor Brown’s supporters, her convictions defy belief.\n\n“We love Corrine,” said Chris Richardson, who sat outside the courthouse Thursday with fellow activist Denise Hunt waiting to show support for Brown.\n\nSince Brown was indicted last year, they had been at a series of sign-waving demonstrations of support at the same area. There were no demonstrators Thursday, but Hunt said it was important to stand up for her.\n\nWhen Brown left the building surrounded by trusted friends, Hunt joined a ring of reporters and onlookers to yell her support, saying backers “don’t give a damn” about the convictions.\n\n“I never knew her to be about money. I always knew her to be about helping,” said former Jacksonville Mayor John Delaney.\n\nDelaney, a Republican and the retiring president of the University of North Florida, testified in Brown’s defense last week.\n\n“It’s hard to win in federal court, but I think she presented a plausible case for reasonable doubt, and I believed what she said,” he said.\n\n“To call someone a liar, thief, among other things, it was hard to read,” said Gibson, the state senator. “She is obviously the go-getter, go get ’em Corrine Brown. … What she believes in, she charges forward with that, galvanizing the community, standing up against injustice.”\n\nBrown could in theory be sentenced to decades in prison. Each fraud or conspiracy conviction carries a potential 20-year sentence, and each tax conviction three years. Hiding income could lead to another five-year sentence.\n\nBrown will likely lean on her legacy in hopes of getting a lighter sentence.\n\nGlover, the Edward Waters College president, said, “This is a sad day for me, personally. I think so much of Congresswoman Brown and her service to this community, and I would hope that all of that service, dedication and commitment to this community would somehow manifest itself in the judge’s deliberations.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html", "title": "Joel Greenberg sentenced to 11 years after cooperating with federal ...", "text": "Orlando, Florida CNN —\n\nConvicted fraudster Joel Greenberg, who cooperated extensively with the Justice Department’s sex-trafficking probe into GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz, was sentenced Thursday to 11 years in prison by a federal judge in Florida.\n\nGreenberg, a former Seminole County tax collector, previously pleaded guilty to underage sex trafficking, wire fraud, stalking, identity theft, producing a fake ID card, and conspiring to defraud the US government. He has been in jail since early 2021 and will get some credit for time served.\n\n“I have never seen a defendant who has committed so many different types of crimes in such a relatively short period,” said district Judge Gregory Presnell, who has been on the federal bench for decades and has sentenced more than 1,000 defendants.\n\nPresnell did praise Greenberg’s cooperation against others allegedly involved in sex crimes and fraud schemes, saying the cooperation was “more than I’ve seen in 22 years.”\n\nAs part of his plea deal, Greenberg provided information to investigators about Gaetz related to the sex-trafficking probe, a source familiar with the case previously told CNN. Women who attended parties with Greenberg and Gaetz previously told CNN that they participated in sex parties near Orlando that featured local political figures, young women, Venmo payments, alcohol, and drugs.\n\nGaetz has denied ever paying for sex or having sex with a minor, and no charges have been filed against Gaetz.\n\nCNN reported in September that prosecutors recommended against an indictment, though senior Justice Department officials get to make the final call – and it’s unclear if that decision has been made.\n\nGreenberg lawyer wants others charged\n\nAfter the sentencing, Greenberg’s attorney Fritz Scheller said he was “disappointed” that the Justice Department hasn’t charged anyone else as part of the sex-trafficking investigation, which includes Gaetz.\n\nScheller previously said in court that Greenberg gave investigators information about seven or eight other men as it pertains to the illegal sexual contact with a minor.\n\n“We expect the federal government to take on the hard cases and not just the easy convictions,” Scheller said, urging prosecutors to “pursue others.”\n\n“That’s what they’re there for,” Scheller added, saying the Justice Department should hold “higher-level” figures accountable for the sake of democracy.\n\nScheller said he and Greenberg communicated “fairly recently … in the past few months” with prosecutors as part of his cooperation in the sex-trafficking investigation.\n\nGreenberg’s “brazen” crime spree\n\nAfter initially facing 33 counts, Greenberg pleaded guilty in May 2021 to six federal crimes.\n\nThe stalking charge was related to a hoax that Greenberg perpetuated against a teacher who ran against him in 2020, when he was running for re-election as Seminole County tax collector.\n\nAs part of his plea, Greenberg admitted sending letters to the teacher’s school, falsely accusing them of sexual misconduct with a student. He also tried to make the teacher look racist by making fake social media accounts under their name and posting inflammatory material.\n\nThe judge said this was “perhaps the most egregious” of Greenberg’s crimes and said it was “downright evil” to frame the teacher of sexual misconduct. Greenberg apologized to the teacher, Brian Beute, at Thursday’s hearing, and Beute told reporters later that he accepts the apology.\n\nGreenberg also successfully scammed the Small Business Administration of $430,000 in Covid-19 relief funds by bribing a federal official, according to court filings.\n\nThe wire fraud charge stemmed from Greenberg misusing hundreds of thousands of Florida taxpayer dollars to make personal cryptocurrency investments. He used government equipment to make fake ID cards, and abused his access to a DMV database on his first day in office, according to court filings.\n\n“To have a tax collector stealing the money he collects is truly outrageous,” Presnell said. “… All of us are victims of crimes where the public trust is abused.”\n\nHaggling over a prison term\n\nFor his crimes, Greenberg faced decades in prison, but his cooperation deal significantly shortened his punishment. The two sides debated how much credit Greenberg deserves for assisting the Justice Department, weighed against the severity of his offenses.\n\nScheller acknowledged that Greenberg’s crimes were “outrageous” and “brazen” but said they were “the result of an impaired mind,” because Greenberg has bipolar disorder and was on the incorrect medication.\n\nHe said Greenberg struggled with his self-worth since he was a child. After being elected tax collector, “he was using money and sex to get access to political circles” and that he “tried to ingratiate himself” with high-profile figures – which includes Gaetz, though Scheller did not name the congressman.\n\nProsecutor Roger Handberg, the US attorney for the Middle District of Florida, acknowledged Greenberg’s substantial and “sincere” cooperation with related investigations, which have led to several indictments and guilty pleas in connection with Greenberg’s fraud schemes.\n\nBut he also said Greenberg “could not be deterred” during this three-year crime spree between 2017 and 2020 and that Greenberg “placed his wants and needs first, above everything else.”\n\nThe judge ultimately accepted Handberg’s recommendation of an 11-year prison term.\n\nAs part of the sentence, Greenberg will need to register as a sex offender when he leaves prison. The judge said Greenberg “is not a pedophile” because the girl he paid for sex was nearly 18 years old.\n\nPublic apology from Greenberg\n\nWearing a dark blue jail uniform, Greenberg briefly spoke during the hearing to offer an apology.\n\n“Nothing that I say today could justify my actions,” Greenberg said. “…I feel such remorse for what I’ve done.”\n\nHe apologized to the unnamed minor that he paid to have sex with, as well as to Beute, the teacher that he framed. He also tried to make amends with his former constituents in Seminole County.\n\n“I let you down and I betrayed your trust,” Greenberg said.\n\nScheller, Greenberg’s attorney, said his client has lost everything, including his marriage and his kids. He said Greenberg’s parents cut him out of their will, and that Greenberg sold his home so he could pay back the money he stole from Seminole County and the Small Business Administration.\n\n“I can never make up for what I’ve done,” Greenberg said, addressing his family, who did not attend the hearing.", "authors": ["Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/columns/nate-monroe/2022/05/19/rep-corrine-brown-plea-deal-legacy-tax-fraud-jacksonville-florida/9804664002/", "title": "Corrine Brown's plea deal corrupts her legacy but doesn't define it", "text": "COMMENTARY | Ex-U.S. Rep.

Weiss is one of a handful of appointees of former President Donald Trump who were kept on by the Biden administration because they were overseeing politically sensitive investigations.\n\nAdding to the pressure, Republicans in Congress have already announced that if they take over the House of Representatives after the midterm elections, they plan to launch new investigations and hold hearings to examine the conduct of Hunter Biden and others in the Biden family.\n\nAlso potentially in play are Justice Department guidelines governing politically sensitive investigations during an election year. Current and former Justice Department officials say there is an unwritten rule that prosecutors avoid bringing politically sensitive cases within 60 days of an election.\n\nSome current and former Justice officials have debated whether the rules necessarily apply in this instance since Joe Biden isn’t on the ballot in the midterms.\n\nA lawyer for Hunter Biden declined to comment. The US Attorney’s Office in Delaware declined to comment.\n\nHunter Biden has not been charged with any crimes and has previously denied any wrongdoing. His father is not being investigated as part of the probe of his son’s business activities, according to sources who have been briefed.\n\nNarrowing the focus\n\nThe Justice Department investigation initially focused on Hunter Biden’s financial and business activities in foreign countries dating to when Joe Biden was vice president. But investigators have examined a swath of broader conduct, including whether Hunter Biden and associates violated money laundering, campaign finance, tax and foreign lobbying laws, as well as whether Hunter Biden broke federal firearm and other regulations, multiple sources said.\n\nAs the investigation has entered its final stages, prosecutors have narrowed their focus to tax and gun-related charges, the people say.\n\nJustice officials have debated the strength of the case for months, and have held discussions about whether more work is needed before deciding on possible charges. Those discussions have involved investigators from the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation agency and prosecutors in Delaware and at Justice Department headquarters, CNN previously reported.\n\nHunter Biden has publicly discussed his own substance abuse struggles, and some Justice officials questioned whether his open discussions of his past drug use could potentially weaken their case should they bring one.\n\nSome officials have noted that Biden could argue he wasn’t aware of wrongdoing because he was on drugs, one source said. CNN has previously reported that some officials were concerned it could be a defense, but more recently, Justice officials have coalesced around the view that Biden’s own public accounts of his recovery show he was fully responsible for actions now under scrutiny, according to the person familiar with the discussions.\n\nIn the meetings, officials also discussed the timing of any possible indictment given the sensitivity of bringing a politically connected case close to an election, another person said.\n\nJustice Department memoranda advise prosecutors against bringing any cases or taking any overt investigative steps with the purpose of impacting an election or providing an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate.\n\nGarland issued a memo in May to prosecutors reiterating the department’s stance on election year sensitivities. The memo is one attorneys general send every election year, and generally advises prosecutors about avoiding making major investigative or charging decisions near an election to avoid the perception of partisan motives.\n\nIn 2018, the last year of congressional midterm elections, prosecutors with the US attorney’s office in Manhattan charged two politically sensitive cases in August: one against Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, and another against Chris Collins, then a Republican congressman and early Trump supporter who was up for reelection that year.\n\nIn both cases, prosecutors made their charging decisions with the elections in mind, people familiar with the cases said.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty that August to campaign finance, tax and other charges and completed a three-year prison sentence. Collins, who won his reelection while under indictment, later pleaded guilty and resigned his seat. Collins was sentenced to 26 months in prison but only served two months after he was pardoned by former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump Justice officials pushed back on a request by New York prosecutors to execute a search warrant on Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump’s personal attorneys, during the months around the 2020 election.

The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2016/02/04/eaa-principal-plead-guilty-corruption/79801412/", "title": "Ex-EAA principal pleads guilty: I betrayed public trust", "text": "Tresa Baldas\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\nEx-principal Kenyetta Wilbourn Snapp, a once-rising education star who was hailed a turnaround specialist in Detroit Public Schools, pleaded guilty today to bribery, admitting she pocketed a $58,050 bribe from a vendor and spent it on herself.\n\nAnd she did it while working for the embattled Education Achievement Authority, a state-formed agency that was supposed to help Detroit's most troubled schools.\n\n\"I received a bribe, sir,\" Snapp told U.S. District Judge David Lawson. \"I betrayed the public trust.\"\n\nAfter admitting her guilt in a case that could send her to prison for up to 46 months, Snapp stood and prayed in front of a window on the seventh floor of the federal courthouse. With her hands held out, she quietly uttered these phrases repeatedly: \"I call on you every night ... I thank you, Lord.\"\n\nSnapp, a central figure in an ongoing federal corruption probe into the EAA, faces 37-46 months in prison under the terms of her plea deal — though her cooperation could get her a sentence of 20 months maximum.\n\nSnapp, who will be sentenced June 1, was ordered to pay $58,050 in restitution to the EAA, which had given her authority as principal to choose vendors for her schools. This, Snapp admitted, is where she abused her position by granting a contract for after-school tutoring services to a vendor her paid her money in exchange. The tutoring was provided at Denby and Mumford, where Snapp became principal in 2013.\n\nSnapp, who once drove a Maserati with a Gucci vanity plate, admitted the money from the vendor influenced her decision to give her the contract.\n\n\"I used the money for my own purposes,\" said Snapp, who also admitted she hid about half of her ill-gotten gains from the IRS.\n\nSnapp, who pleaded guilty to tax evasion, will also have to pay $26,000 in restitution to the IRS.\n\nWith the fate of the EAA still in limbo, Snapp was one of two women to shed some light today on how fraud and corruption ran through an agency that was supposed to help Detroit’s worst schools.\n\nThe other was businesswoman Glynis Thornton, the vendor charged with paying Snapp the bribe. The 58-year-old woman also pleaded guilty to bribery, admitting she secretly paid Snapp to secure the contract. She did this, she said, by funneling payments to Snapp through an independent contractor who was also in on the scheme.\n\n\"I gave bribery money to K.C. Wilbourn in exchange for a contract,\" Thornton said.\n\nThe judge asked her: \"You knew it was illegal?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she answered.\n\nThornton faces 24-30 months in prison, though prosecutors have said they would drop it to as low as 15 months maximum if her cooperation \"substantially assists in the prosecution of others.\" She also has been ordered to pay $58,050 in restitution to the EAA, though the EAA won't get two payments. Both Thornton and Wilbourn could work out a deal to pay the restitution together.\n\nThornton, whose 16-year-old company Making a Difference Everyday provided tutoring services at Denby and Kerby high schools, explained how the scheme worked: Thornton would give an independent contractor the bribe money for Snapp, that contractor would meet Snapp at a bank, give her the money, and keep some for herself.\n\n\"She wanted to make some money, as well,\" Thornton said of the independent contractor.\n\nThat person is Paulette Horton, who has been charged in the same case and has a plea hearing scheduled for Feb. 25.\n\nPrincipal's plea hearing postponed in corruption case\n\nSnapp previously admitted to the Free Press in exclusive interviews that she broke the law, including burying a student’s parent with school funds. But she committed crimes because — Snapp claimed — she wanted to help underprivileged people, and cutting corners became easy.\n\nIndicted ex-principal lands job helping poor in Detroit\n\nSnapp has long been the central figure in a yearslong federal corruption probe into the EAA, the state reform district established by Gov. Rick Snyder for the lowest-performing schools. The EAA oversees 15 schools in Detroit.\n\nSince starting up in 2012, the EAA has had a rocky existence. Enrollment has dropped from nearly 10,000 students during its first year to about 7,000 today. Achievement has lagged, and there have been controversies over spending.\n\nThe Free Press first reported in October that a sweeping federal corruption probe of the EAA began more than 16 months ago and is focused on current and former top officials as well as vendor payments. Snapp has been at the center of the scrutiny.\n\nSnapp was hailed as a turnaround specialist when she worked at Detroit Public Schools, first at Denby High and later at Mumford High. Both schools were part of the DPS before they were placed in the EAA in 2012.\n\nSnapp abruptly resigned from the EAA in November 2014 after federal agents raided her apartment in downtown Detroit. Six months later, the EAA received a letter from the FBI saying Snapp was under investigation.\n\nSnapp told the Free Press in October that she had agreed to a deal to plead guilty to bribery and tax evasion.

He said the agreement was for a five-month sentence to be followed by five years of probation. The judge warned Weisselberg if he does not meet all the conditions of the plea agreement, “I would be at liberty to impose any lawful sentence which in your case includes imprisonment from 5 to 15 years.”\n\nThe plea puts him at odds with the Trump Organization, where he worked for 40 years, and his testimony could damage the company, if it goes to trial on related tax charges as scheduled in October.\n\nNicholas Gravante Jr., the lead attorney for Weisselberg, said in a statement that Weisselberg is happy to put this decision behind him.\n\n“In one of the most difficult decisions of his life, Mr. Weisselberg decided to enter a plea of guilty today to put an end to this case and the years-long legal and personal nightmares it has caused for him and his family,” Gravante said. “Rather than risk the possibility of 15 years in prison, he has agreed to serve 100 days. We are glad to have this behind him.”\n\nIn a statement provided to CNN Thursday, a spokesperson for the Trump Organization said, “The two Trump companies that the Manhattan DA has been targeting, however, will not be taking a plea for the simple reason that they have done nothing wrong. As a result, we now look forward to having our day in court, which, quite interestingly, has been scheduled for October 24 – just days before the midterm elections.”\n\nThe statement went on to call Allen Weisselberg, “a fine and honorable man” who has been “harassed, persecuted and threatened by law enforcement, particularly the Manhattan District Attorney,” all in an effort to get the former President.\n\nWeisselberg has been fiercely loyal to the Trump family, having worked for them since 1973. Yet even by providing testimony against the company Weisselberg will not implicate any Trump family members, who were not accused of any wrongdoing. If the Trump Organization is convicted, it could be required to pay back taxes and fines, but no individual will go to prison.\n\n“Today Allen Weisselberg admitted in Court that he used his position at the Trump Organization to bilk taxpayers and enrich himself,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a statement. “This plea agreement directly implicates the Trump Organization in a wide range of criminal activity and requires Weisselberg to provide invaluable testimony in the upcoming trial against the corporation. Furthermore, thanks to the incredibly hard work and dedication of the team prosecuting this case, Weisselberg will spend time behind bars. We look forward to proving our case in court against the Trump Organization,” Bragg said.\n\nWeisselberg will likely serve at Rikers Island, New York City’s notorious jail. With credit given for good behavior, one-third of the sentence could be knocked off, meaning Weisselberg could end up serving about 100 days behind bars. None of the charges facing Weisselberg have mandatory incarceration but the most serious of the charges has a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass said during the hearing that if Weisselberg fails to meet all of the obligations, they will recommend a sentence in state prison.\n\nThe Manhattan district attorney’s office announced the tax charges last summer as it put pressure on Weisselberg to cooperate against Trump in the wide-ranging investigation into whether the Trump Organization and its top executives provided misleading financial statements to obtain loans, insurance and tax benefits. No charges have been brought in that investigation, which prosecutors say is continuing.\n\nWeisselberg is not cooperating with New York prosecutors in that criminal investigation.\n\nThe guilty plea comes two months before Weisselberg was set to go to trial and one week after a New York state judge denied his motion to dismiss the indictment.\n\nRepresentatives for the Trump Organization have denied any wrongdoing. Trump has called the investigations politically motivated. No other executive was indicted in the tax case and Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump were not accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe Trump Organization was charged with 10 counts and Weisselberg with 15 felony counts in connection with an alleged scheme stretching back to 2005 “to compensate Weisselberg and other Trump Organization executives in a manner that was “off the books.”\n\nThere are few people, including Weisselberg, who could explain how decisions were made in the Trump Organization, and his testimony will provide insights at trial.\n\nWeisselberg acknowledged Thursday that the scheme was carried out with Jeffrey McConney, the longtime controller of the Trump Organization.\n\nMcConney, who reported to Weisselberg, received immunity for his testimony before the grand jury, people familiar with the matter previously told CNN. He was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment.\n\nWeisselberg’s guilty plea comes during a dramatic legal period for Trump, who last week at a deposition in the New York attorney general’s civil investigation, asserted his Fifth Amendment right and declined to answer hundreds of questions about the Trump Organization’s financial statements.\n\nThat came two days after the FBI executed a search warrant on Trump’s private Mar-a-lago residence in Florida, as part of a criminal investigation into the handling of presidential records, including classified documents.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell"], "publish_date": "2022/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/us/mississippi-john-davis-welfare-fraud-guilty-plea/index.html", "title": "Mississippi welfare scheme: Former state official pleads guilty in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA former top state official in Mississippi pleaded guilty Thursday to state and federal charges in connection to an embezzlement scheme that auditors say misused millions of welfare dollars, including funneling funds into projects linked to prominent Mississippians like former NFL star Brett Favre.\n\nOfficials from the US Department of Justice and the Hinds County District Attorney Office announced the one-time head of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, John Davis, had pleaded guilty to two federal counts and 18 state counts.\n\nDavis, 54, served as the director of the Human Services Department at the time state auditors say more than $70 million of federal welfare funds were being misused, including being spent on officials’ personal expenses and by charities on projects unrelated to the welfare program.\n\nThe DOJ said Davis and “his co-conspirators” used federal funds “for their personal use and benefit.”\n\n“At Davis’s direction, MDHS provided federal funds to two nonprofit organizations and then directed the two nonprofit organizations to fraudulently award contracts to various entities and individuals for social services that were never provided,” federal prosecutors said in a news release.\n\nOn Thursday, the former state official pleaded guilty to two federal charges: one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and to commit theft concerning programs receiving federal funds and one count of theft concerning programs receiving federal funds, the DOJ announced. He could be sentenced to up to five years in prison on the conspiracy count and 10 years on the theft count.\n\nDavis also pleaded guilty to five counts of conspiracy and 13 counts of fraud in Hinds County, District Attorney Jody E.

When State Auditor Shad White announced the finding, he called the scheme “the most egregious misspending my staff have seen in their careers.”\n\nThe eight-month long investigation showed that the department gave more than $98 million to two non-profits: The Mississippi Community Education Center and the Family Resource Center of North Mississippi. Of the $98 million, $94 million was “questioned,” meaning it was either definitively misspent or auditors were unable to determine whether it was legally spent.\n\nThe state auditor has said around $77 million of money was intended for a state welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.\n\nLast week White told CNN, “I think what you had was a lot of money being pushed through a state agency that decided to then funnel that money to a nonprofit. There just were not a ton of checks on how that nonprofit was spending this money until the auditor’s office started digging into it.\n\n“And then, you know, going another step forward into the future, I think that it’s important that we show the public that there are going to be consequences for this.”\n\nFavre’s alma mater got new volleyball arena\n\nAccording to investigators, more than $4 million was used to a build a Brett Favre-backed volleyball center at the University of Southern Mississippi, Favre’s alma mater, and where his daughter played the sport at the time.\n\nThe state of Mississippi filed a civil suit against more than 35 people and entities, including Pro Football Hall of Famer, earlier this year.\n\nText messages were released last week as part of that civil suit by attorneys for the non-profit founded by Nancy New, who has already pleaded guilty to charges related to the welfare funds scheme. They showed Favre discussing getting money through New’s nonprofit and expressing his love for Davis after being told of the funding, as well as meetings with Davis and former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant about the funding.\n\nBryant and Favre have not been criminally charged with any wrongdoing at this time. Bryant is also not named as a defendant in the civil suit.\n\nThe former quarterback’s attorney told CNN that Favre, who retired after the 2010 season and a 20-year NFL career, did not know welfare funds were being used for the volleyball center and that his fundraising efforts for the volleyball center were honorable.", "authors": ["Melissa Alonso Dianne Gallagher", "Melissa Alonso", "Dianne Gallagher"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/05/13/joel-greenberg-likely-plead-guilty-key-witness-against-matt-gaetz-florida/5074514001/", "title": "Joel Greenberg likely to plead guilty.

On average, 24 people were forced to flee each minute in 2015, the U.N. said.\n\nUN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said refugees also face increasing dangers.\n\n“At sea, a frightening number of refugees and migrants are dying each year; on land, people fleeing war are finding their way blocked by closed borders,\" Grandi said. \"Closing borders does not solve the problem.”\n\nThe report blames the booming refugee numbers in part on large numbers of refugees from places such as Somalia and Afghanistan, where wars have dragged on for decades. The report also says new or reignited conflicts are occurring more frequently — and that the rate at which solutions are being found for refugees and internally displaced people has been declining since the end of the Cold War.\n\nU.N. chief calls for more aid for Greece as it struggles with migrants\n\nIraq refugees return home: 'Europe didn't welcome us'\n\nThe internal politics in some nations blocks solutions, Grandi said.\n\n“The willingness of nations to work together not just for refugees but for the collective human interest is what’s being tested today, and it’s this spirit of unity that badly needs to prevail,” he said.\n\nThe report comes two days after United Nation Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on European nations to provide additional aid to Greece as it struggles to cope with the migrant crisis there. An estimated 1 million people fled Syria and nearby nations through Turkey to Greece last year, many of them risking their lives in crowded boats to seek asylum in the European Union.

Dramatic video filmed Wednesday showed crowds of people on a platform at Kharkiv train station queuing to get on a train to Uzhgorod, in the west, carrying their children and pets as they fled an assault on the city.\n\nWorryingly, a “big number” of those crossing into Poland are unaccompanied children, according to Poland’s Ambassador to the UN Krzysztof Szczerski. Many children crossing the border are leaving behind parents – particularly their fathers, who have been called by the Ukrainian government to stay behind and fend off Russian troops, he said.\n\nHumanitarian corridors\n\nOn Thursday, a second round of talks between Russia and Ukraine ended with an agreement on humanitarian corridors for civilians, but Ukraine said there were no breakthroughs beyond that.\n\nSenior Ukrainian official Mykhailo Podoliak said in a tweet: “The second round of negotiations is over. Unfortunately, the results Ukraine needs are not yet achieved. There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors.”\n\nThe head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, outlined some of the two-and-a-half-hour discussion to Russian media.\n\n“We have thoroughly discussed three points – military, international and humanitarian, and the third one is an issue of a future political regulation of the conflict. Both positions are clear and written down. We managed to agree on some of them, but the key thing that we have reached an agreement on today was a matter of rescuing civilians who found themselves in a military clash zone. Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministries agreed on providing humanitarian corridors for civilians and on a possible temporary ceasefire in areas where evacuation is happening,” Medinsky told journalists.\n\nAnother member of the Russian delegation, Leonid Slutsky, told Russia 24 that both sides have agreed on the third round of talks, which will happen in the “nearest future.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Czech government has declared a 30-day state of emergency from Friday in anticipation of a major influx of people fleeing the conflict.\n\nThe European Union has made the “historic decision” to grant temporary protection to all refugees fleeing the conflict, said the bloc’s Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, on Thursday.\n\nThe United Nations World Food Programme has launched an emergency operation to provide food assistance to people within Ukraine and in neighboring countries following an official request from the Ukrainian government. The organization is calling for $570 million to help refugees fleeing violence amid Russia’s ongoing invasion.\n\nMichelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement Thursday that, in addition to those who had left the country, one million people were displaced internally.\n\nBachelet said: “Thousands of people, including older people, pregnant women, as well as children and people with disabilities, are being forced to gather in underground shelters and subway stations to escape explosions. Many people in situations of vulnerability are separated from families and effectively trapped.”\n\nWith the scale of the humanitarian disaster becoming ever more apparent, the International Criminal Court announced Wednesday it had opened an immediate active investigation into possible war crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine.\n\nICC Prosecutor Karim A.A. Khan said in a statement Wednesday his office “had already found a reasonable basis to believe crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court had been committed, and had identified potential cases that would be admissible.”\n\nThe move came as the United States and other Western officials warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be shifting his strategy to further target cities and civilian infrastructure with heavy weapons and potentially “tens of thousands” of troops.\n\nThe Russian government has “strongly” rejected accusations that it has committed war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nIt’s unclear exactly how many Ukrainian civilians have been killed during the war, but the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission estimates there have been 750 civilian casualties. CNN cannot independently verify these numbers but there are fears of further casualties as Russian strikes hit built-up areas.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United Kingdom said it was “gravely concerned” by “reports of the use of cluster munitions” by Russia during its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. And earlier that day, US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Russia was moving banned weaponry into Ukraine.\n\n“We have seen videos of Russian forces moving exceptionally lethal weaponry into Ukraine, which has no place on the battlefield. That includes cluster munitions and vacuum bombs – which are banned under the Geneva Convention,” she said. Vacuum bombs, or thermobaric bombs are filled with high-temperature, high-pressure explosives and when detonated suck in the oxygen from the surrounding air to generate a powerful explosion and a large pressure wave that can have enormous destructive effects.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine, though CNN saw Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, on February 26.\n\nThe Russian advance in the south of Ukraine shows the beginning of a potential land bridge that could link the port city of Odessa, through Kherson and Mariupol to the separatist-held pro-Moscow territories in the east.\n\n“It is quite clear that Putin is pushing for a land corridor to Crimea.

A year later, he launched a conflict that spiraled into a brutal civil war, spawning one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.\n\nIn November 2020, Abiy ordered a military offensive in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region and promised that the clash would be resolved quickly. Two years on, the fighting has left thousands dead, displaced more than 2 million people and given rise to a wave of atrocities, including massacres, sexual violence and the use of starvation as a weapon of war.\n\nEthiopia was struggling with significant economic, ethnic and political challenges long before a feud between Abiy and the region’s former ruling party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), bubbled over into unrest and threatened to pull Africa’s second-most populous country apart.\n\nNow, after years of grinding conflict, the Ethiopian government and the leadership of the TPLF have agreed to cease hostilities and pull the country back from the brink. But the surprise truce leaves many questions unanswered, with few details on how it will be implemented and monitored.\n\nHere’s a closer look at what’s happening in Ethiopia.\n\nHow did the conflict start?\n\nAn Ethiopian refugee prays at an Orthodox church near a refugee camp in Gedaref, eastern Sudan, on December 6, 2020. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Tigray conflict has its roots in tensions that go back generations in Ethiopia.\n\nThe country is made up of 10 regions – and two cities – that have a substantial amount of autonomy, including regional police and militia. Because of a previous conflict with neighboring Eritrea, there are also a large number of federal troops in Tigray. Regional governments are largely divided along entrenched ethnic lines.\n\nBefore Abiy Ahmed came to power, the TPLF had governed Ethiopia with an iron grip for decades, overseeing a period of stability and economic growth at the cost of basic civil and political rights. The party’s authoritarian rule provoked a popular uprising that ultimately forced Abiy’s predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn, to resign.\n\nIn 2018, Abiy was appointed by the ruling class to quell tensions and bring change, without upending the old political order. But almost as soon as he became prime minister, Abiy announced the rearrangement of the ruling coalition that the TPLF had founded – the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Front, or EPRDF, which was composed of four parties – into a single, new Prosperity Party, ostracizing the TPLF in the process.\n\nIn his drive for a new pan-Ethiopian political party, Abiy sparked fears in some regions that the country’s federal system – which guarantees significant autonomy to ethnically-defined states such as Tigray – was under threat. Leaders in Tigray withdrew to their mountainous heartland in the north, where they continued to control their own regional government.\n\nTensions boiled over in September 2020, when the Tigrayans defied Abiy by going ahead with regional parliamentary elections that he had delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Abiy called the vote illegal and lawmakers cut funding to the TPLF leadership, setting off a tit-for-tat series of escalations between the regional and the federal government.\n\nOn November 4, 2020, after accusing the TPLF of attacking a federal army base outside Tigray’s regional capital Mekelle and attempting to steal its weapons, Abiy ordered a military assault against the group, sending in national troops and fighters from the neighboring region of Amhara, along with soldiers from Eritrea. Getachew Reda, a senior TPLF leader, said in an op-ed in Foreign Policy that the group attacked the base in an “act of self-defense.” CNN cannot confirm the claims of either side.\n\nAbiy declared the offensive a success after just three weeks, but the conflict dragged on for two years, with both sides trading control over the regional capital Mekelle, gaining and losing ground.\n\nAn earlier humanitarian ceasefire broke down in August and fighting has intensified in the months since. The clashes, combined with a lack of fuel and the communications blackout, has severely curtailed aid distribution to the region.\n\nOn October 17, amid reports of heavy bombing in Shire and other Tigrayan cities, and food supplies running out in the regional capital Mekelle triggering fears of famine, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that the situation in the Tigray region was “spiraling out of control,” and that the violence had “reached alarming levels.”\n\nThe UN chief called for an “immediate withdrawal and disengagement of Eritrean armed forces from Ethiopia,” and the urgent resumption of talks, which had been due to take place in September.\n\nA damaged tank on a road north of Mekelle, the capital of Tigray, on February 26 EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhat does the peace agreement actually mean?\n\nAfter just over a week of formal peace talks mediated by the African Union (AU) in South Africa’s administrative capital Pretoria, delegates from both sides of Ethiopia’s war agreed to a “permanent cessation of hostilities.” The surprise truce was signed by Getachew Reda from the TPLF and Redwan Hussein, national security adviser to Ethiopia’s federal government, on the eve of the second anniversary of the start of the war, on November 3.\n\nThe document laid out a number of key objectives, including the disarmament of fighters, unhindered humanitarian access to Tigray, repairing essential services in the region, providing a framework for accountability and justice, and restoring some semblance of stability in the country.\n\n“We have agreed to permanently silence the guns and end the two years of conflict in northern Ethiopia,” both sides said in a joint statement, published after delegates shook hands.\n\nThose involved in mediating the deal signaled that it was just the first in a long series of steps toward negotiating a more enduring peace. Mediators have also warned that forces fighting on the ground could easily disrupt the pact. Still, the UN has called it a “critical first step” towards ending the conflict.\n\n“This is not the end of the peace process but the beginning of it,” said Olusegun Obasanjo, the AU’s high representative for the Horn of Africa and a former Nigerian president, who first announced the deal.\n\nAbiy, whose military, backed by Eritrean forces, has made rapid gains in Tigray over recent weeks, celebrated the conclusion of the talks, saying: “Our commitment to peace remains steadfast. And our commitment to collaborating for the implementation of the agreement is equally strong.”\n\nBut how the deal will be implemented is unclear, with analysts pointing out that the text raises more questions than it answers.\n\n“These kinds of agreements should include constructive ambiguity, on the issues that are contested,” Kjetil Tronvoll, an expert on Ethiopian politics at Bjorknes University College in Norway, told CNN. “But here it’s not constructive it’s more destructive, in that it will undermine the trust process and could possibly jeopardize the durability of the agreement.”\n\nRepresentatives from Ethiopia and the TPLF and mediators at a press conference announcing the agreement in Pretoria, South Africa. Phill Magakoe/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere are a number of points in the agreement that Tronvoll said raise concerns, particularly one issue that was omitted entirely: the status of Eritrean forces in Tigray, which the text makes no mention of in spite of their outsized role in the conflict. Though the agreement states that the Ethiopian military will be deployed along the country’s borders, it does not specify whether they will ensure Eritrea’s withdrawal. “I don’t see any sustainable peace process if Eritrean forces are still on the ground,” Tronvoll said.\n\nThe deal is widely being seen as a capitulation by the TPLF, which, by Getachew’s own account, have suffered huge losses since hostilities resumed. “In order to address the pains of our people, we have made concessions because we have to build trust,” he said, adding that civilians and fighters were dying as he spoke.\n\nThe swift 30-day timeline for the overall disarmament and demobilization of Tigrayan fighters has raised eyebrows. And the agreement does not outline what force will replace them to provide security guarantees for Tigray’s civilian population, who have suffered widespread abuses at the hands of Ethiopian forces.\n\nThe agreement also states that the Ethiopian government will ensure “accountability, ascertaining the truth, redress for victims,” but ultimately how that accountability might come about is opaque.\n\n“It’s one of the key issues left unanswered … how accountability will come about,” Tronvoll said. “Ultimately it is the generals and Abiy Ahmed himself who should be held to account. I don’t know if anyone believes he’ll sign off on an agreement in which he would be put on trial.”\n\nWhat atrocities have been committed in the conflict?\n\nFor months at the start of the conflict, Abiy denied that civilians were being harmed or that soldiers from Eritrea had joined the fight. But reports from international observers, human rights groups and CNN proved both of those claims wrong.\n\nThousands of people have died in the fighting, by many estimates, with reports of razed refugee camps, looting, sexual violence, massacres and extrajudicial killings. Many more have fled to Sudan, in what the United Nations has called the worst exodus of refugees from Ethiopia seen in two decades. They describe a disastrous conflict that’s given rise to ethnic violence.\n\nEthiopia’s government has severely restricted access to journalists, and a state-enforced communications blackout concealed events in the region, making it challenging to gauge the extent of the crisis or verify survivors’ accounts.\n\nBut evidence of atrocities began to leak out last year.\n\nTigrayans grieve by a mass grave in the city of Wukro, north of Mekele, on February 28, 2021. EDUARDO SOTERAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCNN investigations have uncovered evidence of massacres carried out in two Tigrayan towns, by Eritrean forces in Dengelat, and by Ethiopian soldiers in Mahibere Dego. A CNN team on the ground in central Tigray last April captured Eritrean troops – some disguising themselves in old Ethiopian military uniforms – operating with total impunity, manning checkpoints and blocking vital humanitarian aid to starving populations more than a month after Abiy pledged to the international community that they would leave.\n\nAll actors in the conflict have been accused of carrying out atrocities, but Eritrean forces have been linked to some of the most gruesome. In addition to perpetrating mass killings and rape, Eritrean soldiers have also been found blocking and looting food relief in multiple parts of Tigray.\n\nEritrea’s government has denied any involvement in atrocities. Ethiopia’s government has pledged investigations into any wrongdoing.\n\nThe conflict, which erupted during the autumn harvest season following the worst invasion of desert locusts in Ethiopia in decades, plunged Tigray even further into severe food insecurity. The UN has repeatedly issued warnings about de facto humanitarian aid blockades, barring critical food and assistance to Tigray.\n\nThe Ethiopian government has repeatedly rejected allegations that it is blocking aid. But days after the UN’s aid chief warned Tigray was facing a “man-made” famine, Ethiopia ordered seven senior UN officials to be expelled from the country, including from organizations coordinating relief efforts.\n\nThere are currently about 5.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Tigray, including 3.8 million in desperate need of healthcare, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nOn the same day that the truce was announced, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it had been two months since the last humanitarian aid reached the region, and that large numbers of displaced people were arriving in or moving toward Mekelle seeking assistance every day.\n\n“Since the beginning of the siege, food, medicine and other basic services have been weaponised,” Tedros said. “It has now been more than two months since the last humanitarian aid reached Tigray. But even before that, the aid reaching Tigray was a trickle – nowhere near enough to meet the needs.”\n\nHow did Abiy win the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nEthiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed campaigns in Jimma on June 16, 2021. Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than a year before Abiy launched an assault on his own people, he described war as “the epitome of hell” during his acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was awarded the honor for his role in ending a long-running conflict with neighboring Eritrea and for pushing significant reforms in Ethiopia.\n\nEritrea was once a part of Ethiopia, but won independence in 1993 after a 30-year armed struggle. From 1998 to 2000, Ethiopia and Eritrea fought a war that killed thousands on both sides, which led to a long, dangerous stalemate and a total freeze in cooperation.\n\nOnce in power, Abiy moved quickly to normalize relations with Eritrea, in part by accepting the ruling of an international commission on boundaries between the two states.\n\nAbiy also made significant moves towards domestic reforms, raising hopes that he would bring about lasting change. As well as forging a truce with Eritrea, he lifted a severe security law, released thousands of political prisoners, moved to open up the telecommunications industry and expand private investment.\n\nBut his reputation as a leader who could unite Ethiopia has swiftly deteriorated, and his much-lauded peace deal with Eritrea appears to have paved the way for the two countries to go to war with their mutual foe – the TPLF.\n\nSince the conflict began, ethnically-driven violence has broken out into other parts of the country, including in Abiy’s home region, Oromia, the country’s most populous region. Last May, the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), an armed group, vowed to wage “total war” against Abiy’s government.\n\nDespite promises to heal ethnic divides and pave the way for a peaceful, democratic transition, Abiy has increasingly invoked the playbook of repressive regimes: Shutting down internet and telephone services, arresting journalists and suppressing critics. Abiy has also been criticized for fueling “inflamed” rhetoric amid the conflict in Tigray, whose forces he has described as “weeds” and “cancer.”\n\nLast July, in the midst of the war, Abiy and his party won a landslide victory in a general election that was boycotted by opposition parties, marred by logistical issues and excluded many voters, including all those in Tigray – a crushing disappointment to many who had high hopes that the democratic transition Abiy promised would be realized.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/europe/russia-invasion-ukraine-03-08-intl/index.html", "title": "Civilians flee Sumy after evacuation corridor opens, as 2 million ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA tense and fleeting evacuation from Ukraine’s northeastern city of Sumy took place on Tuesday after Russian airstrikes killed 21 people, including two children, the night before, Ukrainian authorities said.\n\nUkrainian officials confirmed that an evacuation corridor allowing residents out of the city opened on Tuesday morning, following days of sustained Russian attacks. It came as the United Nations estimated that more than 2 million refugees have fled Ukraine since Moscow’s invasion on February 24.\n\nThe agreed ceasefire was set to last until 9 p.m. local time (2 p.m. ET), with final evacuations taking place 90 minutes before that time. Buses have been used to take people to Poltava, around 100 miles away in central Ukraine, said Dmytro Lunin, head of the Poltava regional administration, on his Telegram channel on Tuesday.\n\nOne convoy was delayed by an outbreak of firing at the outskirts of Sumy, according to the city’s regional head, Dmitry Zhyvitsky. But Zhyvitsky was quoted in local media as saying the Russian forces did not shoot on the convoy.\n\n“At the moment, citizens are being evacuated by their own vehicles,” Zhyvytsky said on Telegram. “After 19:30 the checkpoint closes and it will be impossible to leave Sumy.”\n\nThe frantic rush to escape the city, during a break in its assault by Russian forces, was not replicated in other cities. Officials across the country have condemned Russia in recent days for offering unfeasible routes of escape that lead to Russia or its ally Belarus, and for reneging on ceasefire agreements by opening fire on fleeing civilians.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday that Russian troops are holding 300,000 civilians “hostage” in the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where he said a child died of dehydration.\n\nUkrainian authorities said that a long-awaited convoy of humanitarian aid to the city appeared to have come under fire on Tuesday. Russian troops are not allowing “children, women and the elderly” out of the city, and have launched an attack “precisely in the direction of the humanitarian corridor,” Ukraine’s Joint Forces Operation said.\n\nCNN has been unable to verify the status of the convoy and has reached out to the Russian side for a response.\n\nA senior US defense official said Tuesday that Mariupol as of now been “isolated” by Russian forces, though Russian forces are only still bombarding the city and are not inside it “in any significant way.”\n\nCNN has previously reported that Mariupol residents have been cut off from water and electricity for days.\n\nMeanwhile in regions around the capital Kyiv, the humanitarian situation remains fraught.\n\n“The main issue today remains humanitarian aid,” Oleksiy Kuleba, the head of the Kyiv Regional Military Administration, said in a YouTube video.\n\nResidents of Bucha, Irpin, Gostomel, Makariv, Borodyanka and Vorzel are “forced to stay in bomb shelters for days without water and food,” he said, adding that Moscow is preventing “humanitarian evacuation despite agreements with ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) mediation.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Russian forces “violated their obligations under international humanitarian law not to conduct indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks that harm civilians,” following a report that eight civilians were killed over the weekend as they were trying to flee the Russian army’s advance in northern Ukraine.\n\nThat warning came after the UK Ministry of Defence, in its latest intelligence assessment. accused Russian forces of targeting evacuation corridors and killing “several civilians” trying to evacuate the town of Irpin.\n\nZelensky calls for help as Ukrainians flee west\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky criticized the international community for remaining on the “sidelines” of the Russian invasion.\n\nAddressing the UK’s House of Commons on Tuesday via video, Zelensky said that “we will fight to the end,” echoing former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill’s famous wartime speech.\n\n“We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets,” he said. Zelensky pleaded with British lawmakers to “strengthen the sanctions” against Moscow, requested that the UK recognize Russia “as a terrorist state” and reiterated his request with NATO to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine.\n\nNATO has assisted Ukraine with equipment and intelligence, but has resisted implementing a no-fly zone over its airspace.\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the military alliance has a “responsibility to ensure that the conflict does not spread beyond Ukraine” during a joint press conference in Riga with the Latvian President Egils Levits.\n\n“That would be even more dangerous, destructive, and even more deadly,” said Stoltenberg. “The situation could spiral out of control,” he said.\n\nOn the ground, fighting continued in multiple locations as the Russian invasion neared the end of its second week.\n\nIn the southern city of Mykolaiv, regional administrator Vitali Kim asked residents to gather tires, which will be set on fire to impede Russian troop movement in the city.\n\n“In order to limit visibility for the enemy vehicles in the city, I need tires at every intersection in the city,” Kim said in a message posted to Telegram. “If the vehicles break through in some direction, the task will be to go out and set fire to the tire so that there is smoke in order to limit visibility.”\n\nExplosions are seen in the southern city of Mykolaiv on Monday. From Telegram\n\nThe senior US defense official said Tuesday that Russian forces have not yet entered Mykolaiv, a key city that could be used as part of a coordinated assault against the city of Odessa, though there has been an increase in bombardment and shelling.\n\nThe official said that Russian forces are still trying to advance on the cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv, but are still facing resistance and are making more progress in the south of Ukraine than elsewhere in the country.\n\nIn total Russia has launched “nearly 670” missiles since the beginning of their invasion, a separate senior US defense official told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nAlmost half of the missiles launched have been fired from Russia, “the other half largely from inside Ukraine,” the official said. “A little bit more than 70” missiles have been fired from Belarus, and “only a half dozen or so” are coming from the Black Sea, the official added.\n\nA humanitarian crisis keeps growing\n\nMeanwhile, the humanitarian effect of Russia’s invasion were also laid bare on Tuesday, when UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told French radio station France Inter that more than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began.\n\nThe milestone is a “terrifying” number, said Grandi. Most of the refugees have traveled to Poland, Moldova and other neighboring countries “where they have connections, family,” he added.\n\n“What worries me, what we fear is a second wave of persons who have a good deal less resources and connections and who will be much more vulnerable,” said Grandi.\n\nAt least 1.2 million refugees have crossed the border from Ukraine into Poland since the invasion began, the Polish Border Guard tweeted Tuesday, with 141,500 entering on Monday alone.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta Jack Guy", "Rob Picheta", "Jack Guy"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/24/middleeast/shireen-abu-akleh-jenin-killing-investigation-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "New evidence suggests Shireen Abu Akleh was killed in targeted ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story contains a disturbing image.\n\nCNN —\n\nSeveral shots ring out in quick succession, cutting through a clear, blue spring morning in Jenin, in the West Bank. Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.\n\nThe cameraman filming the scene scrambles backwards to take cover behind a low concrete wall. Then a man cries out in Arabic: “Injured! Shireen, Shireen, oh man, Shireen! Ambulance!”\n\nWhen the camera operator pans around the corner, Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh can be seen lying motionless, face down on the ground as another Palestinian reporter, Shatha Hanaysha, crouches down beside her, using a tree trunk for cover. Hanaysha reaches out and tries to rouse her as gunshots continue. There’s no response. Both women are wearing helmets and blue protective vests marked “Press.”\n\nIn the moments that follow, a man in a white T-shirt makes several attempts to move Abu Akleh, but is forced back repeatedly by gunfire. Finally, after a few long minutes, he manages to drag her body from the street.\n\nThe shaky video, filmed by Al Jazeera cameraman Majdi Banura, captures the scene when Abu Akleh, a 51-year-old Palestinian-American was killed by a bullet to the head at around 6:30 a.m. on May 11. She had been standing with a group of journalists near the entrance of Jenin refugee camp, where they had come to cover an Israeli raid. While the footage does not show Abu Akleh being shot, eyewitnesses told CNN that they believe Israeli forces on the same street fired deliberately on the reporters in a targeted attack. All of the journalists were wearing protective blue vests that identified them as members of the news media. ​\n\n“We stood in front of the Israeli military vehicles for about five to ten minutes before we made moves to ensure they saw us. And this is a habit of ours as journalists, we move as a group and we stand in front of them so they know we are journalists, and then we start moving,” Hanaysha told CNN, describing their cautious approach toward the Israeli army convoy, before the gunfire began.\n\nWhen Abu Akleh was shot, Hanaysha said she was in shock. She couldn’t understand what was happening. After Abu Akleh dropped to the ground, Hanaysha thought she might have stumbled. But when she looked down at the reporter she had idolized since childhood, it was clear she wasn’t breathing. Blood was pooling under her head.\n\n“As soon as she [Shireen] fell, I honestly wasn’t comprehending that she [was shot] … I was hearing the sound of bullets, but I wasn’t comprehending that they were coming at us. Honestly, the whole time I wasn’t understanding,” she said.\n\n“I thought they were shooting so we stayed back, I didn’t think they were trying to kill us.”\n\nOn the day of the shooting, Israeli military spokesperson Ran Kochav told Army Radio that Abu Akleh had been “filming and working for a media outlet amidst armed Palestinians. They’re armed with cameras, if you’ll permit me to say so,” according to The Times of Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military says it is not clear who fired the fatal shot. In a preliminary inquiry, the army said there was a possibility Abu Akleh was hit either by indiscriminate Palestinian gunfire, or by an Israeli sniper positioned about 200 meters (about 656 feet) away in an exchange of fire with Palestinian gunmen — though neither Israel nor anyone else has provided evidence showing armed Palestinians within a clear line of fire from Abu Akleh.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on May 19 that it had not yet decided whether to pursue a criminal investigation into Abu Akleh’s death. On Monday, the Israeli military’s top lawyer, Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said in a speech that under the military’s policy, a criminal investigation is not automatically launched if a person is killed in the “midst of an active combat zone,” unless there is credible and immediate suspicion of a criminal offense. United States lawmakers, the United Nations and ​the international community ​have all called for an independent probe.\n\nBut an investigation by CNN offers new evidence — including two videos of the scene of the shooting — that there was no active combat, nor any Palestinian militants, near Abu Akleh in the moments leading up to her death. Videos obtained by CNN, corroborated by testimony from eight eyewitnesses, an audio forensic analyst and an explosive weapons expert, suggest that Abu Akleh was shot dead in a targeted attack by Israeli forces.\n\nAl Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Facebook/Shireen Abu Akleh\n\nThe footage shows a calm scene before the reporters came under fire in the outskirts of Jenin refugee camp, near the main Awdeh roundabout. Hanaysha, four other journalists and three local residents said that it had been a normal morning in Jenin, home to about 345,000 people — 11,400 of whom live in the camp. Many were on their way to work or school, and the street was relatively quiet.\n\nThere was a frisson of excitement as the veteran journalist, a household name across the Arab world for her coverage of Israel and the Palestinian territories, arrived to report on the raid. About a dozen or so men, some dressed in sweats and flip-flops, had gathered to watch Abu Akleh and her colleagues at work. They were milling around chatting, some smoking cigarettes, others filming the scene on their phones.\n\nIn one 16-minute cellphone video shared with CNN, the man filming walks toward the spot where the journalists had gathered, zooming in on the Israeli armored vehicles parked in the distance, and says: “Look at the snipers.” Then, when a teenager peers tentatively up the street, he shouts: “Don’t kid around … you think it’s a joke? We don’t want to die. We want to live.”\n\nIsraeli raids on the Jenin refugee camp have become a regular occurrence since early April, in the wake of several attacks by Palestinians that left Israelis and foreigners dead. Some of the suspected assailants of those attacks were from Jenin, according to the Israeli military. Residents say the raids often lead to injuries and deaths. On Saturday, a 17-year-old Palestinian was killed and an 18-year-old was critically injured by Israeli fire during a raid, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.\n\nSalim Awad, the 27-year-old Jenin camp resident who filmed the 16-minute video, told CNN that there were no armed Palestinians or any clashes in the area, and he hadn’t expected there to be gunfire, given the presence of journalists nearby.\n\n“There was no conflict or confrontations at all. We were about 10 guys, give or take, walking around, laughing and joking with the journalists,” he said. “We were not afraid of anything. We didn’t expect anything would happen, because when we saw journalists around, we thought it’d be a safe area.”\n\nBut the situation changed rapidly. Awad said shooting broke out about seven minutes after he arrived at the scene. His video captures the moment that shots were fired at the four journalists — Abu Akleh, Hanaysha, another Palestinian journalist, Mujahid al-Saadi, and Al Jazeera producer Ali al-Samoudi, who was injured in the gunfire — as they walked toward the Israeli vehicles. In the footage, Abu Akleh can be seen turning away from the barrage. The footage shows a direct line of sight towards the Israeli convoy.\n\nPalestinian journalist Shatha Hanaysha pictured in the West Bank city of Ramallah on May 12, a day after she and Abu Akleh came under fire.

We were standing right there, we saw it. When we tried to approach her, they shot at us. I tried to cross the street to help, but I couldn’t,” Awad said, adding that he saw that a bullet struck Abu Akleh in the gap between her helmet and protective vest, just by her ear.\n\nA 16-year-old, who was among the group of men and boys on the street, told CNN that there were “no shots fired, no stone throwing, nothing,” before Abu Akleh was shot. He said that the journalists had told them not to follow as they walked toward Israeli forces, so he stayed back. When the gunfire broke out, he said he ducked behind a car on the road, three meters away, where he watched the moment she was killed. The teenager shared a video with CNN, filmed at 6:36 a.m., just after the journalists left the scene for the hospital, which showed the five Israeli army vehicles driving slowly past the spot where Abu Akleh died. The convoy then turns left before leaving the camp via the roundabout.\n\nCNN reviewed a total of 11 videos showing the scene and the Israeli military convoy from different angles — before, during and after Abu Akleh was killed. Eyewitnesses who were filming when the journalist was shot were also in the line of fire and pulled back when the gunfire started, so do not capture the moment she is hit with the bullet. ​\n\nThe visual evidence reviewed by CNN includes a body camera video released by the Israeli military, which captures soldiers running through a narrow alleyway, holding M16 assault rifles, and variants, as they spill out onto the street where the armored vehicles are parked. An Israeli military source told CNN that both sides were firing M16 and M4 style assault rifles that day.\n\nIn the videos, five Israeli vehicles can be seen lined up in a row on the same road where Abu Akleh was killed, to the south. The vehicle closest to the journalists, emblazoned with a white number one, and the vehicle furthest away, marked with the number five, are both positioned perpendicular across the street. Toward the rear of the vehicles, directly above the numbers, is a narrow rectangular opening in the exterior of the vehicle.\n\nThe Israeli military referenced such an opening in a statement about its initial investigation into Abu Akleh’s shooting, saying that the journalist may have been hit by an Israeli soldier shooting from a “designated firing hole in an IDF vehicle using a telescopic scope,” during an exchange of fire. Several eyewitnesses told CNN that they saw sniper rifles sticking out of the openings before the shooting began, but that it was not preceded by any other gunfire.\n\nJamal Huwail, a professor at the Arab American University in Jenin, who helped drag Abu Akleh’s lifeless body from the road, said he believed the shots were coming from one of the Israeli vehicles, which he described as a “new model which had an opening for snipers,” because of the elevation and direction of the bullets.\n\n“They were shooting directly at the journalists,” Huwail said.\n\nHuwail, a former parliamentarian and member of the Palestinian Fatah Party in Jenin, first met Abu Akleh two decades ago, when Israel launched a major military operation in the camp, destroying more than 400 homes and displacing a quarter of its population. When he spoke with the journalist briefly that morning of May 11 at the Awdeh roundabout, she had showed him a video of one of their early interviews from 2002. The next time he saw her up close, she was dead.\n\nShireen Abu Akleh lies face down in the street, after having been shot in the head. from Al Jazeera\n\nIn videos of the dawn army raid on Jenin camp earlier in the morning, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants can be seen battling each other with M16 assault rifles and variants, according to Chris Cobb-Smith, an explosive weapons expert. That means both sides would have been shooting 5.56-millimeter bullets. To trace the bullet that killed Abu Akleh to the barrel of a specific gun would likely require a joint Israeli-Palestinian probe, since the Palestinians have the bullet that killed Abu Akleh, while CNN’s investigation suggests the Israelis have the gun. None is immediately forthcoming. While Israel weighs whether to launch a criminal investigation, the Palestinian Authority has ruled out collaborating with the Israelis on any investigation.\n\nA senior Israeli security official flatly denied to CNN on May 18 that Israeli troops killed Abu Akleh intentionally. The official spoke under the condition of anonymity to discuss details about an investigation that remains formally open.\n\n“In no way would the IDF ever target a civilian, especially a member of the press,” the official told CNN.\n\n“An IDF soldier would never fire an M16 on automatic. They shoot bullet by bullet,” the official said, in contrast with ​Israel’s assertion that Palestinian militants were firing “recklessly and indiscriminately” while its soldiers conducted the raid in Jenin.\n\nIn a statement emailed to CNN, the IDF said it was conducting an investigation into the killing of Abu Akleh. It “calls on the Palestinian Authority to cooperate with a joint forensic examination with American representatives to conclusively determine the source of the tragic death.”\n\nAnd added, “assertions regarding the source of the fire that killed Ms. Abu Akleh must be carefully made and backed by hard evidence. This is what the IDF is striving to achieve.”\n\nEven without access to the bullet that hit Abu Akleh, there are ways to determine who killed Abu Akleh by analyzing the type of gunfire, the sound of the shots and the marks left by the bullets at the scene.\n\nCobb-Smith, a security consultant and British army veteran, told CNN he believed Abu Akleh was killed in discrete shots — not a burst of automatic gunfire. To reach that conclusion, he looked at imagery obtained by CNN, which show markings the bullets left on the tree where Abu Akleh fell and Hanaysha was taking cover.\n\n“The number of strike marks on the tree where Shireen was standing proves this wasn’t a random shot, she was targeted,” Cobb-Smith told CNN, adding that, in sharp contrast, the majority of gunfire from Palestinians captured on camera that day were “random sprays.”\n\nPalestinian journalist Mujahid al-Saadi, who was with Abu Akleh when she was killed, points to bullet marks on the tree in Jenin where she died. Nedal Eshtayah/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nAs evidence, he pointed to two videos that showed Palestinian gunmen firing haphazardly down alleyways in different parts of Jenin. The videos were circulated by the office of Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and Israel’s foreign ministry, with a voiceover in Arabic saying: “They’ve hit one — they’ve hit a soldier. He’s lying on the ground.”\n\nBecause no Israeli soldiers were reported killed on May 11, Bennett’s office said the video suggested that “Palestinian terrorists were the ones who shot the journalist.” CNN geolocated the videos shared by Bennett’s office to the south of the camp, more than 300 meters, or 1,000 feet, away from Abu Akleh. The coordinates of the two locations, which were verified using Mapillary, a crowdsourced street imagery platform, and footage of the area filmed by Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, demonstrate that the shooting in the videos couldn’t be the same volley of gunfire that hit Abu Akleh and her producer, Ali al-Samoudi. CNN was also unable to verify independently when the footage was filmed.\n\nAccording to the Israeli army’s initial inquiry, at the time of Abu Akleh’s death, an Israeli sniper was 200 meters away from her. CNN asked Robert Maher, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University, who specializes in forensic audio analysis, to assess the footage of Abu Akleh’s shooting and estimate the distance between the gunman and the cameraman, taking into account the rifle being used by the Israeli forces.\n\nThe video that Maher analyzed captures two volleys of gunfire; eyewitnesses say Abu Akleh was hit in the second barrage, a series of seven sharp “cracks.” The first “crack” sound, the ballistic shockwave of the bullet, is followed approximately 309 milliseconds later by the relatively quiet “bang” of the muzzle blast, according to Maher. “That would correspond to a distance of something between 177 and 197 meters,” or 580 and 646 feet, he said in an email to CNN, which corresponds almost exactly with the Israeli sniper’s position.\n\nAt 200 meters, Cobb-Smith said that there was “no chance” that random firing would result in three or four shots hitting in such a tight configuration. “From the strike marks on the tree, it appears that the shots, one of which hit Shireen, came from down the street from the direction of the IDF troops. The relatively tight grouping of the rounds indicate Shireen was intentionally targeted with aimed shots and not the victim of random or stray fire,” the firearms expert told CNN.\n\nA Palestinian artist paints a mural in Gaza City honoring Shireen Abu Akleh, and depicting Shatha Hanaysha crouching beside her after she was killed.

The people here are very sad for her loss,” he said.\n\nLast month, Abu Akleh celebrated her birthday in Jenin, when she was there to cover an Israeli miltary raid, her longtime colleague, cameraman Majdi Banura, recalled. Banura and Abu Akleh started at Al Jazeera on the same day 25 years ago, and spent much of their careers out in the field together.\n\nBanura is still reeling from having seen Abu Akleh, whom he had filmed countless times before, die in front of his own eyes. But when the gunfire broke out, he knew he had to continue rolling, saying that it was important to have a “continuous record” of her killing.\n\n“To be honest, as I was filming, I had hoped that she will be alive, but I knew seeing her motionless she had been killed,” Banura said.\n\n“Her picture doesn’t leave my life and memory, everything I say or do or touch, I see her.”", "authors": ["Zeena Saifi Eliza Mackintosh Celine Alkhaldi Kareem Khadder Katie Polglase Gianluca Mezzofiore Abeer Salman Oscar Featherstone", "Zeena Saifi", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Celine Alkhaldi", "Kareem Khadder", "Katie Polglase", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Abeer Salman", "Oscar Featherstone"], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/05/middleeast/idf-shireen-abu-akleh-investigation-intl/index.html", "title": "Shireen Abu Akleh: Israeli military admits journalist likely killed by ...", "text": "Jerusalem CNN —\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces have ​admitted for the first time that there is a “high possibility” Palestinian-American Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed by Israeli fire while covering an Israeli military operation in Jenin in May, the IDF announced Monday.\n\n“[I]t appears that it is not possible to unequivocally determine the source of the gunfire which hit and killed Ms. Abu Akleh. However, there is a high possibility that Ms. Abu Akleh was accidentally hit by IDF gunfire fired toward suspects identified as armed Palestinian gunmen during an exchange of fire,” the IDF said in a statement.\n\nBut the Israeli military does not intend to pursue criminal charges or prosecutions of any of the soldiers involved, IDF’s Military Advocate General’s Office said Monday in a separate statement.\n\n“After a comprehensive examination of the incident, and based on all the findings presented, the Military Advocate General determined that under the circumstances of the incident, despite the dire result – the death of Ms. Abu Akleh and Mr. Samudi’s injury – there was no suspicion of a criminal offense that warrants the opening of an MPCID investigation,” the statement said. Abu Akleh’s producer Ali al-Samoudi was wounded in the incident.\n\n“The decision was based on the findings of the review, which determined that IDF soldiers only aimed fire at those who were identified as armed terrorists during the incident. As such, there was no suspicion that a bullet was fired deliberately at anyone identified as a civilian and in particular at anyone identified as a journalist,” the statement said.\n\nA senior IDF official who briefed journalists on the findings ​of the military’s investigation before they were released said the IDF troops did not know they were shooting at the press​, and said that Abu Akleh’s back “probably” being turned to the soldiers was a contributing factor. In images from the scene of the shooting, Abu Akleh is wearing a protective vest that is labeled “PRESS” on both the front and back.\n\n“When they were firing in that direction, the soldiers were not aware they were firing at journalists. They thought they were firing at militants firing at them,” the IDF official said.\n\nA CNN investigation in May unearthed evidence – including two videos of the scene of the shooting – that there was no active combat, nor any Palestinian militants, near Abu Akleh in the moments leading up to her death. Footage obtained by CNN, corroborated by testimony from eight eyewitnesses, an audio forensic analyst and an explosive weapons expert, suggested that Israeli forces intentionally took aim at Abu Akleh.\n\nAl Jazeera, Abu Akleh’s employer, has consistently asserted that the Israeli military is responsible for her death. The network condemned the IDF investigation, saying the delay of more than 100 days since the shooting “is intended to evade the criminal responsibility it bears for the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh.”\n\n“Al Jazeera denounces the Israeli occupation army’s lack of frank recognition of its crime. The network calls for an independent international party to investigate the crime of the assassination of Shireen Abu Akleh, in order to accomplish justice for Shireen, her family and fellow journalists around the world,” the network said in a statement.\n\nWhen asked about investigations, including CNN’s, that found no militants near Abu Akleh when she was shot, the IDF official said: “It is our estimate that there were militants in the vicinity of Ms. Abu Abkleh. Maybe not one meter beside her but they were in that area​,” but the official did not provide evidence to support that claim.​\n\n“When the soldier made that decision, it was a blink of a decision,” the official said. “The soldier did not intend to injure an Al Jazeera journalist or [journalist] from any other network.”\n\n“The soldier is sorry, and I am sorry. This was not supposed to happen and it should not happen. He did not do this on purpose,” the official said. ​He did not name the soldier.\n\nIn Monday’s briefing with reporters, the senior IDF official said the bullet that killed Abu Akleh was too badly damaged to be able to identify which gun fired it, the same conclusion a US-led forensic investigation came to.\n\nHowever, the IDF has concluded that the soldier who likely fired the fatal shot was to the south of Abu Akleh in an armored military vehicle with limited range of sight, did not identify Abu Akleh as a journalist and thought he was shooting at militants.\n\nThe official said soldiers in the area had been under fire “for an hour and fifteen minutes” before Abu Akleh was killed.\n\nAsked why the gunfire appeared to continue even after Abu Akleh fell, the official said they counted no more than seven bullets fired after she was shot. There were Israeli drones filming during the operation, the official said, but not in a high enough resolution to be able to see the fatal shot.\n\nIn the initial aftermath of Abu Akleh’s death, Israeli officials first posited that it was likely indiscriminate Palestinian militant gunfire that killed her, before acknowledging it was possible Israeli gunfire was responsible for her death.\n\nIn their report on Monday, the IDF left open the possibility that Abu Akleh “was hit by bullets fired by armed Palestinian gunmen toward the direction of the area in which she was present.”\n\nAccording to the Palestinian autopsy, Abu Akleh was killed by a single bullet to the back of the head.\n\nShireen Abu Akleh’s family slammed the IDF investigation, saying Israel had “refused to take responsibility for murdering Shireen,” and called for an independent US investigation.\n\nThe report “tried to obscure the truth and avoid responsibility for killing Shireen Abu Akleh, our aunt, sister, best friend, journalist, and a Palestinian American,” the family said in a statement sent to CNN.\n\n“We’ve known for over 4 months now that an Israeli soldier shot and killed Shireen as countless investigations conducted by CNN, the Associated Press, the New York Times, Al Jazeera, Al-Haq, B’tselem, the United Nations, and others have all concluded,” the statement said.\n\n“And yet, as expected, Israel has refused to take responsibility for murdering Shireen. Our family is not surprised by this outcome since it’s obvious to anyone that Israeli war criminals cannot investigate their own crimes. However, we remain deeply hurt, frustrated, and disappointed.”\n\n“Since Shireen was killed our family has called for a thorough, independent, and credible US investigation that leads to accountability, which is the bare minimum the US government should do for one of their own citizens. We will continue to demand that the US government follow through with its stated commitments to accountability. Accountability requires action.”\n\nIn a statement Monday, State Department spokesperson Ned Price welcomed the IDF review and stressed “the importance of accountability in this case, such as policies and procedures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.”\n\n“Our thoughts remain with the Abu Akleh family as they grieve this tremendous loss – and with the many others worldwide who brought Shireen and her news reports into their homes for more than two decades,” Price said. “Not only was Shireen an American citizen, she was a fearless reporter whose journalism and pursuit of truth earned her the respect of audiences around the world.”\n\nIn July the United States found that gunfire from the Israeli military was “likely responsible” for the killing of Abu Akleh, although an examination overseen by the US of the bullet “could not reach a definitive conclusion” on its origin due to the condition of the bullet.\n\nThe US Security Coordinator – who leads an inter-agency team that coordinates with the Israeli government and the PA – “found no reason to believe that this was intentional but rather the result of tragic circumstances during an IDF-led military operation against factions of Palestinian Islamic Jihad on May 11, 2022, in Jenin, which followed a series of terrorist attacks in Israel,” according to a statement at the time from the State Department.\n\nThe IDF has been carrying out regular raids in the West Bank, especially in the Jenin area, targeting what it says are militants and weapons caches. The raid in Jenin when Abu Akleh was killed came shortly after a months-long wave of attacks by Palestinians that left 19 Israelis and foreigners dead. Some of the suspected assailants of those attacks were from Jenin, according to the Israeli military.", "authors": ["Hadas Gold Abeer Salman", "Hadas Gold", "Abeer Salman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/europe/ukraine-russia-invasion-sunday-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Putin orders Russian deterrence forces onto high alert as troops ...", "text": "Kyiv, Ukraine CNN —\n\nA Ukrainian delegation will meet with a Russian delegation on Monday for talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border following assurances from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.\n\nThe announcement came Sunday as Ukrainian forces engaged in fierce fighting with Russian troops in multiple cities across Ukraine.\n\nRussia is facing universal condemnation and increased sanctions from Western powers over Moscow’s unprovoked assault on Ukraine, now in its fourth day.\n\nUkraine’s Deputy Interior Minister Evgeny Yenin said the talks would take place Monday morning local time.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had earlier said he would be willing to hold talks with Russia but not in Belarus, pointing out that Russian military actions are being launched from that country.\n\nOn Sunday, Zelensky said in a brief televised statement that he doesn’t expect much from the meeting.\n\n“I will say frankly, as always: I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try. So that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” Zelensky said.\n\nUkraine has said its air force shot down a cruise missile launched at Kyiv on Sunday from Belarus. Belarus is an ally of Russia and has played an important role in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nZelensky’s office said Lukashenko had called his Ukrainian counterpart on Sunday. “The politicians have agreed that the Ukrainian delegation will meet with the Russian delegation without preconditions on the Ukrainian-Belarusian border, near the Pripyat River,” Zelensky’s office said.\n\n“Aleksander Lukashenko has taken responsibility for ensuring that all planes, helicopters and missiles stationed on the Belarusian territory will remain on the ground during the Ukrainian delegation’s travel, meeting and return.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin ordered his country’s deterrence forces – which include nuclear arms – onto their highest state of alert on Sunday.\n\n“Top officials in leading NATO countries have allowed themselves to make aggressive comments about our country, therefore I hereby order the Minister of Defense and the chief of the General Staff to place the Russian Army Deterrence Force on combat alert,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top Russian defense officials.\n\nPutin also said the Western sanctions placed on Russia were unlawful.\n\nA senior US official told CNN that the new development is Putin’s latest attempt to manufacture threats to justify aggression.\n\n“The only reason his forces face a threat today is because they invaded a sovereign country, and one without nuclear weapons,” said the official. “This is yet another escalatory and totally unnecessary step.”\n\nAs the fighting continues, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have fled their homes and dozens of civilians have been killed, according to UN figures.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told a briefing that Putin’s order to put Russian deterrent forces on alert was a “direct threat to us” and an effort to raise pressure on the Ukrainian delegation at Monday’s scheduled talks.\n\nKuleba indicated that Ukrainian officials are willing to “listen to what Russia has to say” but will not give in to pressure. “We will tell them what we think of this,” he said. “And what we are ready to discuss is how to stop the war and the occupation of our territories. Full stop.”\n\nKuleba said that, according to Ukrainian intelligence, even people within Putin’s inner circle do not agree with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, “because they understand the detrimental, the damaging, the devastating consequences this conflict will have for Russia itself.”\n\nFighting in Kharkiv, missiles in Kyiv\n\nEarlier Sunday, residents of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, awoke to find the city still firmly under Ukrainian control, despite two massive explosions some 30 kilometers, or about 18 miles, south of the city lighting up the sky overnight.\n\nAnd fighting broke out on the streets of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, after Russian forces entered the city, Oleh Synehubov, the head of the Kharkiv Regional State Administration, said Sunday. “Do not leave your shelters!” he posted on Facebook, warning civilians not to go out on the streets.\n\n“Intensive exchanges of rocket artillery overnight have been followed by heavy fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv,” an assessment by the UK’s Ministry of Defence said.\n\nUkrainian forces had managed to deter the Russians from entering the northeastern city – home to about 1.4 million people – for the past three days. The city, which sits less than 20 miles south of the Russian border, was approached by Russian forces shortly after the invasion began.\n\nBut despite being far better equipped, Russia has failed to take control of key cities, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists join efforts to defend their homes and families.\n\nOthers are fleeing the conflict. The United Nations estimates as many as 368,000 Ukrainians are now refugees.\n\nThe UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late Saturday that the United Nations “reports at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 people killed” in the fighting in Ukraine. Damage to civilian infrastructure has deprived hundreds of thousands of people of access to electricity or water, the statement added.\n\nIn a video message Sunday, Zelensky accused Russian troops of targeting civilians, including children, and called for an international investigation into the conflict.\n\nThe Russian Ministry of Defense has previously said it is targeting only military infrastructure, saying in a statement: “The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation do not strike cities and towns, they take all measures to save the lives of civilians.”\n\nBut Zelensky rejected this, saying: “They lied when they said they would not target civilian population. Since the first hours of the invasion, Russian troops have been hitting civilian infrastructure.”\n\nUkraine is “documenting their crimes,” he said, adding: “This is terror.”\n\nRussian offensive failing, Ukrainian PM says\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Saturday that Russia’s offensive was failing and it was now deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure, including kindergartens, residential blocks and “buses with children” – actions he labeled as “war crimes.”\n\n“The Russian government doesn’t understand they are not fighting only with the government, in fact they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,” he added.\n\nRussian troops are facing a determined and highly-motivated Ukrainian resistance, resulting in significantly slower progress than Kremlin military planners had first anticipated, according to an assessment issued by Britain’s Ministry of Defence late Saturday. After encountering strong resistance in Chernihiv, Russian forces were now bypassing the area to prioritize “the encirclement and isolation of Kyiv,” another British assessment said Sunday.\n\nRussia is facing unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, and is experiencing heavier losses in personnel, armor and aircraft than expected, two senior United States officials with direct knowledge told CNN.\n\nThe US continues to see Russian forces facing “stiff resistance” and their momentum has slowed in the northern part of Ukraine, a senior US defense official told reporters Sunday, citing fuel shortages and logistical issues.\n\nThe official noted that the Russians are having a “little bit more success” in the south, and would learn from their logistical issues and find ways to overcome them.\n\nUkrainian Maj. Gen. Borys Kremenetsky told reporters Saturday that Ukraine had captured around 200 Russian soldiers, some of whom were just 19 years old. They were not trained at all and were badly equipped, he said. CNN has not been able to independently verify this.\n\nOn Sunday, Russian authorities acknowledged a number of deaths and injuries in Ukraine for the first time since the beginning of the invasion.\n\n“Russian servicemen are displaying courage and heroism in fulfilling combat tasks in the special military operation,” Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said. “Unfortunately, there have been deaths and injuries among our comrades.”\n\nWithout providing precise numbers, Konashenkov also noted that the losses suffered by Russian troops were “considerably lower” than those by Ukrainian forces.\n\nRussia has yet to establish air supremacy over Ukraine, one US official said, as the Ukrainian Air Force and air defense systems fight for control of the airspace. Without uncontested control of the skies, it becomes more difficult for an army on the move to see and strike targets from the air.\n\nSo far these challenges have prevented the quick overthrow of major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, which US officials were concerned could play out in a matter of days. The city of Kharkiv near Ukraine’s border with Russia also has not fallen to invading forces – despite officials worrying that could happen on the first night of an invasion.\n\nA NATO official agreed that Russian forces were having problems.\n\n“They lack diesel, they are proceeding way too slow and morale is obviously an issue,” said the official.\n\nAsked whether Russians are likely to intensify their efforts, the official said they have no choice. “They are way behind schedule,” the official said. “This is getting out of hand for them, every additional day is very painful.”\n\nBut the Russians on Sunday countered reports of its military stalling, claiming the cities of Kherson and Berdyansk “were completely blocked” by Russian forces, and the city of Henichesk and the Chornobayivka airfield near Kherson, also known as Chernobayevka, had both been brought under control.\n\nMaj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, the Russian Ministry of Defense spokesperson, said a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile regiment surrendered in the Kharkiv region and 471 Ukrainian servicemen were captured.\n\nCNN could not immediately verify those claims.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said on Sunday that checkpoints would be set up across the country to detect Russian troops and make their movements more difficult.\n\nAccusations of war crimes\n\nConcerns are now growing that Russia may look to deploy indiscriminate battlefield weaponry in civilian areas in an attempt to decisively crush Ukrainian forces.\n\nA CNN team spotted a Russian thermobaric multiple rockets launcher south of Belgorod, Russia, near the Ukrainian border early Saturday afternoon.\n\nThermobaric weapons have been used in Chechnya, with horrifying consequences, according to Human Rights Watch, and their use has been condemned by number of non-governmental organizations.\n\nThere is no evidence that thermobaric weapons have been used in the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia moves in heavy flamethrower weapon 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nAlthough Russia has claimed it is not targeting civilian infrastructure, an increasing body of evidence on the ground suggests otherwise.\n\nKyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Sunday that nine civilians, including one child, had been killed in Kyiv since the invasion began, as well as 18 military and territorial defense personnel. There are currently no Russian troops in the capital, he added. The mayor extended a strict curfew across the city until Monday morning.\n\nAccording to a local hospital, a six-year-old boy died in heavy gunfire in a western district of Kyiv on Saturday evening.\n\nA woman was killed after a nine-story residential building in the eastern city of Kharkiv was hit by “enemy artillery” on Saturday night, according to Ukraine’s State Emergency Service.\n\nPolish officials said Sunday that 187,000 people had entered Poland from Ukraine since the invasion began on Thursday.\n\nA defiant Ukraine\n\nAs the battle continues, a defiant Zelensky has released a series of videos from the streets of Kyiv urging citizens to defend their country.\n\nOfficials armed reservists with 18,000 guns and ammunition in Kyiv alone, and Ukrainian TV has broadcast instructions for making Molotov cocktails.

This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” he said.\n\nThe Ukrainian military on Sunday claimed successful attacks by its Turkish-made force of drones against Russian forces. The Armed Forces of Ukraine released footage showing the destruction of armor by a drone and said that it was carried out against a Russian Buk surface-to-air missile system.\n\nValerii Zaluzhnyi, the Armed Forces commander-in-chief, said the drone attack took place near the town of Malyn, about 100 kilometers (or 62 miles) northwest of Kyiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian government began receiving the Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey last year.\n\nWestern powers have imposed several rounds of sanctions against Russia since Thursday, with more under consideration. On Saturday, the United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada said they would expel some Russian banks from SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, and “paralyze” the assets of Russia’s central bank.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russian state TV is covering the war very differently 02:24 - Source: CNN\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz vowed Sunday that “very soon the Russian leadership will feel what a high price they will have to pay” for the invasion of Ukraine, as he announced he would raise German military funding during a special session with lawmakers.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed Sunday that the European Union is shutting down its airspace to Russia.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian-registered and Russian-controlled aircraft.

This will apply to any plane,” von der Leyen said.\n\n“Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane. And that includes the private jets of oligarchs too,” she added.\n\nOn Sunday, the EU also announced a ban on Russian news outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, according to the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell.\n\n“Today we are taking a crucial step to turn off the tap for the Russian’s information manipulation in Europe by banning Russia Today and Sputnik from broadcasting in the European Union,” Borrell said at a joint press conference in Brussels.\n\nAt home, the Kremlin appears to be in damage control, attempting to limit information about the difficulties its forces are facing in Ukraine.\n\nSocial media platform Twitter said Saturday it is being restricted inside Russia and is working to address the issue.\n\nRussia’s media regulator told 10 news outlets that it would restrict access to their publications unless they stopped spreading “false information” – including the shelling of Ukrainian cities and the death of civilians caused by the Russian armed forces.\n\nNonetheless, Russians continued to turn out for anti-war protests over the weekend.

The conflict explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nRussia’s multi-pronged invasion of Ukraine has thrust the country into a conflict that many on the European continent had thought was one for the history books. Now the country is in the throes of war, with a humanitarian disaster unfolding.\n\nAfter months of military buildup and brinkmanship on Russia’s side of the border, Ukraine’s 44 million residents woke up to an all-out conflict on Thursday. Fighting has erupted in several cities across the country, including in the capital, Kyiv, and nearly a half a million people have fled to neighboring countries, according to the United Nations.\n\nRussia had been tightening its military grip around Ukraine since last year, amassing tens of thousands of soldiers, as well as equipment and artillery, on the country’s doorstep.\n\nBlack smoke rises from a military airport in Chuguyev near Kharkiv, the second-largest city in Ukraine, on Thursday. Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFrenzied diplomatic efforts early this year failed to avert the worst-case scenario. Now those troops are engaged in combat with Ukrainians for control of the country.\n\nThe escalation in a years-long conflict between the nations has now triggered the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. Russia’s attack on the country has also sparked an intense showdown between Western powers and Moscow.\n\nSo how did we get here? The picture on the ground is shifting rapidly, but here’s a breakdown of what we know.\n\nHow did Russia invade Ukraine?\n\nSeveral areas across Ukraine came under attack on Thursday morning after Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the start of a “special military operation” and warned of bloodshed unless Ukrainian forces lay down their arms.\n\nThe move came after months of speculation about what Moscow’s intentions were with the troops it had massed on the Ukrainian border. At least 150,000 Russian troops encircled the country on three sides, like a sickle, according to estimates from US and Ukrainian intelligence officials.\n\nIn late 2021 and early 2022, fears heightened as satellite images revealed new Russian deployments of troops, tanks, artillery and other equipment cropping up in multiple locations, including near eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Belarus, where its forces were participating in joint drills with Moscow’s closest international ally.\n\nSome of those forces began pouring across the border, crossing into Ukraine from the north in Belarus and to the south from Crimea, according to the Ukrainian State Border Service. Elsewhere, explosions rang out in multiple cities, including the capital Kyiv.\n\nMissile strikes and street fighting have raged in the days since. Military aged men have been ordered to stay in Ukraine, while countless others have fled westwards towards Poland or Romania.\n\nRussia’s larger and far better-equipped military has, faced determined resistance across the country, as ordinary Ukrainians and reservists have joined efforts to defend their families and homes, frustrating Moscow’s attempts.\n\nThat resistance has been “stiffer than expected” and Russia has had unexpected difficulties supplying its forces, two senior US officials with direct knowledge told CNN. On the battlefield, Russia is suffering heavier losses in personnel and armor and aircraft than expected. This is due in part to the fact that Ukrainian air defenses have performed better than pre-invasion US intelligence assessments had anticipated.\n\nBut US intelligence and defense officials closely tracking the Russian campaign say that Putin still holds a number of moves in reserve that could devastate the Ukrainian resistance.\n\nThe US and its allies have said they have no intention of sending troops into Ukraine, which is not a NATO member. But Ukraine has received assistance in other forms from Europe, the US and beyond, as the West united in condemnation of Putin’s move. NATO’s Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg condemned the Russian attack as a “grave breach of international law, and a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security.”\n\nAnd a raft of heavy sanctions have threatened to cripple Russia’s economy; Moscow has been virtually cut off from the Western financial apparatus and the value of its currency, the ruble, has tanked.\n\nThe coordinated assault came days after Putin announced that Moscow would officially recognize the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics (DNR and LNR), in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in what was widely believed to be the opening salvo to a broader military confrontation.\n\nThe territory recognized by Putin extended beyond the areas controlled by pro-Russian separatists, raising red flags about Russia’s intended creep into Ukraine.\n\nWhat set the stage for the conflict?\n\nUkraine was a cornerstone of the Soviet Union until it voted overwhelmingly for independence in a democratic referendum in 1991, a milestone that turned out to be a death knell for the failing superpower.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO pushed eastward, bringing into the fold most of the Eastern European nations that had been in the Communist orbit. In 2004, NATO added the former Soviet Baltic republics Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Four years later, it declared its intention to offer membership to Ukraine some day in the distant future – crossing a red line for Russia.\n\nPutin has seen NATO’s expansion as an existential threat, and the prospect of Ukraine joining the Western military alliance a “hostile act” – a view he invoked in a televised speech on Thursday, saying that Ukraine’s aspiration to join the military alliance was a dire threat to Russia.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Putin has previously emphasized his view that Ukraine is part of Russia, culturally, linguistically and politically. While some of the mostly Russian-speaking population in Ukraine’s east feel the same, a more nationalist, Ukrainian-speaking population in the west has historically supported greater integration with Europe.\n\nIn early 2014, mass protests in the capital Kyiv known as Euromaidan forced out a Russia-friendly president after he refused to sign an EU association agreement. Russia responded by annexing the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and fomenting a separatist rebellion in Ukraine’s east, which seized control of part of the Donbas region. Despite a ceasefire agreement in 2015, the two sides have not seen a stable peace, and the front line has barely moved since. Nearly 14,000 people have died in the conflict, and there are 1.5 million people internally displaced in Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nIn the eight years since, Moscow has been accused of engaging in hybrid warfare against Ukraine, using cyberattacks, economic pressure and propaganda to whip up discord. Those tactics have escalated in recent months, and in early February the State Department claimed Putin was preparing a false-flag operation to create “a pretext for an invasion.”\n\nWhat does Putin want?\n\nIn a lengthy essay penned in July 2021, Putin referred to Russians and Ukrainians as “one people,” and suggested the West had corrupted Ukraine and yanked it out of Russia’s orbit through a “forced change of identity.”\n\nThat type of historical revisionism was on full display in Putin’s emotional and grievance-packed address to the nation last Monday announcing his decision to recognize the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, while casting doubt on Ukraine’s own sovereignty.\n\nBut Ukrainians, who in the last three decades have sought to align more closely with Western institutions like the European Union and NATO, have pushed back against the notion that they are little more than the West’s “puppet.”\n\nIn fact, Putin’s efforts to bring Ukraine back into Russia’s sphere have been met with a backlash, with several recent polls showing that a majority of Ukrainians now favor membership of the US-led transatlantic military alliance.\n\nIn December, Putin presented the US and NATO with a list of security demands. Chief among them was a guarantee that Ukraine will never enter NATO and that the alliance rolls back its military footprint in Eastern and Central Europe – proposals that the US and its allies have repeatedly said are non-starters.\n\nPutin indicated he was not interested in lengthy negotiations on the topic. “It is you who must give us guarantees, and you must do it immediately, right now,” he said at his annual news conference late last year. “Are we deploying missiles near the US border? No, we are not. It is the United States that has come to our home with its missiles and is already standing at our doorstep.”\n\nHigh-level talks between the West and Russia wrapped in January without any breakthroughs. The standoff left Europe’s leaders to engage in a frenzy of shuttle diplomacy, exploring whether a negotiating channel established between France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine to resolve the conflict in Ukraine’s east – known as the Normandy Format talks – could provide an avenue for calming the current crisis.\n\nIn a news conference with the new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on February 16, Putin repeated unsubstantiated claims that Ukraine is carrying out a “genocide” against Russian speakers in the Donbas region and called for the conflict to be resolved through the Minsk peace progress – echoing similar rhetoric that was used as a pretext for annexing Crimea.\n\nBut less than a week later, after Russia’s upper house of parliament approved the deployment of military forces outside the country on February 22, Putin told reporters that the Minsk agreements “no longer exist,” adding: “What is there to implement if we have recognized these two entities?”\n\nThe agreements, known as Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 – which were hammered out in the Belarusian capital in a bid to end a bloody in eastern Ukraine – have never been fully implemented, with key issues remaining unresolved.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have long been at odds over key elements of the peace deal, the second of which was inked in 2015 and lays out a plan for reintegrating the two breakaway republics into Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently stated that he did not like a single point of the Minsk accords, which require dialogue on local elections in the Russian-backed separatist regions and – although unclear in what sequence – would also restore the Ukrainian government’s control over its eastern borders. Critics say the agreement could give Moscow undue sway over Ukrainian politics.\n\nPutin previously responded in blunt terms by saying that regardless of whether Zelensky likes the plan, it must be implemented. “Like it or don’t like it, it’s your duty, my beauty,” Putin said in a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron. Zelensky, a former comedian and TV star, won a 2019 election in a landslide on promises to end the war in Donbas, but little has changed. Responding to a question about Putin’s stark, undiplomatic language, Zelensky responded in Russian, saying bluntly: “We are not his.”\n\nHow has Ukraine responded?\n\nPresident Zelensky previously downplayed the danger of all-out war with Russia, noting that the threat has existed for years and that Ukraine is prepared for military aggression. But on Thursday, as Russia launched an assault on his country, Zelensky made an emotional address directly to the Ukrainian people, declaring martial law in the country.\n\n“Russia began an attack on Ukraine today. Putin began war against Ukraine, against the entire democratic world. He wants to destroy my country, our country, everything we’ve been building, everything we are living for,” Zelensky said in a video message posted on his official Facebook page.\n\nAcross the country, residents have been preparing for the worst – packing emergency evacuation kits and taking time out of their weekends to train as reservists.\n\nUkraine’s government insists that Moscow cannot prevent Kyiv from building closer ties with NATO, or otherwise interfere in its domestic or foreign politics. “Russia cannot stop Ukraine from getting closer with NATO and has no right to have any say in relevant discussions,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to CNN.\n\nZelensky has since requested Ukraine be admitted “urgently” to the European Union, and has implored Western leaders to help boost Ukrainian forces on the ground.\n\nDelegates from Ukraine and Russia held talks on Monday near the border of Belarus, a country which has assisted Putin’s invasion, and which Ukrainian officials fear could soon put its own boots on the ground in support of Russia.\n\nUkraine demanded a full Russian withdrawal in advance of those talks, but it is unclear whether the meetings will result in a Russian retreat. Zelensky downplayed the significance of the talks, which he did not attend in person. “I do not really believe in the result of this meeting, but let them try, so that no citizen of Ukraine would have any doubt that I, as president, did not try to stop the war when there was even a small chance,” he said Sunday,\n\nPeople in Quezon City, Philippines, light candles in the shape of a peace sign February 28 as they protest Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine views the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline – connecting Russian gas supplies directly to Germany – as a threat to its own security.\n\nNord Stream 2 is one of two pipelines that Russia has laid underwater in the Baltic Sea – in addition to its traditional land-based pipeline network that runs through eastern Europe, including Ukraine. Kyiv views the pipelines across Ukraine as an element of protection against invasion by Russia, since any military action could potentially disrupt the vital flow of gas to Europe.\n\nAfter requests from Zelensky and the US administration, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that he would halt the certification of the pipeline following Putin’s decision to order troops into parts of eastern Ukraine.\n\nNord Stream 2 was just one of myriad challenges facing Zelensky’s government; the former actor, who played a president on Ukrainian television, had experienced a brutal baptism of fire into real-world politics since assuming office in 2019, thanks in part to the pandemic and ongoing tensions with Russia.\n\nBut in the days since the invasion, admiration for him has soared both inside and outside Ukraine; Zelensky refused to leave the country and has instead posted frequent videos from the streets of Kyiv, where he has been encouraging his fellow countrymen to resist Russian forces.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/columnists/courtney-crowder/2019/09/11/iowa-kosovo-balkans-russia-foreign-diplomacy-sister-states-cities-national-guard-army-military-usa/1559250002/", "title": "Iowa and Kosovo: How Iowa is helping develop a small Balkan nation", "text": "VUSHTRRI, Kosovo — Sipping macchiatos in the shadow of a Byzantine-era castle, Xhafer Tahiri recalls memories from 20 years ago as quickly and precisely as the names of his children.\n\nMarch 24, 1999, was the day NATO forces’ bombs lit up the Kosovo horizon, bringing Tahiri hope that the injustices he and his fellow Albanians suffered at the hands of the Serbians might be over.\n\nApril 15, 1999. The night that fighting between Serbian and NATO forces arrived on his doorstep, forcing the 15-year-old and his eight siblings to leave their home with only what they could carry.\n\nJune 15, 1999. The morning his family returned to their village of Vushtrri to discover a patch of scorched earth and a few bent and broken walls where their home once stood.\n\nThen there's Aug. 13, 2018, when, as mayor of his hometown, Tahiri walked the Iowa State Fair’s Grand Concourse, threw out the first pitch at an Iowa Cubs game and watched the flag of Kosovo — Europe's youngest democracy — rise outside the City Hall of Norwalk, Vushtrri's sister city.\n\nTalk of pork chops on sticks and Big Boars might seem wholly out of place in this traditionally Muslim country half a world away from Iowa, but Tahiri is far from alone in his reverence for the Hawkeye State.\n\nFor years, Iowans in and out of military fatigues have quietly worked to lift this tiny country out of chaos and poverty spawned by years of bloody conflict and a campaign of ethnic cleansing.\n\nThey are, in many regards, literally helping grow a new nation — and putting Iowa on the front lines of foreign diplomacy in the process.\n\nIn more than 20 trips annually, members of the Iowa National Guard along with civilian partners instill American interests in the Balkans — a strategic foothold in the shadow of Russia that has for much of the modern era been the political powder keg that lit the world on fire.\n\nFor Iowa, the relationship — which marks the first time a U.S. state has formed both a security and civil partnership with an entire country — is not simply a feel-good venture, said Lt. Col. Michael Wunn, former director of the Iowa-Kosovo partnership.\n\nFrom establishing the first foreign consulate in Iowa to cultivating new revenue opportunities to training a burgeoning military, Kosovo has opened almost as many doors for Iowans as Iowa has for Kosovars.\n\n\"It's good for America to have a friend in the Balkans for the same reason it’s good for America to be in Korea,” said Mark Baskin, a former civil servant with the area’s U.N. peacekeeping mission. “If the state of Iowa is carrying forward the interests of the United States in this region, it’s playing a very significant role — even if it’s not the center of attention in the news.”\n\nIn the 10 years since Kosovo declared independence, it endures as an example of American intervention that worked. Yet, the nation is at a tipping point.\n\nKey members of the U.N. Security Council, including Russia and China, have refused to recognize Kosovo's independence, and the country hasn’t met requirements to join the European Union or NATO.\n\nKosovo’s inability to stabilize Serbian relations has led to shaky security and an unemployment rate of more than 30 percent.\n\nBut with roughly half of the population under age 25, a growing group of young Kosovars is pushing to fight corruption, fix the justice system and stem Islamic extremism.\n\n\"People here are resilient because they've lived through very difficult times,\" said Baskin, who now teaches at Rochester Institute of Technology’s Kosovo campus.\n\n\"I have friends here who have seen seven or eight members of their family killed during the war, and yet they're OK. They’re moving forward.\"\n\nAs the young country continues to fight for change and embrace optimism, Kosovo's future is one that Iowa is helping shape.\n\nIn a nightmare, dreaming of freedom\n\nBy May 2, 1999, Tahiri’s 11-person family was living in a \"2-square meter\" nylon tent just inside the Kosovo Liberation Army's lines.\n\nEvery day, they split their meager rations. Every night, Tahiri fell asleep to the sound of explosions over his rumbling tummy.\n\n\"If I close my eyes, I’m back there immediately,\" he said. \"And the worst part was the fact that we never knew if we are going to make it through alive.\"\n\nOn that particularly gray spring day in his hometown, more than 100 villagers trying to evade Serbian forces were instead massacred in a field just outside city limits. Videos of the aftermath show their belongings strewn across the pasture, each hastily dropped as the villagers tried to outrun Serbian bullets.\n\nVillagers were buried where they fell, which today is a grazing area for cows.\n\nThis graveyard — where the headstones have been replaced with a uniform black granite — is emblematic of the dichotomous way the war is both remembered and forgotten.\n\nAll across the country, markers and memorials sit in the center of towns, on roadsides or in fields, but life in this modernizing country evolves around them.\n\nAlthough people embrace two religions — most Serbians are Orthodox Christians and most Albanian Kosovars are Muslim — the Kosovo War was a conflict over ethnicity.\n\nBefore it achieved independence, Kosovo was a Serbian province. Under the reign of strongman Slobodan Milosevic, the minority Serb group lorded power over the majority Albanians.\n\nAs disdain between the two groups intensified, Milosevic fired Albanian-speaking men from state jobs, shut down Albanian media and declared teachers would instruct in Serbian exclusively.\n\nBy the mid-'90s, which tongue you spoke determined whether you were a second-class citizen, said Jehona Gjurgjeala, an educator and activist who was 15 when the conflict ignited.\n\n\"You go into this mode of self-preservation where you know what you can and you can't do,\" she said. \"And you kind of kept yourself safe by actually limiting your movement and limiting your behaviors so that you didn’t provoke bad reactions.”\n\nOn RIT's campus in Kosovo, students who were babies during the war understand the conflict through their elders.\n\n\"(My parents) tried not to let the war get in our ears because we were still very, very small and they didn’t want us to have trauma,\" said Gelonida Bajraktari, 20, a public policy and international relations major. \"But I still remember as young children that they wouldn’t let us play on the streets. … They would always keep us inside, but never telling us why.\"\n\nGjurgjeala and Tahiri, like many in the generation who were teenagers during the conflict, returned to Kosovo to help form the country their friends died to create.\n\nGjurgjeala went to school in London and worked as an executive at Expedia before deciding that in the one life she had to live, she \"wanted to leave something behind.\"\n\nTahiri studied in Italy, went to law school and joined the team drafting Kosovo's declaration of independence, which used the U.S. Constitution as a framework.\n\nEven a decade later, Tahiri's tears come quickly as he talks about being in parliament's hall when the document was signed.\n\n\"That night, I went back home and kissed my father and my mother and said, 'Congratulations,'\" Tahiri remembered. \"They raised a family of nine children in a system where they didn’t know which one of us will survive because we didn't have freedom. Yet it didn’t stop them.\"\n\nSigns of Iowa influence abound\n\nOn Feb. 5, 2005, Lt. Col. Wunn flew into Pristina en route to join other Iowans already in Kosovo on a peacekeeping mission. From thousands of feet up, what few roofs that survived the war barely peaked out over a blanket of white snow.\n\n\"You could see places that had been bombed,\" he said. \"You could see places where people had been displaced. There was still a need to clean up and to repair and re-establish.\"\n\nMore than a decade later, the trappings of normal European life abound in Pristina. Coffee shops bustle with students and suited business people, and rebuilt town squares feature ornate public art.\n\nBut unlike Paris or Bucharest, a Disney-esque love for America is woven into the city’s fabric — a nod to the help the U.S. provided in fighting the Serbs.\n\nBill Klinton (sic) Boulevard, the main drag through town, is in a perpetual traffic jam. Hillary, a store at the corner of Klinton Boulevard and Robert Doll (sic) Street, sells reproductions of the former first lady’s most famous ensembles.\n\nElsewhere, roads named for George W. Bush and Woodrow Wilson (who championed self-determination for nations) wind around construction on glitzy new apartments and office buildings.\n\nThe thumbprint of Iowa is evident, too. The state flag hangs alongside those of Kosovo and Albania outside the country’s Ministry of Defense. The prime minister lives on Iova (sic) Street. And an Iowa State University banner hangs in a coveted spot behind the hottest bar in Pristina’s poshest neighborhood.\n\nAll this Hawkeye State fanfare was far from Maj. Gen. Tim Orr’s mind when he pushed for the Iowa National Guard to join with the Kosovo Security Force as part of the federal State Partnership Program.\n\nFounded in 1993, the program connects Guard units with less-developed countries to share best practices.\n\nWhen the Kosovo partnership came up in 2011, Iowa was one of the only states that didn’t have a formal agreement through the program. Competing against 17 other units, Iowa won out because of the Guard’s previous deployment to the area and Iowa’s connection to agriculture, which leaders thought could benefit the country’s rural regions.\n\n\"It was clear to us, too, that there would be opportunities to engage with Kosovo outside of those military activities,\" Wunn said.\n\nThe Guard reached out to Iowa Sister States to begin the process of creating a civilian connection, but, at the time, the organization couldn’t take on more agreements.\n\nFounded by former Gov. Bob Ray, Iowa Sister States takes its partnerships \"quite seriously.\"\n\n\"Unlike perhaps other states that sign them and kind of file them away, we actively engage with our sister states,” said Kim Heidemann, the group’s executive director. “So … we felt we really had to take a good look at the benefits of the relationship.”\n\nEach visit brings 'something concrete'\n\nMeanwhile, Kosovo’s then-president Atifete Jahjaga was on a mission to rebrand her country.\n\nJahjaga saw expanding the established military partnership into other governmental arenas as crucial to that campaign. So she directed her top ministers to visit Iowa and engage with the state's leadership.\n\nTwo years later, in 2013, then-Gov. Terry Branstad made the agreement official when he went to Kosovo to sign an accord connecting the countries.\n\n“I'm very proud (of this relationship) because from every single visit, something concrete comes out that opens the door to the partnership and the work between both of our states,” Jahjaga said.\n\nFor Kosovo, the partnership \"distills down the U.S. into a manageable organization,\" Wunn said.\n\n\"Rather than New York or Washington, D.C., where they're just a small fish in a big ocean, they can come to Iowa,\" he said. Here they “have more of that personal connection and access to policymakers, access to business leaders, access to the experts.”\n\nWhile economic relationships bloomed from the partnership — including a Kosovo vineyard that now sells wine in Iowa — knowledge is what Kosovars desperately want as they prepare to join the greater community of nations.\n\nResponding to that call, Iowa Sister States worked to bring professionals and specialists to the table.\n\nTo help with foreign policy, University of Iowa law students worked with diplomats in the Kosovo Ministry of Foreign Affairs. To stitch together an updated educational system, community college students are planning workshops with Kosovar teachers.\n\nAnd to get youth interested in agriculture, which is widely seen in Kosovo as un-hip, Future Farmers of America exchanged delegations with the country.\n\nIn addition to allowing for citizen-to-citizen diplomacy — a key part of all of Iowa Sister States’ relationships — these partnerships offset costs.\n\nIowa Sister States is allotted $19,000 of state money a year to maintain and grow the Kosovo partnership. The Iowa National Guard doesn’t use any state money, but spends an estimated $300,000 of federal funding annually to conduct about 15 exchanges per year.\n\n\"When you look at how much a bomber cost or how much a day of deployment in Afghanistan cost, that’s nothing,\" Baskin said, \"$300,000? I mean, that's paper clips.\"\n\nSeeing the unimaginable in Iowa\n\nOn Dec. 22, just beyond where we sipped macchiatos, Tahiri was sworn in as Vushtrri’s mayor.\n\nIn the shadow of the centuries-old castle, Tahiri faced a new beginning. Now, he had the chance to rewrite his hometown’s story of struggle into one of advancement.\n\nSoon he’d find out he had a few partners on that journey — his sister city, Norwalk, and the state of Iowa.\n\nWhen I arrived in Kosovo, I wanted to find out what Iowa was getting out of this relationship.\n\nAchievements and accolades aside, the real answer doesn’t play well in pamphlets or bar charts.\n\nThe real answer is legacy. Here, in this small county with big political and strategic importance, a handful of Iowans are molding what our state’s heritage will be across the world.\n\n“The question you have to ask yourself is, is charitable donation, is helping a neighbor in need, is that worth it?” Lt. Col. James Grimaldi responded when challenged what Iowa really gets from all this.\n\n“You do it because it’s right,” he continued. “The people of Kosovo are eager. They love Americans and they want to move forward and they could use our help.”\n\nThe international community will inevitably fade away as Kosovo continues to develop, but Iowa has made a long-term commitment. And that unique dedication will cause real change, Gjurgjeala, the educator and activist, said.\n\nIowa, she said, \"has managed to build something that is literally a massive community … every point of entry multiplies straight away because there's so many stakeholders on both sides.\"\n\nFor Heidemann and the other Iowans at the August flag-raising ceremony outside Norwalk’s City Hall, another successful sister city relationship offers a wonderful return on investment and a good example for local-level connections.\n\nBut watching the Kosovo flag sway in the same breeze as the Stars and Stripes was so emotional for Tahiri, he wasn’t sure he’d make it through his speech.\n\nFor the boy who escaped war with only what he could carry and helped his family rebuild their lives from a scorched patch of grass, this was another freedom that seemed like a fantasy.\n\nAnd for the man who watched his country declare independence and who became his hometown’s mayor, it was the moment he realized his future just might be filled with days he once deemed unimaginable.\n\nAbout the series:\n\nAfter a bloody campaign of ethnic cleansing and an unsteady path to independence for Kosovo, Iowa has been quietly helping the nation's nascent democracy for more than 20 years. Now, with a foothold in one of the most politically important regions of the world, Iowa is seeing its citizen-led diplomacy pay off.\n\nIowa Columnist Courtney Crowder and photographer Rodney White hopped a military transport flight with the Iowa National Guard to learn more about this deep relationship. In this three-part series, the pair will explore how Iowa's influence is woven into Kosovo's fabric.\n\nAbout the authors:\n\nCOURTNEY CROWDER, the Register's Iowa Columnist, has visited four of the seven continents and is hoping to convince her fiance to honeymoon in a fifth next year.

However, it comes just days after a major humiliation for the Russian President, when an explosion severely damaged parts of the road and rail bridge between annexed Crimea and the Russian Federation early Saturday.\n\nAnd while the agenda has not been made public, the meeting comes at a strategic crossroads for the Kremlin, which must make a series of unenviable choices after Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine has faltered after a month of military setbacks.\n\nSome road traffic and train traffic has resumed on the estimated $3.7 billion bridge. On Saturday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnullin said repair works on the bridge would be carried out around the clock, with a damage survey to be completed within a day and divers scheduled to check all the supports of the bridge.\n\nThe first passenger services resumed travel across the bridge on Saturday, traveling from the Crimean Peninsula to Krasnodar Krai in southern Russia, Russia’s Ministry of Transport said in a statement.\n\nCar traffic on the bridge has also restarted in two lanes, Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Marat Khusnullin said on Sunday. “Traffic has already been launched along two lanes on the Crimean bridge,” he wrote in a Telegram post, adding that earlier, one lane was being used for cars traveling in alternate directions, slowing down traffic. Heavy trucks, vans and buses have been traveling by ferry since the blast.\n\nKyiv has not claimed responsibility for the blast on the enormous 19-kilometer (about 12-mile) bridge, which was built after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014, an annexation regarded by the West as illegal.” The crossing was opened by Putin himself in 2018, and Ukrainian reaction to the explosion has been gleeful and triumphant.\n\nPutin called the explosions on the Crimean bridge a “terrorist attack” and said the organizers and executors were “Ukrainian special services.”\n\n“Here, as reported, we have no doubts that this is a terrorist attack aimed at the destruction of the critical infrastructure of Russian Federation. And authors, executors, and masterminds are the secret services of Ukraine,” Putin said during a meeting with Chairman of the Russian Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin on Sunday.\n\nA round of Russian missile strikes on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed 13 people early Sunday, including one child, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.\n\nAt least 89 civilians, including 11 children, were injured, Oleksandr Starukh, head of Zaporizhzhia regional military administration, said Sunday.\n\nAccording to Tymoshenko, the rescue and search operations are still ongoing, they continue to get people out from under the rubble.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Sunday dismissed the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons in retaliation for the explosion on the bridge, Russian state media RIA Novosti reported.\n\nPeskov was asked by RIA whether the attack on the bridge could trigger an activation of Russia’s nuclear doctrine because it was “aimed at destroying critical civilian infrastructure of the Russian Federation.”\n\n“No. It’s a completely wrong formulation of the question,” Peskov said.\n\nUkraine’s military has been making dramatic advances in a counteroffensive – the Ukrainian military has recaptured 2,400 square kilometers of territory in Kherson region in the south of the country “since the beginning of the full-scale war,” a senior Ukrainian official said Friday, and Ukrainian troops are preparing for further advances into Russian-held Luhansk in the east, according to Serhiy Hayday, head of the Luhansk region’s Ukrainian military administration.\n\nHayday acknowledged photographs of Ukrainian troops outside the Luhansk village of Stelmakhivka, less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the crucial post of Svatove.\n\nBut with a sudden and successful Ukrainian offensive comes concerns Putin will escalate Russia’s war in Ukraine, with US President Joe Biden expressing fears of the possible use of weapons of mass destruction.\n\n“First time since the Cuban missile crisis, we have a direct threat of the use (of a) nuclear weapon if in fact things continue down the path they are going,” Biden warned during remarks at a Democratic fundraiser in New York on Friday.\n\nHe added: “I don’t think there’s any such thing as the ability to easily (use) a tactical nuclear weapon and not end up with Armageddon.”", "authors": ["Darya Tarasova Amy Woodyatt", "Darya Tarasova", "Amy Woodyatt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}]}

It's a fantasy epic in a time when fantasy epics are the genre du jour of prestige TV. It has been shepherded to the screen by Gaiman himself. It has talented actors – Gwendoline Christie, Stephen Fry, Jenna Coleman – among its large cast.\n\nBut in spite of everything \"Sandman\" has going for it, it is not, in fact, a very good or great show. The series (now streaming; ★½ out of four) is a middling series, made worse by wasted potential and Netflix's dollars.\n\nExcruciatingly slow and dull if not outright boring, \"Sandman\" is a perplexing failure. The stories that make up the comic-book epic are sewn together haphazardly and confusingly, never building to discernible arcs and not even broken down into interesting stand-alone episodes. The series is a pile of stories and moods randomly tossed on top of each other.\n\nWhether that's because the source material is simply too hard to adapt or because this adaptation got it wrong is unclear. What is clear is that fans of the comics are likely to be disappointed, and first-timers are likely to be confused and put off.\n\nMore:Neil Gaiman previews fantasy world of Netflix's 'The Sandman' with new trailer at Comic-Con\n\n\"Sandman\" is about 20 or so different things and characters, but it can be boiled down to this: Dream (Tom Sturridge) is the eponymous Sandman, who controls the dreams of humanity. He's among a family of anthropomorphic concepts, like Desire (Mason Alexander Park) and Death (Kirby Howell-Baptiste, whose episode is the best thing about the series by far). At the start, Dream (sometimes called Morpheus) is captured by a lucky human sorcerer (Charles Dance), imprisoned and silent in the waking world for over a century. His absence from the \"Dreaming\" realm causes chaos there and deaths and illness among the humans.\n\nOnce freed, Dream tries to repair his life by regaining his magical tools, which takes him to hell to visit Lucifer (Christie) and in search of a deranged human (David Thewlis).\n\nIf that sounds both confusing and a little boring, it is. The show fails to build characters worth caring about or any kind of narrative stakes. The problem is not that \"Sandman\" is a cerebral, talky kind of fantasy series. There are plenty of great works of science fiction and fantasy that rely more on character and dialogue than action set pieces. The problem is that all that discourse is empty and meaningless without substantive plot and ideas behind it. By the second half of the season, the acting and scripts turn juvenile and stilted, rendering the episodes almost unwatchable.\n\nMore:From 'The Boys' to 'Ms. Marvel' and 'She-Hulk,' here are the superhero shows to watch this summer\n\nThere's a particular sadness to this adaptation, as characters from this story, based on stories woven into the world of DC Comics, have appeared elsewhere to great critical success. \"Lucifer\" was a delight on Fox and then Netflix, played by Tom Ellis. And \"Constantine,\" brought to life here by Jenna Coleman as the gender-swapped Joanna Constantine, was a short-lived (but well-loved) 2014-15 NBC series starring Matt Ryan. Ryan took the character to other DC shows on CW, including \"Arrow\" and \"DC's Legends of Tomorrow,\" exploring some of his \"Sandman\" story with much more nuance.\n\nI tried really hard to like this \"Sandman\" adaptation, more than I have with other shows that left me so disappointed by the first few episodes. I tried because I love fantasy and I love much of Gaiman's other work, both on the page and on screen. I thought surely I just wasn't getting something about the Netflix series. So I kept watching and waiting. But if anything, the deeper into the 10-episode season I got, the worse the show became.\n\nSo no, I'm not angry.

Some said that the film “doesn’t quite work as a movie or a game,” that the interactive format “may have a future, but it probably shouldn’t involve ‘Black Mirror.’” The general consensus was that the interactivity felt more like a gimmick than a feature; nevertheless, “Bandersnatch” is currently averaging a 7.3/10-stars on IMDB.com, with more than 85,000 reviews.\n\nSome critics, on the other hand, felt that “Bandersnatch” works. David Griffin of IGN gave the film a rating of 8/10; according to Griffin, the decision points were “smooth and unobtrusive,” adding that they provided the plot with tension.\n\nAnd now — well, next week — there’s another one. Last week, Netflix released a trailer for its upcoming interactive series, “You vs. Wild,” which is set to debut on the streaming platform on April 10. The show features outdoorsman Bear Grylls, of “Man vs. Wild” fame. (For those unfamiliar with that series, which ran for seven seasons on the Discovery Channel, Grylls and his film crew are left stranded in remote regions. He and his crew must find a way back to civilization.)\n\nIn “You vs. Wild,” however, the tables have turned. Grylls relies on your wits and intuition—the viewer’s survival skills—to find his way back to civilization. This is achieved by providing the viewer a variety of several well-timed options: “Jump Down!” or “Climb Up!” and “Eat it!” or “Leave it!”\n\n“I’ve spent my life showing you how to survive in some of the world’s toughest terrains,” Grylls says in the recently-released trailer. “Together, you and I are going to find our way back to civilization.”\n\nFrom the trailer, it appears that the choices are limited by a timer — which I suspect would create a certain sense of immediacy, urgency and excitement to the experience. Furthermore, the “live-action” feel seems to work a little better with the interactive format than “Bandersnatch’s” cinematic aesthetic.\n\nIt appears that all eight episodes of the show’s first season will be released simultaneously on April 10.\n\nWhether “Black Mirror: Bandersnatch” worked — or whether “You vs. Wild” works — it appears that Netflix is committed to continuing to experiment with this format. And I believe that, as the technology evolves, there is little doubt that the platform will eventually get it right and develop a hit.\n\nIn doing so, Netflix is continuing to exploit one of the many advantages the platform offers over broadcast television.\n\nDamien Willis is an unpaid columnist for Pulse, writing primarily about entertainment and pop culture.

Yet, Netflix is still a media company that — thanks to its 221.6 million global subscribers — has the ability to capture the cultural zeitgeist.\n\nJust ask Kate Bush.\n\nThe English singer’s 1985 hit single, “Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God),” has taken over the music charts — 37 years after its release. It’s currently No. 1 on Spotify’s Top Songs in the US, No. 5 on Billboard’s hot 100 and broke UK records after hitting No. 1 last weekend.\n\nAll because the song is being showcased in the latest season of “Stranger Things” — the streaming platform’s most popular franchise. Global streams of the song surged more than 8,700% on Spotify (SPOT) following the show’s May 27 season four premiere.\n\nThe fact that “Running Up That Hill” has become a sudden hit nearly four decades after its release represents more than just an old song catching fire on the charts. It’s a potent example of Netflix’s massive cultural power, even as the company is trying to turn itself around.\n\nRunning up the charts\n\nMax’s Song (Full Scene) | Kate Bush - Running Up That Hill | Stranger Things | Netflix\n\nOther songs have seen boosts to sales and streams thanks to being featured in prominent films and TV shows (it has happened for Queen a few times). But few tunes have been part a major plot point the way “Running Up That Hill” is in “Stranger Things 4.”\n\nThe latest season of the science fiction horror series, which takes place in 1986, not only makes the song a favorite of the character Max Mayfield, played by Sadie Sink, the tune is played during a pivotal scene and helps save her from an evil multidimensional force.\n\nA moment like that is a music supervisor’s dream because the scene becomes inextricable from the song, building a connection between content and consumer that’s “very rare,” said Serona Elton, director of the music industry program at the University of Miami’s Frost School of Music.\n\n“Having music just playing in the background is not going to have the same type of impact compared to having the music becoming a fundamental part of the scene,” Elton told CNN Business.\n\nBut none of this could have happened without Netflix’s ability to push the series to its millions of subscribers around the world. Other streaming platforms have millions of users too, but Netflix is still at the top of the hill. It also helps that “Strangers Things” is wildly popular.\n\n“Stranger Things 4 — Volume 1” debuted in May to record numbers, and has since amassed a total of 883 million hours viewed for the platform. That makes it Netflix’s most popular English-language TV show ever. It’s been No. 1 on Netflix’s English top 10 list all four weeks since it premiered.\n\nThe new season also has dominated social media since its debut, with more than 7.7 billion organic impressions across Facebook (FB), Instagram, YouTube, Twitter (TWTR) and TikTok, according to the streamer. That’s helped turn “Running Up That Hill” into a viral meme.\n\nBush recently thanked the Duffer Brothers, the show’s creators, for “Running Up That Hill’s” renewed popularity.\n\n“I’m overwhelmed by the scale of affection and support the song is receiving,” she wrote on her website. “It’s all happening really fast, as if it’s being driven along by a kind of elemental force.”\n\nUpside down, but not out\n\nKate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill,\" a song from 1985, has become a massive hit thanks to \"Stranger Things.\" Tina Rowden/Netflix\n\nNetflix’s world has been turned upside down this year after the company reported in April that it lost subscribers for the first time in more than a decade, news that shocked Wall Street and wiped out billions in Netflix market cap. The company’s stock, which was trading at $337 per share before that news, now stands at $178.\n\nIndustry experts have been wondering what steps Netflix might take to recover, spitballing ideas that include running ads, curbing password sharing and making nice with movie theaters.\n\nThe widespread influence of “Stranger Things” shows that Netflix (NFLX) may be down, but it’s not out.\n\nNetflix distribution is still remarkable in the streaming world, even as rivals are catching up, which allows the service to own pop culture with content such as “Bird Box,” “Squid Game” and “Stranger Things.” And as Netflix attempts to regain its footing after several disastrous quarters, it’s important to remember what it’s capable of.\n\nElton said that this type of exposure can help multiple constituencies.\n\nBush will likely see “increased revenues and maybe a new demographic of fans who might seek out other music of hers,” she said.

His desire for his hosts to pump more oil to ease gas prices and inflation in the US is colliding with his previous condemnation of the ruthless rule of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nIf the President leaves without securing a significant injection of crude into the global market, he risks more political damage at home, where Americans are taking out their frustrations with high gas prices on him. But if he succeeds, he will further anger human rights advocates who accuse him of ditching US principles for short-term political gain. In either case, Biden must find a way to justify his opening to the Crown Prince, Saudi Arabia’s erratic and repressive de facto leader who was blamed by US intelligence for ordering the murder and dismembering of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, a US resident and Saudi dissident.\n\nBiden has, after all, put democracy promotion at the center of his foreign policy agenda while bin Salman has presided over the execution of political prisoners, launched a vicious war in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, and was accused of detaining Lebanon’s prime minister in another regional power play.\n\n“The reason that I’m going to Saudi Arabia … is to promote US interest … in a way that I think we have an opportunity to reassert what I think we’ve made a mistake of walking away from: our influence in the Middle East,” Biden said Thursday.\n\nThe President is ostensibly going to Saudi Arabia to take part in a regional conference also with leaders from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Iraq and Jordan. He is seeking to cement recent progress in a rapprochement between some of these nations and Israel where he spent the last few days. He’s also keen to build support for his drive to use diplomacy to revive a 2015 nuclear deal before Tehran enriches sufficient uranium for a nuclear bomb – a diplomatic process about which both the Israelis and the Saudis are skeptical.\n\nAnd Biden has a strong interest in reasserting America’s leadership as its great power rivals Russia and China seek new inroads in the region. So the President’s claim, that it is now in US interests to reengage with Saudi Arabia after the 2018 Khashoggi killing severely strained relations, does have merit – even though he’s taking heat from progressives in his party for doing so.\n\nBalancing act\n\nWith his visit, the President, who vowed to make the Saudis a “pariah” on the campaign trail in 2020, is experiencing a rite common to commanders-in-chief who have to sometimes dilute their own political interests for a wider strategic goal.\n\n“How do we balance our interests in the free flow of oil at reasonable prices with our values,” asked former US ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk on “Amanpour” on CNN International this week, encapsulating Biden’s dilemma.\n\n“Somehow, the President has to walk the line. We need the Saudis to increase oil production to bring the price down because that is having a terrible impact on inflation. On the other hand, we need to take a clear stand against the way (Mohammed bin Salman) treats some of his people some of the time.”\n\nThe distasteful aspect of this trip is that there is no way for Biden to accomplish his goals without elevating bin Salman, who is the dominant figure in the Saudi royal family and will use the visit of an American President to rehabilitate himself globally and to send a message to other strongman-ruled states that there is no longterm price for acting in a way that offends American values. He may, therefore, not feel especially beholden to offer wide-ranging concessions.\n\nThe White House confirmed for the first time late Thursday that Biden will meet with the Crown Prince without King Salman, who will depart after about 30 minutes of the bilateral meetings, which was expected because of his health. The administration’s shifting positions on whether and how Biden would interact with the Crown Prince in recent weeks have appeared to whip up even more controversy about the visit. In retrospect, an earlier announcement and a strong statement about what the President would do and say might have eased some of the political pressure.\n\nStill, Biden argued in a recent Washington Post op-ed that the broader aspiration of using his trip to promote regional stability was important since it could prevent the conflicts that led to US troops having to fight and die in the Middle East for decades. Biden – whose worldview was shaped by his own experiences and that of his late son Beau, who served in Iraq – has put avoiding new foreign wars at the center of his presidency. This is also one reason why he is committed to trying to revive the Iran nuclear deal, which could head off a fateful decision on whether he might use military force to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon.\n\nWhy does the US have an alliance with the Saudis?\n\nThe question of balancing US principles and national interests was bound to resurface for Biden sooner or later in relation to the Saudis because it has been a constant theme of US relations with the kingdom for over half a century. Saudi Arabia, for instance, has long been a key strategic US ally, but its tolerance for radical Wahabi Islam provided a fountain of extremism in which terrorism grew and eventually led to events like the September 11 attacks in 2001.\n\nThat is why some foreign policy observers have questioned whether there needs to be a complete rethink of the marriage of convenience between Washington and Riyadh and the idea that the two powers really do have common interests. This was not a concern during the transactional presidency of Donald Trump, who blatantly explained that he was not severing relations over the Khashoggi killing, because the Saudis bought lots of American-made weapons. But that interregnum from long-term US foreign policy certainties aside, Presidents have long wrestled with the proper balance of US-Saudi relations. But they have always been drawn back to the kingdom because of the vital importance of the free flow of oil for the US economy, living standards and their own political survival.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on CNN’s “The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer” on Thursday that the question of whether Biden would shake the hand of bin Salman was irrelevant. Instead, the Saudis need to show a commitment to changing their behavior on human rights and demonstrate their loyalty to Washington, he said.\n\n“The question for me, (is) why did it take an emergency visit from the United States President to convince the Saudis to choose their ally, the United States?” Murphy asked.\n\n“I thought the whole point of the United States’ decision, over multiple administrations, to look the other way when the Saudis chopped up political opponents, when they bombed civilians inside Yemen, when they executed political prisoners, was that when the chips were down, we would not have to make an emergency visit for the Saudis to choose the United States.”\n\nWhy is Biden meeting the oppressor and not the oppressed?\n\nThe trip comes at a moment of political peril for Biden, with his approval ratings tumbling while inflation soars and after a period of record gasoline prices, which have moderated slightly in recent days. From a purely political perspective, the sight of a President engaging with oil-producing nations to ease prices back in the United States may be welcome to some voters. But if his visit doesn’t result in significant production increases from Gulf states, or if the move fails to ease gas prices that helped power inflation to a more than 40-year-high of 9.1% last month, the President will face claims he misused the prestige of the presidency and trashed his principles on human rights for no gain.\n\nAnd one concern for the administration is that there is no guarantee that more oil on the market will lower gas prices – sent racing higher by the war in Ukraine – permanently. This is because one of the issues in the industry has been a scarcity of refining capacity coming out of the pandemic – a situation a sudden flood of crude could actually exacerbate.\n\nA trip to the region that doesn’t produce clear wins for the President could add to perceptions of a presidency that is losing direction – even if Biden’s foreign policy, especially his revival of the Cold War coalition of Western nations to confront Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, has been largely successful.\n\nThe brutal murder of Khashoggi has become a metaphor for wider US concerns about human rights in Saudi Arabia, which include the fate of political prisoners, summary executions, the treatment of women and the disregard for civilian life in Yemen.\n\nThe President appeared tetchy at a news conference in Israel on Thursday when he was pressed over whether he would raise the case of the Washington Post journalist when he was with bin Salman.\n\n“I always bring up human rights. I always bring up human rights, but my position on Khashoggi has been so clear. If anyone doesn’t understand it in Saudi Arabia or anywhere else, then they haven’t been around for a while,” Biden said.\n\nLina al-Hathloul, a Saudi democracy activist, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday that it would be a “betrayal” if Biden didn’t bring up US concerns about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record. Human rights organizations have called on Biden to meet political dissidents while he is in Saudi Arabia, a step some past presidents took when doing business with totalitarian regimes.

The same study found that Black women’s hair was over three times more likely to be perceived as unprofessional.\n\n“Natural Black hair is often deemed ‘unprofessional’ simply because it does not conform to White beauty standards,” New Jersey Democrat Bonnie Watson Coleman, the bill’s sponsor in the House, said in a statement. “Discrimination against Black hair is discrimination against Black people.”\n\nSupporters of the CROWN Act say it would prevent against a larger trend across the US, with more and more Black students saying they were being penalized for their hairstyles.\n\nThe problem lies in the policies, experts say, which don’t necessarily take into account an increasingly diverse student body, to the detriment of mostly Black and biracial schoolchildren.\n\nAs CNN previously reported, there have been a number of high-profile cases in recent years of Black students receiving punishment for their hairstyles.\n\nIn Williams’ case, the new high school he moved to in February in East Bernard, Texas, had a dress code policy in its handbook that states “boy’s hair may not extend below the eyebrows, below the tops of the ears or below a conventional standup shirt collar, and must not be more than one-inch difference in the length of the hair on the side to the length of the hair on top.”\n\nThe handbook, which has been removed from the district’s website, goes on to say: “This includes but [is] not limited to tall hair styles, side swept bang styles, and long hair dangling over shaved sides or shaved back of the head. This also includes mullets and mullets in the making. Braided hair or corn rows will not be allowed. No extremes in hair styles.”\n\nCNN made several attempts to reach the East Bernard High School and the school district, but has not heard back.\n\nIn 2020, Louisiana high school senior Asia Simo was kicked off her school’s cheer team after she accumulated demerits for having her hair out of uniform, which led to her eventual dismissal.\n\nThat same year in Texas, high school senior DeAndre Arnold was told he couldn’t walk at graduation unless he cut his dreadlocks and complied with the school district’s dress code that states male student’s hair must be shorter than the top of a T-shirt collar.\n\nIn 2019, an elementary school in Georgia came under fire after a hairstylist shared photos that the school used to show “appropriate” and “inappropriate” hairstyles for students.\n\nAnd in 2018, Andrew Johnson, a Black high school wrestler in New Jersey, was told by a referee to cut off his dreadlocks because it wasn’t in compliance with league regulations or forfeit a match.\n\nMost school administrators and school boards cite policies and regulations as reason for their actions and maintain their rules aren’t meant to be discriminatory.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, a co-sponsor of the bill, said in a floor speech in March: “For too long, Black girls have been discriminated against and criminalized for the hair that grows on our heads and the way we move through and show up in this world.”\n\nShe added, “Whether you are a student in a classroom, an employee in the workplace, or the next Supreme Court Justice or the speaker pro [tempore], you deserve to show up as your full self, rocking your crown with your head held high.”\n\nWhere the legislation stands\n\nSo far, 15 states and more than 40 municipalities have enacted their versions of the CROWN Act. California, in 2019, was the first state to pass the legislation, according to the CROWN Coalition. The US Virgin Islands this month became the first US territory to enact the bill.\n\nLast month, the Democratic-led US House passed the federal version of the CROWN Act in a 235-189 vote, with 14 Republicans joining with Democrats to approve the bill. The fate of the bill in the 50-50 Senate remains unclear.\n\nRepublican opponents of the legislation have said that federal law already covers this kind of discrimination and that Democrats should be focusing on other issues, such as inflation and high gas prices.\n\nThe Biden administration has said it “strongly supports” the CROWN Act and “looks forward to working with the Congress to enact this legislation and ensure that it is effectively implemented.”\n\n“State legislation, having that concurrent with the federal legislation, actually provides more coverage, it makes sure even small businesses are covered, not just the larger businesses,” Eggleston Bracey told CNN, adding that state action “creates even more momentum for the federal legislation.”", "authors": ["Veronica Stracqualursi Rachel Janfaza", "Veronica Stracqualursi", "Rachel Janfaza"], "publish_date": "2022/04/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/14/politics/joe-biden-saudi-arabia-mbs/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Saudi Crown Prince outlasts US' moral outrage, with a little ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has outlasted the United States, nearly four years after the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nAn announcement Tuesday that President Joe Biden will visit Saudi Arabia next month is not a surprise – the White House has been preparing the ground for days. And the President’s decision to visit, as well as lawmakers’ reactions to the trip, fit a prevailing pattern of the US-Saudi relationship: Washington recoils over distaste for Saudi behavior that conflicts with its values, then gets pulled back into its marriage of convenience owing to the kingdom’s oil wealth and critical strategic position.\n\nAlthough Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday defended Biden’s upcoming meetings with the Saudis, Senate Majority Whip Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin – Schumer’s No. 2 – and other leading Democrats are showing their concern.\n\nDurbin told CNN he has “concerns” with Biden’s trip and called on the President to change his plans, but that he understands why Biden decided to take part in the visit.\n\n“I have concerns about it. I think the Saudis have demonstrated that they don’t share our values. The episode with Khashoggi is an international incident of historic proportions. I can’t get around it,” Durbin said, later adding, “It’s a tough call. Sustaining the energy services for our allies and NATO, doing something to increase the oil supply in the world, perhaps bring down gasoline prices. All these things are timely and important. But I’m sorry he has to do it with Saudis.”\n\nVirginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, a member of Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN that the trip is a “really bad idea.”\n\n“His blood stain has not been cleansed,” Kaine said. “And I get it that circumstances change. But what’s the fundamental issue in the world right now? It’s the authoritarians. … I don’t think you go say, ‘Well, circumstances change. We sit down with a murderer who killed a journalist who lives in Virginia.’ I think it’s a big mistake. I’d meet with other — I’d meet with (the) foreign minister. I’d meet with the Saudi ambassador. I’d meet with the King, but I wouldn’t meet with MBS.”\n\nConnecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, another member of Senate Foreign Relations, said he has some “real worries,” adding, “I think I need to hear more from the administration to understand what kind of commitments they’ve gotten from the kingdom to change their ways.”\n\nDurbin’s Republican counterpart, Senate Republican Whip John Thune of South Dakota, also had problems with the trip, saying, “I just wish he would focus on American energy and he wouldn’t have to deal with the Crown Prince.”\n\n“He’s expressed concerns about going there in the past for all the obvious reasons. And it just seems … having to go hat in hand to the Saudis to increase energy production because we won’t do it here – I think it’s unfortunate an American president is put in that position,” Thune added.\n\nThere’s little doubt that Biden is making his trip in order to persuade the Saudis to pump more crude oil to help alleviate the political impact of record-high US gasoline prices. His visit also comes as a new crisis looms with arch Saudi foe Iran, which may soon cross the threshold to building a nuclear bomb.\n\nTo quell the controversy, the White House is styling the visit of Biden to a nation he called “a pariah” over Khashoggi’s brutal killing, for which US intelligence determined the Crown Prince was responsible, as part of a regional peace initiative. The President will take part in a summit with the Gulf Cooperation Council plus Egypt, Jordan and Iraq in Jeddah after visiting Israel to show support for the Jewish state’s warming relations with anti-Iran Arab neighbors.\n\nThere will be bilateral meetings with King Salman and his team, which the White House expects to include the Crown Prince. And White House officials have broadly said that Biden plans to bring up human rights issues with bin Salman and the Saudis during their discussions, but they’ve also repeatedly underscored that the President is looking to reorient its relationship with the Middle Eastern nation.\n\n“We are not overlooking any conduct that happened before the President took office,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday in regard to Khashoggi’s death, noting that Biden “issued an extensive report” from the intelligence community on the journalist’s killing.\n\n“So, it’s important to also emphasize that while we [recalibrate] relationships, we are not looking to rupture relationships – but human rights issues, human rights conversation, is something that the President brings up with many leaders and plans to do so,” she continued.\n\nJean-Pierre also praised Saudi Arabia for having been “a strategic partner of the United States for nearly 80 years,” adding that “there’s no question that important interests are interwoven with Saudi Arabia, notably the recent extension of truce in Yemen, which has saved countless of lives.”\n\n9/11 Families United, an organization consisting of the families of individuals killed during the September, 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, sent a letter to the President earlier this month urging him to ensure accountability for the 9/11 attacks is a key priority of his discussions with Saudi officials.\n\nNational Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told CNN’s “New Day” on Tuesday that Biden is expected to discuss a “range of human rights issues” with the crown prince during the trip, but he did not say whether concerns from the 9/11 families would be brought up during the upcoming talks.\n\nAnd while the Saudis say they’ll be holding official talks with the US, Kirby refused to definitively characterize the meetings taking place between Biden and the Saudi Arabian government, adding that the President will hold “lots of bilateral discussions” with the nine heads of state present at the meeting, adding, “And yes, that will certainly include King Salman and his leadership team and we would expect that the Crown Prince will be part of those discussions.”\n\nStill, there’s no sugarcoating it.\n\nSometimes presidents must do things they find distasteful or that appear hypocritical to advance what they perceive to be the national interest – that is what Biden is doing here. But his visit sends a message to states like Saudi Arabia, that as the US embarks on what looks like a new Cold War with China and Russia, repressive conduct is no barrier to relations with a President who put saving global democracy at the center of his foreign policy.\n\nBiden, for instance, praised bin Salman’s “courage” in extending a truce in Yemen. But it was MBS who started the vicious war that killed thousands of civilians. So, Jean-Pierre’s remark Tuesday that the Saudi move had saved “countless” lives in the country was rather tone deaf.\n\nOnce a pariah.

The ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia is one of the most important on the planet. And lately, it’s also been one of the most awkward.\n\nAngry officials in Washington vowed “consequences” after Saudi-led OPEC sharply cut oil production earlier this month, driving up pump prices just weeks before the midterm elections.\n\nUS lawmakers are threatening steps that were unthinkable not long ago, including banning weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and unleashing the Justice Department to file a lawsuit against the country and other OPEC members for collusion.\n\nRiyadh has been caught off guard by the thirst for revenge from US politicians. And Saudi officials are hinting at payback – including dumping US debt – that could have huge ripple effects in financial markets and the real economy.\n\nNeither side is even trying to hide the tension. After a top Saudi official suggested the kingdom has decided to be the more mature party, a top White House official responded by saying, “It’s not like some high school romance here.”\n\nWhat happens next is critical.\n\nIf this decades-old relationship devolves into a full-blown break-up, there could be enormous consequences for the world economy, not to mention international security.\n\n“This is a new low. We have seen a degradation in the US-Saudi relationship for years but this is the worst it’s been,” said Clayton Allen, director at the Eurasia Group.\n\nSo much for that secret deal\n\nThe spat is linked to one of the biggest sore spots among voters during the Biden era: Inflation and high gas prices.\n\nAfter trying and failing to persuade OPEC to ramp up oil production, President Joe Biden reversed his 2020 campaign promise to make Saudi Arabia a “pariah” over its human rights record. Biden visited Saudi Arabia over the summer and even fist-bumped Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nUS officials thought they reached a secret deal with Saudi Arabia to finally boost supply of oil through the end of the year, The New York Times reported this week.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nOPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, responded by increasing oil production by a measly 100,000 barrels per day – the smallest increase in its history. The move was widely viewed as a “slap in the face” of the Biden administration.\n\nWhat came next was worse.\n\nIn early October, OPEC+ announced plans to slash oil production by 2 million barrels per day – a move that briefly drove up oil and gasoline prices at a time of high inflation and infuriated US politicians.\n\n“Neither side seems to understand each other,” Allen said. “Riyadh underestimated the severity of the US backlash. And the US assumed we had an unspoken agreement.”\n\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, described the move as “unprecedented” and “unfortunate” in an interview with CNN International on Thursday.\n\n“When the global economy was on the brink of a global recession, they decided to push the prices up,” Birol said.\n\nSaudi official accuses US of manipulating markets\n\nThe tensions haven’t eased, and officials from both sides have sharpened their criticism of each other in recent days. In one telling episode, a top Saudi minister went from defending Biden’s energy strategy to slamming it.\n\nDuring the OPEC+ press conference in early October, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman seemed to praise Biden’s decision to release unprecedented amount of emergency oil reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n“I wouldn’t call it a distortion. Actually, it was done in the right time,” Prince Abdulaziz told reporters. “If it didn’t happen, I’m sure that things might be different than what it is today.”\n\nFlash forward three weeks, and that same Saudi minister sang a very different tune.\n\n“People are depleting their emergency stocks, had depleted it, used it as a mechanism to manipulate markets while its profound purpose was to mitigate a shortage of supply,” Prince Abdulaziz said during a conference in Saudi Arabia this week. “However, it is my profound duty to make it clear to the world that losing emergency stock may become painful in the months to come.”\n\nThe criticism is noteworthy, especially given that OPEC openly manipulates markets in many ways by withholding supply to support prices.\n\nOPEC is unpopular\n\nThe risk is that the tension devolves into a tit-for-tat cycle of retaliation that undermines global economic stability, or whatever economic stability there is at the moment.\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle have stepped up their calls to enact NOPEC (No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels) legislation that would empower the Justice Department to go after OPEC nations on antitrust grounds. Although NOPEC isn’t new, it seems more possible now than at any point in recent memory. Eurasia Group pegs a 30% chance of NOPEC enactment and a 45% chance of a watered-down version of the bill.\n\n“You can’t overstate how upset a huge number of lawmakers are,” said Allen.\n\nLawmakers aren’t only upset, they realize OPEC is not exactly endearing itself to voters.\n\n“This is popular. American sentiment is anti-Saudi. This now has domestic political utility for American politicians. That’s where we are now,” said Karen Young, senior research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “NOPEC would be harder to veto than in the past.”\n\nCould Saudi Arabia dump US debt?\n\nSaudi Arabia could respond to penalties from Washington with drastic steps of their own, ratcheting up the conflict further.\n\nSaudi officials have privately warned that the kingdom could sell US Treasury bonds if Congress passes NOPEC, The Wall Street Journal reported this week, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nAt a minimum, dumping US debt would create uncertainty in markets at an already-perilous moment. A fire sale would drive up Treasury rates, destabilizing markets and raising borrowing costs for families and businesses.\n\nAnd of course, Saudi Arabia’s own holdings would be damaged in such a fire sale.\n\nSaudi Arabia is sitting on roughly $119 billion of US debt, according to Treasury Department data, making it the world’s 16th largest holder of Treasuries.\n\nAnother risk is that Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC+, could remove further supply from world oil markets – or at least refuse to respond to future price spikes as the West continues to crack down on Russia.\n\nFurther curbs on OPEC supply would lift gasoline prices and worsen inflation, raising already-high recession risks.\n\nAll of this explains why a full-blown breakdown in relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia may be the last thing the fragile economy needs right now.", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/16/politics/biden-middle-east-trip-takeaways/index.html", "title": "5 takeaways from Joe Biden's first presidential trip to the Middle East ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Saturday capped a four-day trip to Israel and Saudi Arabia, his first trip to the Middle East since taking office.\n\nThe President started his trip by meeting with Israeli leaders to expand security ties with the nation and discuss countering efforts by Iran to destabilize the region. He next went to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he attempted to reassure regional leaders – and the rest of the world – that his administration remains committed to actively engaging in the Middle East and not allowing Russia or China to expand their geopolitical influence.\n\nOn Friday, he sought a reset of relations with the Saudis as he looked for ways to lower high gas prices in the US, which have contributed to a significant drop in Biden’s approval ratings.\n\nThat reset began with a widely criticized fist bump with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MBS, whom the US has accused of sanctioning journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. Biden said he raised Khashoggi’s murder directly with the Crown Prince and indicated he believes MBS was responsible for it, as he emphasized the US commitment to human rights.\n\nHere are five takeaways from the trip:\n\nBiden’s fist bump with MBS signals a reset in US-Saudi relationship and draws fierce criticism\n\nAhead of his departure to the Middle East, administration officials had told CNN they were aiming for a full reset of the US-Saudi relationship after years of strain following Khashoggi’s murder.\n\nA fist bump in front of the cameras between Biden and the Crown Prince neatly symbolized that moment.\n\nThe meetings in Jeddah largely seemed to go along with the planned reset of the US relationship with the kingdom, and Biden announced several new areas of cooperation aimed at reshaping US-Saudi relations. But the images of Biden’s seemingly chummy interactions with the Crown Prince drew the most attention.\n\nThe President was fiercely criticized – including by fellow Democrats – for fist-bumping MBS during their first in-person interaction in Jeddah. Critics argued the fist bump helped rehabilitate the 36-year-old leader’s reputation on the world stage just over a year after the US declassified an intelligence report concluding that he personally ordered the brutal killing of Khashoggi, a charge the Crown Prince denied in their meeting, Biden said.\n\nThe images of the fist bump were quickly promoted by the Saudi government, including on Saudi state TV. Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan said Biden’s fist bump was “shameful” because it “projected a level of intimacy and comfort that delivers to MBS the unwarranted redemption he has been desperately seeking.”\n\nThere was much speculation ahead of the trip whether Biden would shake the Crown Prince’s hand, particularly when the White House said the President would be looking to reduce contact with others amid the spread of a transmissible subvariant of the omicron variant of Covid-19.\n\nBiden brings up Khashoggi’s killing with MBS and emphasizes American support for human rights\n\nHours after being criticized for that fist bump, the President went in front of the traveling press to say he had raised Khashoggi’s murder directly with Crown Prince Mohammed.\n\nBiden said he was “straightforward and direct” with MBS, adding that he indicated to the Crown Prince that he believed he was responsible for Khashoggi’s murder. A day earlier, while in Israel, Biden had stopped short of confirming that he planned to raise Khashoggi’s death with the Crown Prince, instead insisting that he “always” brought up human rights and that his views on the murder had been made “absolutely” clear.\n\nThe President reiterated that point on Friday.\n\n“For an American president to be silent on the issue of human rights is inconsistent with who we are and who I am. I’ll always stand up for our values,” Biden told reporters.\n\nOn Saturday, as he was making remarks to the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as leaders of Egypt, Iraq and Jordan, the President again touched on human rights as he sat beside Crown Prince Mohammed, calling the values enshrined in the UN charter “foundational to who we are as Americans” and encouraging the assembled leaders to allow more rights for women and the press.\n\n“I’ve gotten plenty of criticism over the years. It’s not fun. But the ability to speak openly, exchange ideas freely, is what unlocks innovation,” Biden said.\n\nBiden leaves Saudi Arabia without any public promises for increased oil production, but hints at private assurances\n\nBiden came to Jeddah seeking solutions to one of his top political problems at home – high gas prices -- as diplomacy with the kingdom and other allies in the Middle East was seen as one of the few routes he could take to ease the pain at the pump. But, the trip did not produce any immediate announcements on increased oil production.\n\nThe trip came amid high gas prices and widespread inflation in the US and across the globe, in part due to Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine that has been ongoing since February. The high gas and grocery prices in the US are putting stress on millions of Americans and represent a major political liability for Biden’s Democratic Party in this year’s midterm elections.\n\nWhile gas prices have been falling in recent weeks, high prices have become a thorn in Biden’s side. White House officials said in the lead-up to the Saudi leg of the trip that they did not expect to be leaving with promises of increased oil production, and that prediction came true by the time Biden left the kingdom on Saturday.\n\nHowever, the President did strike an optimistic note that regional leaders would soon take action given that the next OPEC meeting will take place in early August.\n\n“Based on our discussions today, I expect we’ll see further steps in the coming weeks,” Biden said Friday after hours of meetings with Saudi leadership.\n\nThe President attempts to reassure allies the US is committed to the Middle East\n\nBiden attempted to reassert US leadership in the Middle East during the GCC+3 summit Saturday with key leaders in the region and promised that his administration would stay actively engaged amid fears that China and Russia could swiftly fill a leadership vacuum.\n\nThe President’s foreign policy focus since taking office has largely been on countering China’s growing geopolitical influence and Russia’s war in Ukraine, which has raised questions about the extent of Biden’s commitment to engagement in the Middle East.\n\n“The United States is invested in building a positive future in the region in partnership with all of you, and the United States is not going anywhere,” Biden said at the meeting with the GCC+3.\n\nThe summit came nearly one year after the US withdrew all military troops from Afghanistan and ended 20 years of war in the country. Biden also noted that his visit to the Middle East was the first time since the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 that a US president had visited the region without American troops being engaged in combat in the area, though US forces continue to conduct operations in Syria.\n\nBiden has been under pressure to do more to counter Iran in the region and come up with a coordinated strategy among allies, and on Saturday he made a commitment to the US playing a large role in the Middle East for years to come.\n\n“Let me state clearly that the United States is going to remain an active and engaged partner in the Middle East,” he said.\n\nThe White House released a joint statement later Saturday that said all the meeting’s participants “affirmed their keenness to continue to hold the U.S.-GCC Summit annually.”\n\nBiden looks to diplomacy to block Iran from getting nuclear weapon despite Israeli skepticism\n\nDuring the first leg of his trip, in Israel, Biden repeatedly vowed to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon and said he believed diplomacy remained the best avenue to keep Tehran from obtaining one. His Israeli hosts were skeptical at best.\n\nBiden has pushed for a revival of the Iran nuclear deal, which former President Donald Trump withdrew the US from in 2018, as he faces increasing pressure from key Middle East allies to produce a plan to contain Iran. But hopes appear to be fading that a deal will materialize, and the President acknowledged that the US is “not going to wait forever” for a response from Iranian leadership.\n\n“I continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to achieve this outcome,” Biden said at a news conference Thursday. “We will continue to work with Israel to counter other threats from Iran throughout the region, including support for terrorism and ballistic missile program that continues and the proliferation of weapons to terrorist and proxies like Hezbollah.”\n\nStanding alongside Biden at that news conference was Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, who was dismissive about another nuclear deal as the means to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n\n“Words will not stop them, Mr. President. Diplomacy will not stop them. The only thing that will stop Iran is knowing that if they continue to develop their nuclear program, the free world will use force. The only way to stop them is to put a credible military threat on the table,” Lapid said.\n\nIran was a main topic of discussion during Biden and Lapid’s bilateral meeting on Thursday, and the two leaders signed a new joint declaration aimed at expanding the security relationship between their nations and countering what they described as efforts by Iran to destabilize the region. The President reiterated the US’ “ironclad commitment” to Israel’s security.", "authors": ["Kate Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/20/politics/biden-inflation-recession-gas-prices-analysis/index.html", "title": "Analysis: America is on edge, and that's bad news for the White ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIf Americans are “really, really down,” as President Joe Biden suggests, it’s hardly surprising.\n\nMany key aspects of economic, social and national life that were once viewed as smoothly running certainties are out of joint. The Covid-19 pandemic, though it has eased its deadly grip, has left a complicated legacy of challenges that are still disrupting daily life. Some are aggravations – like the more than 800 airline flights cancelled on Sunday. Others threaten Americans’ economic prospects and sense of safety and wellbeing, like the growing fears of a recession.\n\nSuch an atmosphere is sure to breed new turmoil in a nation seeing widening ideological divides ahead of midterm elections that are likely to cause more dysfunction if power is split in Washington between Republicans and Democrats. And it almost guarantees years of political bickering ahead of the 2024 presidential race, which may hamper the nation’s capacity to solve any crisis.\n\nAcute problems include record gasoline prices. Families are struggling to cope with the soaring costs of food and vital goods. Some major cities are failing to manage a homelessness crisis. Baby formula shelves are still often empty. And summer getaways are hampered by an airline industry knocked off balance by Covid-19. While vaccinations and less deadly variants reduced the threat of the virus, it’s still disrupting business, schools and summer camps.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This is what determines the price of gas 01:57 - Source: CNN\n\nThe political split in the country, meanwhile, is exemplified by the tortuous effort to pass even rudimentary firearms safety measures in the Senate. While liberals watch the ever-escalating death toll from mass shootings with horror, conservatives who believe all gun rights are at risk make it difficult for Republican lawmakers to compromise. Political divisions are also underscored by the mixed reception of televised hearings of the House select committee probing the US Capitol insurrection. The panel is showing just how close the US came to an authoritarian takeover with ex-President Donald Trump’s coup attempt. But the new evidence is being largely ignored by his supporters, reflecting the GOP’s turn against democracy and raising the stakes for the next elections.\n\nA tense national mood is likely to be exacerbated if, in what would be twin triumphs for conservatives, the Supreme Court rules against majority public opinion and loosens gun restrictions and overturns a woman’s right to an abortion in the coming days. Already, a man has been charged with trying to kill conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, reflecting the charged atmosphere surrounding the court and the politicized issues it’s set to rule on.\n\nLooming troubles\n\nThings are unsettling abroad as well. The United States is bankrolling a war against Russia in Ukraine, which – despite Biden’s success in reviving the West’s Cold War front against Moscow – is turning into a costly stalemate. A building superpower showdown with China will stretch US resources and a new nuclear crisis with Iran may shortly join the continuing one with North Korea.\n\nThese are undoubtedly troubled times. But some perspective is also in order. Biden is right to highlight the strong job growth that has taken unemployment to such low levels that it could cushion the impact of a potential recession set off by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive attempt to cool inflation. And for the first time in two decades, the US does not have troops on the ground in a major war overseas. A snapshot of almost any moment in US history could reveal political struggles over the destiny of the country and the scope of rights conferred by the Constitution. Even if a recession comes, there is hope that it won’t be within the scale of the 2008 financial crisis or the Great Depression nearly 100 years ago, though that will be of little consolation to anyone who loses their job.\n\nThe crush of current crises will inevitably have political reverberations most immediately for Democrats in Congress who are facing a terrible environment less than five months before Election Day. Midterm elections are typically wounding for first-term Presidents. Biden’s eroded approval ratings and the White House’s difficulty in projecting control threaten to hand both the House and the Senate to Republicans, prolonging a political age in which almost every election seems to turn into a repudiation of those in power and a recalibration of voters’ decisions from the previous election.\n\nIt is debatable just how much Biden could do to improve the economy and all the troubles that are afflicting the country. But his professed rationale for his 2020 victory – that he was chosen by voters to fix problems – is crumbling. And while the White House has taken multiple steps to fix things – including expansive use of war-time powers under the Defense Production Act, the releases of millions of barrels of oil from national reserves and mounting emergency flights of baby formula from abroad – its efforts have not always been effective.\n\nWhen it comes to inflation especially, the White House has presented an often confusing political message as officials oscillate between saying there’s not much more Biden can do to highlighting multiple plans to show that the President understands the pressure on Americans. But given the reality of rising gas prices, Biden is a tough political spot – unable to take credit for positive aspects of the recovery since many people are simply not feeling the strength of the economy in their lives.\n\nAt times, Biden has appeared to be claiming credit for what works in the economy and blaming others for what doesn’t – rejecting criticism that his stimulus spending fueled inflation and branding high gasoline prices as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “price hike.” Last week, the President lashed out at big energy firms over their inflated profits, in what might be a smart political strategy to rally Democrats but may not help lower gas prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Fact-checking Biden's claim that Putin shares blame for inflation 02:33 - Source: CNN\n\nBiden’s remarks in an interview with the Associated Press last week that Americans are “really, really down,” after years of pandemic deprivations and political divisions, were consistent with his promise to always tell Americans the unvarnished truth. But they didn’t necessarily paint a picture of a President with the capacity to inspire the nation in hard times. This is especially problematic since his comments coincided with a pro-active attempt by the White House to dampen speculation about Biden’s reelection intentions amid increasing discussion about his age. He will turn 82 between the next presidential election and inauguration. Every White House assurance that he plans to run only fuels stories about Biden’s political plight.\n\nBut there would be far less Washington whispering about his future were economic conditions in a better place.\n\nThings could get worse\n\nThe daunting reality for Democrats – and struggling Americans – is that things could get worse.\n\nA combination of stubbornly high inflation and rising job losses in an economy slowing due to Federal Reserve action would be an even bigger political disaster for the White House. The administration already has limited credibility in talking about the economy after repeatedly downplaying the risks of risking inflation last year and insisting that it was a temporary phenomenon. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is one of the few officials to admit she got it wrong, as she did in a recent CNN interview. She insisted on ABC News’ “This Week” on Sunday that though inflation was “unacceptably high,” a recession was not inevitable. Brian Deese, the director of Biden’s National Economic Council, had a similar message on other Sunday talk shows.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Treasury secretary warns of 'unacceptable levels of inflation' 01:58 - Source: CNN\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, meanwhile, added to the messaging confusion about Biden’s upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia by saying that she thought Biden would meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom US intelligence blames for ordering the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Biden last week said he was not going to the kingdom to meet the Crown Prince but that he would attend an international meeting of regional powers at which he would be present.\n\nThe dancing on a rhetorical pin head reflects an apparent desire by the administration to mend relations with the Saudis to secure an increase in oil production that might bring gas prices down. But it’s also a reflection of the backlash Biden is facing from some Democrats over easing his position on a nation he once branded a “pariah.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback From 'pariah' to 'partner'?

Any improvements to the inflation picture are unlikely to be sufficient to shift the political environment before November. And a prolonged fight against rising prices and a possible dip into recession could haunt Biden as the 2024 campaign ramps up after November.\n\nThis is giving Democrats heartburn as Trump shows every sign of launching a campaign for his old job – despite the evidence of his extremism and abuses of power unveiled by the House panel in its televised hearings.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/06/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/15/politics/oil-politics-joe-biden-saudi-arabia/index.html", "title": "Biden set to take calibrated approach in effort to shift US-Saudi ...", "text": "Jeddah, Saudi Arabia CNN —\n\nSoaring gas prices may have been the driving factor behind President Joe Biden’s decision to visit Saudi Arabia, but the American effort to secure increased oil production will be more diplomatic than overt pressure, according to US officials.\n\nThe approach will reflect the realities of a relationship that has been under significant strain, but also an awareness of market dynamics that limit the flexibility – and capacity – the Saudis have to simply ramp up production on request.\n\n“Everyone knows the goal here,” a US official said of the push for increased production. “But the approach is important – both from the Saudi perspective and for our domestic audience.”\n\nThat means Biden won’t be boarding Air Force One back to Washington with explicit production increases, officials said. Instead, the expectation is that there will be an understanding that will be the case in the months ahead – done within the context of increased output levels in the OPEC+ cartel laid out at its August meeting.\n\n“Before we announced the trip, you saw an announcement from OPEC+ on accelerating and increasing production. We will discuss the issue here. And we are hopeful that we will see additional actions by OPEC+ in the coming weeks,” national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters aboard Air Force One on the way to Jeddah.\n\n“I don’t think you should expect a particular announcement here bilaterally because we believe any further action taken to ensure that there is sufficient energy to protect the health of the global economy will be done in the context of OPEC+,” Sullivan said.\n\nFor months, key Biden administration officials have traveled to Riyadh to lay down the conditions for the meeting – trips that underscored a more holistic approach to addressing concerns from a long-time ally that has come to question US commitment to the region.\n\nThose meetings have touched on an array of issues, from regional stability and security to climate, technology and investment in a growing and rapidly diversifying kingdom. Yet throughout, it was clear that at some point, a meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman would be a critical moment to solidify a relationship in repair.\n\nThe meetings also marked an effort to provide assurances to Saudi officials that despite Biden’s statements about making the kingdom “a pariah state” in the wake of the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the Biden administration has said was ordered by MBS, the US viewed the relationship as critical for regional stability. The Crown Prince has denied involvement.\n\nDespite the repeated insistence by Biden and other officials that any interaction with MBS would occur in the context of the Gulf Cooperation Summit or in a bilateral meeting with King Salman and an array of top Saudi officials, the White House announced the day before his arrival that Biden would hold a separate bilateral meeting with MBS.\n\nIn short, the idea that Biden can simply come to Saudi, shun MBS and demand increased production and expect results is both shortsighted and the opposite of the approach Biden will take, officials said.\n\n“Part of the frustration on the Saudi side has been the idea that they can be kicked or ignored for the better part of a year and then all of the sudden snap to when a US president calls,” one Riyadh-based diplomat said. “It may sound transactional, but at some point any leader would ask the question: ‘What are we actually getting out of this?’”\n\nFor Saudi officials looking for a firm idea of American goals and intentions with both bilateral relationship and more broadly in the region, Biden’s ability to deliver that answer to that question is a critical component of the visit – one expected to be bolstered by a series of commitments across several areas when Biden departs.\n\nStill, the issue of oil hangs over everything in the next two days, where US officials will focus the conversation less on specific asks than their analysis of both the acute and looming risks to the global market as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues. The approach has delivered some results already, with OPEC+ agreeing to boost output last month in a decision applauded by Biden and other White House officials.\n\nThe US approach is also grounded in the reality presented by Saudi’s own commitments. The kingdom has no desire to rupture the OPEC+ coalition, which includes Russia and is viewed as a critical element of maintaining stability through an increasingly turbulent last several years.\n\nAny decision to increase production would be made within that structure, and as such, would likely need to be tied to market realities.\n\n“I think the conversation is really focused on, given current market conditions, how do we see things? How do we see the next six months, and how can we keep markets balanced in a way that contribute to continued economic growth? So that’s the common focus of ours, with not just the Saudis, but other producers,” a senior administration official said.\n\nBiden gave a window into the balancing act last month when asked if he’d explicitly ask Saudi King Salman or the Crown Prince for increased production.\n\nBiden said no, then quickly broadened out his pitch to oil producers in the region outside of just Saudi.\n\n“I’ve indicated to them that I thought they should be increasing oil production, generically – not to the Saudis particularly,” Biden told reporters. “And I think we’re going to – I hope we see them, in their own interest, concluding that makes sense to do.”\n\nBut there are only two major producers that have the capacity to deliver a tangible increase – Saudi and the United Arab Emirates. Biden is set to hold a bilateral meeting with the UAE’s leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan the day after he sits down with top Saudi officials.\n\nWhile US officials believe both countries have the capacity to increase production, they have been careful not to prescribe specific numbers, something that underscores an awareness of the limitations that exist.\n\n“Saudi Arabia has a unique role in the global oil market because it has developed and sustained spare capacity,” Ben Cahill, a senior fellow in the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote this week. “If it maximizes output and burns through its spare capacity, there will be no room to cover a production shortfall in other countries due to war, accidents, or weather-related outages.”\n\nWith Biden’s arrival, that market reality has converged with the complex mix of political and diplomatic dynamics that US officials have been grappling with for months. Biden’s visit will go a long way to determining the future of the US-Saudi relationship during his time in office.\n\nWhat it won’t do, however, is significantly change the price at the pump in the near term.\n\n“If anyone’s under the impression MBS can just flip a switch and dramatically drive down gas prices, they simply have no idea what they’re talking about,” the Riyadh-based diplomat said.", "authors": ["Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/18/politics/house-vote-crown-act/index.html", "title": "US House passes CROWN Act that would ban race-based hair ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe US House on Friday passed legislation that would ban race-based hair discrimination in employment and against those participating in federally assisted programs, housing programs, and public accommodations.\n\nThe Democratic-led House voted 235-189 to pass the CROWN Act, which stands for “Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair.” The bill seeks to protect against bias based on hair texture and protective styles, including locs, cornrows, twists, braids, Bantu knots, and Afros.\n\n“Natural Black hair is often deemed ‘unprofessional’ simply because it does not conform to White beauty standards,” Democratic Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey, the bill’s sponsor, said in a statement. “Discrimination against Black hair is discrimination against Black people.”\n\nThe bill now heads to the Senate, where Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey has sponsored the chamber’s version of the bill.\n\nThe Biden administration this week said it “strongly supports” the CROWN Act and “looks forward to working with the Congress to enact this legislation and ensure that it is effectively implemented.”\n\n“As a Black woman who loves my braids, I know what it’s like to feel isolated because of how I wear my hair,” Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri said Friday on the House floor before the vote. “This is the last time we say no more to Black people being demeaned and discriminated against for the same hairstyles that corporations profit from. No more to Black people being made to feel like we have cut our locs just to get a job. This is the last time we say no more to Black people being made to feel like we have to straighten our hair to be deemed professional.”\n\nRepublicans objected to the bill, arguing that federal law already covers this kind of discrimination and that Democrats should be focusing on other issues, like inflation and high gas prices.\n\n“Fourteen months of chaos and we’re doing a bill on hair,” Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said Friday, adding, “I hope we can actually focus on the things that matter to the American people.”\n\nDemocrats acknowledged that such discrimination is prohibited under existing federal law, such as the 1964 Civil Rights Act but said courts have misinterpreted the law by narrowly interpreting the meaning of race, thus allowing discrimination against people who wear natural or protective hairstyles.\n\nThis is the second time this year the House considered the legislation. The bill failed to pass the House last month when Democrats sought to fast track it. Fifteen Republicans joined with Democrats to pass the bill, but it did not reach the required two-thirds threshold to pass.\n\nThe House on Wednesday passed a resolution clearing the way for the bill, H.R. 2116, to be reconsidered.\n\nThe House passed the CROWN Act last Congress, but the bill stalled in the Senate where Republicans had held control.

His administration also released an intelligence report last year that directly accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of orchestrating Khashoggi’s killing.\n\nBut officials say Biden, who is under immense pressure to crack down on Russia and lower domestic gas prices amid inflation that’s rising at the fastest pace since 1981, has set aside his moral outrage to pursue warmer relations with the Kingdom amid the dramatic global upheaval spurred by the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n“Both sides have decided that for the sake of achieving peace and stability in the Middle East, we need to move past it,” said one senior US official, referring to Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudis, for their part, consider the Khashoggi case closed—and have made that clear to the US, officials said.\n\nThat doesn’t mean forgiving and forgetting, the sources noted. Biden, they said, does plan to raise Khashoggi’s murder directly with MBS, as the crown prince is known, when they meet as soon as next month. And some officials inside the administration still believe more should be done to hold MBS accountable for the crime. But the shift is now well underway after months of meetings in Riyadh between two of Biden’s top national security advisers, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein, and Saudi officials, including MBS. And it is already sparking outrage, with Khashoggi’s fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, accusing Biden of losing his moral compass.\n\n“President Biden’s decision to meet MBS is horribly upsetting to me and supporters of freedom and justice everywhere,” she said in a statement to CNN.\n\nA human rights defender in Washington close to the administration, who was also a close friend of Khashoggi’s, told CNN that he believes moving on and doing nothing more to hold MBS accountable for Khashoggi’s killing will deal a huge blow to the prince’s opposition and Arab dissidents around the world.\n\n“The promise of accountability was the only check on this guy [MBS], now it’s gone,” he said. “When the President of the US goes to this murderer’s hometown to appease him, he’s not only glossing over his past heinous crimes with stunning impunity but enabling his future ones. It’s a wink-wink nudge-nudge to commit the next crime in a cleaner, less messy fashion.”\n\nUS officials told CNN that the decision to meet with MBS has been a tough pill to swallow for the President, who said in 2019 that Saudi Arabia had “no redeeming social value.” But they said the countries have agreed that the relationship cannot be held “hostage” by the murder, especially given how dramatically the world has changed since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.\n\nAmong the US’ most important foreign policy goals now is to isolate Russia politically and cut off funding for its war machine by banning Russian oil exports – two objectives that officials believe will be nearly impossible if Saudi Arabia is not on the US’ side, particularly when it comes to increasing oil production to try to stabilize global oil markets. The President and his senior national security advisers therefore believe that to “shun” Saudi Arabia over the murder of Khashoggi would be shortsighted.\n\nThe troubling economic trends, particularly when it comes to record high domestic gas prices and soaring inflation, have also come to dominate the priorities of the administration and shunted others aside, said a US official outside the White House.\n\n“I do think the desperation of the trajectory of the global economy is driving everything,” the official said. “They [the White House] are anxious, they are desperate.”\n\n“Their fear, and their anxiety, is making them throw principle out the door,” the official added. “The worst [economic] outcomes on this are really bad and would devastate any hopes the Democrats would have in November.”\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN en Español on Wednesday that the administration never sought to fully “rupture” US-Saudi relations, even after releasing the report last year that put MBS at the center of Khashoggi’s murder. But he said that the US would continue “to make sure that human rights is fully reflected in our foreign policy.”\n\nOil prices driving the reset\n\nBiden’s advisers have said openly that the need to increase oil production to stabilize prices is a key driver of the Saudi reset.\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday that “there is no doubt that Saudi Arabia has to account for what they did with Jamal Khashoggi.” But, she added, “there is also no question that we have to increase global [oil] supply. And OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, is at the head of the pack for that.”\n\nThere are of course things the Saudis want in return from the US, including a viable strategy for dealing with Iran – the Kingdom’s biggest regional enemy – as the US struggles to finalize a new nuclear deal. The Saudis also want security commitments, like the continued provision of missile defense systems, officials said.\n\nBut White House officials argue that Saudi Arabia has been working with the US in good faith over the last several months, which has made the White House more confident that a meeting between Biden and MBS will be fruitful.\n\nUS officials have repeatedly pointed to the fragile ceasefire in Yemen reached in April and the Saudi’s ouster of Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who was viewed by many officials in the region and in the US as an impediment to peace, as major diplomatic victories that would not have been possible without US engagement. The two-month-old ceasefire, which was extended last week, is the first between the warring Saudis and Houthis in six years.\n\n“I’m not going to change my view on human rights,” Biden said last week. “But as President of the United States, my job is to bring peace if I can. And that’s what I’m going to try to do.”\n\nWorking on a ‘significant agenda’\n\nA National Security Council spokesperson noted that the Khashoggi murder took place during the Trump administration, telling CNN that the US is “not looking past any conduct that took place before we entered office.” The spokesperson pointed to the sanctions the US has imposed on Saudi individuals believed to have been involved in Khashoggi’s murder and others implicated in human rights abuses.\n\nBut the spokesperson also said the US has “a significant agenda with Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the other countries of the Middle East. That agenda is focused on delivering results for the American people as well as ending wars and leading through diplomacy to bring stability to the Middle East region.”\n\nLast week’s agreement by OPEC+ to increase oil production by 200,000 barrels per day in July and August, a decision spearheaded by Saudi Arabia, was another show of good faith by the Saudis, officials believe. And with help from the United States, relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia are also slowly but steadily improving, officials noted – discussions are underway now, for example, to expand Israeli commercial planes’ access to Saudi airspace, the sources said. One regional official briefed on the discussions said Israel wants the Saudis to allow Israeli Arab Muslims to fly to the Kingdom for religious pilgrimages.\n\nIsrael has been pushing heavily for the Biden-MBS meeting to happen, multiple officials said. And underscoring the changing nature of the Israel-Saudi relationship, Biden is expected to make an extraordinarily rare flight directly from Tel Aviv to Riyadh on Air Force One while in the Middle East next month, according to two regional officials briefed on the plans.\n\nStill, those developments are unlikely to satisfy activists and American lawmakers who continue to call for further accountability and justice for Khashoggi.\n\n“The highest levels of the Saudi government, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, are culpable in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, and there is no escaping that stark truth laid bare in the U.S. Intelligence Community’s 2021 public assessment,” top House lawmakers wrote in a letter to Biden earlier this week. “We must continue to insist on justice for this horrific crime.”", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand Alex Marquardt", "Natasha Bertrand", "Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/18/energy/gas-prices-inflation-biden/index.html", "title": "Gas prices are in the danger zone. Biden can't do much about it ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s 2022 is off to a dreadful start. Prices at the pump could make it even worse.\n\nCrude oil has already zoomed back to two-month highs. Gasoline prices, which move with a lag, have stopped their muted decline. And they’re starting to creep higher again.\n\nThe energy resurgence is only going to add to the economic anxiety gripping the United States and sinking Biden’s poll numbers.\n\n“This is a terrible situation. Gas prices are in this political danger zone,” Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told CNN.\n\nThe White House knows how deeply unpopular high gas prices are. That’s why Biden took sweeping action in November to intervene. The administration announced the largest-ever release of emergency crude reserves from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in US history.\n\nThe return of $85 oil will pile pressure on Biden to act once again — and the administration is signaling further action is on the table.\n\n“Tools continue to remain on the table for us to address prices. This is something the administration is continuing to watch and monitor very closely,” a White House official told CNN.\n\nYet presidents have limited power to lower gas prices. While Biden has options, they all have drawbacks.\n\n“They are in a difficult situation. There are no magic wands here,” said Bob McNally, president of consulting firm Rapidan Energy Group and a former energy adviser to former President George W. Bush.\n\nEmergency release Part II\n\nIf crude prices stay elevated, Biden may be tempted to take another stab at knocking them down.\n\n“President Biden has taken strong, aggressive measures to combat these challenges,” the White House official told CNN, citing the SPR release from November.\n\nAnd the official reiterated that Biden “stands ready to take additional action, if needed,” to maintain adequate supply, echoing what the administration said last fall.\n\nLocated along the US Gulf Coast, the SPR is an underground series of caverns that contains crude stockpiled for break-the-glass moments like hurricanes or wars.\n\nBiden’s SPR intervention was met with mixed results.\n\nOil prices began tumbling in early November on rumors that the White House would step in. By the time of the announcement, crude was down about 10% from the highs.\n\nDays later, US crude crashed to as low as $65.76 a barrel on December 1. But that late November selloff was driven by Omicron fears, and it proved short-lived. Crude is now trading at around $85 a barrel, up 29% from that December 1 low.\n\nThe gas price relief was fleeting.\n\nAfter hitting a seven-year high of $3.42 a gallon in early November, the national average briefly dropped below $3.30 a gallon. But they have since rebounded to $3.31 a gallon — and the market is signaling further gains ahead. Gasoline futures are now trading at two-month highs.\n\nSome energy analysts say the SPR failed to work, while others argue energy prices would have been much higher if Biden hadn’t acted.\n\nCroft, the RBC strategist and a former CIA analyst, said the SPR release may have succeeded as a diplomatic tool used to get oil producers to add supply. She noted that despite Omicron, OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, went ahead and increased oil production in December.\n\nStill, barely two months after Biden’s historic intervention, he’s under pressure to tap the SPR again. That underscores the SPR’s limitations.\n\nAfter all, emergency reserves have a finite number of barrels. Washington can’t simply release barrels every month.\n\nA more extreme step\n\nIn November, nearly a dozen Congressional Democrats urged Biden to ban US oil exports, a dramatic step that some Wall Street banks and industry experts have warned would badly backfire. At least one powerful official inside the administration backed that idea: White House chief of staff Ron Klain.\n\nAs CNN reported last fall, the soaring price of gasoline so alarmed Klain that at one point he suggested halting US exports.\n\nHowever, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm later told oil executives in December that the administration is not considering an oil export ban.\n\n“I’ve heard you loud and clear, and so has the White House,” Granholm told the National Petroleum Council in December. “We wanted to put that rumor to rest.”\n\nMcNally, the energy consultant, said an export ban would be a disaster.\n\n“They may be looking for stronger medicine but this would be poison,” McNally said.\n\nThat’s because oil is a globally traded commodity and US gas prices are set by Brent, the world benchmark. If the world lost access to US barrels, Brent prices would likely rise due to less supply.\n\nMake nice with MBS\n\nEnergy diplomacy may be Biden’s best option for driving down gas prices. Only OPEC has enough firepower to quickly add barrels on the market.\n\n“We are in a supply crunch engineered by OPEC+,” said Claudio Galimberti, senior vice president of analysis at Rystad Energy.\n\nThe administration’s efforts to get OPEC to open the spigots have not been helped by the tense relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia, the cartel’s kingpin.\n\nMaking nice with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, could help. But that would come at a cost given that US intelligence found that MBS approved the operation to capture or kill journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.\n\n“Does Biden have to pick up the phone and call MBS as opposed to outsourcing it to his lieutenants?” RBC’s Croft asked. “None of this is easy.”\n\nMeet with Big Oil\n\nIn recent months, the Biden administration has begun to take a friendlier tone with a key group in this inflation crisis: the US oil industry.\n\nDuring Granholm’s virtual address to the National Petroleum Council last month, the Energy Secretary asked the industry to ramp up production to meet demand.\n\n“Consumers, as you know, are hurting at the pump…You clearly have some important tools to alleviate that pain,” Granholm said. “Please, take advantage of the leases you have. Hire workers. Get your rig count up.”\n\nGranholm added: “I do not want to fight with any of you.”\n\nIn theory, Biden could take this a step further by meeting with oil CEOs at the White House and considering requests to cut red tape (or at least promise not to add more regulation).\n\nHowever, Biden ran on the most aggressive climate agenda in US history, and climate scientists say the world needs less, not more, fossil fuels. Cozying up to Big Oil isn’t really an option for this White House.\n\nWait it out\n\nThere is a lot of uncertainty over how much higher gas prices will go.\n\nMuch will depend on the path of the pandemic and supply. But the good news is that as long as Russia doesn’t invade Ukraine and disrupt gas supply, some energy analysts expect gas prices will cool off later this year as supply meets demand.\n\nMcNally said his advice to Biden would be not to overreact to rising prices.\n\n“Stand pat. Don’t commit mistakes,” he said. “Wait for prices to come down.”\n\nOf course, presidents with low approval ratings in election years aren’t known for their patience.", "authors": ["Matt Egan"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}]}

It is the largest fine the FTC has ever imposed for a rule that it enforces, the agency said Monday.\n\nIn a second and separate settlement, Epic will pay $245 million as refunds to consumers who were allegedly harmed by user-interface design choices the FTC claimed were deceptive. That agreement is the largest administrative order in FTC history, the FTC added.\n\nIn a blog post addressing the twin settlements, Epic said the agreement reflects an evolution in how US laws are applied to the video gaming industry.\n\n“No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here,” Epic said in the blog post. “We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.”\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan said the settlement reflects the agency’s heightened focus on privacy and so-called “dark patterns,” a term used to describe design elements intended to nudge users toward a company’s preferred result.\n\n“Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices,” Khan said in a statement.\n\nThe FTC’s complaint and proposed settlement dealing with children’s privacy was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. In addition to the alleged illegal collection of children’s data, the FTC also claimed that Epic’s default settings for matchmaking and in-game communications exposed children to bullying and harassment.\n\nThe allegations of Epic’s deceptive design choices were filed as an FTC administrative complaint. The complaint claims Epic made it extremely easy for children to purchase in-game items with a single click or button press without parental approval, resulting in more than one million parental complaints to Epic about unwanted charges.\n\nThe FTC further alleged that Epic made it more difficult to cancel purchases of in-game items by burying the option at the bottom of the screen and by requiring consumers to push and hold a button on their controllers to complete the cancellation. Those design choices were allegedly implemented after surveys showed that, when the cancel button was more prominently displayed, accidental charges were the “number one ‘reason’” users clicked on the button, the FTC said.\n\nEpic’s agreement with the FTC, which is not yet final, prohibits the company from using dark patterns or charging consumers without their consent, and also forbids Epic from locking players out of their accounts in response to users’ chargeback requests with credit card companies disputing unwanted charges. The agreement will last for 20 years from the time it is adopted.\n\nIn its blog post, Epic said it has agreed with the FTC to implement a feature that explicitly asks Fortnite users whether to save their payment information for future use. The feature is currently live, it added. The company also recently rolled out a more limited version of “Fortnite” for younger players that allows them to access some features while awaiting parental consent but that restricts chat and purchases.\n\nThe FTC said that as part of its children’s privacy settlement, Epic may no longer enable text and voice chat by default for teenage Fortnite players or those under the age of 13. The company must also establish a comprehensive privacy program and delete the data it allegedly gathered in violation of COPPA.\n\n“We share the underlying principles of fairness, transparency and privacy that the FTC enforces, and the practices referenced in the FTC’s complaints are not how Fortnite operates,” Epic wrote. “We will continue to be upfront about what players can expect when making purchases, ensure cancellations and refunds are simple, and build safeguards that help keep our ecosystem safe and fun for audiences of all ages.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2019/07/24/facebook-pay-record-5-billion-fine-u-s-privacy-violations/1812499001/", "title": "Facebook fine: FTC fines company $5 billion for privacy violations", "text": "Facebook must pay a record-breaking $5 billion fine as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, by far the largest penalty ever imposed on a company for violating consumers' privacy rights.\n\nFacebook also agreed to adopt new protections for the data users share on the social network and to measures that limit the power of CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\n\"We've agreed to pay a historic fine, but even more important, we're going to make some major structural changes to how we build products and run this company, Zuckerberg posted on Facebook.\n\nUnder the settlement, which concludes a year-long investigation prompted by the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, the social networking giant must expand its privacy protections across Facebook itself, as well as on Instagram and WhatsApp. It must also adopt a corporate system of checks and balances to remain compliant, according to the FTC order.

That move came after The New York Times and U.K.'s The Observer said Cambridge Analytica had access to 50 million profiles and used them to target ads during the 2016 presidential election campaign. At the time, Facebook said it knew the firm had violated its policies by obtaining and secretly passing on the data, which users had agreed to share with a personality prediction app.\n\nThe separate SEC complaint also dates back to Facebook's response to Cambridge Analytica. The allegation, which Facebook while agreeing to the final $100 million judgment neither admits nor denies, is that in 2014 and 2015, Cambridge Analytica paid an academic researcher to \"collect and transfer data from Facebook to create personality scores for approximately 30 million Americans\" and that Facebook discovered this misuse in 2015 but failed to correctly disclose it for more than two years.\n\nThe $5-billion FTC fine is nearly 20 times greater than the largest privacy or data security penalty that has ever been assessed worldwide and is one of the largest imposed by the U.S. government for any violation.\n\nAs part of the settlement, the FTC's order also curbs Zuckerberg's oversight in privacy and security matters, with the requirement Facebook create a new privacy committee with independent board members who cannot be removed without a two-thirds shareholder vote. Zuckerberg and designated compliance officers each must submit individual quarterly compliance reports to the FTC.\n\nBig tech:Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter likely facing review from Justice Department\n\nEquifax-FTC settlement:What does Equifax's $700M settlement over its data breach mean for you?\n\nAdditionally, a third-party assessor will monitor Facebook's privacy-related decisions going forward.\n\nThe commission approved the settlement with a 3-2 vote, with the dissenting commissioners wanting tougher action taken against Zuckerberg.\n\nBut the order achieves more than the FTC could have achieved by going to court, says chairman Joe Simons and the commissioners Noah Joshua Phillips and Christine Wilson, who approved the settlement in their lengthy statement.\n\n\"The Order significantly diminishes Mr. Zuckerberg’s power – something no government agency, anywhere in the world, has thus far accomplished,\" the statement says.\n\n\"The provisions of this Order extinguish the ability of Mr. Zuckerberg to make privacy decisions unilaterally by also vesting responsibility and accountability for those decisions within business units, DCOs (digital compliance officers), and the privacy committee.\"\n\nThe settlement hasn't placated Facebook's harshest critics.\n\n\"A penalty that doesn’t require real structural changes, that financially is a drop in the bucket, and that appears to absolve Facebook of any liability over additional abuses like tricking kids into in-app purchases, is a get out jail free card for Facebook and sends a signal to the rest of the industry that business as usual is acceptable,\" said Common Sense CEO James Steyer in a statement. \"This punishment simply does not fit the crime and we strongly encourage policymakers to consider this just the very beginning of a long way we have to go to hold Facebook and the tech industry accountable for protecting the privacy of users, especially young people.\"\n\nConsumer Reports President and CEO Marta Tellado, added, “As expected, the size of the settlement is historic, but these attempts to hold Facebook accountable are not enough to make a real difference. With a weak and under-resourced FTC, and a glaring need for far more comprehensive privacy laws, Congress must raise the standards for consumers and hold Big Tech accountable.\"\n\nSimilarly, earlier this week, the FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and 50 states and territories reached a settlement with credit-reporting company Equifax over allegations that it did not implement sufficient security measures to prevent a massive data breach. Equifax must pay at least $575 million and potentially as much as $700 million.\n\nPreviously, the FTC’s highest fines were to Google, which paid $22.5 million in 2012 and Upromise, which paid $500,000 in 2017.\n\nFacebook agreed to the settlement with the agency over allegations it broke a previous agreement over privacy protections.\n\nThe changes the company agreed to will likely make it take longer to bring new features to Facebook and its other products, Zuckerberg said.\n\nBut, it is the company's \"responsibility to protect people's privacy. We already work hard to live up to this responsibility, but now we're going to set a completely new standard for our industry,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Overall, these changes go beyond anything required under US law today. The reason I support them is that I believe they will reduce the number of mistakes we make and help us deliver stronger privacy protections for everyone.\"\n\nFacebook (FB) shares were down more than 1% in early trading to $199.94; the ended the trading day up $2.30 to close at $204.66. Shares have risen 47% so far this year. The company is expected to release its second-quarter results after the market closes Wednesday.\n\nThe FTC also announced separate settlements with Cambridge Analytica, its former CEO Alexander Nix, and Aleksandr Kogan, an app developer who worked with the company. The actions allege Cambridge \"used false and deceptive tactics to harvest personal information from millions of Facebook users\" and all face restrictions on future business.\n\nTimeline:Facebook becomes the Uber of 2018\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/business/nightcap-zelle-fraud-warren-investigation/index.html", "title": "Zelle fraud is rising. And banks aren't coming to the rescue", "text": "This story is part of CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York CNN Business —\n\nZelle, the popular payment app, is under fire for how it handles (or rather, doesn’t handle) fraud and scams that have exploded on the platform in recent years.\n\nThe New York Times called Zelle out in two reports earlier this year. That grabbed the attention of US senators, who pressed the CEOs of the nation’s large banks that own the platform in hearings last month and began an investigation into the service.\n\nHere’s the deal: On Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren’s office said its investigation into Zelle showed that fraud and theft are not only rampant but getting worse. And once people report fraudulent transactions, banks are reimbursing only a small fraction of the swindled customers.\n\nSen. Warren questions bank CEOs about Zelle during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Sept. 22. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\n“Big banks own and profit from Zelle but are failing to make their customers whole for both authorized and unauthorized fraudulent activity on the platform, despite their claims that it is safe,” Warren’s office wrote.\n\nKey things to know:\n\nZelle (rhymes with “tell”) was created in 2017 as the banking industry’s answer to Venmo and Cash App.\n\nThe fintech companies behind those apps were doing what big banks had failed to do for decades — make transferring money to your friend who just paid for dinner easy and free and fast.\n\nSo the big banks got together and created Zelle, which was lame and almost no one used it till around 2020, when digital payments took off in response to the pandemic.\n\nZelle is now by far the largest peer-to-peer payment system in America. Last year, according to Zelle, transactions totaled $490 billion, up 59% from the year before. (PayPal-owned Venmo, its closest rival, handled $230 billion.)\n\nThe service is operated by Early Warning Systems, a fintech company owned by seven of the US’s largest banks.\n\nNaturally, where the internet and money collide is where scammers get to work.\n\nZelle’s size and accessibility — it’s built right into participating banks’ apps — make it the “preferred tool of fraudsters and other bad actors,” according to the report from Warren’s office.\n\nAmong the investigation’s key findings, which corroborate anecdotal evidence reported by the Times:\n\nBanks are not repaying 90% of cases in which customers were tricked into making payments on Zelle.\n\nAn estimated $440 million was lost by Zelle users through frauds and scams in 2021. But banks “appear not to have provided sufficient recourse to their customers.”\n\n“Authorized” vs “Unauthorized:” Under the a federal rule known as Regulation E, banks are technically only liable to cover fraudulent activity when it involves “unauthorized” transactions. Say, when someone steals your credit card and makes purchases without your permission. But if someone persuades you to send them $500 through a phishing scam, banks consider that “authorized” and won’t reimburse those funds.\n\nBUT… The bank data reviewed by Warren’s office suggest even the bulk of unauthorized cases are going unpaid. For example: PNC Bank indicated that its customers reported 10,683 cases of unauthorized payments totaling over $10.6 million. It refunded only 1,495 cases, totaling $1.46 million.\n\nZelle sought to downplay the report and didn’t specifically address Warren’s allegations Monday. In a statement, the company said: “Tens of millions of consumers use Zelle without incident, with more than 99.9% of payments completed without any report of fraud or scam,” adding that the proportion of fraud and scams has steadily decreased as its user numbers have climbed.\n\nThe Bank Policy Institute, a banking industry group, also disputed Warren’s findings and claimed that Zelle’s rivals Venmo and CashApp receive more reports of disputed transactions.\n\n“Zelle is the safest peer-to-peer network,” it said in a statement Monday. “For any real discussion of online fraud, the focus belongs elsewhere.”\n\nBOTTOM LINE\n\nIt’s kind of crazy to remember how anyone moved money among friends before the advent of payment apps. Did I actually carry cash with me? On the first every month did I take my little checkbook out and literally write out my portion of the rent on a magic slip of paper and then just hand it to my roommates? Wild. It would not surprise me if the original idea for a payments app came from a restaurant server who was fed up with splitting bills unevenly across eight different cards.\n\nBut that’s the pre-internet world Regulation E was made for. It’s a 1978 rule that only got a 21st century electronic payments update by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau late last year. It wasn’t made for the world of instant payments, and could hardly have envisioned how easy the internet would make it to swindle people out of their money.\n\nWarren’s report on Zelle could add pressure on regulators including the CFPB to update its guidance.\n\n“Given this uncertain landscape and the banks’ abdication of responsibility, regulatory clarity is needed to further protect Zelle users,” researchers wrote in the report, noting that the CFPB has regulatory authority over peer-to-peer platforms including Zelle.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: $1.26 million\n\nKim Kardashian, the reality TV star, cosmetics entrepreneur and budding private-equity manager, was hit with a $1.26 million fine for touting what turned out to be a worthless crypto token to her millions of Instagram followers.\n\nKardashian failed to disclose that she was paid $250,000 for the endorsement. Her hashtag “#ad” in the June 2021 post wasn’t enough to satisfy the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition to the fine, Kardashian agreed to refrain from any crypto asset promotions for three years.\n\n“This case is a reminder that, when celebrities or influencers endorse investment opportunities, including crypto asset securities, it doesn’t mean that those investment products are right for all investors,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler.\n\nUK U-Turn\n\nIn a development that I can only assume means that Liz Truss is a Nightcap reader, the British government is reversing part of its tax proposal that was so unpopular it nearly tanked the UK bond market last week.\n\nHere’s the deal: The newly installed government of Prime Minister Liz Truss had announced a massive slate of tax cuts that have amounted to a windfall for the nation’s wealthiest people, slashing the top rate of income tax to 40% from 45%.\n\nThat provision “had become a distraction,” the finance minister said Sunday.\n\nThe proposed cuts of more than $50 billion were aimed at turbo-boosting growth. Instead, it caused panic. The pound plunged to its lowest level against the US dollar, and sparked chaos in the market for UK debt because they will require a large increase in government borrowing.\n\nIt was a dumpster fire of a plan that no mainstream economist supported.\n\nBut, as my colleague Mark Thompson writes, the about-face is more of a symbolic gesture than a genuine reckoning. It will likely reduce the overall size of the tax-cutting package by about £2 billion.\n\n“This move is rather symbolic, being less about the amount of money it will save (low billions) and more about the poor signal it had delivered of ideological (unfunded) tax cuts,” wrote Chris Turner, global head of UK markets at ING.\n\nBottom line: The Truss government’s unfunded tax cuts, which set off a panic in financial markets and put Downing Street in a standoff with the Bank of England, remain, uh, unfunded. The BOE’s bond-buying intervention may have bought the government some time, but Truss has shown no signs of budging on her fringe trickle-down economic theory.\n\nTruss’ finance minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, “still has a lot of work to do if he is to display a credible commitment to fiscal sustainability,” said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, on Monday.\n\n“Unless he also U-turns on some of his other, much larger tax announcements, he will have no option but to consider cuts to public spending: to social security, investment projects, or public services.”\n\nEnjoying Nightcap?

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.\n\nNew York CNN —\n\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has agreed to be extradited to the United States, where he faces eight federal counts of fraud and conspiracy that could land him behind bars for life.\n\nJerone Roberts, the attorney representing Bankman-Fried in the Bahamas, confirmed that SBF’s next court appearance will be to complete the extradition process and is expected to happen this week — likely Tuesday.\n\nHere’s the deal: All signs pointed to a swift extradition to the US after people familiar with SBF’s plans said he intended to abandon his fight against returning to the US.\n\nBut at Monday’s hearing in Nassau, the mood was pure chaos.\n\nThe tl;dr version: It seems that SBF’s US lawyers worked out an agreement with Bahamian prosecutors to drop the extradition fight, which would have taken months, if not years, to play out.\n\nBut SBF’s local defense lawyer, Roberts, said he wasn’t included in that plan, and claimed prosecutors wouldn’t share the US indictment with him. Prosecutor Franklyn Williams dismissed Roberts’ accusation, saying that it was “not to be believed.”\n\nA representative for SBF’s American lawyers told me it was “tough to give specifics while relying on the Bahamian courts.\n\nAt the end of the hearing, the understandably frustrated magistrate judge cleared the courtroom so that Bankman-Fried could call his US attorneys with his Bahamian attorney present.\n\nKEY CONTEXT\n\nSBF had initially planned to fight efforts to return him to the United States. He has repeatedly denied knowingly defrauding customers, while admitting to managerial mistakes at FTX, his crypto exchange, and Alameda, its sister trading house (both of which are now bankrupt).\n\nBut then he was denied bail in the Bahamas, meaning he wouldn’t be able to fight extradition from the comfort of his luxury home. Instead, he’d have to stay in the country’s notorious Fox Hill prison — a place the US State Department has described as overcrowded, dirty and lacking medical care. Its crowded cells often lack mattresses and are “infested with rats, maggots, and insects,” according to a recent report. Toilet access is, at times, nonexistent.\n\nAfter a week of that, SBF is ready to face the music on US soil.\n\nTo be sure, the federal detention facility in Brooklyn where SBF could end up while awaiting trial isn’t exactly the Ritz. Inmates, lawyers and human rights advocates say the conditions inside that facility are also inhumane, citing overcrowding, frequent loss of heating and poor sanitary conditions overall. But he could also make another attempt at bail before a US court… It seems either of those options are preferable to an interminable stay at Fox Hill.\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY: $520 MILLION\n\nEpic Games, maker of the hit video game “Fortnite,” will pay a record $520 million to settle US government allegations that it tricked millions of players, including children and teens, into making unintended purchases and that it violated a children’s privacy law.\n\nIt is the largest fine the Federal Trade Commission has ever imposed, the agency said Monday.\n\nSPEAKING OF CHAOS…\n\nWell, the votes are in: Twitter users think Elon Musk should step down as CEO of the platform, according to a (highly unscientific) survey of Musk’s followers.\n\n57.5% of respondents said yes, Musk should step down, while, 42.5% voted no. Musk did say he would abide by the results, though as of this typing he hadn’t said whether he was stepping down or indicated who might replace him.\n\nFor those keeping track at home: It’s now been two chaotic months of Musk-era Twitter. In that time, Musk has:\n\nLaid off about half of Twitter’s staff.\n\nGiven an ultimatum to the remaining staff that they need to do “extremely hardcore” work or leave.\n\nFired employees who disagreed with him and publicly shamed former employees who were engaged in difficult moderation discussions as part of the “Twitter Files.”\n\nStarted, stopped and then restarted a revised user-verification system that costs $8 a month for a blue check.\n\nFrequently changed Twitter’s rules by executive fiat and with no notice, banning people who violate the new rules — including several tech journalists and an account that tracked his jet.\n\nSpread a conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi.\n\nWelcomed back some of the platform’s permanently banned accounts, including former President Donald Trump and at least one prominent neo-Nazi.\n\nRolled out and then promptly retreated on a policy that would prevent users from sharing links to other social media on Twitter.\n\nIn summary: Musk appears to be making it up as he goes along.\n\nThat’s not very reassuring for advertisers, which make up the vast majority of Twitter’s revenue. The company is on pace to lose $4 billion a year thanks to an advertiser exodus, estimates Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities.\n\nA successor won’t be easy to find. One of Musk’s first orders of business as CEO was to gut Twitter’s C-suite — the executive ranks who would, in normal times, be natural candidates for the top job.\n\n“No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,” Musk tweeted. “The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive.”\n\nAnd even if he recruits externally, you’d need an iron stomach to take the helm of the financially and reputationally damaged social media platform, which Musk bought for $44 billion. Any new CEO will still have to answer to Musk, the sole board director.\n\nRELATED: Elon Musk’s management of Twitter has “severely damaged” market sentiment around Tesla, and risks sparking a backlash from advertisers and consumers, a Wall Street analyst warned.\n\nEnjoying Nightcap?

Her nightmare of being scammed by those horrible DTE impersonators appeared to be over.\n\nThe letter, which arrived in late June, gave her hope that she might recover the money she lost to the utility shut-off scam in late April.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'\" she told me, thinking things had turned in her favor.\n\n\"Your claim has been resolved,\" the bank proclaimed in its bold greeting.\n\n\"We're happy to tell you that we've credited your account for $1,324.85. We appreciate your patience and are happy we could resolve this in your favor,\" the letter stated.\n\nIt was all there in black and white. All there, except the green.\n\nWill she or won't she recover the cash?\n\nWhen she went online to look at her bank account, she couldn't spot an extra $1,324.85 in her checking account. Worse yet, a bank representative later told her that the letter was sent in error. No money would be showing up — ever.\n\nThat phone conversation with the bank lasted nearly an hour, the woman said, as she tried to get the representative on the phone — who was very polite — to explain how in the world the bank could send a letter one day saying they're fixing the problem, then never fix it and claim they aren't required to do so.\n\nA mistake? Oh, nevermind? You won't get more than a thousand dollars back after all?\n\n\"And I lost it,\" she told me frantically by phone. \"I said, 'Do you know what you've just done to me?'\"\n\nAll the shame, all the self-doubt, all the embarrassment, all the frustration of the scam, all back to torment her once again.\n\nMore:Fake Caller ID in utility shut-off scam cost Troy woman $700 via Zelle\n\nMore:Don't lose cash on money apps, digital wallets: How to protect yourself\n\nMore:When is it time to hang up on scam call?

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Jack Reed of Rhode Island.\n\n\"Zelle’s biggest draw — the immediacy of its transfers — also makes scams more effective and 'a favorite of fraudsters,' as consumers have no option to cancel a transaction even moments after authorizing it,\" the letter stated.\n\nWhat is Zelle?\n\nAbout 1.8 billion payments — totaling $490 billion — were sent by consumers and businesses through the Zelle Network in 2021, according to the Early Warning Services. Total dollars transferred were up 59% from 2020.\n\nEarly Warning Services, which operates Zelle, is owned by seven big banks — Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, PNC Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo.\n\nZelle is found easily on thousands of banking apps for a wide variety of banks and credit unions across the country. Or you download the Zelle app on your own. You send money to another person's bank account if you have their email or cellphone number.\n\nBank of America highlights Zelle online as a way to \"send and receive money with almost anyone in minutes, no matter where they bank.\"\n\nAt the same time, though, Zelle and others say money transfer apps should only be used to send and receive money with people you know and trust, not strangers. The same is true of gift cards, too, which are also used by scammers.\n\nZelle \"doesn’t offer a protection program for authorized payments,\" according to Early Warning Services.\n\n\"Money moves fast — directly into the enrolled recipient’s bank account. Always double check the recipient’s correct U.S. mobile number or email address, so the money goes to the right person,\" according to Early Warning Services.\n\nWhat are the hot scams?\n\nCrooks are using Zelle and other apps to rob consumers when listing fake puppies to sell, advertising phony apartments or homes to rent, offering extra income from wrapping your car in an ad and even texting consumers and pretending to be their bank.\n\nDTE had received reports of 58 scam cases through late June where customers confirmed they had paid a scammer or provided sensitive information, according to Katie Susko, a spokeswoman for DTE.\n\nSo far in 2022, Susko said, 95% of the shut-off scams requested payment through Zelle.\n\nThe latest DTE-related scam involves crooks, posing as DTE Energy, initially contacting customers via text message, then by phone call and asking them to make missed payments via a website.\n\nDTE Energy said it will never contact customers through text messaging. If you are unsure about a caller claiming to be a DTE employee, the utility recommends hanging up and calling customer service line at 800-477-4747.\n\nOne new scam: A prospective buyer supposedly wants to buy an item you listed on Facebook Marketplace but then claims that you \"need” to upgrade your Zelle or another digital wallet app to accept money from their \"business account\" for the big-ticket purchase to go through, according to a June alert by the Better Business Bureau.\n\nThe scammer supposedly puts up $300 and sends you screenshots of his Zelle app as proof. Then, the scammer pressures you into paying him back.\n\nBut the BBB warns: If you refund the fake buyer, you’ll be out a few hundred dollars. No money was spent on an upgrade. And you won't receive any money for selling the item.\n\n\"Scammers go where it's easy to get the money. Zelle is their current mechanism to drain consumer accounts,\" warned Ed Mierzwinski, PIRG Education Fund’s senior director of federal consumer programs.\n\n\"The scammers are taking advantage of consumers because the banks are letting them,\" Mierzwinski said, who says tougher consumer protection laws are needed.\n\n\"My basic advice is don't use these apps,\" Mierzwinski said.\n\nIf you do use them, PIRG suggests, that if possible, keep one separate bank account to link to peer-to-peer accounts. Don't link a money transfer app to your bank account with the biggest balance.\n\nAvoid engaging with those who contact you out of the blue and suggest that you can pay a utility bill or anything else via Zelle or another peer-to-peer app.\n\nNot surprisingly, the top payment method used by scammers to obtain money in 2021, in terms of reported dollars lost, was by “bank transfer or payment,\" according to data from the Federal Trade Commission Consumer Sentinel Network. Cryptocurrency was a very close second.\n\nVery tough for many to get money back when scammed\n\nWill you get your money back if you're scammed? Many times, the best way currently is to put up a fight — and even that might not work.\n\nYou should contact your bank or credit union immediately if a fraudster takes money from your account. Even if you were the one who was scammed into sending the money, contact your bank or credit union immediately and insist that they investigate and try to get the money back from the scammer’s bank.\n\nIf you've been scammed with Zelle and your bank refuses to return your money, file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which forwards complaints to financial institutions to respond. See www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint. Consumers also can call the CFPB at 855-411-2372.\n\nMierzwinski also suggests filing a complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or www.occ.gov.\n\nYou also can report a scam to the Federal Trade Commission at ReportFraud.ftc.gov. And you can report the fraud to the state attorney general. In Michigan, go to www.michigan.gov/ag/complaints.\n\nWhat happened with the bank's letter?\n\nThe woman who lost money to the DTE scam said the Bank of America letter arrived unexpectedly in her afternoon mail on a Wednesday.\n\nWhen she didn't see the money online, she called the bank first thing the next morning. The woman then called me at 9:41 a.m. to share her frustration. We missed each other and she left a message.\n\nI called back and we talked. After we hung up, I left a voicemail and sent an email to a Bank of America media contact around 2:12 p.m. and included the woman's claim number from her letter.\n\nBy 3:49 p.m., the woman was calling me all happy now because all of a sudden the $1,324.85 was showing up as pending in her Bank of America account.\n\n\"I'm absolutely shocked,\" she said. \"I'm stunned.\"\n\nThe woman admitted to me later that when she was talking with the bank representative she did tell them that she was going to call the Detroit Free Press. Well, she did.\n\nA Bank of America spokesperson declined to address questions about the customer.\n\nThe bank only issued a statement beginning: \"It’s unfortunate when people fall for scams like this and send money to scammers posing as a legitimate business.\"\n\nThe bank said customers are warned during a Zelle transaction if they are sending money to a new recipient to only send money to people they know and trust and never to transfer money as a result of an unexpected call or text.\n\nTo help customers avoid scams, the bank has information on its website. Tips include: \"Beware of scammers impersonating banks and fraud departments.\"\n\n\"In cases like this, we attempt to get the money back from the recipient bank; however, there is no guarantee since the customer has authorized the payment,\" according to the bank's statement.\n\nWhy would a bank send the woman a letter and then claim it was a mistake?\n\nPIRG's Mierzwinski speculated that perhaps one junior level bank employee researched the rules and interpreted regulations one way and then a senior level attorney disagreed but only did so long after the letter was sent out.\n\nMierzwinski said he's heard of cases where banks took care of consumer complaints after the issue was reported to local consumer reports at newspapers or TV stations.\n\nIt's not typical, consumer watchdogs say, to hear of a bank sending a letter to offer the recovery of money and then saying it was a mistake.\n\n\"The banks are generally doubling down and claiming it's not our fault,\" he told me.\n\n\"The bank is telling consumers that it's your fault.\"\n\nWatchdogs want more breaks for consumers\n\nConsumers are caught in a mess because regulations apparently have not kept up with changing technology. Many say more consumer protection is needed.\n\n\"Clearly, the warnings provided by the payment apps themselves to beware of scams are not adequate to protect consumers from the losses,\" according to a report submitted by consumer groups April 28 before the House Financial Services Taskforce on Financial Technology.\n\nRegulation E — a federal banking rule that's meant to protect banking customers who use electronic methods to transfer money — was enacted in 1978, long before we had mobile phones, online banking and payment apps. The regulation implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act.\n\n\"Regulation E’s protection against unauthorized transfers will likely not apply when the consumer is fraudulently induced to make a payment, even if the consumer’s authorization was obtained through fraud,\" according to a statement written by written by Lauren Saunders and Carla Sanchez-Adams at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\n\"Zelle is a very dangerous payment system,\" Saunders told me in interview by phone.\n\n\"These scams happen in a lot of ways and the legal rights are tricky,\" she said.\n\nIf you're persuaded to send money, Saunders said, you're probably not protected, as it's viewed as an authorized transaction. But if hackers steal money out of your account, she said, it's clear that you're protected, even if you got tricked into giving them information needed to get into your account.\n\nAn argument is being made by consumer advocates that the fraudster in many cases is actually initiating the transfer of money.\n\nThe crooks might already have the consumer’s online banking username and password, and mobile phone number.\n\nThe fraudster uses the consumer’s online banking username and password to begin the account-logon process.\n\nBut the fraudster needs more information and tricks the consumer into handing over the authentication code that the consumer’s bank just texted to the consumer. The fraudster enters that code into the consumer’s bank’s online banking portal. And the fraudster is now logged into the portal as the consumer. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently clarified, Saunders said, that consumers still have rights in that situation.\n\nNever give over such a code to a stranger, even if you believe you're talking with a trusted source.\n\nMierzwinski called the issue a loophole in the law and noted last year that the watchdog group planned to lobby Congress to fix that problem. The law hasn't change yet.\n\nIn December 2021, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued new FAQs and clarified that Regulation E protects victims who are induced into turning over their account credentials to scammers, who conduct unauthorized transfers.\n\nSaunders noted that CFPB's FAQs only addresses the situation where you are induced into giving the crook your account credentials, not where you are induced into transferring the money.\n\nShe said banks and Zelle are responsible for unauthorized transfers that the scammers initiate, but not for ones in which consumers are defrauded into sending money.\n\n\"Given this regulatory landscape, your company and the banks have a clear responsibility to more aggressively protect consumers,\" according to the letter Warren and other Democrats sent to Zelle’s parent company, criticizing it for not doing enough to combat fraud.\n\nA bank would need to conduct an investigation to determine whether a fraudster induced the transaction.\n\n\"When a consumer provides notice to a financial institution that money was stolen from the consumer’s account, the burden is on the institution to show that the transfer of funds out of the consumer’s account was authorized by the consumer,\" according to a CFPB spokesperson.\n\nConsumers, of course, experience a great deal of confusion when they are scammed and have no idea how crooks are accessing the money.\n\n\"The banks appear to be gaming the lack of clarity to deny consumer claims,\" Mierzwinski said.\n\nA fake collection call makes a migraine worse\n\nConsumers must move cautiously to protect their money. Look out for signs of fake collection calls.\n\nThe Rochester Hills woman originally reached out to me in May when I wrote about consumers who lost money to crooks who were impersonating DTE Energy.\n\nShe saw herself in that column when she reading that a Troy woman paid $700 via the mobile wallet Zelle to scammers claiming to be from DTE and an Allen Park consumer lost $376.96 via the Zelle app to a similar DTE scam.\n\nThe Rochester Hills woman was dealing with a bad migraine when she received the fake DTE call in April. She thought she's was paid up on her bills. But the caller ID said DTE. The real DTE number showed up.\n\nThe man pretending to be from DTE claimed she owed $232. He sounded helpful, giving the impression that we could get this cleared up right away.\n\nShe wanted to pay by credit card but the scammer told her to use Zelle.\n\n\"I never used Zelle. I don't know anything about it,\" said the woman, who works for a major automaker. But the app was there at the bank site.\n\n\"Once I opened it, it was ready to go,\" she said.\n\nSomehow, the crooks figured out a way to ultimately get most of her money in her checking account. They left her with $7 in checking.\n\nWhen this first happened, she contacted DTE and Bank of America. But she said she was told by Bank of America back in April after she visited a branch that she authorized this payment so it was not fraud.\n\n\"After I got home from the bank, I cried and cried,\" she told me.\n\nAnd then she got upset all over again when the bank representative on the phone told her in June that that letter was all a mistake.\n\n\"I am beyond happy,\" she said about getting the money. \"What a roller coaster of emotions these last 24 hours.\"\n\nShe is still very upset with her bank — and says she intends to close her account.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/06/26/rent-to-own-contracts-challenged-federal-court/385195001/", "title": "Rent-to-own contracts challenged in federal court", "text": "In a first-of-its-kind lawsuit, an Indianapolis housing rights group is challenging a local realty company’s rent-to-own practices, alleging predatory lending and civil rights violations.\n\nThe owner of Rainbow Realty Group denies the allegations, saying he is merely trying to sell homes to individuals who would otherwise never qualify for a traditional mortgage.\n\nOfficials at the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana say the real estate firm targets predominantly black and minority neighborhoods in a “predatory and unlawful” rent-to-own contract scheme.\n\nHomeownership mirage:How home buyers say their American dream became a nightmare\n\nYour rights:Indiana has few protections for land contract purchases\n\nThe fair housing organization filed a federal lawsuit this month against Rainbow Realty Group, Empire Holding Corp. and the companies’ owner, James R. Hotka, alleging that Hotka, through his businesses, purchased close to 1,000 homes to target minorities for unfair land sale contracts.\n\nThe complaint alleges that through Rainbow Realty, Hotka purchased dilapidated homes in Marion County, and “lured the victims into paying inflated prices and exorbitant interest rates for these run down houses,” adding that homeowners were tricked “into investing their own money and time into repairs.”\n\nAt his office on the east side, Hotka told IndyStar he is devastated that he is being accused of running a “scheme.”\n\n“These are homes that no bank would offer a traditional home mortgage on,” he said, adding that the homes would otherwise sit empty and decrease the value of other homes in neighborhoods.\n\nThe fair housing organization alleges Hotka deliberately targets minority neighborhoods “due to the historic denial of equal opportunities for good credit and homeownership, many people in minority neighborhoods are especially susceptible to this predatory scheme,” the lawsuit filed in the Southern District of Indiana alleges.\n\n“Given the condition of their houses and their reliance on deception to ensnare victims, defendants need vulnerable customers to perpetrate this scheme.”\n\nIn this case, the homebuyers were responsible for all improvements to the interior of the home, including repairs to make the home habitable. Several consumers who participated in the rent-to-own program were evicted for delinquent payment in small claims court, according to court documents.\n\nHotka says his business practice is clear — the contract is construed as a rental for the first two years with just a few hundred dollars down, and afterwards the home becomes the property of the resident.“Most of the costs for us are at the beginning of the contract,” Hotka says, adding that he charges an average 10 percent interest on a home.\n\n“I am not trying to put people in homes they can’t afford.”\n\nHotka told IndyStar that the allegations against his 45-year-old firm are “clearly untrue,” adding that roughly 2 percent of his residents, both renters and owners, are evicted per month.\n\n“We require each one of our owners to inspect their homes,” he told IndyStar.\n\nThis is not the first time Rainbow has been under scrutiny for its business practices.\n\nThen-Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller sued Rainbow Realty in 2012 for similar claims and \"for allegedly running a rent-to-buy scheme meant to avoid Indiana's landlord tenant law.\"\n\nZoeller pursued revocation of Hotka’s real estate license through an investigation with the Indiana Real Estate Commission.\n\nIn March, current Attorney General Curtis Hill took over the case and filed a motion to dismiss the request to revoke Hotka’s license.\n\nHis office would not comment on why the request was dropped.\n\nThe origins of rent-to-own\n\nRent-to-own contracts came to fruition as early as the 1950s, “when you had neighborhoods that were credit starved and couldn’t get access to (traditional mortgages),” said Amy Nelson, executive director of the Fair Housing Center of Central Indiana.\n\nNelson’s organization advocates on behalf of renters and home buyers to “ensure equal housing opportunities by eliminating housing discrimination,” according to the non-profit’s website.\n\nA representative of the National Consumer Law Center in Boston says the contracts are most often used in low-income neighborhoods and that the lawsuit against Hotka is believed to be the first to allege racial discrimination in a rent-to-own case.\n\nThe problematic aspect of rent-to-own contracts are that they can be misconstrued in court as a renters’ contractby consumers despite the resident of the home believing that they are the true owner of the property, says Sarah Mancini, a staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center.\n\n“Really what makes (rent-to-own contracts) so predatory is because it blurs the lines between renting and owning,” Mancini said.\n\nThe practice has grown substantially in the past 10 years, because after the Great Recession many people were unable to qualify for conventional mortgages, Nelson said.\n\n“In 2010 and 2011, credit was extremely tight, no one was getting a mortgage unless someone had a lot of money to put down,” Nelson said.\n\nAfter the housing market collapsed nearly a decade ago, Fannie Mae resold about 400,000 homes to investors, including more than 10,000 to firms that specialize in seller-financed deals. Some of those homes were sold in bulk transactions for pennies on the dollar.\n\nFannie Mae stopped these bulk sales in 2014, but firms continue to buy individual homes from Fannie on the open market. In all, Fannie has resold 1.2 million homes since 2009, the worst year of the crisis.\n\nA particularly troubling aspect of the contracts is that the seller enjoys the most gains when an individual is evicted from the property, Nelson said. Hotka disputes the notion.\n\n\"I lose money when people are evicted,\" he said.\n\nNelson estimates that there are roughly 12 companies that offer rent-to-own contracts in the Indianapolis area.\n\nThe future of the practice\n\nThe federal government and state agencies are taking a critical look at rent-to-own contract agreements.\n\nIn May, Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that they would cease sales of bank-owned properties to rent-to-own company Vision Property Management and its affiliates.\n\nThis month, the Wisconsin Department of Justice sued South Carolina-based Vision Property Management, which owns about 200 homes that it offers to rent or lease to low-income individuals.\n\nThe department wants Vision tobe banned from running a rent-to-own operation in Wisconsin and be ordered to refund money collected through the \"illegal rental, leasing and sale\" of its properties, according to the suit filed this month.\n\nIndianapolis City-County Councilman Zach Adamson, whose district contains tens of thousands of empty and abandoned homes, says he would like to see greater regulation of rent-to-own contracts in the state.\n\nHe said he believes the contracts are often predatory.\n\nHotka disagrees.\n\nHe said he runs a long-standing, legitimate business and wants to continue to run it as he has for the past four decades.\n\nCall IndyStar reporter Fatima Hussein at (317) 444-6209.

An online oral history presentation called “Voices of Alabama” features photos of historic sites and interviews with some of the people who worked with the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s. The state was a hotbed of the movement at the time. The parsonage where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. lived in Montgomery is included. So are other places including a home in Selma where landmark demonstrations were planned, as well as churches in Birmingham that played a role in the movement. The project, which features 20 sites total, was assembled by the New York-based World Monuments Fund and the Alabama African-American Civil Rights Heritage Sites Consortium.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Board of Education has announced high teacher turnover statewide. KTUU-TV reports 25 superintendents out of the state’s 54 school districts have been in their position for less than two years, and 13 of them began this school year. The education agency says the turnover rate for teacher, principal and superintendent positions mirrors a national trend of teachers leaving the profession without being replaced. Agency officials say they expect to have the latest data Oct. 15 on how many teachers are leaving the state. Officials say lack of competitive salaries and benefits could be the cause, and they are exploring alternative certification pathways that won’t sacrifice teacher quality. Officials say the University of Alaska Anchorage education program’s loss of accreditation could also pose problems.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state Department of Corrections urged an appeals court Tuesday to throw out a 2018 contempt-of-court ruling against now-retired Corrections Director Charles Ryan for failing to follow through on promises in a legal settlement to improve prisoner health care. Timothy Berg, an attorney representing the agency, told the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco that the judge who found Ryan in civil contempt and imposed a $1.4 million fine against the state for noncompliance didn’t have contempt powers available to enforce the nearly 5-year-old settlement. The settlement was a private agreement between the state and prisoners, not a court order enforceable through contempt powers, Berg said. The state has been dogged by complaints that it has been dragging its feet for years in complying with the settlement.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State environmental officials have approved an air permit for a Chinese company’s $1.8 billion paper mill that has been delayed by President Donald Trump’s trade dispute with China. The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality approved the permit for Sun Paper’s mill in Arkadelphia, setting emissions limits for the facility. The plant will produce liner board for cardboard boxes. Sun Paper consultant Ray Dillon says design engineering can now begin, but a construction date hasn’t been set. The project was first announced in 2016. Dillon says it will be further delayed unless the trade dispute is resolved. Stephen Bell, the Arkadelphia Area Chamber of Commerce president and chief executive officer, says a delegation from Clark County is traveling to China next month to meet with Sun Paper.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A proposal to restrict where homeless people may camp drew protest at a City Council meeting from demonstrators who fear the rules would criminalize homelessness. Councilmembers began discussion Tuesday on proposed changes to the city’s code that would prevent people from sleeping near sensitive areas such as schools or blocking right-of-ways like driveways and loading docks. During public comment, opponents voiced concerns that the restrictions would send the message that homeless people are dangerous. The meeting was briefly halted as demonstrators chanted “shame on you.” A motion to consider the changes was submitted in July. Last week, President Donald Trump visited California and blamed the state’s homelessness crisis on “liberal” policies. The council took no action and promised further discussion on the issue.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Alarmed by violence depicted in trailers for the upcoming movie “Joker,” some survivors of the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting are asking distributor Warner Bros. to commit to gun control causes. Sandy Phillips’ daughter, Jessica Ghawi, was one of 12 people killed during a midnight showing of the Batman film “The Dark Knight Rises,” also distributed by Warner Bros. Phillips and four other Aurora survivors sent a letter to Warner on Tuesday asking the studio to lobby for gun control. Phillips says she was compelled to act after seeing a trailer for “Joker,” with the Batman villain portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix in the film being released Oct. 4. Warner issued a statement later Tuesday saying it has always supported victims of gun violence and calling on policymakers to enact bipartisan legislation to address what it called an epidemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A federal appeals court has ruled that a lawsuit seeking to change the way the state counts prisoners when drawing up legislative districts can move forward. A three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on Tuesday rejected the state’s request to dismiss the lawsuit filed by the NAACP. The judges disagreed with the state’s argument that it is immune from the lawsuit. The decision upheld a ruling by a federal judge in Connecticut. The civil rights organization argues it is unfair and unconstitutional that inmates are included in the population counts of the areas where they’re imprisoned rather than their home districts. The NAACP says urban legislative districts, with larger minority populations, often lose out because there is essentially an undercount in their communities.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The U.S. Mint is now selling $1 coins that pay homage to a female astronomer from the state. Annie Jump Cannon, who developed the star-classifying system that is still used today, was born in Dover. Cannon graduated as valedictorian from Wilmington Conference Academy, which is now Wesley College, in 1880, according to the Delaware Public Archives. She went on to develop the Star Spectra system, which classifies more than 300,000 stars based on color and temperature. Cannon was the first woman to receive an honorary doctorate from Oxford University, according to the state archives. She was legally deaf. One side of the coin features a silhouette of Cannon with a backdrop of the night sky and the phrase “Classifying the Stars.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The FBI has searched the headquarters of the city’s Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs. Deputy Mayor Lucinda Babers oversees the agency and tells The Washington Post that the Tuesday search focused on the workstation of a single employee. Officials didn’t immediately identify the employee, who has since been placed on administrative leave. FBI Washington Field Office spokeswoman Melanie Lowry would only confirm there was court-authorized law enforcement activity at the agency. Babers said in a statement that the search wasn’t related to operations of the agency, which is responsible for housing code enforcement and occupational licensing. The agency has been heavily criticized since a fatal fire at an unlicensed rental row house last month.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: A police officer who was fired after arresting two 6-year-olds at their schools has a disciplinary history that includes excessive force and a racial profiling allegation. The Orlando Sentinel reports Dennis Turner had retired from the department last year and was working in the reserve unit when he arrested the students. Records released Tuesday show Turner was disciplined seven times during his 23-year tenure and was the subject of 16 citizen complaints. In one case, records show Turner stunned a trespassing suspect five times. In 2015, he was accused of asking a woman during an investigation if she was related to Saddam Hussein because her last name sounded the same. The children were arrested in separate incidents last week. The state attorney’s office said they won’t be prosecuted.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State records show that behind the elegant lobbies and brochures promising compassionate care, many senior care facilities fail to provide even a minimum level of care. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports many senior living centers in the state feature extremely thin staffing and constant turnover among low-paid staff. The failures have resulted in injuries, humiliation and even deaths. At Sunrise at East Cobb, 91-year-old World War II veteran Adam Bennett left a desperate voicemail to his daughter saying, “I’m dying. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.” After Bennett’s death, doctors discovered broken ribs, a punctured lung and a damaged kidney. Prosecutors said a caregiver had punched him repeatedly. A worker was convicted of elder neglect. In a statement, Sunrise said it has made changes at the home, including hiring new staff and retraining workers.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Conservationists have released seven Hawaiian crows, increasing the population of the critically endangered birds. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports the Hawaiian crows, or Alala, joined nearly 20 other birds released in the Big Island’s Puu Makaala Natural Forest Reserve in the past two years. The release this month was part of the Alala Project, a joint revitalization effort by the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and San Diego Zoo Global. Officials say the birds were declared extinct in the wild in 2002 but have been gradually reintroduced in groups since 2017. Officials say 11 crows were released in 2017, including one that sustained an injury and was retrieved by the Alala Project and released again this month.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Four women are suing Canyon County because they say they were paid lower wages than their male colleague, even though they all had equal or superior experience and performed the same tasks. Linda Ellis, Tracy Johnson, Rene Whitneck and Toni Kreiter filed the civil rights lawsuit Monday in Idaho’s U.S. District Court, contending they were each paid less than $25 an hour for their work as nurses at the Canyon County Jail, while the only male nurse at the jail was paid more than $31 an hour. They also said that they were required to wear scrubs, while the male nurse was allowed to wear tactical gear, and that the disparities were not the result of a seniority or merit system. Both state law and federal law make it illegal to pay an employee less for comparable work because of their sex.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Fewer bicyclists are being ticketed in the city, but most of the citations are going to riders in low-income, predominantly African American neighborhoods. The Chicago Tribune obtained figures from the police last month under the Freedom of Information Act showing bike citations dropped from more than 4,000 in 2016 to 2,196 last year. Fewer than 600 tickets were issued through late June. But the newspaper reports that over half of the citations were issued in majority African American neighborhoods on the South and West sides in 2018 and 2019, mirroring the numbers in preceding years. Transportation equity advocates say the practice of ticketing bikers in impoverished areas is “racist and discriminatory.” City officials and the state attorney general approved a police consent decree in January, heightening scrutiny on misdemeanor arrests.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Four state residents have sued the federal government over Indiana’s plan to implement work requirements for low-income residents who receive their health insurance through Medicaid. The lawsuit filed Monday in federal court comes after rulings have blocked similar work requirements in Arkansas, Kentucky and New Hampshire. Indiana’s program would require those not qualifying for exemptions to report 20 hours a month of work or related activity or face coverage loss after Dec. 31. The lawsuit filed by Indiana Legal Services and the National Health Law Program maintains the rules wrongly jeopardize health coverage for thousands of people. Gov. Eric Holcomb’s office tells The Journal Gazette the requirements are intended “to ensure Hoosiers can easily skill up, volunteer in their community or get a better-paying job.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The Slaughterhouse, a haunted attraction featuring Iowa’s own heavy metal band Slipknot, is returning to downtown. New features have been added to the Slaughterhouse – including Slipknot memorabilia, decor and themed actors – for the entirety of its 2019 season. The attraction, which opens Oct. 4 and runs through Oct. 26, is heavily influenced by the band’s legacy of heavy metal expression. General admission tickets for the Thursday-through-Sunday haunted house cost $20. Skip-the-line passes are available for $30. Exclusive merchandise bundles and tickets are on sale online. “The quality and cohesive story line make the Slaughterhouse comparable to a cinematic experience,” says Ian Miller, attraction co-founder, creative director-producer and director. “We want our guests to feel immersed as if they are walking through a favorite horror film.”\n\nKansas\n\nMerriam: A dog that spent more than 400 days at a suburban Kansas City animal shelter has found a home after a man moved into a kennel with the terrier mix and posted videos of the experience on Facebook. Staff with the Great Plains SPCA shelter in Merriam cheered as the 3-year-old dog, named Queen, left the shelter with her new owner, Tony Puluso. He told KMBC-TV that Queen is a “perfectly sweet dog.” He said he didn’t even know she was at the center of a viral campaign to find her a home. The man behind the campaign was Scott Poore, of Mission Driven Goods, which creates fundraisers for shelters. He moved in with Queen on Sept. 18, bringing with him a laptop, a desk and a small twin mattress.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Two students are suing the University of Kentucky, claiming the college is violating federal law by failing to offer women enough varsity athletics opportunities. The lawsuit says UK has to add about 183 women to its athletics programs in order to comply with Title IX, the civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded education programs. The suit was filed in federal court Wednesday morning against UK, its board of trustees, athletic director Mitch Barnhart and university President Eli Capilouto. The plaintiffs are asking the court to require UK to expand varsity-level athletics opportunities for women and increase the financial assistance it affords female athletes. They’re also seeking monetary damages.\n\nLouisiana\n\nWoodworth: State wildlife agents say a stolen cellular game camera kept sending pictures, letting them identify the man who had it. He and the man from whom he said he’d bought it were arrested. A Department of Wildlife and Fisheries statement Monday said Kurt Wiggins, 55, is accused of theft and Ernie Jenkins, 53, of possessing stolen items. Both are from Woodworth. Department spokesman Adam Einck says he doesn’t know whether either has an attorney. He says a U.S. Department of Agriculture feral hog trapper reported Sept. 16 that his game camera, mount and battery pack were stolen from a trap site in the Kisatchie National Forest near Woodworth. Einck says agents with a search warrant found the items Sept. 19 at Jenkins’ home. The camera was marked as U.S. government property.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Some voters in the state say they were tricked into signing a petition that could lead to a vote on repealing a law that eliminates religious and philosophical exemptions for childhood vaccines. The Portland Press Herald reports that voters claim to have been misled and, in some cases, lied to about the details of the petition they were signing. Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap says he cannot remove signatures under state law. However, petitioners are required to have a copy of the law they want to enact or repeal for a voter’s review. Cara Sacks, co-chair of Mainers for Health and Parental Rights, which organized the petition drive, says voters were asked to sign a petition to allow people to vote on the issue of government-mandated vaccines.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The federal government is poised to provide $76million in funding for the Chesapeake Bay Program next year, more than 10 times the amount originally allotted for the program by the Trump administration in March. A 2020 funding bill that passed a Senate appropriations subcommittee Tuesday included a $3 million increase over last year’s budget for the Environmental Protection Agency program. The allocation amounts to the first annual increase in funding for the program since fiscal year 2015. When the Trump administration proposed cutting the program by 90% in March, the move was met by bipartisan criticism. The cuts were part of a move to reduce the overall Environmental Protection Agency budget by about 30%, down to $6.1 billion.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: State regulators have approved a tightly regulated home delivery system for recreational marijuana. The Cannabis Control Commission voted 4-1 Tuesday to grant final approval for the system. Legal deliveries are scheduled to begin next year. For two years, the commission will only give delivery permits to participants in its social equity program, as well as smaller growers and businesses owned by state residents. Commissioners say it makes sense to prioritize smaller businesses because delivery programs will likely be cheaper to start than retail stores. Consumers will be required to visit a store to verify they’re over age 21 before they can place delivery orders. Delivery workers will also have to wear a body camera during customer interactions to deter theft.\n\nMichigan\n\nEscanaba: Researchers from Michigan Technological University have wrapped up their second year of work using drones to photograph native and invasive plants in the Hiawatha National Forest. The team conducted drone flights in August in the eastern half of the forest, the Escanaba Daily Press reports. The first flights were completed last year, marking the first time that drones have been used to survey the forest. Researchers are reviewing the information collected by the drones and will share their findings with the U.S. Forest Service. Jim Ozenberger, program manager for the Hiawatha National Forest’s soils, water and landscape ecology programs, says the drones are an efficient way to collect information about invasive species, particularly in coastal parts of the forest that can be difficult to access.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: A homeless man has pleaded guilty to starting a fire that destroyed a 117-year-old synagogue. Matthew Amiot, 36, entered his guilty pleas on negligent fire charges Tuesday in St. Louis County District Court. The fire destroyed the Adas Israel Synagogue on Sept. 9. Authorities say Amiot used a lighter to ignite combustible materials outside the main building, near a separate religious structure called a sukkah. The complaint says Amiot admitted starting the fire and told police he tried to spit on it to put it out but walked away when that didn’t work. Police say they don’t believe the fire was a hate crime. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 25. The Star Tribune of Minneapolis reports that prosecutors are recommending probation.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A guitar given to B.B. King for his 80th birthday has sold for $280,000 at an auction of items from the blues legend’s estate. Julien’s Auctions says the Mississippi native often used the black Gibson ES-345 prototype that was one of several guitars he called “Lucille.” Early in his career, King ran back into a burning nightclub to rescue his guitar, and he later learned the fire started when two men were fighting over a woman named Lucille. The estate auction took place Saturday, a few days after what would have been King’s 94th birthday. The 15-time Grammy winner was 89 when he died in 2015. He is buried in the small town of Indianola, Mississippi, near the community where he grew up picking cotton.\n\nMissouri\n\nOak Grove: A nonprofit that advocates for the separation of church and state alleges that a school district on the outskirts of Kansas City is forcing religion on students and has threatened to sue if it doesn’t stop. The Kansas City Star reports that Oak Grove Superintendent Bryan Thomsen says the district is investigating the claims that the Freedom From Religion Foundation made in a letter this month alleging that the district repeatedly violated the First Amendment’s establishment clause. The groups say many middle and high school teachers instruct students on the “biblical view of the creation of the world” while teaching them about evolution. The group says crosses are displayed in the district’s front office, and mandatory faculty meetings include prayer.\n\nMontana\n\nLivingston: With a Montana International Film Festival screening of their latest movie, “Robert the Bruce,” on the horizon, a group of local filmmakers is intent on making this city the Hollywood of the North. Real estate developer and area native Carter Boehm and his production company, Ponderosa Films, partnered with Livingston’s own Soundcolor Studios to build a medieval village on Boehm’s Cokedale ranch to serve as the setting for the “Braveheart” sequel starring actor Angus MacFadyen reprising his role as Robert the Bruce. The movie closed out the Montana International Film Festival, held in Billing’s Babcock Theatre, the Livingston Enterprise reports. Soundcolor Studios, led by local brothers Abram and Michael Boise, is hard at work constructing a sprawling 28-building Old Western town on land just south of Chico Hot Springs.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A major building project at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s College of Engineering is getting a $20 million boost from one of North America’s largest construction and engineering companies. University officials have announced a donation of $20 million from Pete Kiewit Sons’ Inc. The contribution will help pay for a planned $85 million engineering facility in Lincoln, to be named Kiewit Hall. The building will serve as the engineering college’s academic hub. It also will house Lincoln-based construction management programs. Bruce Grewcock, the company’s chairman and chief executive officer, says the goal is to help turn the university’s engineering program into one of the best in the country.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The University of Nevada, Reno has completed the $18 million sale of about one-tenth of its half-century-old research farm for commercial development on one of the last big, undeveloped parcels zoned for industrial-retail use within the city limits. The university plans to spend the proceeds from the 104 acres – more than $173,000 per acre – on new campus laboratories and advanced research into wetlands and range improvements for livestock. It finalized the deal Monday with Reno Land Inc., which already is building a pair of master-planned communities at a former Reno shopping center and on ranchland that was owned by casino mogul Bill Harrah. The agricultural research center along the Truckee River about 5 miles east of downtown dates to 1956.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: More than 800 families will be getting lock boxes and safe disposal bags in an effort to keep youth away from prescription drugs. Organizations that promote public health and drug abuse prevention on Tuesday announced the new initiative aimed at fighting the state’s opioid crisis. Officials from the Capital Area Public Health Network and the Rx Abuse Leadership Initiative of New Hampshire said they will be distributing the boxes and bags at community events in Concord and two dozen surrounding towns, or parents can request them directly from the organizations. They said prevention is a key part of addressing the crisis, and the new initiative builds on other programs, such as the periodic drug take-back days when police departments collect prescription medication.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The state says it has bought its 700th home under a program to acquire and demolish houses in flood-prone areas. But nearly seven years after Superstorm Sandy, not one of those purchases has been along the ocean. The state Department of Environmental Protection announced the milestone Tuesday, the purchase of a home in South River in Middlesex County. The clusters of homes bought thus far have mainly been along rivers, and some have been on or near bays, both of which are also flood-prone. The environmental protection agency did not respond to a request for comment on why no oceanfront homes have been bought under the Blue Acres program. But it has in the past said there have been no willing sellers in those areas. The program is strictly voluntary.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nChaco Culture National Historical Park: Chaco Canyon has fueled scientific curiosity for more than a century, with each discovery made at the world heritage site spurring only more questions about the people who lived there. One thing is for sure: Chocolate was part of life at the once-bustling ceremonial and economic hub. By analyzing 1,000-year-old pottery sherds, archaeologist Patricia Crown solved that mystery in recent years when she and a chemist at Hershey Co. uncovered the first evidence of chocolate consumption beyond the cacao-growing regions of Mesoamerica. That work has since shed more light on early trade routes and the widespread use of cacao in the American Southwest. Chocolate residue has been found on sherds collected in Utah, Arizona and northern Mexico. Crown is after the details now – who got to drink the frothy libations, and did the size of the mug matter?\n\nNew York\n\nSalamanca: A crumbling 3-mile stretch of the New York State Thruway that runs through Seneca Indian Nation territory will be repaired under an agreement between the state and the Senecas. The state is set to begin work on the western New York roadway Thursday. The section crossing the Senecas’ Cattaraugus Territory has fallen into dangerous disrepair amid conflict between the state and tribal leaders, including over whether New York had permission to build on Seneca territory when it constructed the 500-mile Thruway across New York in the 1950s. Seneca President Rickey Armstrong Sr. says the agreement announced Wednesday follows several days of direct communication with state officials. Thruway Authority Executive Director Matthew Driscoll says the work will begin with urgent repairs followed by full reconstruction.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nLinville: Park officials are warning visitors that black bears have been active this season at a popular camping spot. Officials at Grandfather Mountain State Park, about 120 miles northwest of Charlotte, alerted visitors last week that they may need to be prepared to “back away slowly and make lots of noise” if they encounter one of the brazen bears. Officials confirmed there have been multiple sightings reported this month. One recent report detailed that a bear even figured out how to get into “bear-proofed” food hung from a campsite tree. Park officials say that once a bear associates humans with food, it can become a “problem bear.” They added that as more people enjoy the state’s remote environments, it can put a strain on animals that live there.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s top gambling regulator says her agency needs to double in size to keep pace with the “explosion” of wagering brought on by electronic pulltabs. Charities began operating electronic pulltabs one year ago. State gaming director Deb McDaniel told the Legislature’s interim Taxation Committee on Tuesday that the popularity of the games has “put a tremendous strain” on her agency. She says the amount wagered on charitable games in the current two-year budget cycle will top $1 billion, mostly from electronic pulltabs. That’s about 75% more than the 2015-17 budget cycle. Rep. Jim Grueneich, who heads the committee studying charitable gambling taxes, says the panel will meet at least two more times before the full Legislature convenes in 2021. He says legislation likely will come from the meetings.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: It’s the year of Lafcadio Hearn. The enigmatic late-19th-century author was once celebrated across the globe, but his fame did not last outside Japan, where his writings on Japanese folklore are still taught in schools. In Cincinnati, where his career began as a reporter for the Cincinnati Enquirer and Cincinnati Commercial, Hearn is relegated to the fringe of history. That could change. The Lafcadio Hearn Society/USA is presenting a Hearn symposium at downtown’s Main Library at 1 p.m. Saturday. It’s one of many efforts to raise the awareness of Hearn on the 150th anniversary of his arrival in America. He’s the subject of a new novel, “The Sweetest Fruit” by Monique Truong, which explores Hearn through the women in his life. Also celebrating the author are a collection of his Japanese tales, a featured article in The New Yorker and plans for a plaque in Cincinnati.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt is demanding that all state agencies receive approval from his office before applying for federal grants or other outside funding. The Republican issued an executive order Tuesday requiring approval of his Secretary of Budget Mike Mazzei before any state agency, board or commission applies for a grant of more than $50,000 from a foundation or nonprofit. The threshold is increased to $100,000 for applications for federal grants. In a statement accompanying the order, Stitt says he wants to avoid pursuing short-term funds that may run out and require continuing state funds. He also says he wants to make sure the grants that agencies seek “match the vision and values of Oklahoma.” The governor’s order doesn’t apply to public colleges and school districts.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The secretary of state is preparing an effort to make her office, the state’s top elections watchdog, a nonpartisan post. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the deputy to Secretary of State Bev Clarno, Richard Vial, says they are considering it and may ask the Legislature to adopt the change that would make that happen. Of the 35 states that elect their secretaries of state, all but one is held by a politician affiliated with a specific party. In places where the secretary of state oversees elections, though, that role is increasingly contentious. Candidates frequently complain that partisan elections officials favor candidates from their own party. The secretary of state’s job is the only statewide office Republicans have held in the past 19 years.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he is now in favor of legalizing marijuana for recreational use and is asking lawmakers to consider it. Wolf’s announcement Wednesday advances his position from December, when he signaled that he was open to taking a look at it as it gathered popularity and momentum, particularly in bordering states. Before last winter, he had dismissed the idea. Wolf, a Democrat, made the announcement while releasing a report from Lt. Gov. John Fetterman’s statewide listening tour on legalizing marijuana. Wolf has long supported decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, although the Legislature hasn’t passed legislation to that effect. He signed a bill in 2016 creating Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program. He also wants lawmakers to allow the expungement of past convictions of nonviolent and small marijuana-related crimes.\n\nRhode Island\n\nExeter: State Police say they plan to create three new state police substations and close two barracks. State Police Col. James Manni says the new substations will improve public safety and ensure troopers can be closer to their patrol areas. Manni says the new substations in Jamestown, Exeter and Portsmouth are expected to open within the next six months to a year. Within the next few years, the department plans to shut down barracks in Richmond and North Kingstown and condense their operations with the already-closed Portsmouth barracks into one central-southern barracks. All those buildings are in poor physical condition. Manni says about 80 to 100 troopers and 10 detectives would work at the new barracks.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Federal officials say they’re encouraged by a test of a jamming technology some hope will help combat the threat posed by inmates with smuggled cellphones. The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday that they received “promising results” from the test conducted in April at a maximum-security South Carolina prison. Assistant Attorney General Beth Williams says it was the first time federal officials have collaborated with officials at a state prison for such a test. The test marked progress on the state level quest to stamp out cellphones, which officials have long said represent the top security threat within their institutions. Jamming technology was tested last year at a federal prison, but a decades-old law says state or local agencies don’t have the authority to jam the public airwaves.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nYankton: The Yankton Sioux Tribe won’t be getting National Guard assistance for now for flood relief efforts at Lake Andes. The South Dakota Department of Public Safety on Tuesday recommended declining the request because other options are available. However, the state says it’s willing to provide other aid. The Yankton Daily Press and Dakotan reports that flooding from Lake Andes has cut off Highway 18/50/281 east of Lake Andes. The road has been mostly closed since March. The state responded by raising the highway several feet. The road reopened for about two weeks, only to close again following more flooding two weeks ago. Tribal leaders told KSFY-TV the two rounds of flooding have taken taking a toll on members, causing mold in homes and cutting off a housing unit from town.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: For the 16th time, Goner Records will present its multiday, multivenue garage rock extravaganza, Gonerfest, this weekend. While the event has always been popular – drawing fans from all over the globe and packing out venues across Memphis – this year all-access passes sold out well in advance, as did individual tickets for Friday and Saturday night concerts at the Hi-Tone Cafe. The festival is an outgrowth of the Cooper-Young-based record label and retail store. Since launching in 2004, Gonerfest has become one of the Bluff City’s unique cultural events, expanding beyond its modest garage rock origins to include a mix of music, film and visual arts. Tickets are still available to the Thursday night opening concert, and Goner will present a series of daytime shows, starting Friday with an event at Memphis Made Brewing, which has crafted special Gonerfest beers.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Recent sunsets in the city have been tinged with a burst of purple haze that experts link to a volcano eruption three months ago in Russia. The Houston Chronicle reports the National Weather Service says chemicals and other particles are ejected into the atmosphere when a volcano erupts. Meteorologist Jimmy Fowler, with the NWS office in Galveston, says the particles causing people to see purple light rays are sulfur dioxide gas. Fowler says that the gas is not harmful and that “it just looks pretty.” A volcano in the Kuril Islands in Russia’s Sakhalin Oblast region erupted June 22. The volcano, called Raikoke, spewed ash and debris 10 miles into the sky.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Surprise, or maybe no surprise at all: Among the 50 states, Utahns drink the least beer. According to a recent Gallup poll, some 63% of American adults drink alcohol, with beer the favored beverage among them. Americans consumed an estimated 6.3 billion gallons of beer in 2018, or about 26.2 gallons per drinking-age adult. In Utah, there are both religious and legislative reasons for residents drinking less alcohol than other states. A heavy presence from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, whose beliefs require that members abstain from alcohol, almost certainly plays a major role. State laws also maintain that there can only be one bar for every 10,200 residents, meaning that with a population of just over 3 million people, Utah is only allowed to have about 300 bars in the entire state.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: State transportation officials say Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express passenger train could reach the city by 2021. The extension of the service from Rutland north to Burlington has been in the planning stages for decades while officials have upgraded the tracks and other infrastructure between the two cities. The Ethan Allen Express currently runs between Rutland and New York. Dan Delabruere of the Vermont Transportation Agency tells WCAX-TV railroad passenger platforms in Vergennes, Middlebury and Burlington need to be upgraded before the train can be extended. Delabruere says he hopes the platforms can be finished by the end of next year. Officials say the train ride from Burlington to New York will take about eight hours. Vermont officials also hope to extend the state’s other Amtrak train, The Vermonter, to Montreal.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: In an effort to save dwindling space, the Army is proposing new rules to limit who can be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Under the current rules, the cemetery would run out of space by the mid-2050s, the Army says. The proposed restrictions would preserve the cemetery’s lifespan for another 150 years. Veterans who retired from active duty and were eligible for retirement pay would no longer be automatically eligible for in-ground burial. They would be eligible, though, for above-ground “inurnment” of cremated remains. Those who were killed in action or received awards such as the Purple Heart or Silver Star could still receive an in-ground burial. U.S. presidents and vice presidents also would retain eligibility. The proposed rules will now be subjected to the federal rulemaking process and published in the Federal Register.\n\nWashington\n\nSalem: State authorities have identified an unprecedented pest that could defoliate forests in the region. The Capital Press reports the state Department of Agriculture has announced likely plans to mount an air assault to eradicate the Hokkaido gypsy moth. Department officials say they have asked the governor’s office for $176,000 in state funds to spray and trap the potentially new and destructive pest to see if a population is developing. Authorities say the first Hokkaido moth ever detected in the U.S. was caught by the department in July in southwest Snohomish County. Authorities say the moths are mobile and eat a wide variety of plants and trees. Officials say the department currently traps Asian and European gypsy moths each year to keep them from defoliating forests.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A federal judge has ordered companies owned by West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice to pay $35 million over a lawsuit accusing them of violating a mining contract. U.S. District Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove in Kentucky on Monday ordered the Kentucky Fuel Corp. and the James C. Justice Cos. to pay the sum. The lawsuit was filed by the New London Tobacco Market and Five Mile Energy. They are accusing the Justice companies of failing to pay mining royalty payments and retainer fees. The ruling includes roughly $17 million in damages, $17 million for royalties and $1 million in retainer fees. A lawyer for Justice’s companies says they plan to appeal the judge’s ruling.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bipartisan state legislative task force reversed course Wednesday by recommending the faster release of funding for a suicide prevention hotline after it had initially called for the Legislature to pass a bill to award the money, which would take much longer. The fight over the $110,000 annual grant has broken down over partisan lines, even as Democrats and Republicans on the suicide prevention task force managed to agree on a host of other recommendations to reduce the number of suicides in Wisconsin. Democrats – including four who served on the task force – said the group’s recommendations weren’t meaningful because they didn’t include the passage a “red flag” law through which judges could temporarily take away firearms from people deemed to be suicidal or a risk to others.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Some $1.7 million for job training and other career assistance will continue to be available for workers laid off from the state’s coal industry. Gov. Mark Gordon announced Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Labor grant funding set to expire Sept. 30 will still be available to the state through June 2021. Coal industry workers who’ve lost their jobs due to layoffs are eligible for tuition assistance and other career help through the Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce Economic Revitalization grant program. Gordon says the funding comes at a critical time for Wyoming. Some 600 workers have been furloughed since Milton, West Virginia-based Blackjewel filed for bankruptcy July 1, and the company closed two major Wyoming coal mines.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/29/beggars-night-stranger-hotel-stays-haunted-history-news-around-states/49302057/", "title": "Beggars' Night, 'Stranger' hotel stays: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Special tours Friday at Old Alabama Town, an otherwise charming group of restored 19th- and 20th-century structures, aim to show the frightful side of history. “It’s interwoven with character stories, as well as the history of the buildings and the people,” said Ella Martin, special events coordinator for Landmarks Foundation of Montgomery, who will be one of the tour guides for the Haunting at Old Alabama Town. Tickets are $25 at landmarksfoundation.com. There is limited space, and no tickets will be sold at the door. Tours will go through 10 buildings in Old Alabama Town’s Living Block, starting in Lucas Tavern, where guests be greeted by the ghost of Eliza Lucas, who ran the establishment. From there, a guide will lead guests to the Yancey dogtrot home, where Southern secession leader William Lowndes Yancey – the man Abraham Lincoln held responsible for the Civil War – lived and died. One of the darker stops will be Dr. Duncan’s office. “People were dying. Death was prevalent,” Martin said. “It’ll be a little scary because he’ll have his amputation kit and tell what he had to do take care of people since there weren’t any antibiotics around.” There’s also a gruesome story of a teenage horse rider from the Martin-Barnes House, whose life ended after being impaled on a fence. “He didn’t come home for supper,” Martin said. “He’ll be around to give his story. We’ll have a real horse there with its ghostly rider.” The tours are family-friendly but rated PG-13.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: An impromptu fundraiser to allow a library to purchase books amid cries of censorship has twice surpassed its goal. The fund was established after the Kenai City Council delayed accepting a $1,500 grant until the library director provide a list of the books that would be purchased with the money. The grant was intended to buy library materials related to health and wellness, including mental health, suicide prevention, self-care, and reference books about Medicare and Medicaid, the Peninsula Clarion reports. The council asked Kenai Community Library Director Katja Wolfe to provide an inventory of proposed purchases to be funded by the Collection Equity Award grant, from Region 5 of the Network of the National Library of Medicine. Kenai Peninsula residents Sovala Kisena and Todd Smith said they organized the crowdsourcing page to raise funds for the library and act as a positive response to the council’s action. “It’s the definition of censorship … and it bothered me,” Smith said. Before the council voted to postpone action at its Oct. 20 meeting, one resident questioned whether any of the books would be about the coronavirus, the Clarion reports. Another said he took particular issue with the term “equity” in the name of the award and asked if the grant would be “enhancing some sort of a federal agenda … which would not necessarily represent the views of the people of Kenai.” “I think equity can create division,” Peck said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, which is facing a spike in COVID-19 cases, is prohibiting trick-or-treating and haunted houses on Halloween. COVID-19 cases are up 140% over this time last year, according to an emergency declaration signed by community President Martin Harvier and posted on the community’s Facebook page. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community has land adjacent to Scottsdale, Tempe, Fountain Hills and Mesa. The community was created in 1879 and represents two pre-American tribes: the Pima and Maricopa, according to the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community appears to be the first jurisdiction in Arizona to publicly ban trick-or-treating. Arizona health experts are advising that people who do go out on Halloween to take precautions. Banner Health, the state’s largest health system, advises people who do choose to take part in the tradition this year to remain outside and avoid crowds, such as Halloween parties. Children should also use hand sanitizer or wash their hands with soap and water after they get home and before they eat any treats, Banner Health officials said. Also, they should try to keep 6 feet away from anyone who doesn’t live with them.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state filed a consumer protection lawsuit Wednesday against a medical supplier for nearly $11 million for failing to deliver supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said. Rutledge said Wednesday that Med-Care Healthlink LLC of Suffolk, Virginia, and its representatives failed to deliver gowns, ventilators and face shields ordered in March and April 2020 to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. “This had been a company the state had worked with previously, and so therefore there was no reason to believe at that point that we would have something this significant occur,” Rutledge said. A phone call to the company rang unanswered. Deputy Attorney General Shannon Halijan said state officials were told at various times that the supplies had been bought by another entity, were held in China or were in other states. UAMS attorney Sherri Robinson said the company initially responded to questions about the supplies, then stopped after four to six months. UAMS ordered 1.5 million medical gowns and 60 ventilators, while the state ordered 2.5 million gowns, 500 ventilators and 1 million medical face shields, Rutledge said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nTahoe City: Drought fueled by climate change has dropped Lake Tahoe below its natural rim and halted flows into the Truckee River, a historically cyclical event that’s occurring sooner and more often than in the past, raising fears about what might be in store for the famed alpine lake. Scientists are concerned that the growing frequency of low-water extremes may become the new normal. They point to seasonal shifts in weather patterns causing precipitation that historically falls as snow to arrive in the form of rain atop the Sierra along the California-Nevada state line. “Our summers are lasting longer. Springs are coming sooner,” said Gregory Schladow, a water resource and environmental engineering professor who is the founding director of the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center. Over the past century, the amount of precipitation falling as snow has declined from 52% in 1910 to 33% in 2020 and is projected to drop below 20% by the end of the century, according to experts at the research center. Rain runs off the mountains instead of piling up as snow on mountaintops for safe storage until it is most needed in late spring and summer – the high Sierra equivalent of leaving a freezer door open atop a refrigerator. Since summer, boat ramps have been closed. Docks sit precariously above the receding lake’s dry bottom. Boat and kayaking rentals have fallen, and river rafting operations on the Truckee River had to end early. “Our season was short, and we fear there may not be one next summer,” said Toni Rudnick of the Truckee River Raft Company.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A federal judge has issued a restraining order against a suburban Denver county’s policy allowing parents to opt their children out of a mask mandate at school, finding that the rule violates the rights of students with disabilities who are vulnerable to COVID-19. U.S. District Judge John L. Kane on Tuesday called the Douglas County Board of Health order that allowed parents to opt their children out of mask-wearing a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which guarantees equal access to education for all. Kane’s order came in a hearing about a lawsuit filed by the Douglas County School District challenging the county Board of Health order. The school district, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of nine children with disabilities, argued that the board’s action allowed a relaxation of universal masking that placed those students at high risk of severe disease, The Denver Post reports. The school district also challenged the Board of Health’s relaxation of quarantine rules affecting students suspected of having the coronavirus. Kane’s order is not the end of the legal challenge, even though it sets aside the opt-out rule for now, and he set a Nov. 8 hearing about the case.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: An early 18th-century painting depicting Yale University’s namesake with an enslaved Black child has been returned to public display at one of its museums even as art experts investigate its origins and amid campus discussions about the school’s ties to slavery. The nearly life-size, oil-on-canvas portrait shows Elihu Yale and family members sitting at a table with tobacco pipes and wine glasses, while an enslaved boy with a metal collar locked around his neck looks on. In the background are playing children, believed to be Yale’s grandchildren. The Yale Center for British Art removed the painting from display in October 2020 to conduct a technical analysis, which continues and includes efforts to identify the boy, as well as to confirm the identities of the others. Over the years, some patrons expressed concerns about the depiction of an enslaved child, but that was not a reason for removing it, said Courtney Martin, the center’s director. For several months, the painting was replaced by a 2016 work of art by Titus Kaphar that included a portrait of just the enslaved boy, without the metal collar, on top of what appears to be a crumpled version of the original painting. There is no evidence Elihu Yale owned slaves. His papers, including financial records, have not been found. But experts believe Yale oversaw slave trading and other commerce in India. There are other paintings showing Yale with slaves, and his relatives in New Haven were slave owners, researchers say.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Delaware Art Museum is reprising an exhibition 50 years after its premiere, in the wake of a nearly yearlong occupation of the city by the National Guard. National Guardsmen focused primarily on West Center City, a mostly Black community, after rioting and unrest following Dr. Martin Luther King’s murder. The trauma of those nine months in 1968 left the community reeling, and Percy Ricks, an artist and longtime educator, had something he thought people needed to see: a momentous exhibition of drawings, paintings, prints and photographs created by 66 Black artists. Ricks, the first Black art instructor in Wilmington’s public schools, was a driving force behind the city’s art scene. He went on to found arts and humanities collective Aesthetic Dynamics Inc., which aimed to highlight Black artists and their contributions to the arts. Still, the organization’s inaugural exhibition struggled to find a home as Black artists were shut out of institutions and as segregation persisted across Delaware. It eventually premiered at the Wilmington Armory but has largely been forgotten and overlooked by historians and institutions. Now, the Delaware Art Museum – which at the time overlooked requests to stage the exhibition – is trying to reconcile its initial disregard and to illustrate the cultural legacy Ricks left behind.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Earlier this month, a federal judge held two top officials from the D.C. Department of Corrections in contempt over a delay in handing over medical records for a Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendant. Now, the Department of Justice says he appears to have “invented” the emergency that led to that decision, WUSA-TV reports. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth hauled D.C. Jail Warden Wanda Patten and D.C. Department of Corrections Director Quincy Booth into court Oct. 13 to explain why the jail hadn’t complied with his order the prior week to turn over an orthopedic specialist’s notes about a hand surgery for Christopher Worrell. The Florida man has been in D.C. Jail custody since his arrest in March on multiple felony charges in connection with the insurrection, accused of joining other members of the Proud Boys in storming the U.S. Capitol and assaulting federal officers with pepper gel spray. In May, Worrell fell in his cell and broke his pinky finger. In filings, he claimed officials didn’t get him the proper medical treatment, and he’d need surgery because of the delay. On Wednesday, the Justice Department said a Howard University Hospital doctor determined Worrell’s hand had already healed normally, and he was suffering no pain or loss of function. Prosecutors said his records show he was “primarily dissatisfied with the appearance of his pinky finger” and demanded surgery even after the doctor told him the risks could outweigh the benefits.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state has withheld funding from two school districts over their coronavirus mask mandates, flouting threats from White House officials who warned that such penalties would violate federal law. School officials in Alachua and Broward counties on Wednesday said the state docked school board salaries and overall funding in amounts equal to federal aid packages meant to blunt the state’s sanctions on mask requirements. This month, more than $164,000 was withheld from the Alachua school district, and more than $455,000 was withheld from Broward. The penalties are the latest development in an ongoing feud between the White House and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration over coronavirus regulations. The Florida State Board of Education earlier this month approved plans to withhold a month’s salary from school board members in districts with classroom mask requirements and reduce overall funding if those counties receive a federal grant intended to offset the state’s fines. The announcements come days after the U.S. Department of Education sent a letter to Florida warning that deducting money from districts that received the grant would violate federal law. The letter added that the federal government “is prepared to initiate enforcement action to stop these impermissible state actions.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A high school is marking its new name and a larger building after students said the old name was offensive and pushed to remove it. Midtown High School hosted a ceremony this week to highlight the new name of the former Henry W. Grady High School, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Students had complained for years that their school was named after Grady, a newspaper editor who advocated for white supremacy after the Civil War. While credited by many with helping in the rebirth of Atlanta after the war, Grady also wrote editorials and gave speeches that ignored the plight of Black people in the region. Grady was an editor and part-owner of The Atlanta Constitution.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Starting next week, the city will allow outdoor and indoor entertainment venues to operate at full capacity with vaccinated attendees, the mayor said Wednesday as he announced the latest measures easing coronavirus restrictions. Patrons will have to wear masks, Mayor Rick Blangiardi said at a news conference. No food will be allowed, only water, he said. The change will take effect Nov. 3, in time for the next University of Hawaii football home game a few days later, when the Warriors host San Jose State. Blangiardi said the city plans to allow the Honolulu Marathon to go ahead Dec. 12, though the race will be required to stagger runners’ starting times. Competitors will leave the starting line in groups of no more than 200 people at a time, he said. He expressed confidence that the city was ready to relax its rules, noting Honolulu has one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country. As of Wednesday, 95% of the population 12 and older had received at least one shot. The mayor said the city still has public safety and public health at top of mind, and it will be ready to tighten restrictions again if COVID-19 hospitalization metrics deteriorate. “This is about going forward and living with it,” the mayor said of the virus.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The company that successfully brought genetically modified potatoes to the market announced an agreement Thursday to help a plant breeding company grow strawberries they say will stay fresh longer and have a longer growing season. J.R. Simplot Co. and California-based Plant Sciences Inc., both privately held companies, said they expect to launch the first commercially available, gene-edited strawberries within a few years. U.S. growers produced $2.2 billion in strawberries in 2020, mostly in California, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But consumers discarded an estimated 35% of the crop due to spoilage. Simplot and Plant Sciences officials said genetically modified strawberries will help reduce waste and make them available to consumers much of the year. The strawberries will only contain genes from strawberries, selecting desirable traits that have been cultivated over decades. “It’s the same technology we’re working on with potatoes,” said Doug Cole, director of Marketing and Biotech Affairs at Simplot. There is no evidence that genetically modified organisms, known as GMOs, are unsafe to eat, but changing the genetic code of foods presents an ethical issue for some. Federal agencies approved a previous gene-modifying technique on Simplot potatoes. Now, more than 1.1 billion pounds of the potatoes are sold in some 40 states and 4,000 supermarkets and 9,000 restaurants.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state Senate on Thursday night approved a weakened and criticized plan to preserve ramifications for those who refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Democrats who control both houses of the General Assembly struggled through caustic debate all week in pushing a COVID-19 carve-out of the Illinois Health Care Right of Conscience Act. The Senate endorsed the plan 31-24 on the last day of the Legislature’s fall session. Initially approved in the 1970s to protect physicians from repercussions for refusing, based on religious beliefs, to perform abortions, supporters argue the law was never intended to give similar protections to people who refuse to get a preventive shot in a worldwide pandemic. “Your right to exercise your religious belief is not always without consequence, and the Health Care Right of Conscience is not a defense in certain circumstances,” Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said during floor debate. “You’ve asked where we draw the line. The line of my personal liberty ends at the beginning of your nose.” Lawsuits have sprung up – nine alone in which Gov. J.B. Pritzker or other public agencies are defendants – in which repercussions, such as losing a job, are being contested based on the right of conscience law. The proposal, which now goes to Pritzker, doesn’t require anyone to be vaccinated. It targets the law’s language prohibiting retribution, such as dismissal from a job, in the case of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: A hotel offers guests a chance to enter the “Upside Down” with themed accommodations based on the Netflix series “Stranger Things,” set in the fictional Indiana town of Hawkins. Entering Graduate Bloomington yields a few subtle hints. The hotel’s ground floor mixes framed Eggo waffle art and a photo of the faded Starcourt Mall facade with older references to famous Hoosiers and pop culture. Its restaurant, Poindexter, offers an Upside Down burger and Demogorgon smoothie on the menu. And on the third floor, spaces once occupied by rooms 318 and 320 now house the “Upside Down Experience,” a suite with detailed recreations of two key settings from the sci-fi hit. The suite’s showstopper is an alphabet and Christmas light wall, like the one Winona Ryder’s character, Joyce Byers, uses to communicate with her captured son, Will. The Wheelers’ basement serves as the suite’s bedroom, complete with a Dungeons and Dragons game. General Manager Corey Parton said the suite, which opened to the public Tuesday, is meant to be an immersive experience. Guests are loaned Polaroid cameras for an ’80s documentation of their visits, as well as Eleven’s Eggo Extravaganza – a recreation of the main character’s iconic meal of three waffles doused in whipped cream and candy. A stay also includes two passes to the nearby WonderLab Science Museum, as a nod to the main characters’ love for science. Graduate also donates 11% of the suite’s profits to WonderLab.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Beggars’ Night is nearly here. Trick-or-treaters in the city go out Oct. 30, not Oct. 31, in a quirky tradition started about 80 years ago to curb the violence and vandalism that had become an annual problem. In the 1930s, a long list of teenage miscreants who’d spent the night soaping windows, setting fires and tossing bricks at homes was published every year in the Nov. 1 newspaper. Kathryn Krieg, then the director of recreation for the Des Moines Playground Commission (now the Parks and Recreation Department), proposed naming Oct. 30 “Beggars’ Night” and sending children out to perform for homeowners after saying “tricks-for-eats.” Children were to receive a treat “only if such a ‘trick’ as a song, a poem, a stunt or a musical number, either solo or in group participation, is presented.” The event reversed the conventional tradition of asking homeowners to provide a treat to avoid being tricked or pranked. Beggars’ Night gained traction and in 1942 was promoted as a way for children to play a part in the war effort. The rallying headline “Kids! - Don’t help the Axis on Halloween” topped an Oct. 29, 1942, Des Moines Register article. It also chided teenagers for soaping windows, saying that “soap wasted … means waste of an ingredient used in manufacture of high explosives.”\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: Construction on a national laboratory to study diseases that can be spread from animals to humans has been delayed, federal officials said. Officials said earlier this year that the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan would be substantially completed by this October. Now, the construction is expected to finish next spring, with commission of the laboratory in the summer, The Manhattan Mercury reports. The Department of Homeland Security and the United States Department of Agriculture are collaborating on opening the facility. A Homeland Security official said technology upgrades and equipment installation are taking longer than expected. “The technology efficacy of the building is of the utmost importance and is a critical aspect of standing up this facility,” Tim Barr, NBAF program manager for Homeland Security, said in a statement. “We are testing individual systems and testing again as systems are integrated with other systems, so it is very difficult to predict how long it will take to ensure each system is working as intended given the complexities of the facility.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture began managing operations and maintenance in the facility earlier this month.\n\nKentucky\n\nHazard: The superintendent of Hazard Independent Schools said that “appropriate disciplinary action has been taken” after photos surfaced showing students giving lap dances to staff and wearing scant clothing as part of Hazard High School’s homecoming week festivities. Students and staff took part in a “Man Pageant” and “Costume Day” on Tuesday, according to Hazard High School’s Facebook page. Photos that were subsequently taken down from the athletics department’s Facebook page showed students in underclothing giving lap dances to faculty and staff, including Principal Donald “Happy” Mobelini, who is also mayor of the Perry County city. Other photos on the athletics page that also were later taken down showed female students dressed up in “Hooters” outfits and students and staff appearing to paddle one another. Mobelini, the principal and mayor, did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday. “Um. Exactly what is going on here, y’all? C’mon Hazard,” Nema Brewer, cofounder of education advocacy group KY 120 United, wrote Tuesday night in a tweet that showed the lap dance photos. “Get it together.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Violence at a high school has stopped since a group of fathers started patrolling the campus, and the dads are aiming to expand their initiative into a movement across the parish. “Dads on Duty” started in response to a series of fights at Southwood High School in September that led to the arrests of about two dozen students. Michael LaFitte gathered other parents after a Sept. 17 incident to form a strategy for combating violence at the school. Expected to meet for 45 minutes that weekend, the group solidified a plan four hours later. “At the end of the meeting, there was a group of fathers who decided to just go to the school and patrol and walk around and show a strong male presence on the campus,” LaFitte said. “I don’t care how old you are or what size you are – it’s something about seeing a man, a positive male figure, a father, your daddy or whatever you want to call them, at the school. It will make you straighten up and fly right.” On the Monday after the meeting, a group of fathers showed up before the 7:30 a.m. bell to usher students inside. Dads have been there every morning since, with about 40 now taking shifts to patrol during lunch and after school, too. They’ve tried to assume the roles of “cool uncles” to the students, according to LaFitte. He said there have not been any fights on campus since they started.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Forestry officials are asking residents who want to decorate for the fall and winter to be on the lookout for common invasive plants. The plants are sometimes used in wreaths and garlands and other decorations, according to the Maine Department of Agricultural, Conservation and Forestry. State law prohibits the import or sale of invasive plants in any form. The forestry department said the most common invasive plants in the decorations are Asiatic bittersweet and multiflora rose. The plants can cause environmental damage and overtake forests, wetlands and backyards. The state said the plants are also difficult to control and can re-sprout after being cut. It’s asking decorators to use native species, such as winterberry holly, red twig dogwood and American mountain ash.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: The city will move forward with its plans for a multimillion-dollar indoor sports facility, despite calls to slow down the project. The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to enter into an agreement with Eastern Sports Management to develop the structure, along with authorizing city staff members to prepare a demolition contract for Municipal Stadium, which sits on the property where the structure will be built. The money will come from the city’s fiscal year 2021 general fund surplus. Early estimates for the new indoor turf facility were around $7 million, but it is now estimated to cost between $10 million and $20 million, according to city officials. The city will be responsible for tearing down Municipal Stadium, which will cost about $100,000.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A hospital says someone hacked into its employee email system, potentially exposing the personal information of thousands of patients. UMass Memorial Health notified patients earlier this month if their information was involved in the breach, which occurred between June 2020 and January. The personal data included Social Security numbers, insurance information and medical information. More than 200,000 patients and health plan participants could have been affected by the breach, according to a federal database of cybersecurity incidents at medical facilities. The hospital said it had investigated the incident but couldn’t determine how much of the personal information might have been stolen. Affected patients will receive free credit monitoring and data protection assistance.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state Supreme Court has agreed to take another look at a law that allows communities to collect millions of dollars from poor criminal defendants to pay salaries, keep lights on, and wax floors in courthouses up and down the state. The issue is whether it’s unconstitutional, especially when a judge knows a conviction will bring in cash and please local officials who count on the money to ease budget pressures. The Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday saying it would hear arguments in a case from Alpena County. Travis Johnson was ordered to pay $1,200 in local court costs for a pair of convictions. The court especially wants to hear whether the law “deprives criminal defendants of their right to appear before an impartial judge.” A judge can order people convicted of crimes to pay a portion of a court’s operating costs, such as salaries, utilities and other services. Someone who is acquitted doesn’t get a bill for overhead, nor do parties in a civil lawsuit. If prosecutors lose a case, money isn’t deducted from their budget. From 2016 through 2019, courts collected $172 million, nearly 75% of it in district courts, which handle traffic tickets, drunken driving cases and other misdemeanors mostly committed by people who can least afford it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A judge has denied a defense request to dismiss the most serious charge against a former suburban police officer who said she meant to use a Taser instead of a handgun when she fatally shot Black motorist Daunte Wright. Former Brooklyn Center police Officer Kim Potter will stand trial in Hennepin County on first- and second-degree manslaughter charges in the death of Wright, who was shot after being stopped April 11 for a traffic violation. Potter, who is white, was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter, which requires a finding that she acted with “culpable negligence” in Wright’s death. Prosecutors later added a first-degree manslaughter count against Potter, alleging she recklessly handled a firearm and endangered Wright’s safety when death or great bodily harm was reasonably foreseeable. In allowing the first-degree manslaughter charge, Hennepin County Judge Regina Chu said Wednesday that she only had to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and make a finding of “probable cause,” meaning it was more probable than not that a crime was committed. She noted the state will have a much higher burden of proving the crime beyond a reasonable doubt during a trial, the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Two new lawsuits claim hundreds of children have been exposed to dangerous lead levels through the drinking water in the capital city, which has been facing water system problems for years. One lawsuit represents one child, while the other has hundreds of children as plaintiffs. The suits, filed last week in federal court in Jackson, say the city and the state Health Department have made “conscience-shocking decisions and have shown deliberate indifference that have led to Plaintiffs’ exposure to toxic lead in Jackson’s drinking water.” One of the attorneys who filed the lawsuits, Corey M. Stern, has represented people who sued over tainted water in Flint, Michigan. Attorneys for Jackson are reviewing the lawsuits, and “the city will eventually have a response,” city spokesman Justin Vicory said. The lawsuits seek unspecified amounts of money for punitive damages and compensatory damages, plus attorneys’ fees and “other relief the Court deems appropriate.” Jackson has about 160,000 residents, and the city has long-standing problems with water quality and distribution. Since July 1, Jackson has been under a safe drinking water consent order with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which sets a schedule for work on water treatment facilities and delivery systems.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mark McCloskey said he does not support allowing abortions for young girls who become pregnant through rape or incest. McCloskey, a St. Louis personal injury lawyer who gained national attention after he and his wife waved guns at racial injustice protesters last summer, made the remarks last week at a forum in Osage Beach. “I’ve got a client who was raped by an uncle when she was 13 years old, had the child; she finished high school, finished college and got a master’s degree,” McCloskey said. “That child she would have aborted finished high school, finished college and now has a master’s degree. … I don’t believe in any exceptions.” McCloskey did not specifically address whether he would support an abortion to save the life of the mother, The Kansas City Star reports. He said it has always bothered him that people who oppose the death penalty often support abortion rights. “The justices of the Supreme Court in the most heinous crimes don’t have the right to decide who should live and die,” he said. “But every 13-year-old girl on the street should be able to decide the fate of the life of their child?” The subject of abortion exceptions famously sank the U.S. Senate campaign of another Missouri candidate in 2012. Asked if he supported abortions for women who were raped, Republican nominee Todd Akin, who died this month, responded: “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A commission created to allocate federal COVID-19 relief funding to help stabilize the state’s economy recommended Wednesday that the governor allocate $4 million to help recruit new medical workers to Montana. But members rejected a proposal to spend $13 million on retention bonuses for existing hospital workers. The health care worker recruitment program would allow health care providers to cover up to $12,500 in moving expenses for new hires, along with another up to $4,300 to cover the taxes on that payment, said Scott Mendenhall, the state’s new American Rescue Plan Act program director. The program could recruit another 238 medical employees to the state, which has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases since mid-July. New workers would have to remain in their jobs in Montana for at least a year, or they would have to repay the money, Mendenhall said. Democratic House Minority Leader Kim Abbott, a member of the committee, argued the proposal overlooked members of the existing health care workforce, who are stressed and frustrated by seeing traveling workers receiving more pay than they receive. Abbott proposed recommending that the state set aside $13 million in federal relief funding for retention bonuses for employees of inpatient hospitals who stuck with their jobs during the pandemic.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s largest and oldest prison lost running water because of a plumbing issue, forcing inmates and staffers to use bottled water and portable toilets and raising concerns about conditions at the facility. Officials at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln said they had to shut off the water Tuesday when they discovered numerous leaks in the facility’s old, brittle pipes. Laura Strimple, a spokeswoman for the state corrections department, said in an email Thursday that crews had restored water service to the prison. State Sen. Terrell McKinney visited the prison Wednesday and said he saw toilets filled with human waste. He said he was told prisoners were getting two water bottles a day, but some complained that they had only received one, and a few prisoners were using mop buckets to shower. “From what I saw, it was horrible,” McKinney said. “You could smell it when you walked in.” Prison officials said the problem demonstrates the need for a new, $230 million facility proposed by Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts. But some state lawmakers, including McKinney, an Omaha Democrat, argue that a new prison isn’t necessary, especially when other states are closing prisons to save money.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Tourists are returning, events are expanding, and a wave of wagering is washing over the state, where a September casino winnings report showed gambling at pre-pandemic levels. Casinos statewide took in almost $1.2 billion in house winnings in September, the Nevada Gaming Control Board reported Wednesday. The figure marked seven straight months of $1 billion or more – one short of a record eight-month streak set in late 2006 and early 2007, before the Great Recession. Tourism officials in Las Vegas reported separately that hotel occupancy increased to 73% last month and that more than 2.9 million people visited the region, down 15% from the same month in 2019 but up 72% from 1.7 million in September 2020. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority characterized the month as a “stabilization” and noted that nightly hotel room rates have climbed to the highest during the “pandemic era,” to an average of $155. Increased vehicle traffic on Interstate 15 at the California-Nevada border reflected a return of domestic tourists, but regular international air travel has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Federal authorities have set vaccination requirements for foreign, non-immigrant adults flying to the U.S. beginning Nov. 8.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Executive Council on Wednesday approved using federal funds to boost COVID-19 vaccination efforts in a vote that involved much less drama – and money – than previous requests. Two weeks ago, the Republican-led council that approves state contracts turned down $27 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over concerns that language in the grants would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. More than 100 vaccine-mandate opponents packed the room, and nine were arrested for interrupting the meeting. But protestors were absent Wednesday when the the council unanimously voted to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funding to help community health centers and regional public health networks set up school-based and community vaccination clinics. “This will be an additional resource that is needed,” Republican Councilor Joe Kenney said. But Cinde Warmington, the lone Democrat on the council, noted that using the ARPA funds instead of the CDC money diverts money that could have been used for other programs. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette agreed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOceanport: Netflix has confirmed it will enter the bidding for a 289-acre tract of Fort Monmouth, where it hopes to create a mix of soundstages, post-production buildings and backlot sets. Gov. Phil Murphy supports Netflix’s bid, according to an account in The New York Times, the first to report on the development. In a statement to the Asbury Park Press on Tuesday, Netflix said: “America’s first movie studio was in New Jersey, and today it’s home to many talented people working in entertainment.” The world’s first film studio was part of Thomas Edison’s laboratories in West Orange – now part of the U.S. National Park Service. Years later, but before the motion picture industry moved to the warmer and stable climate of Los Angeles, the capital of American filmmaking was Fort Lee. Fort Monmouth was formerly the base for the U.S. Signal Corps and over its long, nearly 100-year history contributed to many technological advances. Radar was developed at the fort, and it was the first place to bounce an electronic signal off the moon. The fort closed in 2011 and has been undergoing redevelopment and a return to private hands. Prospective purchasers have until Jan. 12 to submit a proposal to buy what is called the Mega Parcel, which sits in parts of Eatontown and Oceanport.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: School bus drivers in the city have gone on strike, shutting down much of the public school transportation system that serves 3,500 students. Current drivers picketed the office of southern New Mexico district school bus contractor STS New Mexico on Thursday, demanding better pay and working conditions. Bus driver shortages have strained schools across the state as education officials struggle to hire and train more workers. Some offer free training, signing bonuses and other perks for new employees. The shortage has led the company to push mechanics into driving service, meaning there aren’t mechanics to fix buses when they break down, a bus driver union representative said. “We’re just going to do the best that we can do,” STS General Manager Van Wamel said. “This shift in focus is unfortunate, but we are confident that it is temporary,” Las Cruces Public Schools Superintendent Ralph Ramos said in a statement. District officials told parents by text message Thursday to “please make alternative transportation arrangements if possible.” District spokeswoman Kelly Jameson said special education students with transportation specified in their individualized learning plans won’t be affected by the strike.\n\nNew York\n\nMechanicville: A furry, four-legged scourge is wreaking havoc on a Hudson Valley town’s water supply, forcing local officials to scramble to keep up. The culprits are a family of beavers that has been building dams near Mechanicville, impeding the flow of water from the primary stream that empties into the small reservoir on which the town depends for drinking water. “I wouldn’t call it a fight. I call it a very challenging opponent, and we play a game of chess,” Mechanicville Public Works Commissioner Anthony Gotti told the Albany Times-Union. “I take his dam down. I’ve got to figure out where he goes next.” Towns like Mechanicville, about 20 miles up the Hudson River from Albany, don’t have the luxury of relying on large reservoirs fed by numerous tributaries. That has made the problem more pressing, as beavers are capable of building a dam in as little as two nights that can slow water flow and create algae in the reservoir. The challenge is complicated by the fact that the dams, which consist of tightly wound branches secured by mud and leaves, usually must be removed by hand, as work crews can’t bring heavy equipment into the forest without building a road, the Times-Union reports. The beaver, a protected species, became New York state’s official mammal in the 1970s and was once nearly extinct.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and his brother-in-law are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for potential insider trading – a case that stems from their abrupt sales of financial holdings during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, according to recent federal court filings. Burr, a Republican, is among several lawmakers from both parties who faced outrage over their aggressive trading in early 2020, before the economic threat from the virus was widely known. That fueled accusations that the members of Congress were acting on inside information gained through their official duties to benefit financially, which is illegal under a law known as the STOCK Act. Burr was previously investigated by the Trump administration’s Justice Department for offloading $1.6 million from his portfolio in January and February 2020. The department cleared him of wrongdoing almost a year later – on Jan. 19, Donald Trump’s last full day in office. But the SEC continued to investigate Burr, according to court documents filed in the Southern District of New York that were first made public last week. The agency enforces federal securities law. Attorneys for Burr as well as for Gerald Fauth, the brother of Burr’s wife, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Burr has previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A lawmaker was barred from boarding a flight at Minot International Airport this week after a run-in with a security agent during a pat-down. Republican state Rep. Jeff Hoverson said he and his wife were planning to travel Monday for their anniversary. He said a Transportation Security Administration agent said he was going to give him a pat-down but did not ask permission. Hoverson said he moved the agent’s hand away. TSA said in a statement that the pat-down was initiated when Hoverson set off the alarm in the screening machine. The agency said Hoverson objected during the pat-down and called the police. He eventually complied, but the airline made the decision to deny boarding, TSA said. Hoverson said everyone overreacted, including himself. A pastor who’s among the most far-right legislators in the GOP-controlled Legislature, he introduced legislation last session to repeal mask mandates in the state. He also unsuccessfully sponsored legislation that would make it a felony to help women get abortions, including by giving them rides to abortion clinics. And as a freshman legislator two years ago, Hoverson protested a prayer by a Hindu cleric, saying he didn’t “want to be compelled to pray for a false god.”\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A roller derby team that has called itself the Cleveland Guardians since 2013 sued the city’s Major League Baseball team in federal court Wednesday, alleging that the switch from Indians to Guardians infringes on its trademark. “A Major League club cannot simply take a smaller team’s name and use it for itself,” the lawsuit said. “There cannot be two ‘Cleveland Guardians’ teams in Cleveland, and, to be blunt, Plaintiff was here first.” The Cleveland Indians announced in July that the team would assume the name Guardians for the 2022 season after years of criticism that the Indians name and Chief Wahoo logo were racist. The new name, the team has said, was influenced in part by the two large art deco statues that appear to stand guard on a bridge spanning the Cuyahoga River. The all-gender roller derby team is based in the Cleveland suburb of Parma. It formally registered the name Cleveland Guardians in 2017 with the Ohio secretary of state and has been selling team merchandise since 2014, the lawsuit said. The baseball team filed a trademark application for the Guardians name in the East African island nation of Mauritius, “effectively hiding the application unless one knew where to look,” it said. In a statement Wednesday, the Indians said officials “believe there is no conflict between the parties and their ability to operate in their respective business areas.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A federal judge has temporarily blocked parts of a new state law that makes it a misdemeanor for people to unlawfully obstruct a public street or highway during a protest. U.S. District Judge Robin Cauthron also put on hold Wednesday a provision that could result in fines of up $50,000 for groups or organizations “found to be a conspirator” with someone who violates any one of a number of state laws pertaining to riots and unlawful assemblies. The injunction temporarily prevents the enforcement of these parts of the law as the court weighs its constitutionality. A key provision of the new law that grants immunity to drivers who run people over is not being put on hold. The Oklahoma chapter of the NAACP sued Attorney General John O’Connor and Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, alleging parts of the law are unconstitutional because it will limit protests and have a chilling effect on free speech. The law was passed this year by the Republican-controlled state Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Kevin Stitt shortly after an incident in July in which a pickup truck pulling a horse trailer drove through Black Lives Matter protesters on Interstate 244 in Tulsa. Three people were seriously injured, including a 33-year-old man who fell from an overpass and was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A lawsuit has been filed saying the residency requirements for the state’s assisted suicide law violate the U.S. Constitution. Oregon was the first state to legalize medical aid in dying in 1997, when it allowed adult residents with a terminal diagnosis and prognosis of no more than six months to live to end their lives by taking a lethal dose of prescribed medication. The national advocacy organization Compassion & Choices and an Oregon Health & Science University professor of family medicine filed the new lawsuit. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports experts believe the legal action could have broad implications as the first challenge in the nation to raise the question of whether such residency requirements are constitutional. Oregon’s law was the basis of the laws that have since been adopted in eight other states and Washington, D.C. California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Vermont and Washington state allow aid in dying for residents of their states only. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Portland on Thursday asks the court to prohibit Oregon officials from enforcing the residency provision of the law. It says the residency requirement violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the Constitution and the Commerce Clause in Article I.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Senate on Wednesday approved legislation that would bar municipalities in the nation’s No. 2 natural gas state from adopting building codes that prohibit gas hookups or otherwise restricting utility service based on the energy source. The Republican-penned bill passed 35-15 and heads to the state House of Representatives for consideration there. The chamber approved it without debate, with six Democrats joining all 29 Republicans in favor of it. The bill defends a homegrown energy source in Pennsylvania as some states, cities and counties elsewhere begin looking at all-electric building codes that exclude gas infrastructure as a way to fight climate change and accelerate progress toward a carbon-free electricity grid. The vast Marcellus Shale reservoir beneath Pennsylvania is the nation’s most prolific natural gas reservoir, and the state has helped subsidize the build-out of gas infrastructure to help the industry find new customers. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Gene Yaw, R-Lycoming, said the legislation ensures the state controls any decision to restrict the use of an energy source in housing and commercial buildings. Combustion of natural gas emits carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, while natural gas contains methane, which is far more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, according to researchers.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The thousands of drivers who use the Route 37 highway on their way to work every day probably have no idea they are passing over the graves of some people who died in the late 1800s and early 1900s at state institutions. Route 37 was built between 1963 and 1969 over part of the institution cemetery called State Farm Cemetery #1, which has about 1,200 gravesites containing 3,000 people, WPRI-TV reports. A thousand of those graves should have been moved, said Charles St. Martin, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. “It was during a time when regulations were far more lax than they are now,” he wrote in an email. “This would never happen now.” There were no grave markers when the highway was built because the original grave markers were wooden stakes that had rotted away, St. Martin said. Some of the grave markers had been destroyed by fire too. The cemetery was near railroad tracks, and sparks from the steam engines set fires that consumed the markers, according to a description of the cemetery by the Rhode Island Historical Cemetery Commission. The cemetery deteriorated and became overgrown. In 2006, when dozens of coffins were exposed due to rain, the transportation department realized the graves were there, St. Martin said. The agency does not plan to move the graves that are under Route 37.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor wants to put $500 million of federal COVID-19 relief money toward fixing and improving water systems across the state, with priority given to rural and smaller systems. Gov. Henry McMaster announced his idea Thursday, saying a modern clean drinking water and sewer system is vital to citizens and to bring in businesses. “In rural South Carolina, water and sewer is the key to life,” McMaster said at a news conference in Great Falls. The $500 million is part of about $2.4 billion in pandemic relief money that the state can spend. The General Assembly will make the final decision on where the money goes. Senate and House committees discussing the relief money have brought up the idea of water system building and repair, but with a big difference: requiring local systems to also put up money for the effort. The state has more than 260 water systems and 200 wastewater systems, and their average age is approaching 50 years old, officials said. McMaster said a local match wasn’t in his plan. “Some of these communities just don’t have the money,” the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem issued an executive order Wednesday aimed at ensuring that state employees can easily obtain medical and religious exemptions from federal vaccine mandates. Noem said the move was necessary to ensure employees aren’t forced to get COVID-19 vaccinations under President Joe Biden’s initiative, which covers not only people directly paid by federal contracts but also anyone who works to support them. State lawmakers have said South Dakotans are being denied medical and religious exemptions from feds and have called for a special session to stop the order. Noem spokesman Jordan Overturf said Noem’s exemptions are “explicit and offer a clear path” for state workers to opt out of the shots. For medical exemptions, state employees need a note from a doctor stating that the vaccination is too risky because of health reasons. For religious exemptions, workers need to fill out and sign a form stating they object to the COVID-19 vaccine based “on religious grounds, which includes moral, ethical, and philosophical beliefs or principles.” Once either forms are submitted, the exemptions are automatic, Overturf said. Noem said she is talking to lawmakers about extending those protections to private employees.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A new piece of legislation aims to grow and preserve the city’s beleaguered tree canopy by creating a dedicated stream of revenue to help fund the effort. Nashville’s continued growth and development has come at an environmental cost. Between 2008 and 2016, the city lost 918 acres of tree canopy to development – about 13% of its urban canopy, according to a 2018 report. More than 30,000 metric tons of carbon were released into Davidson County’s atmosphere as a result. The bill, drafted by Mayor John Cooper’s administration, would create a dedicated revenue stream for tree restoration by allocating 1% of annual revenue from each of three funding sources: building permits, grading permits and general obligation bond-funded construction projects. The tree restoration and maintenance fund would be capped at $2.5 million annually, and the legislation would “sunset” June 30, 2023, allowing an opportunity for future review and potential renewal if deemed necessary. The bill will go before the Metro Council for its first of three readings Tuesday. The majority of tree loss in Davidson County occurs on private property, according to the bill.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: A museum dedicated to telling the history of Juneteenth with a national scope is set to be built in the city. The National Juneteenth Museum will be built as part of a mixed-use development, the city of Fort Worth said in a news release Tuesday. When President Joe Biden signed a bill into law over the summer making June 19 a federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the U.S., those by his side included Opal Lee, a 95-year-old Fort Worth woman who spent years rallying people to join her push to see the day get that recognition. The city said Lee has been leading the charge for the new museum, which will be built on land that currently houses her Fort Worth Juneteenth Museum. “To have lived long enough to see my walking and talking make an impact is one thing, but to know that a state-of-the-art museum that will house the actual pen that President Biden used to sign the bill, and many other exhibits, is coming to pass as well – I could do my holy dance again,” Lee said. The city said the museum will be led by a collaboration that includes activists, researchers and historians.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Southwest Symphony opens its 41st season Friday with the annual Halloween Spooktacular, featuring the music of John Williams. Maestro Lucas Darger returns for his sixth season as music director and conductor. Over the years, Darger and his predecessor Gary Caldwell have offered audiences an smorgasbord of Williams’ works. The composer best known for his film scores has received Academy Awards, Grammys, Golden Globes and Emmys. “Our ‘haunted’ orchestra will feature Williams’ music with selections from ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Jurassic Park,’ ‘Superman,’ ‘E.T.,’ ‘Saving Private Ryan’ and many more,” said Scott Raine, marketing director of the Southwest Symphony. The traditional Handel’s “Messiah” will be returning in early December. Prokofiev’s “Peter and the Wolf” is slated to be presented in early February, followed by award-winning international flutist Demarre McGill in March.\n\nVermont\n\nRockingham: The town is planning to spend up to $20,000 to save the steeple and a stained glass window from an old church in the village of Bellows Falls that is slated for demolition. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the Rockingham Select Board voted unanimously to spend up to $15,000 to remove the steeple from the Methodist Meeting House and up to $5,000 to remove and crate the stained glass window of “The Parable of the Sower.” Town Manager Scott Pickup said what will happen to the historic items after they are removed has not been decided. The demolition date has been pushed back to December to allow more time to salvage the historic items, Pickup said. The board voted last month to demolish the 1835 building. It was extensively renovated in 1880. But while it was home to the local YMCA, the building fell into a state of serious disrepair. Efforts to save the building failed. The town took ownership of the dilapidated building this summer. Select Board member Elijah Zimmer, a member of the town’s Historic Preservation Commission, said the steeple is in excellent condition, unlike the rest of the building. “I’m sad to lose the building, but glad to see a commitment to historic preservation,” Zimmer said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Police are warning that an unlicensed tow truck is being used to quickly steal vehicles throughout the city. On Sunday, the tow truck was captured on surveillance video backing up toward a vehicle, lifting it with tow gear and towing it away seconds later, Richmond Police said in a news release. Police said the truck is black with no logo or lettering on it, as is required for tow trucks for hire. Detectives asked the public to call 911 if they see this tow truck or any tow truck without a company name, lettering or logo.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A federal jury has determined that The GEO Group must pay minimum wage – rather than $1 a day – to immigration detainees who perform tasks like cooking and cleaning at its for-profit detention center in the state. The verdict came Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Tacoma in a second trial over the issue. The first trial ended in June with a deadlocked jury. “This multi-billion dollar corporation illegally exploited the people it detains to line its own pockets,” Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement. “Today’s victory sends a clear message: Washington will not tolerate corporations that get rich violating the rights of the people.” The jury will now consider how much the immigrant detainees who worked at the facility are owed, and U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan on his own will determine what The GEO Group must pay the state for its claim that the company unjustly enriched itself. Ferguson, a Democrat, sued the Florida-based GEO Group in 2017, saying the company had unjustly profited by running the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma – now known as the Northwest ICE Processing Center – on the backs of captive workers. A separate lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees was also filed that year, seeking back pay. The judge, who rejected several attempts by GEO to dismiss the lawsuits, consolidated the cases for trial.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A new program enables owners of small forestlands to prosper from improving forest health while slowing climate change. The Family Forest Carbon Program, which pays family and individual small-forest owners to implement practices that increase the amount of carbon sequestered and stored on the land, is opening enrollment to West Virginia landowners. The program could pay significant financial and environmental dividends in the Mountain State, given that West Virginia is the third-most-forested state in the nation, with more than 12 million acres of forestland. The program, a product of the American Forest Foundation and the Nature Conservancy, enables the carbon sequestered by enrolled landowners to become part of a carbon market in the form of carbon credits to be verified by a third party. The program provides expert consultation from foresters to landowners and a forest management plan customized for the landowner’s property. “We built into (the program) a management plan, not to tell them what to do but to help them reach the goals and visions they have for their land, put it into a management plan so that their woods are producing timber, wildlife, carbon for the years to come,” American Forest Foundation CEO Tom Martin said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A sheriff who supports former President Donald Trump accused the bipartisan state Elections Commission of breaking the law during last year’s election, taking the unusual step Thursday of detailing the allegations publicly even though no charges have been filed. Racine County Sheriff Charles Schamling called on the Wisconsin Department of Justice to investigate the commission’s decision last year to tell local elections officials not to send poll workers into nursing homes to assist residents with voting during the pandemic. The move is the latest example of Trump supporters seeking to undermine confidence in the election in a critical battleground state that President Joe Biden carried last year. The state Department of Justice has already said it has no plans to pursue the case, the sheriff said. In a 75-minute presentation streamed on his Facebook page, Schmaling detailed what he said was evidence collected from the Ridgewood Care Center in Racine County. Trump issued a statement encouraging his supporters to watch the presentation. Schmaling said the families of eight residents told investigators they believed that their loved ones did not have the capacity to vote but that ballots were cast for them. “I don’t know how or who they voted for,” the sheriff said. “I didn’t ask because it doesn’t matter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Central High School’s theater program returned in full capacity with an intimate production of “Typhoid Mary.” The play tells the story of Mary Mallon, an Irish cook who immigrated to America in the early 1900s while unknowingly serving as a carrier of the disease typhoid. The story begins after Mary has already infected and killed several people with her cooking, but still she refuses to be vaccinated or studied by scientists who offer to help her. Choosing a play with such a relevant premise was entirely intentional, but director Jeremiah Kolkman wasn’t looking to take sides, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. “If the audience walks out of here thinking that they were able to relate to this because of current events as they are, that’s great,” he said. “If audience members are walking out of here disgusted because they don’t like the differences of religion and science, that’s great. I just want them walking out of here thinking about it.” While the director chose the play for its relevance, the production remains bipartisan. It presents the situation from a variety of different perspectives. Mary and her husband struggle through religious reconciliation, while the two scientists throughout the production face conflict in their field. Prior to last weekend’s shows, the last time Cheyenne Central held a full production was fall 2019, before the contagious, deadly coronavirus reared its head.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/29"}]}

List of US cities with the biggest increase\n\nThe FDACS will treat the affected area with a pesticide called metaldehyde (AKA “snail bait,”) approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for use on crops and in residential areas. The pesticide works by targeting what gives snails and slugs their signature slimy feel, hindering their ability to produce mucus and leading to dehydration, issues with digestion and mobility, and eventually leading to death within days, according to the FDACS.\n\nOne of the most destructive species in the world\n\nWhile issuing a quarantine over snails may sound extreme, the hubbub can be attributed to the species’ extraordinary talent for destruction.\n\nThe giant African land snail is capable of causing extensive damage to “tropical and subtropical environments,” meaning it can prove devastating to Florida agriculture and wildlife, according to reporting by Naples Daily News, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIn fact, the USDA reports that it took the government 10 years and $1 million to eradicate the snail after its initial state-side discovery in South Florida in the 1960s. Unfortunately, the species found its way back in 2011, when another 10-year campaign was launched, this time racking up a bill of almost $23 million.\n\nTarantulas in TexasTarantulas in Texas are popping out of the earth. Here's what they're looking for.\n\nDubbed one of the most damaging snails in the world, the species has been known to consume at least 500 different kinds of plants and other nonorganic materials, like stucco. It is also a carrier of rat lungworm, a parasite which causes meningitis in humans.\n\nThe “giant” in its name refers to its ability to grow to roughly 8-inches long, about the size of an adult man’s fist, making it one of the biggest mollusks in the world. It can lay 1,200 eggs a year, depositing up to 200 eggs per batch, and has proven deft at adapting to the consumption of local flora and fauna, securing a spot atop the U.S. invasive species lists.\n\nIt is illegal to own, purchase or sell giant African land snails in the U.S. and would-be smugglers may face heavy fines and penalties for transporting the snails without a proper permit.

And they're huge!\n\nThese slimy mollusks – which grow to more than five times the size of a garden snail – pose a health risk to Floridians while also threatening the state's agriculture and wildlife. They are capable of causing extensive damage to tropical and subtropical environments, according to reporting by the Naples Daily News, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nOn June 20, Florida quarantined another county – Broward – because of the giant African land snails. Lee and Pasco counties on Florida's west coast have been under quarantine since last year.\n\nWhere have the giant African land snails been found in Florida?\n\nThe Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) confirmed a giant African land snail sighting in Broward County earlier this month.\n\nThe state has quarantined a 3½-square-mile tract at the southern border of the county in Miramar and made it illegal to move a giant African land snail – even if it's moved within the quarantined area. The rule also applies to plants, soil, compost, yard waste and debris where the snails or their eggs may be hidden.\n\nThe troublesome snails also were detected in Pasco County in June 2022 and Lee County in December that same year. Once quarantined, a three-year process of treatments and monthly surveys ensure they've been eradicated.\n\nThis isn't Florida's first encounter with the snails, though. The invasive species was first detected in 1966, according to the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.\n\nCan’t see our graphics? Click to reload.\n\nWhat do giant African land snails look like?\n\nThe snail's shell has seven to nine whorls (spirals) when it is fully grown. At least half of the snail's length is taken up by its brownish shell, which has darker brown lengthwise stripes.\n\nAnother invasive species invaded the Northeast: How the spotted lanternfly is spreading.\n\nAre the giant African land snails edible?\n\nNo − you don't want to eat these snails.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the snails can carry the rat lungworm parasite, which is known to cause parasitic meningitis in people who eat raw or undercooked snails. Some children have been infected by swallowing snails \"on a dare.\"\n\nIf you have to handle these snails, wear gloves and then wash your hands throughly.\n\nHow big do giant African land snails get?\n\nThe “giant” in its name refers to its ability to grow to roughly 8 inches long and 5 inches in diameter, about the size of an adult man’s fist. That makes it one of the biggest mollusks in the world.\n\nLife cycle of the giant African land snail\n\nGiant African land snails are hermaphrodites, meaning they have both female and male reproductive organs. Each snail can produce 100 to 500 eggs after a single mating. Although each snail is equipped with female and male reproductive organs, they rarely self-fertilize. They will still find a mate and fertilize each other's eggs. Every two to three months, the snails can produce new egg clutches.\n\nWhat to do if you see a giant African land snail\n\nIt's illegal to import or possess giant African land snails in the United States without a permit.\n\nAccording to experts, if you see an African land snail, you should contact the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service office in your state or your state's Department of Agriculture.\n\nFloridians who suspect they may have discovered one are advised to take a picture and contact the Florida Department of Agriculture Helpline at 1-888-397-1517 or DPIHelpline@fdacs.gov.\n\nContributing Mary Walrath-Holdridge/USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/01"}]}
