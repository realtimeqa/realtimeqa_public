Every newspaper and cable channel is filled with thoughts about the move, with much of that opinion tilting toward outrage over the Florida Republican governor treating people like political pawns.\n\n“It’s outrageous,” New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez said of the move. “They lure people, like human traffickers lure people, onto buses and unknowing where they’re going to. They have no concern for – they supposedly are the advocates for human life. They have no concern for the lives of these people.”\n\nDeSantis couldn’t have scripted it any better politically.\n\nThe simple fact is that DeSantis made this Martha’s Vineyard gambit solely to draw attention to himself and his opposition to the border policies of the Biden administration. It was, to be frank, a stunt. And it’s not the first time he’s done something like this.\n\nConsider:\n\n* In the spring of 2022, DeSantis’ administration rejected 41% of proposed math textbooks because they were allegedly “indoctrinating” kids. “Some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,” DeSantis said in a statement explaining the move.\n\n* At a press conference at the University of South Florida earlier this year, DeSantis scolded students for wearing masks while indoors. “You do not have to wear those masks,” he said. “I mean, please take them off. Honestly, it’s not doing anything. We’ve got to stop with this Covid theater. So if you want to wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous.”\n\n* DeSantis revoked Disney’s special self-governance status in Florida following the company’s criticism of the state’s passage of legislation that bans the discussion of gender and sexuality among young people in public schools. “You’re a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you’re going to marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state,” said DeSantis. “We view that as a provocation, and we’re going to fight back against that.”\n\nEach of these incidents drew national headlines. Each of them drew intense criticism from the left. And each of them drew equal amounts of praise from the conservative right.\n\nWhich is exactly how the Martha Vineyard’s stunt has played out. While DeSantis was blasted by Democrats, the right ran to defend him. “DeSantis was right to send migrants to Martha’s Vineyard. We need to bring border crisis to Democrats,” read an op-ed on Fox News’ website.\n\nFor DeSantis, the outrage – on both sides – is the point. He has built a political brand on the idea of standing up to what he views as political correctness and wokeness. (DeSantis signed a bill into law earlier this year designed to “protect Floridians from discrimination and woke indoctrination.”) In order to maintain and burnish that image, he has to do even more outrageous things – like the Martha’s Vineyard move.\n\nThe fact of the matter – whether you like DeSantis or not – is that his outrage machine is humming along. Largely riding his knack for stirring controversy, he has emerged by many measures as the second-most popular Republican in the country – behind only Donald Trump. He is regarded as a heavy favorite to win a second term over his Democratic opponent, former Gov. Charlie Crist, in November. And he is widely regarded as the only candidate who could credibly challenge Trump in a 2024 Republican primary.\n\nWhich is somewhat ironic. Because, as Trump likes to remind anyone who asks, he helped make DeSantis by endorsing him in a primary fight in 2018. And DeSantis has quite clearly modeled his approach to politics off of the ripped-from-the-headlines strategy employed by Trump.\n\nIn fact, what DeSantis is offering Republican voters amounts to Trumpism without Trump. In DeSantis, you get all the anti-wokeness that Trump built a presidential campaign and presidency on, but just without some of the more embarrassing personal foibles and tics that the former President brings with him.\n\nAnd, just like Trump, covering DeSantis provides a significant challenge for the media as well. DeSantis wants – and even courts – the scorn of the mainstream media for gambits like the one in Martha’s Vineyard. He knows that the more negative attention he gets, the better liked he is among the Republican base and the more money he can raise for his future political endeavors.\n\nNot covering someone like DeSantis – the governor of a major state and someone with national ambitions – is out of the question. But how DeSantis – and his stunts – are covered is something that the media needs to think seriously on as we move closer to 2024.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade.

(The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016.

Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/17/us/inside-texas-synagogue-hostage-standoff/index.html", "title": "Inside the Texas synagogue hostage standoff | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt started like most any Saturday for members of Congregation Beth Israel.\n\nFamilies of the Reform Jewish synagogue just outside Dallas-Fort Worth had gathered – in person and online – to participate in the Sabbath service, even amid the twin perils of a fresh pandemic wave and a swelling tide of attacks on Jewish people in the United States.\n\nBy day’s end, the community of faith in Colleyville, Texas, would be at the center of a global drama involving a livestreamed hostage-taking, an imprisoned terrorist icon, an elite FBI rescue team, a rabbi’s quick thinking and a final, frantic sprint to freedom.\n\nMore details may yet offer a deeper understanding of why it happened. But already, the tale is one of searing trauma, with the broader American Jewish community now again forced to be resilient as it’s reminded of the ever-present potential for disaster.\n\nA rabbi welcomes a stranger\n\nA stranger arrived that morning at the synagogue.\n\nRabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker welcomed in the man and made him a cup of tea, the rabbi told CBS on Monday.\n\nCytron-Walker may not have known immediately that Malik Faisal Akram, 44, was a British national. Akram had arrived in the US via New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport in late December, a US law enforcement source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nIn the two weeks before he met Cytron-Walker, Akram had spent three nights – January 6, 11 and 13 – at a Dallas homeless shelter, according to Union Gospel Mission Dallas CEO Bruce Butler. He was very quiet and wasn’t there long enough to build any relationships, Butler said.\n\nOver their shared tea, Cytron-Walker and Akram talked, the rabbi said.\n\n“Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” said the rabbi, who soon that day would lead a religious service for the 157 membership families of his congregation, established in 1999.\n\nThe rabbi pointed Jeffrey Cohen, the vice president on the synagogue’s board of trustees, to their guest that day. Cohen went over and introduced himself, he wrote in a Facebook post describing his experience.\n\n“He was on the phone, but briefly stopped his conversation,” Cohen said. “He said hello, smiled, and after we introduced ourselves, I let him go back to his call. He seemed calm and happy to be in from the frigid 20 degree morning. His eyes weren’t darting around; his hands were open and calm, he said hello, he smiled.”\n\nBecause of the recent coronavirus surge, many of Congregation Beth Israel’s members had stayed home on Saturday to watch the weekly prayers via Facebook or Zoom. Services began at 10 a.m.\n\nAs the rabbi led the prayers – his back turned as he faced toward Jerusalem – he heard a click. It came from the stranger.\n\n“And it turned out, that it was his gun,” Cytron-Walker said.\n\nCohen said he heard that same click, the “unmistakable sound of an automatic slide engaging a round.” The mysterious guest then began yelling something. Cohen dialed 911 on his phone, put the screen side down and moved as commanded, he wrote.\n\nAkram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, authorities said.\n\n‘I’m going to die at the end of this’\n\nPolice got an emergency call at 10:41 a.m.\n\nThey rushed to the synagogue and set up a perimeter, evacuating residents nearby, police said. Soon, nearly 200 members of local, state and federal law enforcement, including the FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, were on hand, FBI Dallas Special Agent in Charge Matthew DeSarno said.\n\nMeanwhile, the livestream – intended for the faithful who’d stayed home to be safe from Covid-19 – appeared to capture some of what Akram was saying.\n\n“I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” he told someone he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.”\n\nThe audio can be difficult to understand, and it’s not clear whom Akram is talking to. But it’s clear he planned to die during the standoff, he repeatedly told people.\n\n“OK, are you listening? I don’t want you to cry. Listen! I’m going to release these four guys … but then I’m going to go in the yard, yeah? … And they’re going to take me, alright? I’m going to die at the end of this, alright? Are you listening? I am going to die! OK? So, don’t cry over me,” the man said to someone else.\n\nCongregation member Stacey Silverman watched the livestream for more than an hour. She heard the suspect ranting, sometimes switching between saying, “I’m not a criminal,” to apologies, she said.\n\nThe man vacillated among languages and was “screaming hysterically,” she said. He claimed to have a bomb.\n\nAkram also “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States,” the FBI said in a statement. The convict is believed to be Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani with a PhD in neuroscience who is serving a federal prison sentence in Fort Worth after being found guilty of attempted murder and other charges in an assault on US officers in Afghanistan.\n\nShe was not involved in the Colleyville attack, her attorney said Saturday.\n\n“He wanted this woman released and he wanted to talk to her and he thought – well, he said point-blank – he chose this synagogue because ‘Jews control the world. Jews control the media. Jews control the banks. I want to talk to chief rabbi of the United States,’” Cohen told CNN, adding there is no chief rabbi in the US.\n\nInside the synagogue, Cohen resisted following exactly as Akram commanded, he wrote in his Facebook post. Rather than go to the back of the room as ordered, Cohen stayed in line with one of the exits. When a police officer came to the door and the hostage-taker became more agitated, Cohen moved closer to the exit door, he wrote.\n\nAkram let them call their families, and Cohen called his wife, daughter and son and even posted on Facebook. He also slowly moved a few chairs in front of him – “anything to slow or divert a bullet or shrapnel,” he wrote.\n\nAt one point – at the suspect’s request – the rabbi being held hostage called a well-known rabbi in New York City so the suspect could say Siddiqi was framed and he wanted her released, two officials briefed on investigation said.\n\nAs hours ticked on, law enforcement negotiators had a “high frequency and duration of contact” with the suspect, DeSarno said. The FBI called out its Hostage Rescue Team from Quantico, Virginia, and some 60 to 70 people came to the site, Colleyville Police Chief Michael Miller said.\n\nOne hostage – a man – was released unharmed around 5 p.m., Colleyville Police Sgt. Dara Nelson said. The hostage-taker did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS.\n\nBut, he added, they were threatened the entire time.\n\nA thrown chair activates a bold escape\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Police speak out after synagogue hostages were rescued 02:12 - Source: CNN\n\nWith threats and attacks targeting Jewish people growing more common in recent years, Cytron-Walker and his congregation had participated in security courses with law enforcement agencies, he said.\n\nAs Saturday afternoon rolled to the night – and the hostage-taker’s demeanor began to change – that training helped the rabbi and the two others who were still held against their will.\n\n“In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself.”\n\nCohen helped another hostage move closer to that exit, and whispered to him about the door, he wrote. The third hostage later joined them when they received pizza to eat, putting them all within 20 feet of the exit door.\n\nThey spoke with Akram and asked him questions, trying to buy the FBI time to move into position, he wrote.\n\nYet the situation began to devolve. “At one point, our attacker instructed us to get on our knees. I reared up in my chair, stared at him sternly. I think I slowly moved my head and mouthed NO. He stared at me, then moved back to sit down. It was this moment when Rabbi Charlie yelled run,” he wrote.\n\nCytron-Walker saw his opening when he got the gunman a drink in a glass, he told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Tuesday.\n\n“As he was drinking, the gun wasn’t in the best position and I thought this was our best chance, I needed to make sure the people who were still with me that they were ready to go,” the rabbi said.\n\n“And so there was a chair that was right in front of me. I told the guys to go, I picked it up and I threw it at him with all the adrenaline,” Cytron-Walker said. “It was absolutely terrifying and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be shot, and I did not hear a shot fired as I made it out the door. I was the last one out.”\n\nThe three hostages burst through the exit door and sprinted away from the building, video taken from outside the synagogue by CNN affiliate WFAA shows. Seconds later, a man in black holding what appears to be a gun stepped halfway through the exit to look outside. He then returned inside the building without shooting, the video shows.\n\nA group of heavily armed law enforcement personnel moved toward another part of the building, the video shows. About 30 seconds later, a series of four bangs erupted, followed by a louder explosive boom that set a number of car alarms to begin wailing. Other armed law enforcement personnel moved into a different position by the building, and another three loud bangs then went off, the video shows.\n\nThe loud boom, heard by a CNN team near the synagogue at about 9:12 p.m., was the result of entry tools used by the hostage rescue team, an ATF spokesperson said.\n\nThe rescue team breached the synagogue, Miller said. The suspect was killed.\n\nNone of the four hostages was harmed, DeSarno said.\n\nMore booms echoed as the tactical team disposed of leftover entry explosives brought by the rescue team. Crime scene investigators recovered one firearm they believe belonged to the suspect, the ATF spokesperson said. An ATF dog found no more explosives, the spokesperson said.\n\nOn Facebook, Cohen credited active shooter training he received for his survival and escape.\n\n“We weren’t released or freed,” he said. “We escaped because we had training from the Secure Community Network on what to do in the event of an active shooter.”\n\nThe Secure Community Network describes itself as the “official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.”\n\n“Those courses, that instruction, helped me to understand that you need to act in moments where your life is threatened. I would not have had the courage, I would not have had the knowhow or what to do without that instruction,” Cytron-Walker said. “I want people to understand, it doesn’t matter if you are in a synagogue, if you’re Jewish, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Christian, if you’re religious at all, it can happen in a shopping mall. Unfortunately this is the world that we’re living in.”\n\n‘The time to heal our community has begun’\n\nOn Sunday morning, Cytron-Walker took to Facebook, this time to express his gratitude to those who supported him throughout Saturday’s ordeal.\n\n“I am thankful and filled with appreciation for all of the vigils and prayers and love and support, all of the law enforcement and first responders who cared for us, all of the security training that helped save us,” he wrote in the Facebook post.\n\n“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive,” Cytron-Walker said in the post.\n\nNothing suggests the threat posed by Akram is continuing, officials said. The investigation into the case and its motive is likely to be global, DeSarno added, including contacts with Tel Aviv and London.\n\nInitially, the FBI, based on its exchanges, found the suspect to be “singularly focused on one issue, and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community, but we’ll continue to work to find motive,” DeSarno said.\n\nOn Monday, the agency called Saturday’s attack “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted,” according to a statement. The case “is being investigated by the Joint Terrorism Task Force.”\n\nCongregation Beth Israel held a special service Monday night at which the rabbi spoke about the need to heal after the incident.\n\n“Thank God, thank God,” Cytron-Walker said. “It could’ve been so much worse, and I am overflowing, truly overflowing, with gratitude.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson"], "publish_date": "2022/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/middleeast/why-arabs-are-furious-world-cup-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Arabs and Muslims feel stung by coverage of the Qatar World ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories.

Today I feel a migrant worker,” FIFA chief Gianni Infantino said in a fiery tirade on Saturday, comparing his own plight as a redhead son of migrants to that of marginalized communities.\n\nHis ostensible empathy with Qatar was due to the barrage of criticism the nation has faced in Western media for hosting the tournament.\n\nBut it’s hypocritical of the West to be giving lessons in morality to others, he said.\n\nThose statements on the eve of the World Cup went viral, inviting much anger and ridicule. But to many Arabs and Muslims, they resonated strongly.\n\nUS actor Morgan Freeman (2nd L), Qatari singer Dana al-Fardan (2nd R), and Qatari YouTuber Ghanim al Muftah (R) perform during the Qatar 2022 World Cup opening ceremony on Sunday. Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOmar Alsaadi, a 21-year-old Qatari, told CNN that Infantino vocalized “from a Western point of view” what many of his compatriots have felt about being targets of racism.\n\nIn the run-up to the tournament, Western media coverage has been dominated by the controversies surrounding the event rather than the sport itself, including the Gulf nation’s treatment of migrant workers, its rules on LGBTQ people and its tight social restrictions. Britain’s public broadcaster, the BBC, refrained from airing the opening ceremony on television, opting instead to cover criticism of the host nation. The BBC said it did broadcast the ceremony on their video-on-demand service.\n\nThis year’s World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.\n\nThe Bedouin-themed opening ceremony on Sunday began with a female singer donning a traditional burqa, a kind of face covering that has been banned in several European countries. It also cited a verse from the Quran about God creating humanity into “nations and tribes” so they can get to know each other.\n\nAccording to social media reports, some hotel rooms in the country offer visitors QR codes to learn about Islam, and Muslim volunteers have been teaching visitors about Islamic fashion.\n\nQatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), which is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nBut in an earlier statement to CNN, the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nThe visibility of Islamic symbols in Qatar hasn’t escaped those attending. An on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of “a lot of mosques” in the country caused outrage among Muslims on social media.\n\nWestern news outlets have also been accused of peddling stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.\n\nThe Times of London on Monday said “Qataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country” in a photo caption that was later deleted after being flagged on social media. Around 87% of the country’s population of 2.9 million is made up of expatriates, many of whom are Western.\n\n“I think that the Western media is biased because they don’t want to see an Arabic success, a Muslim success in the delivering and hosting of a global cup for football in a third [world country],” Najd Al-Mohanadi, a 20-year-old Qatari, told CNN.\n\nBut some in the Western media have spoken out against stereotyping and alleged biases. Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host who previously worked for Qatar’s Al Jazeera, said recent coverage of Qatar shows “the depths of Western prejudice, performative moral outrage and, perhaps most significantly, gross double standards.”\n\nThe Economist and the New York Times have also run articles defending Qatar’s right to host the tournament. The Times of London ran an essay saying criticism of Qatar was “laced with hypocrisy.”\n\n“I always question the timing [of the criticism], as migrants throughout the region endure poor living arrangements for meager pay, while also working under strenuous physical and mental conditions,” said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher from the UAE who is studying at Oxford University in England.\n\n“Scrutiny is overdue and it makes no sense to tie it to global events where virtue-signaling becomes deeply problematic,” Al Hussein told CNN.\n\n“Especially when it comes from non-NGO entities that are themselves embroiled in human rights violations within and across their borders.”\n\nJames Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Qatar, said that while some of the coverage around Qatar in the West has reinforced negative stereotypes about the Arab Muslim world, most of the criticism has been “fair and proportionate.”\n\n“It’s absolutely right to call out instances of that kind of coverage, but wrong to generalize from those examples to imply that all, or most, criticism is driven by racism,” he said.\n\nWorkers in the country continue to “face harsh, abusive working conditions and severe exploitation, with domestic and construction workers among those most at risk,” he said, adding that Qatar’s women and LGBTQ people “face serious discrimination and repression, both in law and practice.”\n\nCritics of Western media coverage of Qatar have countered that other countries with questionable human rights records didn’t receive such scrutiny when hosting global sporting events.\n\n“At the risk of engaging in whataboutism… Qatar’s human rights records, as poor as they may be, cannot possibly be more outrageous than other countries, such as Russia, China and Israel,” said Al Hussein. “Qatar is certainly not engaging in ethnic cleansing, nor are migrants living in concentration camps, despite the poor living conditions.”\n\nMaryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said some of the recent rhetoric around Qatar shows that some Western critics have been more concerned with feeding into an “orientalist discourse,” referring to language aimed at imposing Western worldviews, than human rights.\n\n“This should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,” she said. “Rather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.”\n\nShe noted however that some over-zealous defenders of the government on the Qatari side have neglected the country’s human rights shortcomings.\n\n“Many of the people defending Qatar are also using terrifyingly pro-government language,” she said, adding that it reaches a point that doesn’t help the cause of Qatar’s migrant workers.\n\n“The plight of migrant workers in places like the US or the UK does not take away from the fact that we have problems in Qatar,” AlHajri told CNN. “It shouldn’t be about whataboutism.”\n\nWith additional reporting from Mariam Dirar Alqasem in Doha\n\nIran protests\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN hears testimony from women who say they experienced sexual violence by Iranian regime 06:31 - Source: CNN\n\nSocial media videos have emerged allegedly showing Iranian security forces sexually assaulting female demonstrators on the streets.\n\nWith media access inside Iran severely constrained, CNN went to the region near Iraq’s border with Iran, interviewing eyewitnesses who’d left the country and verifying accounts from survivors and sources both in and outside Iran.\n\nThe covert testimonies revealed sexual assaults on male and female activists as a women-led uprising spreads throughout Iran.\n\nUS Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley on Tuesday tweeted it is “a reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people - and of the lengths to which the regime will go in its futile attempt to silence dissent.”\n\nRead the article here.\n\nHere’s the latest on the protests in Iran:\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Tuesday that the rising number of protest-related deaths highlights the “critical” nature of the situation in the country. The UN said its sources had reported over 40 deaths “in mainly Kurdish cities in the past week.”\n\nForty foreign nationals “affiliated in riots” have been arrested in Iran since protests started in September, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Masood Satayshi said without revealing their nationalities.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday the US is taking steps to “push back against actions Iran is taking to repress its own people.”\n\nMobile internet was restored in Iran after a major disruption on Monday, according to internet watchdog NetBlocks, which said that cellular data was down for about 3.5 hours as security forces cracked down on protesters in the Kurdish region of Iran.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nSaudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.\n\nMany had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.\n\nWatch CNN’s Becky Anderson speak to celebrating fans of the Saudi team:\n\nAlso read:\n\nThe digest\n\nTeenage student dies in twin explosions in Jerusalem\n\nTwo explosions shook Jerusalem early Wednesday, killing one person and injuring 18 others in a suspected “combined terror attack,” according to an Israeli police spokesperson. The first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance of Jerusalem, killing a 16-year-old student at a Jewish seminary, his family told local media. The second explosion occurred almost half an hour later at the city’s Ramot junction. Initial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects, the police spokesperson said.\n\nBackground: The attack brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side of the conflict to at least 29 this year. This year has also been the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015.\n\nWhy it matters: Jerusalem has not seen a double bombing like this one in many years. Prime Minister Yair Lapid said after participating in a situation assessment with security officials that the incident was “different from what we have seen in recent years.” The explosions come after months of tensions in the occupied West Bank.\n\nRussia to build attack drones for Ukraine war with the help of Iran, intelligence assessment says\n\nIran and Russia have reached an agreement to begin the production of attack drones in Russia, according to a new intelligence assessment from a country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program. Iran is beginning to transfer blueprints and components for the drones to Russia after the initial agreement was struck earlier this month, said a source familiar with the assessment.\n\nBackground: US officials have said that Russia has received hundreds of drones from Tehran which have had a deadly effect in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the Iranian government acknowledged for the first time that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhy it matters: The move would further cement the partnership between Tehran and Moscow and likely provoke significant anger from Ukraine and its western allies including the US. Sources explained that the goal is for Russia to produce thousands of new attack drones using Iranian components and blueprints.\n\nSaudi Arabia says it may take steps to balance market\n\nOil rose on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ was sticking with output cuts and could take further steps to balance the market, outweighing global recession worries and concern about China’s rising Covid-19 case numbers, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday was also cited by state news agency SPA as denying a Wall Street Journal report that said OPEC was considering boosting output.\n\nBackground: The Wall Street Journal earlier on Monday reported an output increase of 500,000 barrels per day was under discussion for the next meeting of OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on December 4. The report cited unidentified OPEC delegates. The report sent oil prices plunging by more than 5%.\n\nWhy it matters: The oil cartel last month cut production by 2 million barrels per day in an effort to stabilize the market “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” The oil cut was made despite strong US pressure against it. Potential further cuts could exacerbate already tense relations between the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim Abbas Al Lawati", "Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/21/politics/trump-kevin-mccarthy-mike-pence/index.html", "title": "Trump lashes out at McCarthy and Pence over January 6 hearings ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nDonald Trump is growing increasingly irritated with the House panel investigating the January 6, 2021, riot as it lifts the curtain on some of its findings with public hearings that have garnered gavel-to-gavel cable coverage – much to the annoyance of the TV-obsessed former President.\n\nTucked away at his Bedminster golf club, Trump has spent the past week venting his frustrations ​to nearly anyone who will listen. He has also taken his complaints about the committee on the road, lashing out at the congressional panel during a speech to conservatives in Nashville last Friday.\n\n“I don’t understand why Kevin didn’t put anyone on the committee,” Trump ​has recently ​griped to those around him, according to a GOP source with direct knowledge of the comments – a reference to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s decision to boycott the select committee after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected two ​Republican members he originally chose to sit on the panel.\n\nTrump’s growing frustration with the absence of any hard core supporters on the select committee – which has given the panel uninterrupted air time and deprived Republicans of the ability to cross-examine witnesses ​in real time – is just the latest example of how the public hearings have gotten under his skin.​ The former President has previously complained about his lack of allies on the committee, though he has become especially exasperated over the last week with his inability to preemptively respond to the committee’s findings without knowing what the panel plans to reveal during each hearing.\n\nTrump has also publicly and privately lashed out at former Vice President Mike Pence, whose chief of staff Marc Short and ​former top White House lawyer Greg Jacob have ​both been featured prominently in the select committee hearings, put​ting an unflattering spotlight on ​the pressure campaign ​Trump directed at Pence and others as he desperately attempted to stay in power.\n\nAnd while Trump has been pleased by the counter-programming effort being waged by his Capitol Hill allies in conservative media and on social media, he has still felt the need to take matters into his own hands​. He reacted to the committee’s first prime-time hearing earlier this month with a lengthy 12-page rebuttal bashing the probe into the deadly Capitol riot ​and devoted much of his 90-minute appearance at the Faith & Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority conference last week to slamming Pence and the committee’s two Republican members – Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois.\n\nAs the former President contemplates launching another presidential bid – potentially before the midterm elections –​ ​he has also become hyper-sensitive to how the hearings are ​being received by viewers and voters alike, according to multiple Republicans close to Trump. The stakes are high: the investigation could not only cast Pence, one of his potential 2024 rivals, in a positive light as investigators underscore the former vice president’s role in preventing a constitutional crisis, but it could also foreshadow potential legal trouble for Trump, ​who is already grappling with multiple legal battles unrelated to his role in January 6. ​\n\nStuck in this high pressure atmosphere, Trump has started to direct his anger at people both inside and outside his orbit, from McCarthy ​and Pence to his former chief of staff Mark Meadows ​and Attorney General Bill Barr.\n\n‘We have no representation on this panel’\n\nOne of Trump’s chief complaints as of late has centered on the lack of Republican representation on the committee – Cheney and Kinzinger, who were both appointed by Pelosi, are ardent Trump critics. McCarthy chose five Republicans for the panel, but Pelosi, in an unprecedented move, vetoed Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana and Jim Jordan of Ohio from serving on the committee since they supported efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nNot only has Trump privately vented about McCarthy opting to withdraw his remaining picks for the panel, but Trump also took that grievance public in a recent radio interview, though he did not mention McCarthy by name.\n\n“Unfortunately, a bad decision was made,” Trump told conservative talk show host Wayne Allyn Root. “This committee was a bad decision, not to have representation on that committee. That was a very, very foolish decision because you know, they try and pretend like they’re legit, and only when you get into the inner workings you say, ‘what kind of a thing is this? it’s just a one-sided witch hunt.’”\n\n“We have no representation on this panel. We should certainly have some Republicans, real Republicans … We have nobody on that panel who can fight back,” Trump said earlier in the interview. “In a way, the Republicans should be ashamed of themselves.”\n\nThe thinking among some of Trump’s advisers – and even among a handful of far-right Republicans on Capitol Hill – is that it was a mistake to not have any GOP lawmakers inside the room pushing back in real time ​or providing insight to the former President and rest of the GOP conference as to what investigators planned to highlight in public hearings. Had Republicans been on the committee, they could have asked tough questions of witnesses, made procedural motions to disrupt the flow of the hearings, and would have had some advance knowledge of the subpoenas, taped depositions​ and other evidence collected by the panel.\n\nCNN previously reported that Trump was caught off guard by seeing his daughter, Ivanka Trump,​ and his son-in-law Jared Kushner appear in a video clip during the first televised hearing, even though he knew ​they had both spoken with the committee. ​The former President complained to aides at the time that his daughter’s testimony was taken out of context and deliberately included to embarrass him, according to a person close to Trump.\n\nSome Republicans have also questioned whether a bipartisan commission to investigate January 6 would have been a better outcome for Trump and the GOP. At McCarthy’s direction, GOP Rep. John Katko of New York hammered out a deal on a commission that would have required both parties to agree on subpoenas, forced the commission to finish up its work by the end of last year, and prevented any current politicians from serving on the investigative body.\n\nBut McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell both opposed the commission, which ended up failing in the Senate and led Pelosi to establish a select committee instead.\n\nOne GOP source called the move a “tactical error.”\n\nJordan, however, defended McCarthy’s decision-making and said the GOP leader had no choice but to boycott the select committee after what Pelosi did. After McCarthy made the decision, Republicans on Capitol Hill were quick to rally around the move. And McCarthy used the moment as a political opportunity to paint the investigation as a one-sided witch hunt, which has become the GOP’s primary talking point.\n\n“Pelosi knew, when she wouldn’t let the selections of the leader on the committee, she knew Kevin had no other choice,” Jordan told CNN. “You’re doing something that hasn’t been done in the history of the country, and we’re just supposed to go along with it? No.”\n\nStill, even if most of the GOP has no regrets about McCarthy deciding to yank his remaining Republican picks from the committee, it could be problematic that Trump is second guessing McCarthy, who needs the former President’s support to become speaker one day.\n\nAnd in the conservative radio interview, Trump went out of his way to make clear that he has only endorsed McCarthy for reelection ​but not for speaker, a position McCarthy has long had his sights on and is expected to seek if Republicans retake the House this November. People close to Trump, who wants House Republicans to aggressively investigate President Joe Biden if they find themselves in power, say he has intentionally withheld a speakership endorsement to maintain leverage further down the road.\n\n“No, no, no. I haven’t,” Trump said, when the talk show host suggested he had endorsed McCarthy for speaker. “No, I endorsed him in his race. But I haven’t endorsed anybody for speaker.”\n\n‘I don’t see him letting up on Mike anytime soon’\n\nInside Trump’s orbit, his anger towards another top Republican – Pence – has sown tension between allies who share his frustration with the visible role Pence aides have played in the public hearings and those who believe his attacks are both unwarranted and unhelpful.\n\nIf Trump’s goal is to dissuade Pence from potentially challenging him in a 2024 presidential primary, allies of the former vice president say it won’t work, noting that Pence is going to make that decision for himself and apart from Trump’s criticism. Still, Trump is expected to continue his onslaught this weekend when he appears at a campaign rally in Illinois for Republican incumbent Rep. Mary Miller, according to a GOP source close to Trump.\n\n“I don’t see him letting up on Mike anytime soon and, frankly, the more Mike is out there doing things with clear 2024 undertones, the more he is going to make trouble for himself,” said a Trump adviser.\n\nAt the same time, some in Trump’s orbit still believe that Pence does not pose a legitimate threat in 2024, particularly if he runs against the former President.\n\n“He has no political window,” another Trump adviser told CNN, referring to Pence’s chances of a successful presidential bid.\n\nPence, however, continues to walk a political tightrope. While the former vice president has not stood in the way of his former advisers testifying before the committee, he has also made a point to distance himself from the ongoing hearings, instead making a series of public appearances where he has focused on other issues like the economy and border security.\n\nHe also rescheduled a long-planned visit to Capitol Hill to meet with the Republican Study Committee on Tuesday. The hearing would have not only been awkward timing for Pence, but also would have potentially put Republicans like Banks, the head of the RSC, in the crosshairs, which most Republicans are eager to avoid.\n\nWhile Pence declined an invitation to also appear in Nashville last week, he recently joined Gov. Mike DeWine in the critical battleground state of Ohio for a roundtable on oil and gas sectors and he delivered a policy-heavy speech at the University Club of Chicago on Monday, previewing his pitch to primary voters if he does seek the GOP presidential nomination. The former vice president has visited all three early voting states over the past year – some more than once – and is due to release a book about his time in the administration later this fall.\n\nDuring his appearance in Chicago on Monday, Pence repeatedly implored Republicans to keep the focus on the future – a stark contrast with Trump’s almost singular focus on the 2020 election in his own public appearances.\n\n“In the days between now and Election Day, we need you to say yes – yes to the future, yes to a future of freedom and our cherished values. And the Republican Party must be the party of the future,” Pence said.\n\nCommittee members have said they could still issue a subpoena to try to compel Pence’s cooperation with the ongoing investigation, but after last Thursday’s hearing, multiple sources familiar with the probe acknowledged that remains unlikely at this stage.\n\nPence, meanwhile, has offered little indication that he would testify voluntarily, either publicly or behind closed-doors, a move that would certainly escalate the currently one-sided confrontation with Trump with little political upside.\n\nBut Pence isn’t the only White House veteran caught in Trump’s line of fire.\n\nThe former President has also complained to allies about the content of text messages that Meadows provided to the committee before halting his cooperation. Messages to Trump’s then-chief of staff from his own adult children, on-air allies at Fox News, and some of his staunchest supporters on Capitol Hill have revealed just how desperate some were for Trump to condemn the violence at the US Capitol in a timely manner – and their absolute exasperation with his initial response.\n\nTestimony from at least two former Meadows aides, Cassidy Hutchison and Alyssa Farah, has also proved critical in the ongoing January 6 probe, with Hutchison reportedly revealing in her closed-door deposition that Meadows burned papers in his office following a meeting with Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania where the two men discussed efforts to reject the 2020 election results. Perry was the first person to connect the then-President with Justice Department attorney Jeffrey Clark, who Trump considered putting in charge of the top law enforcement agency to help implement plans to overturn his defeat.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Gaborr Zachary Cohen", "Melanie Zanona", "Zachary Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/03/26/ukraine-russia-invasion-live-updates/7174667001/", "title": "Ukraine updates: Biden declares Putin 'cannot remain in power'", "text": "This story recounts all that occurred Saturday in the war in Ukraine. For the latest news, see our latest live updates story.\n\nIn a sweeping and forceful speech concluding a four-day trip to Europe, President Joe Biden cast the war in Ukraine on Saturday as part of an ongoing battle for freedom and ended with a blunt call for Russian President Vladimir Putin to be stopped.\n\n\"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,” Biden said during a visit to Warsaw, Poland, in his strongest comments to date about his desire to see Putin gone.\n\nShortly after the speech, a White House official speaking on the condition of anonymity said Biden was not calling for Putin to be removed from office.\n\n“The president’s point was that Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region,\" the official said. \"He was not discussing Putin’s power in Russia, or regime change.\"\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded that “it’s not up to the president of the U.S. and not up to the Americans to decide who will remain in power in Russia.”\n\n“Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Peskov said.\n\nBiden's speech was delivered hours after meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda during a historic visit Saturday where the allies presented a united front against Russian aggression and reaffirmed their commitment to the NATO alliance.\n\nBiden later met with Ukrainian refugees, including children who asked him to “say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother. He’s back there fighting.”\n\nBiden's visit comes as Moscow appears to be recalibrating its military strategies in Ukraine, even as several media outlets reported a Russian missile struck a fuel depot in the western Ukraine city of Lviv which has largely escaped the devastation other parts of the nation have suffered.\n\nRussia's military goals in Ukraine have been hazy since it began its invasion more than a month ago, and new statements suggest Moscow may consider claiming victory without completely overthrowing the Ukrainian government or capturing Kyiv.\n\nWestern analysts and leaders were skeptical of the Friday statements, where the deputy chief of the Russian general staff said his forces had largely achieved the \"main objectives\" of a first phase of the conflict. The power of the Ukrainian military has been \"considerably reduced,\" freeing up troops to \"focus on the main efforts to achieve the main goal, liberation of Donbas,\" said Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi.\n\nThe implications of the statement are difficult to determine, according to Stephen Biddle, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University who has studied U.S. wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.\n\nSpecial Subscription Offers\n\n\"It's plausible that they’re basically trying to ratchet their perceived war aims down to something they’ve already accomplished,\" he said.\n\nBefore the invasion, portions of the Donbas in southeastern Ukraine were already controlled by Russian-backed forces. Similarly skeptical, French President Emmanuel Macron said “it’s too soon to say” whether the Russians have changed their approach.\n\nBut what does appear clear: In the face of fierce Ukrainian resistance, the progress of Russian forces has largely stalled.

The mayor of the city says one of the targets was a fuel depot.\n\n►The U.N. human rights office said it has been challenging to confirm fatalities in Mariupol given the organization's strict methodology for counting the number of civilian deaths in conflict. The office says at least 1,035 civilians have been killed in Ukraine and 1,650 injured, but acknowledges that is an undercount.\n\n► The governor of the Kyiv region says that Russian forces have entered the city of Slavutych in northern Ukraine and seized a hospital there.\n\n► Britain has seized two jet aircraft belonging to Russian billionaire Eugene Shvidler as Western governments put pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin by targeting the luxury lifestyles of his closest supporters.

Police also found on his telephone photos of checkpoints in the region, which Kozytskyy said had been sent to two Russian telephone numbers.\n\nRockets hit an oil storage facility and an unspecified industrial facility, wounding at least five people. A thick plume of smoke and towering flames could be seen on Lviv’s outskirts hours after the attacks.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nBiden stirs concern with remark that Putin 'cannot remain in power'\n\nAfter four days of alliance building, emotional interactions with refugees and stirring words about the need to fight for democracy, one sentence that President Joe Biden appeared to tack on to the end of his final speech in Poland threatened to overshadow all he had achieved as he deals with the most significant foreign policy crisis of his presidency.\n\n“For God’s sake,” Biden said of Russian President Vladimir Putin, “this man cannot remain in power.”\n\nThe White House tried to quickly walk it back.\n\nBiden was not promoting regime change, said an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The point the president was trying to make in his remarks was that Putin “cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.”\n\nBiden may have been saying what he believes, but it was not smart policy to say it aloud, said Tom Schwartz, a historian of U.S. foreign relations at Vanderbilt University. Read more here.\n\nKremlin responds to Biden's condemnation of Putin\n\nA spokesperson for the Kremlin on Saturday said President Joe Biden's statement that Vladimir Putin \"cannot remain in power\" was \"extremely negative\" for U.S. relations with Russia.\n\n“Only Russians, who vote for their president, can decide that,” Dmitry Peskov told The Associated Press. “And of course it is unbecoming for the president of the U.S. to make such statements.”\n\nThe White House walked back Biden's initial statements in Poland, claiming the president was not endorsing regime change, but meant that \"Putin cannot be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors or the region.\"\n\nPeskov said that with Biden's statements, he was \"narrowing the window of opportunity for our bilateral relations under the current administration.\"\n\nUS giving $100 million for civilian security assistance in Ukraine\n\nThe U.S. will give Ukraine an additional $100 million in civilian security assistance, the State Department announced Saturday.\n\nThe funding will help pay for field gear, medical supplies, armored vehicles and other equipment for Ukraine’s police and border guards.\n\nUkrainian law enforcement officers are playing a key role in rescuing civilians, protecting convoys of fleeing refugees and providing security to civilian areas torn apart by Russia’s invasion, according to the State Department.\n\nThe administration repeated past warnings that it is helping document war crimes so those responsible can be held accountable.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: Autocracy ‘no match’ for liberty\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he arrived in Europe with a message for NATO, the European Union and all freedom-loving nations: “We must commit now to be in this fight for the long haul.”\n\n“We must remain unified today and tomorrow and the day after and for the years and decades to come,” he said.\n\n“It will not be easy. There will be cost, but it’s a price we have to pay Because the darkness that drives autocracy is ultimately no match for the flame of liberty.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to Russians: 'These are not the actions of a great nation'\n\nBiden appealed to ordinary Russians, first telling them – “if you’re able to listen” – that “you ... are not our enemy.”\n\nThe president said what they experienced at the hands of invaders in World War II is exactly what is happening to Ukrainians by the Russian military.\n\n“These are not the actions of a great nation,” Biden said of the bombings of hospitals, schools and maternity wards. “This war is not worthy of you, the Russian people.”\n\nBiden said Putin’s aggressions have cut his people off from the rest of the world and taken Russia back to the 19th century.\n\nBut Biden promised that the United States “will stand with you and the brave people of Ukraine who want peace.”\n\n“For God’s sake,” Biden said at the end of his speech, Putin \"cannot remain in power.\"\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: War in Ukraine 'strategic failure' for Putin\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Saturday the war in Ukraine has been “a strategic failure” for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPutin thought Ukrainians would “roll over and not fight,” Biden said.\n\n“Instead, Russian forces have met their match with brave and stiff Ukrainian resistance,” he said.\n\nRussia’s actions have also strengthened NATO’s resolve instead of pulling the alliance apart, Biden said.\n\n“The west is now stronger, more united than it has ever been,” he said.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden: The ruble is turning into rubble\n\nBiden said the sanctions imposed on Russia are having an impact.\n\n“The ruble has almost immediately reduced to rubble,” he said.\n\nMore:'It will be a lot harder on people.' How sanctions will impact ordinary Russians\n\nRussia’s economy is on track to be cut in half in the coming years and will no longer be among the 20 largest, he predicted.\n\nThat’s sapping Russia’s strength and ability to reject power, Biden continued.\n\n“It is Vladimir Putin who is to blame. Period,” he said.\n\n-- Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden warns against ‘forces of autocracy’\n\nPresident Joe Biden warned Saturday that the battle for democracy did not end with the Cold War.\n\n“Over the last 30 years, the forces of autocracy have lived all across the globe,” Biden said in remarks from the steps of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland.\n\nToday, Russia has “strangled” democracy, and Vladimir Putin has sought to do so elsewhere – not only in his homeland but by invalidating neighboring nations, Biden said.\n\n“Let us resolve to put the strength of democracies into action to thwart the designs of autocracy,” he said. “Let us remember that the test of this moment is the test of all time.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to Ukraine: 'We stand with you. Period.'\n\nBiden praised the brave resistance of Ukrainians and said he was there to deliver a message.\n\n“We stand with you. Period,” Biden said.\n\nBiden spoke in the packed courtyard of the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Poland where American and Polish flags waved in the background. When the president said he suspected Ukrainians were in the audience, a cheer went up.\n\nBiden said Ukrainians’ resistance is part of a larger fight for essential democratic principles. Those principles, he said, have always been under siege and every generation has to had to fight democracy’s mortal foes.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden in Warsaw: 'Be not afraid'\n\nIn remarks concluding his four-day trip to Europe, President Joe Biden stood on the steps of the Royal Castle in Warsaw on Saturday and recalled the words of Pope John Paul II: “Be not afraid.”\n\nThe White House billed Biden’s speech as a major address in which he would address efforts of the free world to hold Russia accountable for the war in Ukraine.\n\n“In this battle, we need to be clear-eyed,” Biden said. “This battle will not be won in days or months either. We need to steel ourselves for the long fight ahead.”\n\n– Michael Collins and Maureen Groppe\n\nRussian missile strikes Lviv fuel depot\n\nLVIV, Ukraine — Air raid sirens sounded Saturday afternoon in the western city of Lviv, and governor of the region Maxym Kozytsky reported “three powerful explosions near Lviv” without giving details of what was hit. Footage shot by The Associated Press showed thick plumes of smoke rising above the city.\n\nThe mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadoviy, tweeted that one of missiles struck an industrial area that include a fuel storage depot, but that there was no indication residences were hit.\n\n\"All emergency services are working on the location,\" he tweeted. \"Please stay in the shelters until the air alarm goes off.\"\n\nLviv, a city of over 700,000 roughly 70 kilometers (43 miles) east of Ukraine’s border with Poland, has been largely spared from major Russian attacks in recent weeks. Two weeks ago, the Russian forces fired missiles on a military training center near Lviv, which at the time was the most westward target, and killed 35 people.\n\nSince the beginning of the invasion, Lviv has become a safe harbor for some 200,000 displaced Ukrainians.\n\nThe explosions Saturday came as U.S. President Joe Biden was wrapping up a visit to neighboring NATO ally Poland in which he told Poland’s president that “ your freedom is ours.”\n\n- Associated Press\n\nBiden on Ukrainian refugees: ‘You just want to hug them’\n\nPresident Joe Biden got a glimpse of the human toll of the war in Ukraine on Saturday when he visited with a group of Ukrainian refugees whose resilience he said demonstrated “the depth and strength of the human spirit.”\n\n“They’re an amazing group of people,” he said.\n\nBiden mingled for several minutes with refugees and humanitarian officials who are providing assistance to them at a national stadium in Warsaw. The stadium serves as a processing center where refugees are issued identification cards allowing them to work, live, go to school and get social benefits.\n\nBiden stopped in a courtyard that is serving as a distribution site for the World Central Kitchen, the non-profit organization founded by Chef José Andrés. The group has set up a mobile kitchen and is providing hot meals to the refugees.\n\nBiden chatted briefly with Andrés before walking over to a corner where families were gathered around tables with plates of hamburgers, fries, sausages and other food. Wearing a face mask and accompanied by an interpreter, the president picked up a small girl wearing a pink jacket and held her in his arms for several minutes.\n\n“It’s so incredible to see all of those little children,” Biden told reporters. “You just want to hug them.”\n\nBiden said each of the children he spoke with asked him to “say a prayer for my dad or my grandfather or my brother. He’s back there fighting.”\n\n“I remember what it’s like when you have someone in a war zone,” said Biden, whose late son, Beau, was a veteran of the war in Iraq. “Every morning, you get up and you wonder. You just pray you don’t get that phone call.”\n\nAsked what his visit with the refugees made him think of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Biden responded: “He’s a butcher.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden stresses ‘sacred obligation’ to defend NATO allies\n\nPresident Joe Biden sought Saturday to reassure Poland that the U.S. would come to its defense if it should come under attack by Russia in an escalation of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe U.S. considers its commitment to defend other members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization “a sacred obligation,” Biden told Polish President Andrzej Duda during a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw.\n\n“You can count on that,” Biden said.\n\nThe U.S. has sent thousands of forces to Poland to shore up NATO’s eastern flank in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden visited with members of the 82nd Airborne Division on Friday during a stop in Rzeszów, Poland, about 60 miles from the border of Ukraine.\n\nIn Warsaw, Biden and Duda sat across from each other at a long table beneath a crystal chandelier as the two leaders prepared to discuss the humanitarian crisis sparked by the month-old war. More than 2 million Ukrainian refugees have fled to Poland to escape the war.\n\nSpeaking in Polish, Duda said Biden’s visit strengthened the bond between the two countries.\n\nRussia’s invasion has created “a huge tragedy” for the Ukrainian people and “a great sense of threat” for the Polish people, Duda said.\n\n“We know what Russian imperialism stands for, and we know what it means to be attacked by Russian armed forces,” Duda said.\n\nBiden stressed that stability in Europe “is critically important to the United States” and said the most important criterion is that NATO stay “absolutely, completely, thoroughly united” and that there be “no separation in our points of view.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nUkraine official: Russia destroyed 4,500 houses, 400 educational institutions\n\nDuring a briefing at the Ukraine Media Center, Ukraine’s development minister said Russian forces have destroyed about 4,500 houses and almost 400 education institutions since the war began last month, according to the Ukrainian news outlet Pravda.\n\n“These figures are growing every day, and perhaps every hour,” said Oleksiy Chernyshov, Ukraine’s minister of development of communities and territories, according to the report. “At this time, when we say the bombing is going on, people are dying, infrastructure is being destroyed.\"\n\nHe added that about 100 factories and enterprises and 150 health care facilities were also destroyed and noted that not all damage can be assessed until the conflict has ceased.\n\nThe price tag on the damage could reach “tens of billions” of dollars, he said.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nEuropean nuclear group severing ties with Russia and Belarus\n\nThe European Council for Nuclear Research is suspending work in Belarus and Russia in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOn Saturday the 23 member states of CERN Council agreed to halt all events in Russia and Belarus and all scientists in all scientific committees of institutions in Russia and Belarus.\n\nIn the announcement Friday, the CERN Council said the restrictions were agreed upon and implemented in an act of solidarity with the Ukrainian people.\n\nEarlier this month, the CERN Council condemned the military invasion and agreed not to engage in new collaborations with Russia. At the council's June session the group said they will consider more sanctions on Russia and Belarus.\n\n- Ana Faguy\n\nBiden arrives for meeting with Duda\n\nWith pomp and fanfare, President Joe Biden arrived at the Presidential Palace in Warsaw on Saturday for a meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda on how allies are responding to the humanitarian crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine.\n\nBiden’s limousine pulled into the palace courtyard shortly after 12:30 p.m. local time.\n\nDuda greeted the president as he stepped out of the car. The two chatted briefly, shook hands with a line of dignitaries and then participated in a formal arrival ceremony that included the playing of each country’s national anthem and a military procession.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nHolocaust memorial damaged by Russian forces\n\nRussian invaders fired on and damaged Drobytsky Yar, a Holocaust Memorial outside Kharkiv.\n\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Defense announced the attack on the memorial, which first opened in 2002, via Twitter.\n\n\"The Nazis have returned,\" the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense tweeted. \"Exactly 80 years later.\"\n\nThe memorial was created in honor of the 16,000 people killed after Nazi troops invaded the town in 1941.\n\n-Ana Faguy\n\nUkraine: Women perform significant role in military resistance to Russia\n\nWomen make up 15% of Ukraine's military, with nearly 7,000 women serving in its Air Force alone, a top Ukrainian official said Saturday. Ukraine’s military has 250,000 active-duty troops.\n\n“Women are the heart of the resilience of local communities,” People’s Deputy Lesia Vasylenko said in a tweet. “Heroic mothers and their inspiring daughters. This is the (Ukrainian) resistance.”\n\nThe figure is on par with other nations worldwide, many of which have significantly larger militaries.\n\nAbout 16.5% of the active-duty U.S. military are women, according to a 2020 Government Accountability Office report. Some branches of the military are more gender diverse than others – roughly 21% of the Air Force is comprised of women compared to 9% of Marines – a 2021 Department of Defense report shows.\n\nAbout 11% of the United Kingdom Regular Armed Forces are women, according to a 2021 report. The Center for Strategic & International Studies calculated that roughly 4% of the Russian military was women in 2020. The percentage of women in the other reporting NATO nations’ militaries range from 0.3% (Turkey) to 20% (Hungary), a 2020 NATO report shows.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nRussia conducted 60 cyberattacks against Ukraine, information protection agency says\n\nUkraine's information protection agency on Friday said that, between March 15-22, Russia conducted 60 cyberattacks against the nation’s \"critical infrastructure and government organizations,” but that most were limited in impact.\n\n“The number of attacks is growing, but most of them are unsuccessful,” Viktor Zhora, deputy head of Ukraine’s State Service of Special Communication and Protection of Information, said in a March 23 briefing, according to the agency’s Telegram post. “Even those that are successful do not affect the operation of critical information infrastructure.”\n\nZhora added that the current activity is less serious than the activity tracked by the agency earlier this year.\n\n- Ella Lee\n\nRussian troops enter city of Slavutych, seize hospital\n\nLVIV, Ukraine -- The governor of the Kyiv region says that Russian forces have entered the city of Slavutych and seized a hospital there.\n\nSlavutych is located north of Kyiv and west of Chernihiv, outside the exclusion zone that was established around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant after the 1986 disaster. It is home to workers at the Chernobyl site.\n\nGovernor Oleksandr Pavlyuk said Saturday that the Russians also kidnapped the city’s mayor, but some media reported later in the day that the mayor was released swiftly. Neither claim could be verified independently .\n\nThe governor said that residents of Slavutych took to the streets with Ukrainian flags to protest the Russian invasion.\n\n“The Russians opened fire into the air. They threw flash-bang grenades into the crowd. But the residents did not disperse, on the contrary, more of them showed up,” Pavlyuk said.\n\n- Associated Press\n\nDeath toll of children reaches 136\n\nIn the month since the Russian invasion began, 136 children have been killed.\n\nReuters reported that 64 of the children were killed in the Kyiv region and 50 were killed in the Donetsk region. An additional 199 children have been wounded.\n\nThe Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said Thursday, the civilian death toll in Ukraine has exceeded 1,000 since the start of the war.\n\n- Ana Faguy\n\nTop Ukrainian officials to attend Biden speech in Warsaw\n\nA pair of top Ukrainian officials will be on hand in Warsaw Saturday when President Joe Biden delivers a speech on holding Russia accountable for its month-long war against Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said in a message on Twitter that he and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba will attend the president’s address.\n\nBiden started the final day of his four-day trip to Europe by dropping by a meeting between Reznikov and Kuleba and their U.S. counterparts – Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Reznikov tweeted a photo of the meeting – sans Biden – and said they were discussing “current issues & cooperation in political & defense directions.”\n\n“In the evening we’ll also be present at @POTUS speech on the Russian war against Ukraine,” Reznikov wrote.\n\nBiden will deliver his remarks at the Royal Castle in Warsaw.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n100,000-plus flee Ukraine on Friday\n\nMore than 100,00 people left Ukraine Friday, the State Border Guard Service Ukraine said.\n\nTwo-thirds of those who left crossed Ukraine's western borders with EU countries as well as Moldova. The State Border Guard Service estimated 45,000 left Friday night alone.\n\nMeanwhile, many men are returning to Ukraine to defend the country, the Ukrainian government said. 21,000 people arrived in Ukraine Friday night. The State Border Guard Service said more than 420,000 Ukrainians have returned since Russia first invaded.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that 10 million people have fled Ukraine since the conflict began last month. Friday's flow of refugees was significantly higher than in recent days. On Wednesday, about 43,000 fled and around 62,000 fled Thursday, according to government figures.\n\n- Ana Faguy\n\nUkraine president Zelenskyy makes surprise appearance at Doha Forum\n\nDOHA, Qatar — Ukraine's president made a surprise video appearance Saturday at Qatar's Doha Forum, calling on the energy-rich nation and others to boost their production to counteract the loss of Russian energy supplies.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy called on the United Nations and world powers to come to his aid, as he has in a series of other addresses given around the world since the start of the war Feb. 24. He compared Russia's destruction of the port city of Mariupol to the Syrian and Russian destruction wrought on the city of Aleppo in the Syrian war.\n\n\"They are destroying our ports,\" Zelenskyy said. \"The absence of exports from Ukraine will deal a blow to countries worldwide.\"\n\nThe loss of Ukrainian wheat already has worried Mideast nations like Egypt, which relies on those exports.\n\nZelenskyy called on countries to increase their exports of energy — something particularly important as Qatar is a world leader in the export of natural gas.\n\nZelenskyy criticized Russia for what he described as threatening the world with its nuclear weapons, raising the possibility of tactical nuclear weapons being used on the battlefield.\n\n\"Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\nHe also noted that Muslims in Ukraine would have to fight during the upcoming holy fasting month of Ramadan.\n\n\"We have to ensure this sacred month of Ramadan is not overshadowed by the misery of people in Ukraine,\" he said.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nPresident Biden to meet with refugees, deliver speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Saturday will cap his European trip talking to Ukrainian refugees in Poland and delivering a speech on holding Russia accountable for its invasion and upholding democratic values.\n\nJake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, previewed Biden’s remarks as a major address that will “speak to the stakes of this moment, the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world, and why it is so important that the free world sustain unity and resolve in the face of Russian aggression.”\n\nBiden will also put the war in historical context and describe where he sees it going from here, Sullivan said.\n\nBefore delivering those remarks at the Royal Castle in Warsaw, Biden will meet with Polish President Andrzej Duda at the Presidential Palace\n\n“The suffering that is taking place now is at your doorstep,” Biden told Duda on Friday at a meeting in Rzeszów, where the influx of refugees is the largest. “You're the ones who are risking, in some cases, your lives and risking all you know to try to help. And the American people are proud to support your efforts.”\n\nOn Thursday, Biden announced the U.S. will take in up to 100,000 Ukrainians and provide more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance.\n\nPoland has taken in more than 2 million refugees, and the numbers continue to grow.\n\n“We have never experienced anything like that throughout our history,” Duda told Biden.\n\nOn Saturday, Biden will meet with refugees at the National Stadium in Warsaw. The stadium is a processing center where refugees are issued identification cards allowing them to work, live, go to school and get social benefits.\n\n“I'm here in Poland to see firsthand the humanitarian crisis,” Biden said Friday, expressing his disappointment that he can’t cross the border into Ukraine for security reasons.\n\nBiden has been in Europe since Wednesday, meeting with NATO allies and other European and world leaders.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies announced new sanctions on Russia, additional help for Ukraine, and discussed beefing up force presence in Eastern Europe in the near and longer-term.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nUK sees Russians reluctant to enter urban war\n\nLONDON — Britain's Defense Ministry says Russia continues to besiege a number of major Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Mariupol.\n\nA daily update says Russian forces are proving reluctant to engage in large scale urban infantry operations, rather preferring to rely on the indiscriminate use of air and artillery bombardments in an attempt to demoralize defending forces.\n\nThe assessment says it is likely Russia will continue to use its heavy firepower on urban areas as it looks to limit its own already considerable losses, at the cost of further civilian casualties.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy: Ukraine will not cede territory to end Russian invasion\n\nZelenskyy has again appealed to Russia to negotiate an end to the war, but says Ukraine would not agree to give up any of its territory for the sake of peace.\n\nIn his nightly video address to the nation Friday, Zelenskyy appeared to be responding to Col. Gen Sergei Rudskoi, deputy chief of the Russian general staff, who said Russian forces would now focus on “the main goal, the liberation of Donbas.”\n\nRussian-backed separatists have controlled part of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine since 2014, and Russian forces have been battling to seize more of the region from Ukraine, including the besieged city of Mariupol.\n\nRudskoi’s statement also was a suggestion that Russia may be backing away from trying to take Kyiv and other major cities where its offensive has stalled. Zelenskyy noted that Russian forces have lost thousands of troops but still haven’t been able to take Kyiv or Kharkiv, the second-largest city.\n\nUkraine destroys Russian vessel; Moscow taps troops in Georgia\n\nUkrainian forces destroyed a Russian transport ship in the port city of Berdyansk that appeared to be on a resupply mission, a senior Defense official said Friday.\n\nThe attack on Thursday blew up a tank-landing ship at its pier, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence assessments. The Russians have 22 warships in the Black Sea.\n\nRussian combat power in Ukraine, which dipped below 90% for the first time this week, is now between 85% and 90%, the official said. For the first time, Russia appears to be drawing reinforcements from its troops based in Georgia. Combat power includes troops, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, warplanes, warships and ballistic missiles.\n\nRussia has also drawn down its stockpile of precision-guided weapons and is relying more on so-called dumb bombs to bombard cities, the official said. Russia has used about 50% of its air-launched cruise missiles. Russia’s cruise missiles have at times failed to launch or hit their targets.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nPoll shows Americans support Russian sanctions, think Biden should be tougher\n\nA majority of Americans are supportive of the harsh sanctions on Russia but believe Biden needs to be tougher on the Kremlin after its invasion of Ukraine, according to a poll commissioned by the Associated Press and NORC released Thursday.\n\nThe poll, which surveyed 1,082 U.S. adults from Thursday to Monday, found 56% of Americans believe Biden's response to Russia hasn't been tough enough, including a majority of 53% of Democrats. A very small percent, about 6%, said they thought Biden had been \"too tough,\" the poll shows.\n\nAcross the board, Americans of both political parties were supportive of the harsh economic blows to Russia. The poll showed 68% were supportive of economic sanctions in general with 70% saying they supported the recent banning of oil imported from Russia, which in turn caused gas prices to rise.\n\n— Christal Hayes\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/25/oil-train-conversion-sit-anniversary-healing-garden-expansion-news-around-states/111368136/", "title": "Oil train conversion, sit-in anniversary: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A three-day event is marking the 60th anniversary of the state’s first sit-in against racial segregation. Five of the surviving demonstrators were on hand Monday for a remembrance at Alabama State University in Montgomery. Civil rights lawyer Fred Gray of Tuskegee was also set to participate, according to an announcement from the school. Alabama State, a center of activity during the civil rights era, is also hosting events through Wednesday, including a panel discussion of elected officials and a presentation of scholarly papers about the sit-in and its legacy. A student sit-in began Feb. 25, 1960, at the Montgomery County Courthouse snack bar, where 35 black women and men asked to be served in defiance of the city’s segregation law. They were inspired by the Greensboro four, who started the sit-ins campaign at a lunch counter in North Carolina just weeks earlier. Then-Gov. John Patterson, a segregationist, made Alabama State expel any students who participated by threatening its state funding. Nine students identified as leaders were kicked out of school.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Landslides that caused road closures last year have raised concerns about whether there will be full access to Denali National Park and Preserve for the upcoming tourism season. The National Park Service has said it plans to open the entire Denali Park Road by early June, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The 92-mile road running through steep mountain passes provides the only driving access into the park’s 7,344 square miles. The park service repeatedly closed parts of the road last summer amid heavy rains, rockfall and mudslides. Recent National Park Service surveys found the speed of a landslide at Pretty Rocks section of the road has increased dramatically since September, and the road was slumping nearly 2 inches every day after August. Private vehicles are restricted beyond Mile 15 of the road. But hundreds of thousands of visitors each year use buses run by commercial operators to take them farther into the park. Business owners inside the park rely on the road to bring in supplies for guests.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A new task force will focus on decreasing cases of animal hoarding across Pima County. The Pima Animal Care Center and other community organizations will meet Tuesday to discuss how to help overwhelmed pet owners before they get to the point of hoarding. Center officials say animal hoarding is not necessarily just about the number of pets in a home but about whether the owner can actually support them, the Arizona Daily Star reports. Kristen Hassen, animal services director, says the task force wants to change how hoarding cases are handled. It will work with pet owners and connect them with community resources. Two part-time public health nurses will be available to talk with owners, Hassen says. In addition, owners will get assistance with spaying, neutering and pet vaccination services. In 2019, the Pima County animal shelter took in almost 19,000 animals – many from hoarding situations and with medical conditions.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: The Baxter County Historical and Genealogical Society will meet Tuesday at 6p.m. in the Knox Community Room of the Baxter County Library. Admission is free, and guests are welcome. The evening’s guest speaker will be Roy Stovall, speaking about “The de Soto Entrada” and its significance to Arkansas history and archaeology. Conquistador Hernando de Soto and his men, the first Europeans to explore Arkansas, trekked 4,000 miles from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Brazos River 480 years ago. The adventurers spent two years in what would become Arkansas before de Soto met his death near the Mississippi River. Stovall has made an extensive study of the expedition as a lifetime member of the Arkansas Archeological Society.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The first new state park campground on the California coast in 30 years is expected to feature ocean frontage on Monterey Bay when it opens in 2022. Fort Ord Dunes State Park has 4 miles of ocean beach on the bay and is located near Marina, south of Moss Landing and north of Monterey, The San Francisco Chronicle reports. A former military unit, Fort Ord Dunes opened 10 years ago with little supporting infrastructure and is one of a handful of state parks providing free parking and access. The area is sometimes overlooked because unlike most state parks along the Pacific Coast Highway, Fort Ord Dunes does not have a direct turnoff to parking from Highway 1. A boardwalk has been planned to allow access to the beach without damage crossing sensitive dunes. Two overlook areas are expected to provide views of Monterey Bay, historic Fort Ord, and oceanfront cities Sand City, Seaside and Monterey.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: The Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad has debuted its first locomotive that runs on oil, a more environmentally friendly fuel source that holds less fire risk than a traditional coal-burning engine. For the past two years, the D&SNG’s crews have worked to convert the No. 493, an early 1900s coal-burning locomotive, to be able to run off oil. It’s the first of what’s expected to be several conversions from coal-fired to oil-burning engines as the city’s top tourist attraction braces itself for the future. “We need to be prepared and just recognize the changing climate,” owner Al Harper told The Durango Herald. Coal-burning engines can emit small cinders from their smokestacks and start fires. Harper said it’s important to have the option of running oil-powered locomotives during extreme drought. This issue came to a head in summer 2018, when drought, high fire danger and the 416 Fire caused the D&SNG to shut down for more than 40 days.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStratford: A school board member who was accused of sexually assaulting a teen is resisting calls to resign from his post. Stratford Board of Education Member Robert DeLorenzo took a plea deal in the case and was convicted of first-degree reckless endangerment, The Connecticut Post reports. Democratic Town Committee Chair Stephanie Phillips and others have called on DeLorenzo, a Democrat, to resign from the board. But DeLorenzo says he has no plans to step down and insists the efforts to get him to resign are politically motivated. “I said 10 times I am not stepping down,” he told the newspaper. Police said DeLorenzo assaulted a 13-year-old girl, who told authorities that DeLorenzo told her he would kill her if she told anyone about it. DeLorenzo denies ever assaulting the girl.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state’s Council on Development Finance on Monday approved a $4.5million grant for Amazon, which says it is bringing about 1,000 full-time jobs to the former General Motors plant in Newport. A Nevada-based distribution company that counts Amazon as a client plans those jobs and more seasonal ones for a 3.7 million-square-foot logistics warehouse, according to a presentation from Amazon at the Buena Vista conference center in New Castle. Amazon’s application for the money was not readily available to the public during the hearing. Monday’s agenda offered little more detail on the application, only revealing that Amazon was seeking the $4.5 million to “establish its operations in Wilmington, Delaware.” The $4.5 million will come from Delaware’s Strategic Fund, a pool of state money meant for attracting businesses and growing jobs in the First State.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Children’s Museum of D.C. officially opened Monday. The new attraction is the perfect place to spark a child’s curiosity and creativity, WUSA-TV reports. Located at 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest, adjacent to the Ronald Reagan Building, it features exhibits including the Dream Machine, which allows kids to climb up to the clouds and slide down a huge slide that is also wheelchair-accessible. The museum was built to connect with all kids and also includes a mother’s room with stroller parking, quiet rooms for sensory-friendly kids, open captioning with audio for every video and, upon request, a personalized verbal description and sighted guide for guests who are blind. Admission is just $10.95 for adults and children over 1 year old. Pop-ups and family workshops are also expected to be a part of the experience.\n\nFlorida\n\nTavares: Seven decades after four young black men were accused of raping a white woman in a 1949 case now seen as a miscarriage of justice, the central Florida county where their case took place has erected a monument in their honor. The monument honoring Charles Greenlee, Walter Irvin, Samuel Shepherd and Ernest Thomas was unveiled Friday during a ceremony at the Lake County Historic Courthouse. The granite memorial for the men known as the Groveland Four features a bronze plaque imprinted with a written account of the men’s ordeal, which was prepared with the help of their families. “While we cannot change the past, we can learn from it, and we can assure that our institutions today provide equal and fair justice to all,” said Lake County Commission Chairman Leslie Campione. A year ago, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state’s three-member Cabinet granted posthumous pardons to the men. The case of the Groveland Four is considered a blight on Florida’s history. One of the four was killed before he could be charged. One of the remaining men was fatally shot by the local sheriff and another shot and wounded by the sheriff and a deputy. A third man was wrongly imprisoned.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgians could get a chance to vote on making it easier to sue state government under a constitutional amendment moving forward in the General Assembly. The House voted 163-0 on Thursday to pass House Resolution 1023. It moves to the Senate, where it would need a two-thirds vote to make it to the election ballot for a referendum. “It makes sense to amend the constitution so that people can come to the courthouse and seek redress,” said Rep. Andy Welch, a McDonough Republican who has been pushing the effort for several years. Bills to broaden the grounds for suits have been vetoed twice, first by Gov. Nathan Deal in 2016 and then again by Gov. Brian Kemp last year. However, the governor has no power to reject a proposed constitutional amendment. Lawmakers are reacting to a 2014 state Supreme Court decision that says state and local governments can only be sued when they have waived a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity. That’s a principle descended from English common law, commonly described as “the king can do no wrong.” When Georgia overthrew the king in 1776, that cloak of legal protection transferred to the state government.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A bill aimed at raising the minimum age to purchase tobacco and electronic smoking devices has stalled in the state House of Representatives. The bill proposed to make it illegal for anyone younger than 25 to buy the products, West Hawaii Today reports. Democratic Reps. Richard Creagan and John Mizuno, the chairman of the House Committee on Health, introduced the bill that was unanimously passed by the health committee Feb. 4. The measure also passed a full reading on the House floor but did not secure required hearings before the House Judiciary and Finance committees. The bill subsequently missed a deadline for moving bills with multiple referrals to a final committee. The bill cited the harmful effect of nicotine on developing brains, particularly youth and young adults and unborn children, as well as a study by the Institute of Medicine that found raising the minimum purchase age led to decreases in smoking prevalence and mortality.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A transgender rights group says it’s suing the state over a proposed bill that makes it illegal for someone to change their gender identity on a birth certificate, according to a television station’s report. The National Association of Transgendered People prepared the lawsuit and planned to file it Monday, KBOI-TV reports. The House Education Committee held a hearing on the bill last week and recommended sending it to the full House for a vote. The bill introduced by Rep. Julianne Young, a Republican, would ban changes to a birth certificate if more than a year has passed since the person’s birth. The bill is in conflict with a 2018 ruling by a federal magistrate that said Idaho must accept applications from transgender people who wish to change their gender on their birth certificates to confirm with their gender identity. Idaho has been complying with the federal ruling.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Supporters of the revitalization of the historic Pullman neighborhood say they have the money for more restoration work, five years after then-President Barack Obama designated part of the area as a national monument. Longtime supporters gathered with National Park Service officials Wednesday on the city’s Far South Side to celebrate the five-year anniversary of the monument designation as leaders unveiled the latest renderings for a more than $56 million revitalization project. A central part of the restoration is the Pullman Clock Tower and Administration building, which will convert into a visitors center. That’s expected to be completed next year. The neighborhood was built by industrialist George M. Pullman in the 19th century for people who worked at his state-of-the-art factory building luxurious railroad sleeping cars. The harsh working conditions aboard Pullman’s sleeping cars helped spur the birth of the African American labor movement.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local government officials and environmentalists oppose a project proposing to burn or harvest parts of the Hoosier National Forest because they are concerned it could contaminate the only source of drinking water for more than 140,000 people. The U.S. Forest Service approved the Houston South Vegetation Management and Restoration project last week. Federal officials point out that projects such as this are a common means of maintaining forest health. But critics say it could worsen existing water-quality issues in the Lake Monroe reservoir, which serves all of Monroe County. “Lake Monroe is the surface drinking water source for not only Monroe County but also surrounding areas,” said Monroe County Commissioner Julie Thomas, a vocal opponent of the project. “We’re really concerned.” It wasn’t until Lake Monroe was created in the 1960s that Bloomington finally had a stable source of drinking water.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Supreme Court elected Justice Susan Christensen as its next chief justice Monday, making her only the second woman to rise to chief of the seven-member court. Appointed by Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds in 2018, Christensen is part of a new, more conservatively constituted court. Reynolds has named three justices to the court since becoming governor and will name a fourth after acting Chief Justice David Wiggins retires next month. Wiggins, an appointee of Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack, became acting chief after the unexpected death of Chief Justice Mark Cady in November from a heart attack. Cady had chosen Wiggins to take the post if he were to become incapacitated. Wiggins announced last month his plans to retire March 13. Christensen was a lawyer before becoming a district court judge. She is married with five children and five grandchildren. Her father, Jerry Larson, was a justice on the Iowa Supreme Court for 30 years until his retirement in 2008.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State lawmakers are considering making changes to the criminal public offender registry system and cutting back on penalties. The expansive system that publicly tracks convicted criminals after they’ve served their time covers a wide range of crimes beyond sex offenses, Kansas News Service reports. Now, some policymakers believe it’s time to ease the rules. Marc Schultz, convicted of manslaughter for hitting and killing a cyclist while driving drunk in 2010, said he didn’t intentionally commit a violent crime but still has to be listed among those who committed crimes like sexual assault, human trafficking or kidnapping. “When people look at that map, they don’t know the difference between the dots that they see,” Schultz said, noting a map with too many offenders makes it less useful for the public. Proposed changes include reducing penalties for not registering properly and changing the 15-year registration term for those convicted of crimes, like drug distribution, to only face a five-year registration term.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Authorities are asking for the public’s help in finding those responsible for poaching two elk. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources said on its Facebook page that two bull elk were poached Thursday in the Ball Creek area of Knott County. The post shows a photo of two severed elk heads. The department said it is offering a $4,000 reward leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. It said the League of Kentucky Sportsmen and Safari Club International’s Kentuckiana Chapter donated toward the reward. Tips can be called in to the department or to Kentucky State Police in Hazard.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A textile museum at Louisiana State University is growing and will reopen its renovated, larger space with an exhibition celebrating four decades of its collection. The opening exhibition in the LSU Textile and Costume Museum’s new gallery will include a 1960s special occasion dress designed by American designer James Galanos; a 1938 SEC Championship LSU boxing robe; and the outfit worn by Baton Rouge WAFB-TV personality “Buckskin Bill” Black. Other items include clothing from past governors and their spouses; an 1840s/1850s day dress; a Haspel labeled seersucker man’s suit; and non-western artifacts such as a 19th century Chinese “dragon robe.” The exhibition can be viewed by the public Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. from March 30 to April 6. The museum will celebrate the grand opening of its exhibition gallery March 28. The event will feature local reality TV star Anthony Ryan, winner of “Project Runway All Stars” and an alumnus of the university’s textiles, apparel and merchandising program.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: State conservation officials are asking residents to take a few steps to cut down the spread of invasive species. The Pine Tree State’s effort is taking place during National Invasive Species Awareness Week. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry said the state suffers from non-native species such as the emerald ash borer and green crab that have a negative impact on natural resources. The department is asking residents to take steps such as clipping the webs of browntail moth caterpillars before they get active. The caterpillars can cause a painful rash in humans. Residents should also avoid releasing aquarium fish and plants, live bait or other exotic animals into the wild, the state said. Another helpful step is to learn how to identify invasive plants that might be growing on private property and take steps to control them.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Some state lawmakers want to ban the practice of offering sexual assault victims a waiver that says they don’t want to go forward their case. The Baltimore Sun reports some legislators want to do away with the waivers so that victims aren’t discouraged to report and prosecute the crimes. Experts say investigators sometimes misuse waiver forms to pressure victims to stop pursuing charges or to get cases off their plate without a thorough investigation. Some police departments have recently stopped the practice. But the Harford County Sheriff’s Office continues to use waiver forms. The sheriff said the waivers are used “sparingly” and only when a victim has requested that an investigation end. The proposed legislation would stop police from presenting victims with forms that prevent prosecution of the crime or waive the victim’s rights.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A week after Plymouth Rock was defaced with graffiti, it appears as if vandals have targeted the historic town’s 9/11 memorial. A statue of a police officer was knocked over sometime over the weekend, and two nearby lamp posts were knocked over. The statue’s head was knocked off. A nearby figure of a firefighter was untouched. On Feb. 16, Plymouth Rock, the symbolic spot of the Pilgrims’ landing 400 years ago, was covered in paint. Vandals also targeted the Pilgrim Maiden statue and several other significant spots. It was not clear if the two vandalism cases are connected. The Sept. 11 memorial, unveiled in 2004, was privately funded by businessman and former Selectman Richard Quintal, who donated the land on which the memorial sits. No arrests have been announced in either case.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State officials have recognized three trails as “Pure Michigan Trails” because they provide access to high-quality scenic views. They also designated three communities as “Pure Michigan Trail Towns.” The label refers to towns or cities along trail routes that provide vibrant experiences for users. The Canada Lakes Pathway in Luce County, the historic Haywire Grade in Schoolcraft and Alger counties, and the Kal-Haven Trail in Van Buren and Kalamazoo counties joined the ranks of Pure Michigan Trails. Cheboygan, Reed City and Oakland County’s Orion Township were added to the roster of Pure Michigan Trail Towns. “With four seasons of trail recreation fun available, Michigan truly is home to a variety of great trails and trail towns,” said Paul Yauk, DNR state trails coordinator. He said the trails and towns receiving Pure Michigan designation provide some of the state’s elite trail experiences; promote healthy lifestyles; conserve natural and cultural resources; and boost local economies.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The city has paused plans to issue its own identification cards that would be available regardless of a person’s immigration status. Mayor Jacob Frey said Friday that the move was made in part because of concerns that the information could be used to identify immigrants for deportation. He said the city wants to ensure “people signing up for the ID card are protected.” The Star Tribune reports the discussions about how and whether to proceed come at a time when many cities are looking for ways to resist immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump. Minneapolis approved the creation of a municipal ID program in 2018 but had been discussing it for many years. Supporters said having a form of identification is crucial to opening a bank account, receiving health care and, in some cases, picking up children from school.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: About 450 homes were damaged in Hinds and Madison counties from flooding in the Jackson metro area earlier this month. Before the flooding from the Pearl River started, officials had projected up to 2,500 structures, including about 1,000 homes, could be affected. Mississippi Emergency Management officials said Monday in an email that the number is a rough estimate and is likely to change. MEMA on Monday began conducting in-depth damage assessments. In Rankin County, about 18 structures reportedly were damaged, with fewer than five that were homes, Rankin County Emergency Management Director Mike Word said. The Pearl River at Jackson is slowly receding but will take a few days before it reaches below-flood stage levels. MEMA officials said the water has receded across affected areas around Jackson, and river levels will continue to fall throughout the week.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A fired Kansas City Public Schools secretary who was among seven employees accused of falsifying attendance data in a bid to help the district regain accreditation said she and her co-workers were following orders from top administrators. Former Central Middle School secretary LaQuyn Collier told The Kansas City Star that she gave administrators “exactly what they said they needed.” She and another fired employee have hired an attorney to try to get their jobs back. Emails obtained by the newspaper show that administrators asked secretaries to gather at the district’s central office to review “several attendance recording issues” in the summer of 2014 during the time in which an investigation found the tampering happened. Attendance is among the criteria Missouri uses in giving out performance scores that determine whether a district is unaccredited, partially accredited or fully accredited.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana State Parks’ free lease of 337 acres at Hell Creek on Fort Peck Reservoir expires in 2021, and between now and then, the state is planning to negotiate a new 20-year lease with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Hell Creek Marina and adjoining state park create a complexity not found at other state parks, the Billings Gazette reports. Clint and Deb Thomas own and run Hell Creek Marina. The marina operates on a lease from Montana State Parks, which oversees adjacent Hell Creek State Park. “I am not a concessionaire,” Thomas emphasized. He owns the marina buildings, including a small motel, docks, store and other improvements to the property. “I’ve got $2 million invested.” That’s not the case at other areas, such as Tongue River Reservoir State Park, where Montana State Parks owns the marina’s facilities and hires a concessionaire to operate it.\n\nNebraska\n\nGretna: A wildlife biologist will present a program next month about people-powered science and wildlife observation. The presentation March 15 is part of a Sunday speaker series at Schramm Education Center. The presenter will be Alie Mayes, a biologist with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. Her program is scheduled to begin at 2 p.m. at the center, which sits along Nebraska Highway 31 near the Platte River, about 6 miles south of Exit 432 off Interstate 80. Contact Amber Schiltz for more information at amber.schiltz@nebraska.gov or 402-332-5022.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A sanctuary garden for those affected by the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting is expanding. The city will be adding more features – including a fire pit, a walkway covered in greenery and a pear tree – to the Healing Garden, which was created also as a place to honor the 58 victims, KTNV-TV reports. City officials say they hope to complete the expansion in May, with access for the public in June. A Callery pear tree near the World Trade Center in New York City became known as the “Survivor Tree” after the 9/11 attacks. Its seedlings are given to communities who have also experienced tragedy. The Oct. 1, 2017, shooting during an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The volunteer-built garden features a tree for each of the 58 victims and an oak that represents life. It was dedicated during the shooting’s first anniversary.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Statistics released for 2018 show that heart disease was the leading cause of death in New Hampshire, marking the first time in over a decade that it surpassed cancer, state health officials said Monday. More than 2,600 New Hampshire residents died from heart disease that year, the state Department of Health and Human Services said. Nationally, heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women. About 647,000 Americans die from heart disease each year, accounting for 1 in every 4 deaths. High blood pressure, high cholesterol and smoking are major risk factors for heart disease.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHardwick Township: A forest fire burning through a popular hiking area that is crossed by the Appalachian Trail and a major interstate highway was about 80% contained by Monday afternoon, state fire officials said. The fire began Sunday afternoon on Mount Tammany, a steep, rugged area of New Jersey’s Worthington State Forest and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area on the New Jersey-Pennsylvania border. Fire officials said about 80 acres had burned by Monday. A helicopter and 40 firefighters were working to put the fire out Monday, officials said. Greg McLaughlin, chief of the New Jersey Forest Fires Service, said no injuries had been reported. A cause for the fire had not been determined, officials said. Chris Franek, the state forest fire service’s assistant division fire warden, said fires on similar terrain usually burn upward, but Sunday’s fire, which started below a trail at an elevation of about 1,400 feet, burned downhill because the trail area is rocky and without abundant vegetation. He said fires are rare there at this time of year because the area usually has a layer of snow.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An analysis shows the city’s police are taking 93% longer to respond to 911 calls than nine years ago. KOAT-TV reports an examination on the Albuquerque Police Department’s response times shows officers now take an average of 48 minutes to arrive to a scene. That’s a 23-minute jump from 2011. Albuquerque Emergency Communications Center manager Erika Wilson says police are during the best they can with the resources available. Albuquerque police say the department currently has about 950 officers. In 2011, it had about 1,100 officers. “We are in a pickle,” said Shaun Willoughby, president of the Albuquerque Police Officers Association, the union that represents Albuquerque cops. “The Albuquerque Police Department is understaffed. It has been for a number of years.” FBI statistics show Albuquerque had a violent crime rate of 1,365 per 100,000 residents in 2018. The national rate was about 369 violent crimes per 100,000 residents that year.\n\nNew York\n\nSeneca Falls: A long-simmering leadership dispute in the Cayuga Indian Nation erupted over the weekend with bulldozers razing several buildings on Cayuga land in western New York. The buildings demolished early Saturday in Seneca Falls housed several businesses, a longhouse and a day care center. A statement from the Cayuga Nation said it demolished the buildings for public safety reasons. It said the properties were seized in 2014 by a group that disputes the authority of Cayuga leader Clint Halftown, who ordered the demolition. Halftown’s Cayuga Nation Council is officially recognized by the U.S. government. The opposing faction that controlled the buildings since 2014 is the Traditional Cayuga Nation Chiefs and Clan Mothers. A statement from the traditional faction’s counsel, Joe Heath, called Saturday’s demolition “viciously unlawful.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nForneys Creek: The Hidgon Family Cemetery in the Great Smoky Mountains has become a source of mystery for the National Park Service. On the North Carolina side of the park stands a slanted granite tombstone that says only: “A Black Man” – no name, no date, no epitaph, The Charlotte Observer reports. Now park historians say they’re determined to figure out who he was and why he was afforded a costly grave marker with no hint of identification, as part of a project documenting “the African American experience in the Smokies.” “This research project is facing common obstacles: the African American members of the communities are nameless and faceless in typical historical records,” the park service wrote on Facebook. Some bloggers believe the man was “elderly” when he died around 1920, during a period when the “Spanish Flue” had overtaken Swain County, according to a report in Reflections of Olde Swain.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A nonprofit group that arranges trips for veterans to visit Washington memorials dedicated to them will now have its first honor flight chapter dedicated to area veterans in western North Dakota. The local chapter, Western North Dakota Honor Flight, announced its start a week ago with Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., in attendance, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The local chapter is the first since the Rough Rider Honor Flight Network ceased in 2011 after operating for two years. The group hopes to raise $160,000 through sponsorships, fundraisers and donations to send about 100 area veterans to the nation’s capital on a private plane. The two-day trip planned for this fall will be free to the veterans, but they do have to apply to participate in the program.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has signed a bill under which motorcyclists in the state would be allowed to wear earphones or earplugs while riding to ward off hearing loss. The state House and Senate previously approved the legislation, which would prohibit motorcyclists from listening to music or other entertainment while wearing the ear protection. The Republican DeWine signed it into law Friday, and it takes effect in 90 days. Noise from the wind and engines can produce severe hearing loss for motorcyclists, said Sen. Rob McColley, a Republican from Napoleon in northwestern Ohio. There was no public opposition, and proponents said riders would still be able to hear sirens and car horns.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Native American tribes suing the state over tribal gambling compacts oppose requests by two tribes to intervene in the lawsuit. The Dec. 31 lawsuit by the Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw nations asks a federal judge to determine whether compacts allowing gambling exclusively at tribal casinos automatically renewed Jan. 1. Mediation was ordered after Gov. Kevin Stitt asked the judge to order the casinos to stop offering certain games, including electronic and table games. Several tribes intervened, but they oppose intervention by the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians and the Kialegee Tribal Town, saying they have no valid claim. “UKB and Kialegee do not conduct gaming pursuant to (Indian Gaming and Regulatory Act) Compacts and are not developing any projects to engage in gaming,” as do the tribes in the lawsuit, according to the Feb. 18 motion.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city intentionally allows drivers to park vehicles illegally close to crosswalks and intersections, making it difficult to navigate the city and potentially deadly for all road users, a lawsuit filed last week in Multnomah County Circuit Court says. The lawsuit seeks to address what attorney Scott Kocher describes as Portland’s “ongoing failure” to provide adequate sight distance at street corners or crosswalks, the Oregonian/OregonLive reports. Kocher is using the 2019 death of a motorcyclist, one of 49 people killed in what was the deadliest year since 1997, as a test case to argue the city’s negligence. The family of Elijah Coe, a 48-year-old chef who was killed on East Burnside Street in May, is seeking $5.9 million in damages and demands the city retrofit its intersections to comply with its own code governing sight distances as well as state law.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nState College: Hundreds of Penn State students have raised more than $11 million dollars for pediatric cancer patients in the annual 46-hour dance marathon known as Thon. The $11,696,942.38 total was announced Sunday afternoon at the conclusion of the Penn State Interfraternity Council/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, billed as the world’s largest student-run philanthropy. Money raised benefits pediatric cancer patients and their families at the Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center. Child cancer survivors and their families also participate along with the dancers, who aren’t allowed to sleep or even sit and are helped by thousands of other students in support roles. The amount raised this year was more than $1 million beyond last year’s total. Before this year’s event, officials said the dance marathon had raised more than $168 million since 1977.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s main airport is getting a $4.7 million grant to modernize the terminal, acquire land and study effective noise reduction strategies. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, announced the Airport Improvement Program grant for the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, the quasi-public agency that oversees the airport’s operations. Most of the federal funding will be used to renovate restrooms and other public facilities in the 24-year-old airport terminal, Reed said. The renovations are expected to be complete this summer. About $400,000 will be used to purchase 1.3 acres of vacant property within a runway protection zone for one of the runways. About $90,000 will be used to help update noise exposure maps that were generated in 2010.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State lawmakers are looking to end a practice that allowed police officers to patrol by themselves for up to a year without training. The idea for decades was to allow small police forces to use newly hired officers immediately after putting them on the payroll because it could take months to get a slot in the state’s only police training academy in Columbia. But the death of an untrained officer in a shooting during a traffic stop in Florence in January and the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy revamping its training program to eliminate the months­long wait have four former law enforcement members writing a bill to change things. The proposal would only allow an officer without the certification earned through 12 weeks of training to patrol or arrest someone if they are with a certified officer.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A new app is helping American Indian youth learn math that can be taught in their native Lakota language. The bilingual English and Lakota math video game was created by the Thunder Valley Community Development Corp., a South Dakota nonprofit that promotes Native American issues. The “Making Camp: Lakota” app is free and can be downloaded on mobile devices and computer desktops, KOTA-TV reports. It is meant mainly to help fourth- and fifth-grade students. A historical video introduces each section of the game explaining cultural symbols like eagle feathers, buffalo and horses. Mary Bowman, an Oceti Sakhalin teacher with the Rapid City Area School District, said it’s a key part of the curriculum. Culturally responsive teaching increases children’s achievement levels because the children are more engaged and learn more, she said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: As part of the kickoff to its 20th anniversary year, Stax Music Academy will present a special Black History Month concert Tuesday. The event, titled “Let’s Do It Again,” will take place at the Rose Theatre on the campus of the University of Memphis. In addition to performing the classics, Stax Music Academy will show the lasting influence and continuing impact of the label by playing contemporary songs – by artists ranging from Destiny’s Child to Ariana Grande – that incorporate or sample familiar Stax sounds. Pat Mitchell Worley, executive director of Stax Music Academy, said the theme of the concert is a way to connect multiple generations of music fans. The Black History Month concert is typically Stax Music Academy’s biggest show of the year, and “Let’s Do It Again” will feature appearances by all its various groups, including the a capella, jazz, and junior and senior high school ensembles. There will be two performances Tuesday: a daytime event exclusively for Memphis middle and high school students and an evening concert that will be open to the public. Tickets are $20 for adults. Youth tickets are $10.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The “Leaning Tower of Dallas,” a social media sensation born when a part of a building survived implosion, endured scores of blows from a wrecking ball Monday. Dozens of people gathered downtown to watch as a crane was used to batter the former Affiliated Computer Services building. The 11-story building found a second life online after surviving a first demolition attempt. It inspired jokes and comparisons to Italy’s Leaning Tower of Pisa when a Feb. 16 implosion failed to bring down its core. The company that engineered the blast said some explosives did not go off. In the following week, people flocked to the site to post photos of themselves pretending to prop up the lopsided tower. The remainder of the building proved resilient Monday, and some onlookers were nonplussed by the ball that began swinging about 9 a.m. As demolition work took place, an online petition to “save this landmark from destruction” continued to draw signatures.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: U.S. officials have dropped plans to sell energy leases in a popular recreational area renowned for its mountain biking trails. The reversal by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management comes after local businesses, officials and Gov. Gary Herbert raised concerns about potential effects to the Slickrock Trail near Moab. The two lease parcels would have covered about two-thirds of the 10.5-mile trail and been barely a mile from Arches National Park. The 9,000-acre Sand Flats area that includes the trail is visited by 160,000 people a year, many of them drawn to the undulating, rocky trails that pose a challenge to mountain bikers. The U.S. land agency co-manages the recreation area with Grand County, an arrangement in place since 1994. Under President Donald Trump, the amount of acreage leased for oil and gas in Western states has been sharply increasing, raising concerns among conservationists about potential damage to the environment.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Department of Fish and Wildlife is proposing to issue 55 moose hunting permits for this fall in the wildlife management unit along the state’s borders with Quebec and New Hampshire. The October hunt would result in the taking of an estimated 33 moose. The target for the area known as Wildlife Management Unit E is designed to reduce the impact of winter ticks on the moose population. “Moose density in WMU E is more than one moose per square mile, significantly higher than any other part of the state,” said moose biologist Nick Fortin. The suggestion for the number of moose hunting permits came after Fish and Wildlife worked with University of Vermont researchers to study moose health and survival in the wildlife management unit by tagging 36 cows and 90 calves with GPS tracking collars. The study found that chronic high winter tick loads have caused the decline in moose health.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Lawmakers passed a bill Monday that scraps the state’s Lee-Jackson holiday celebrating two Confederate generals and replaces it with one on Election Day. The House approved legislation that had already cleared the Senate, advancing the measure to Gov. Ralph Northam, who supports it. Lee-Jackson Day, established more than 100 years ago, is observed annually on the Friday preceding the third Monday in January. It honors Confederate Gens. Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, both native Virginians. Critics of the Lee-Jackson holiday view it as a celebration of the state’s slaveholding history that’s offensive to African Americans. Many cities and counties have opted not to observe it. “Voting is our most fundamental right as Americans – and it is past time we stopped celebrating men who worked actively to uphold the system of slavery,” Northam said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Potato farmers in Skagit County suffered big losses after they were unable to harvest some of their crops due to early and heavy rainfall. The county’s farmers were unable to harvest an estimated 3 square miles of potatoes in the fall, with losses valued between $5 million and $10 million, The Skagit Valley Herald reports. Don McMoran of the Washington State University Skagit County Extension said farmers often do not harvest some land each season, but a loss of that size is rare. Farmers are also worried about the condition of potatoes they harvested that are sitting in storage, McMoran said. “When you harvest under wet conditions, you’re going to have the potential for more disease concerns,” he said. Potatoes are the county’s most valuable crop, bringing in about $60 million to growers annually, according to extension statistics.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Wildlife officials have proposed 16 changes to the state’s hunting and fishing regulations. Officials with the Division of Natural Resources met Sunday and explained the rationale for the changes, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. The proposals will be voted on during meetings in May and August. Some of the bigger proposals included lengthening the spring turkey-hunting season, changing smallmouth-bass fishing regulations along the New River, expanding nighttime hunting for coyotes and imposing a creel limit on panfish. The proposal to lengthen the spring turkey season from 27 days to 35 days would provide additional days of hunting recreation, said Paul Johansen, the agency’s wildlife chief. The proposal to expand nighttime hunting for coyotes to year-round is an answer to requests from predator hunters.\n\nWisconsin\n\nElm Grove: A historic church and convent is being sold to a local development firm that plans to convert much of that space to apartments. Mandel Group Inc. has agreed to buy the 30-acre School Sisters of Notre Dame complex, according to an announcement Monday. Mandel has done some preliminary work on plans to redevelop the site but hasn’t yet determined how many apartments could be built there, said Dan Romnek, a development associate at the firm. The development would likely blend preserved buildings with new construction, he said. The two main buildings, Notre Dame Hall and Maria Hall, are to be preserved, Romnek said. Mandel is considering plans for the property’s other buildings, some of which could be demolished, he said. A detailed proposal is to be filed with Elm Grove officials this summer for a Plan Commission and Village Board review, Romnek said. Mandel plans to talk to neighbors before submitting those plans.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Land owners on a Native American reservation will be able to sell their property to the federal government through a program meant to return ownership to the reservation’s two tribes. The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Land Buy-Back Program for tribal nations will enable the purchases on the Wind River Reservation, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. Participation in the program is voluntary, and only tribal members with allotments will be eligible to sell their land. Much of the property was allotted to tribal members by the government but is often underutilized due to a tangle of ownership. The original allotments have been passed down through generations for the reservation’s tribes to control, but tangled ownership webs can result in hundreds or thousands of owners of a single allotment. After the property is returned to tribal jurisdiction, the land could be used for purposes including economic development, right-of-ways, cultural preservation and housing.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/25"}]}

Standards have changed quite a bit in terms of what references the culture at large deems offensive in its hit songs, from casual homophobia in pop songs from Katy Perry and Taylor Swift to the jaw-dropping lyrical content of some Rolling Stones classics.\n\nBelow, find a list of songs that, if released today, would almost certainly ignite a scandal.\n\nSong: Kung Fu Fighting by Carl Douglas, 1974\n\nChoice lyric: “There was funky Billy Chin and little Sammy Chung / He said ‘Here comes the big boss, let’s get it on.' ”\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: Perhaps the song was just trying to celebrate the ancient art of kung fu. But its lyrics about “funky Chinamen from funky Chinatown” with stereotypically Asian-sounding last names isn’t exactly a nuanced appreciation of the culture.\n\nSong: Brown Sugar by the Rolling Stones, 1971\n\nChoice lyric: “Gold coast slave ship bound for cotton fields / Sold in the market down in New Orleans / Scarred old slaver knows he's doing alright / Hear him whip the women just around midnight.”\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: Even Mick Jagger knows these lyrics aged incredibly poorly; in recent years, he’s changed the words when he performs the song live. Beyond the song’s opening stanzas, the racism, misogyny and outright references to raping slaves make this a low point in the Stones’ discography.\n\nSong: Under My Thumb by the Rolling Stones, 1966\n\nChoice lyric: “Under my thumb, the squirmin' dog who's just had her day / Under my thumb, a girl who has just changed her ways.\"\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: Another disgusting entry in the Stones’ songbook, the song about a woman who’s been molded to “talk when she's spoken to” is an embarrassment for even existing.\n\nSong: Ur So Gay by Katy Perry, 2007\n\nChoice lyric: “I can't believe I fell in love with someone that wears more makeup and / You're so gay and you don't even like boys”\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: If Perry’s I Kissed A Girl was borderline gross for its exploitative take on same-sex experimentation, Ur So Gay crosses the line with its deeply immature rattling-off of gay stereotypes, driven home by the use of the word as a slur.\n\nSong: Picture to Burn by Taylor Swift, 2008\n\nChoice lyric: “So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy / That's fine, I'll tell mine that you're gay.”\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: Perry’s frenemy Taylor Swift wasn’t immune to the same kind of sophomoric homophobia, with Picture To Burn subscribing to the same backward view that the worst thing you could call a teenage boy is “gay.”\n\nSong: Do They Know It’s Christmas? by the Band Aid choir, 1984\n\nChoice lyric: “And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time / The greatest gift they'll get this year is life / Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow / Do they know it's Christmas time at all?”\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: Possibly the most culturally insensitive Christmas song of all time, the Band Aid supergroup may have raised money to alleviate an Ethiopian famine with the proceeds from Do They Know It’s Christmas. But they did it with a song that declares the entire continent of Africa is bereft of water, trees or joy.\n\nSong: Turning Japanese by The Vapors, 1980\n\nChoice lyric: \"I'm turning Japanese, I think I'm turning Japanese\"\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: No, Turning Japanese isn't literally about turning Japanese. Still, it wouldn't be acceptable today to hear a group of white guys assuming the identity of Asian people.\n\nSong: I'm an Indian Outlaw by Tim McGraw, 1994\n\nChoice lyric: “You can find me in my wigwam / I'll be beating on my tom-tom / Pull out the pipe and smoke you some / Hey and pass it around.”\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: McGraw is certainly not “an Indian outlaw, half Cherokee and Choctaw” as he claims in the song. And even if he were, that wouldn’t excuse the hilariously lazy Native American tropes he employs.\n\nSong: Island Girl by Elton John, 1975\n\nChoice lyric: “Island girl, what you wanting with the white man's world / Island girl, black boy want you in his island world”\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: The borderline fetishization in John’s chart-topping ode to a New York City prostitute who’s “black as coal but she burn like a fire” is cringeworthy.\n\nSong: Ebony and Ivory by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder, 1982\n\nChoice lyric: “Ebony and ivory / Live together in perfect harmony / Side by side on my piano keyboard / Oh lord, why don't we?”\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: McCartney and Wonder meant well with their hyper-literal interpretation of race relations. But their message of “people are the same, there’s good and bad in everyone, so let’s just get along” would be interpreted as hilariously naïve by the more woke factions of today's cultural discourse.\n\nSong: Rape Me by Nirvana, 1993\n\nChoice lyric: “Rape me / Rape me, my friend”\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: We get it. Kurt Cobain was a deeply tortured soul. He probably, in retrospect, could’ve expressed this one better.\n\nSong: Tonight’s the Night (Gonna Be Alright) by Rod Stewart, 1976\n\nChoice lyric: “Don’t say a word, my virgin child, just let your inhibitions run wild\"\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: In case the lyrics to this No. 1 hit weren’t cringe-inducing enough, try not feeling icky watching its video. In it, Stewart woos a faceless young woman and leads her up to his bedroom before she says in French, “I’m a little scared. What is my mother going to say?”\n\nSong: One in a Million by Guns N' Roses, 1988\n\nChoice lyric: “Immigrants and f****ts, they make no sense to me / They come to our country and think they’ll do as they please\"\n\nWhy it wouldn’t fly today: Axl Rose attempts to win our sympathy with his story of a “small-town white boy” feeling lost when he moves to Los Angeles. But using derogatory language for gay and black men certainly doesn’t help his case, nor do his wildly xenophobic lyrics about immigrants. (“They talk so many (expletive) ways / it’s all Greek to me.”)\n\nSong: Kissin' Cousins by Elvis Presley, 1964\n\nChoice lyric: \"Well I've got a gal, she's as cute as she can be / She's a distant cousin but she's not too distant with me\"\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: Nothing like a little casual incest to get the crowd up and dancing. This seemingly innocent but actually creepy doo-wop tune is taken from the King's 1964 movie musical, in which he plays an Air Force pilot whose two beautiful cousins compete for his affections. Different times?\n\nSong:Age Ain't Nothing But a Number by Aaliyah, 1994\n\nChoice lyric: \"Age ain't nothing but a number / throwing down ain't nothing but a thang / This lovin' I have for you, it'll never change\"\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: No disrespect to the late Princess of R&B, whose hypnotic vocals and idiosyncratic style remain timeless. But it's hard not to feel at least mildly uncomfortable listening to this song in retrospect: At the time she recorded it, a then-14-year-old Aaliyah was dating — and would soon illegally marry — her mentor/producer R. Kelly, who was 27.\n\nSong: Illegal Alien by Genesis, 1983\n\nChoice lyric: \"It's no fun being an illegal alien\"\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: Its message and story are seemingly well-intentioned, detailing a Mexican immigrant's struggle to cross the border in search of a better life. But the racist video puts the song in a whole different light, with stereotypical imagery of mariachi horns, ponchos, sombreros and oversize mustaches.\n\nSong:Walk on the Wild Side by Lou Reed, 1972\n\nChoice lyric: \"Holly came from Miami, F-L-A / Hitchhiked her way across the USA / Plucked her eyebrows on the way / Shaved her legs and then he was a she\"\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: In a song filled with racy anecdotes, this reference to Holly Woodlawn, a transgender actress who was bullied as a teenager and ran away from home, is alarmingly tone-deaf.\n\nSong: Money for Nothing by Dire Straits, 1985\n\nChoice lyric: \"See the little f****t with the earring and the makeup? / Yeah buddy, that's his own hair / That little f****t got his own jet airplane / That little f****t, he's a millionaire\"\n\nWhy it wouldn't fly today: A slight at effeminate rock stars, once again using \"gay\" as an insult.

Bubbly singles \"Me!\" and \"You Need to Calm Down\" were a far cry from Swift'sdarker \"Reputation\" era. Third and fourth singles \"Lover\" and \"The Man\" solidified Swift’s next chapter as one of happiness, maturity and self-determination.\n\nThen, about six months later (before her \"Lover Fest\" tour could take off), the COVID-19 pandemic took over the world and canceled crowded live music events.\n\nThat didn’t stop Swift from creating music, though. In July 2020, about a year after \"Lover,\" she debuted \"Folklore\" (which went on to win the Grammy for best album of the year), followed by sister album \"Evermore\" in November 2020. And then there's her \"Fearless (Taylor's Version)\" re-recording, which dropped in April, and upcoming \"Red (Taylor's Version),\" due Nov. 19.\n\nBut what happened to \"Lover\" in all the hubbub of Swift’s new woodland nymph era and blasts from the past? Nothing, and that’s exactly the problem.\n\n\"Lover\" stands the test of Swiftian time as her lost masterpiece, an ode to love in all its forms – and one we could surely use right now as we cap off yet another cruel summer.\n\nAnd more albums to come:Taylor Swift reveals new tracks for 'Red' album after teasing fans: 'Congrats pals'\n\nThe 'Lover' era represented a simpler time we'd love to return to\n\nYou won't hear any complaints here about the woodsy, cottage-core vibes of \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore,\" but Swift's loud, colorful and bold looks from the \"Lover\" era felt daring and carefree in a way we're longing to return to.\n\nThe glittery release of \"Lover\" came about six months before COVID-19 changed the world. The splashy aesthetic seeped into Swift's music videos (\"Lover\" and \"You Need to Calm Down\") as well as her merchandise (we lived for the pastel-centric Stella McCartney fashion collaboration).\n\nAs much as we love the muted vibes of \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore,\" living amid the prolonged pandemic makes us nostalgic for the time when solving problems felt as simple as \"step(ping) into the daylight and let(ting) it go.\"\n\nOur review:Taylor Swift is a kid again on 'Lover,' a big, messy embrace of a new album\n\nWe'll always walk down 'Cornelia Street'\n\nWhile \"Lover Fest\" never happened, Swift treated us to live performances before the pandemic. We can't stop playing one in particular: The \"Cornelia Street (Live from Paris)\" recording from her \"City of Lover\" one-day concert at Paris' Olympia theater. Fans hardly recognized the start of the stripped-down version of the song, but once they did, screams bellowed out from the crowd and they sang along.\n\nLive performances can sometimes sound better than the album recordings – and we'd argue that's the case here. Something about this version's raw energy and Swift's connection to her audience breaks our heart a \"Lover Fest\" tour never happened. But it also makes us that much more excited for whatever concert she'll concoct for us next.\n\nWe'll walk \"Cornelia Street\" again and again with you, Taylor.\n\nQueen celebrates queen:Taylor Swift gushes over Simone Biles’ Olympics return: ‘We all learned from you’\n\n'Cruel Summer' should have been a single\n\nThe aforementioned four singles Swift chose summed up the vibe of this era: Confident and in love but ready to take down anybody who gets in her way or of someone she cares about.\n\nAside from being a certified bop, \"Cruel Summer\" represented Swift's duality as a songwriter. Yes, she's in a steady relationship that prompts beautiful love ballads, but she can also still write a killer song about new relationship anxiety.\n\nIt's a song that deserves to go down in Swift's bridge hall of fame (as does this album's \"Death By A Thousand Cuts\"). Add to the list of song lyrics we wish we could have belted out during \"Lover Fest\": \"I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you/And I snuck in through the garden gate/Every night that summer just to seal my fate/And I screamed for whatever it's worth/'I love you,' ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?\"\n\nSome fans crossed their fingers that \"Cruel Summer\" would be released the following summer as a post-album single (which Swift has previously done with \"You Belong With Me,\" \"Red\" and \"Style\") and maybe even a music video. Instead, she dropped a whole new album in the summer of 2020 as the world faced a truly cruel summer.\n\nTwo albums later (or three, if we're counting \"Fearless (Taylor's Version),\" we know Swift is busy with her re-records and has moved on from her \"Lover\" days. But we'll still scream our hopes that \"Cruel Summer\" gets its due, for whatever it's worth.\n\nWe actually can't wait:Taylor Swift will drop rerecorded 'Red' album with 30 songs in November: What we know", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/25/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-review-imax-film-album/4089656002/", "title": "Kanye West's 'Jesus is King' new gospel album, film are holy but ...", "text": "Another Kanye West album is here, and with it, another collective shrug of indifference.\n\n\"Jesus is King,\" the rapper's most clear-cut foray into Christian hip hop, was released midday Friday after multiple delays and tracklist changes. The 11-song, 27-minute album finds West teaming up once again with frequent collaborators including Pusha T, Ty Dolla Sign and producer Mike Dean, as well as his recently formed Sunday Service collective: a gospel group that has accompanied him throughout the past year at Coachella music festival in April and various pop-up shows nationwide in months since.\n\nIn some regards, \"Jesus is King\" is West's riskiest effort yet. Here, he completely abandons his provocative rhymes about fame, women and mental health, and potentially alienates longtime fans with chaste lyrics about God, heaven and staying on the straight and narrow. Interpolating Bible verses and Christian hymns, and frequently backed by a church organ and choir, the album suggests a bold new direction for the now-father of four (a musical path he looks to continue on with the just-announced \"Jesus is Born,\" out Christmas Day.)\n\nSo why can't we get more excited about it?\n\nThere was a time when new music from the rap legend felt like an event. Who can forget the thrill when, after widespread backlash to the Taylor Swift incident at the 2009 VMAs, he emerged from hiding a year later with \"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,\" his grandiose career-defining masterpiece (and arguably the best album of the past decade)? The messy rollouts and bold swings of 2013's \"Yeezus\" and 2016's \"The Life of Pablo\" kept fans on their toes, even if in retrospect, we weren't nearly critical enough of West's offensive and unwanted depictions of Swift and other female celebrities on the latter.\n\nMore:Kanye West slams Kim Kardashian's tight dress as 'too sexy'; Tyler Cameron offers defense\n\nBut in the past couple of years, West's antics have grown increasingly tiresome. Last year's \"Ye\" – which he unveiled during a star-studded listening party in his new adopted home of Wyoming – felt sporadic and unfinished; an afterthought to the string of albums he would produce and feature on for other artists that summer. His blind support of President Donald Trump and attempts to reclaim the \"Make America Great Again\" hat as a symbol of unity have been ignorant and misguided, while his bizarre insistence last year that slavery was a \"choice\" just seemed like faux provocation for the sake of it.\n\nIn terms of elaborate rollouts, \"Jesus is King\" is West at his most exhausting. The rapper made a 31-minute IMAX film to accompany the album, which is screening in theaters nationwide for one week only. Shot with obnoxious fish-eye lenses and shown almost entirely through circular frames, the movie mostly lingers on long shots of billowing clouds, wildlife and the backs of choir singers. West appears only in silhouette to perform a God-focused update of \"808s & Heartbreak\" track \"Street Lights,\" which serves as an emotional finale to an otherwise self-indulgent and unnecessary project.\n\nMore:Kanye West's 'Jesus is King' inspires mosh pits, strong emotions at LA preview event\n\n\"Jesus is King,\" the album, doesn't fare much better. Lyrically, the music sounds as if West picked up a Bible yesterday, took everything at face value and decided to make an album about it. His rhymes are often lazy and on the nose, making broad declarations about his new outlook on life since finding religion. (\"Thou shalt love thy neighbor, not divide,\" he raps on \"On God.\" \"His light shine the brightest in the dark.\")\n\nHe extols the power of forgiveness and counts himself among God's soldiers on \"Selah,\" and repeatedly asks for guidance and protection throughout \"Use This Gospel,\" which reunites rap duo Clipse and features a saxophone solo from none other than Kenny G. \"Closed on Sunday\" warns against the dangers of social media and vanity, and opens with one of West's most cringe-worthy lyrics to date: \"Closed on Sunday, you my Chick-fil-A,\" referring to the famously religious fast-food chain, which has donated to anti-LGBTQ groups through the years.\n\nMore:Taylor Swift slams Kanye West in Rolling Stone interview: 'He is so two-faced'\n\nMore: Christian hip hop is having a moment: 6 rappers you should know, including chart-topper NF\n\nWest's trademark wit is largely absent from \"Jesus is King.\" (\"What if Eve made apple juice?\" is the clearest attempt at humor on \"Everything We Need,\" but his mixed metaphor about partaking in sin ultimately goes nowhere.) And while the production is reliably stellar, there are no standout hooks that make any of these songs worth returning to.\n\nThis is in no way meant to discredit West's recent religious awakening. Many of us will go on spiritual journeys throughout our lives, and if finding God has given him inner peace, there's no reason he shouldn't reflect that in his music. But most everything on \"Jesus is King\" feels purely surface level, devoid of any of the soul-searching or introspection that faith often brings.\n\nThe only exception is \"God Is,\" a searing confessional in which West exorcises his demons in real time. Appearing to reference his past struggles with opioid abuse, he thanks the Lord for \"freedom from addiction,\" and expresses gratitude for his family and health.\n\n\"This my kids, this the crib / This my wife, this my life / This my God-given right,\" West breathlessly chants, his voice audibly cracking and aching as he races to the song's finish. \"Thank you, Jesus, won the fight.\"\n\nIt's a powerful example of someone being profoundly moved by spirit, and a reminder that West still has the ability to move us.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/columnists/chuck-campbell/2020/07/05/eurovision-soundtrack-will-ferrell-rachel-mcadams-6-lack-jessie-ware-dream-wife-peter-manos-review/5378820002/", "title": "Marilyn Manson's 'We Are Chaos' gets a shot from Shooter Jennings", "text": "Like most of Marilyn Manson’s previous releases, his new “We Are Chaos” is good music for Halloween. And in a year blighted by a worldwide pandemic, his material is all the more appropriate for 2020.\n\nManson hits the familiar marks here with metal-draped rage, industrial-sized rhythms and histrionic posturing delivered with monster-modulated vocals and acidic lyrics.\n\nShooter Jennings is the surprise weapon: The alt-country star produced or co-produced (with Manson) every track on the release. The two previously worked together on a song for an unlikely 2016 Jennings album that paid tribute to electronic-music/disco icon Giorgio Moroder, though “We Are Chaos” fits snugly in the Manson oeuvre, with a Bowie-esque glam rock edge that likely owes something to Jennings.\n\nYet this is mostly Marilyn Mason just being Marilyn Manson, whether he’s swimming through the saturated framework of the title track to find an anthemic payoff, striding through the grind of “Red Black and Blue” with the hook “Am I garbage or God?” or chugging along in the dramatic spin of “Don’t Chase the Dead” to offer the advice, “Don’t chase the dead, or they’ll end up chasing you.”\n\nUnlike others in the hard/industrial/death/rock/metal subgenres, Manson delivers his venom with his tongue in cheek, and he hits irresistibly accessible highs, as when he commandeers the crushing dance cadence of “Perfume” to offer the winking warning, “If you conjure the devil, you better make sure you got a bed for him to sleep in.” He also fits snugly in the surreal power-ballad mode of “Paint You With My Love”\n\nManson ventures over a lot of familiar territory on “We Are Chaos” and sounds a little tired at times (you try being Marilyn Manson for 30 years), but he offers a satisfying and sneering explanation on the track “Solve Coagula”: “I’m just broken, and I don’t wanna be fixed.”\n\nMarilyn Manson\n\n\"We Are Chaos\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nGuyton gets somewhere on 'Bridges'\n\nThirty-something years ago, Mickey Guyton was growing up in small-town Texas, listening to Dolly Parton tapes with her grandmother and falling in love with classic country music. She sounds like countless other Southern girls with Grand Ole Opry dreams, but as she sings on her new song “Black Like Me,” “I did my best just to fit in.”\n\nGuyton has lived her dream of being a country singer, though in a genre dominated by men – and especially white men – she isn’t a household name. But that could change, or at least her profile should grow, with her new “Bridges,” a disarmingly honest EP that is infectious, poignant and (mostly) country.\n\nProduced by Karen Kosowski, the release is authentic, opening with a prayer for an ailing society on the infectious power ballad “Heaven Down Here” and then segueing to a title track where Guyton sings “we’re gonna need more than prayers and wishes” to put out the fire on the street.\n\nGuyton is genuine, soulful and charismatic. She’s straightforward, but hopeful, and unifying, not divisive.\n\n“What Are You Going to Tell Her” is heart-wrenching, a piano-based reality check for parents of color who try to foster their children’s hopes, yet “do you let her think the deck’s not stacked?” And on the moving “Black Like Me” she makes a plaintive pitch: “If you think we live in the land of the free, you should try to be black like me … I know I’m not the only one who feels like I don’t belong.”\n\nHeavy and beautiful as these songs are, Guyton also has a wicked playful side, evident in the Western showdown of “Salt” (“You think you’re getting’ sugar, but boy you’re gettin’ salt”). Plus, on the giddy toast to her favorite beverage, “Rose,” Guyton sounds like Parton, chirping, “Pretty in pink, baby that’s my kind of drink!”\n\nNow that’s country.\n\nMickey Guyton\n\n\"Bridges\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBrian's '1999' hits the spot in 2020\n\nRich Brian is at his worst when he’s at his technical best and at his best when he’s at his technical worst on his new “1999.”\n\nThe 21-year-old Los Angeles-based vocalist from Jakarta, Indonesia, rips through the rapid-fire rap of the track “Long Run” in a dazzling display of speed and an absolute lack of personality as he dispenses a lot of words that don’t say much against the thumping bass and tinny synthetic sweeps.\n\nBy contrast, in the woozy vibe of “When You Come Home,” Brian is all over the map – uneven, imperfect and completely endearing in the dreamy arrangement, offering lines like, “You always make me laugh when you speak/And you always thought my laugh was funny.”\n\nBrian is impressively dexterous here, writing and producing on a handful of tracks that range from the strident nervous energy of “Don’t Care” to the oddly spiritual-esque melancholy of “Sometimes,” where he says his life is like the movies because “I skip the drama and get right to the action.”\n\nBrian is also a singer, taking a page from The Weeknd in the sleek synth/dance of “DOA” to sing, “Nights like this could make the brightest days overrated,” and later protecting himself on “Sins” with, “I can’t let your sins just take away my faith.”\n\nPlus on the uncharacteristic pop song “Love in My Pocket,” Brian shows his agility by singing and rapping through wry ambivalence and amusing twists.\n\nBrian is barely 21 and “1999” is only seven songs long, but he shows more range here than most artists twice his age with twice as many songs … even if the speed rapping is gratuitous.\n\nRich Brian\n\n\"1999\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nRichie unearths her comedic side\n\nIt should be no surprise that fashion designer/actress/celebrity Nicole Richie would get around to making an album: Her father is Lionel Richie, her husband is Good Charlotte lead vocalist Joel Madden, and even her onetime bestie Paris Hilton has indulged in making music. But nearly everything else about Nicole Richie’s new “Unearthed” – which is credited to her alternate persona, Nikki Fre$h – is a surprise.\n\n“Unearthed” is comedy rap, a Lonely Island-ish “conscience trap album” where Richie plays an overly woke pro-environment troubadour.\n\nThe release features half a dozen “voicemails” where friends and associates (and Lionel Richie himself) are baffled by her new persona and try to talk her out of releasing the album.\n\nBut here it is, with the mother of two warning her kids not to “bring the Virgo out in me” on first song “Parent Trap” (and telling them to “go do your homework”) before she turns her attention to nature.\n\nShe frets over the loss of honeybees on “Bee’s Tea” (“I’m just tryin’ to save a queen”), worries about rejected not-traditionally-attractive fruits and vegetables on “U.G.L.Y.” (“We take damn good food, and we kiss it goodbye”), advocates for clean water on “Drip Drip” (“Everything requires water and so do me”) and recognizes kindred spirits in plant life on “We Are a Garden” (“A kumquat tree … an epiphany … it’s just like me”).\n\nThe standout track is “Lil Gems,” a well-executed modern dance song about the power of gems to repel negative energy. And there’s an extended spoken track, “Knuckle Fresh,” where Nikki visits a senior living home to give away her music and receptive resident Trixie says, “We have literally nothing to do and all the time in the world.”\n\nFans of eccentric diversions might find time for “Unearthed,” too.\n\nNikki Fre$h\n\n\"Unearthed\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nSweeping tones compensate for vocals\n\nSuburban Living bridges shoegaze music to the sweeping tones of Gothic rock on its new “How to Be Human,” creating thoughtfully ornate soundscapes suitable for reflection, rumination and/or relaxation by its listeners.\n\nThe Philadelphia by way of Virginia Beach band builds its textured sound on layers of guitars from Wesley Bunch and Chris Radwanski plus Radwanski’s keyboards and the rhythm section of drums by Mike Cammarata and bass by Peter Pantina.\n\nThe tracks sprawl with effective disembodiment, typically elevating in intensity on each track, though the shifts are subtle. The resulting psychological impact of “How to Be Human” is primal as the thick arrangements sink into the psyche and absorb into the soul.\n\nBut there’s an all-too-human aspect to the release: Bunch’s vocals are subpar, weakly navigating through the swarming instrumentation and serving as a mildly irritating distraction to the aural effect. His words are spiked with passion, but Bunch’s mundane and hookless vocal delivery sinks into the mix, corrupting the lyrical intent.\n\nThe words do bleed through – whether on the lush city-themed “Main Street,” where he sings, “I look to you in my time of need … I’m begging you, please let me in,” or when he wonders in the insinuating intoxication of “Video Love (T’s Corner),” “Is this my time?”\n\nApart from the occasional tedium that surfaces on a few songs, “How to Be Human” compensates for the vocals with the music, as when Max Swan steps in with a saxophone solo in the flooded sound of “Indigo Kids” or when the indulgent 7-minute arrangement of closer “Once You Go” pays off with an evocative atmosphere.\n\nIf only the vocals were better, “How to Be Human” could have been transcendent.\n\nSuburban Living\n\n\"How to Be Human\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nCools finds 'Paradise' in California\n\nMusicians are often inspired by locations for their material, and so it is with Evelyn Cools on her California-based “Misfit Paradise,” which explores a time in 2018 when she “experienced love like she never had before,” according to a press release.\n\nDespite some lyrical references to the state and Southern California folk-rock leanings in the arrangements, however, “Misfit Paradise” seems far more informed by that unprecedented love experience, which comes off as elusive, potentially obsessive and also both blissful and oddly threatening.\n\nCools – a native of Belgium who lived in London, Budapest and Hong Kong before moving to the United States – starts strong on “Misfit Paradise” with the starry-eyed piano ballad “Another Night,” where she wonders, “What if we never met? What if I never said, ‘Could I come over, I want to know you better?’” Later, on the bucolic “Yosemite,” where Cools sings in the measured style of an old folk song until she gives way to distant feral wails by song’s end, she issues the invitation, “The howling winds are calling me/Meet me at Yosemite.”\n\nThe title track is the messiest song on “Misfit Paradise,” with the vocalist’s delivery not enough to take over a largely uneventful, if over-complicated, arrangement as she sings lines like, “the only way we know is never to let go.” On the flipside, the rocking “Gold Woman” might be the tightest track, alive and raw as she sings of a femme fatale only to pivot to a confession that she’s a “gold woman” herself.\n\nYet the acoustic-guitar-driven closing cut “Soaring” is the best overall representative of “Misfit Paradise” as Cools struggles to articulate her intense feelings: “It’s hard to explain the grip you’ve got on me/It’s hard to explain everything I fear.”\n\nSometimes love is like that.\n\nEvelyn Cools\n\n\"Misfit Paradise\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nKaty Perry offers humble 'Smile'\n\nKaty Perry may get knocked for sticking to formula on her new “Smile,” but it works.\n\nPerry’s last release – 2017’s “Witness” – was abysmal, an attempt at something innovative and “purposeful” (Perry’s word) that was soulless, overproduced and overlong. On the final track, she sang the symbolic line, “No one’s ever seen me like this,” and it’s doubtful many would want to see her like that again.\n\nThe humble “Smile” – released within days of the birth of her daughter, Daisy – is an about-face. Like Lady Gaga’s retreat from art pop into her comfort zone earlier this year with “Chromatica,” Perry is blithely unassuming, breaking no ground and visiting familiar territory.\n\nAlthough nothing overwhelms, there are several highlights. Perry’s audience can be swept along with the muscled rhythm of “Cry About It Later” as the singer goes drinking, contemplating a new tattoo and looking for a new love: “I think I’m ready to be someone’s new muse.” She’s equally confident in the ticking timebomb of “Resilient” (ready to grow “right through the cracks”), playful in the plucky tropical R&B diversion of “Harleys in Hawaii” and determined in the swooping aural storm of “Teary Eyes.”\n\nAnd unlike the ill-fated closer of “Witness,” “Smile” punches out with a grandiose “What Makes a Woman,” a self-assured anthem about learning to love yourself.\n\nMuch of the rest of “Smile” is fairly forgettable, though never bad, with Perry forcing the drama with fits of oversinging, accompanied by snappy pop and EDM-blasted arrangements.\n\nPerry has said in interviews that “Smile” was her effort to put a dark time behind her, and it sounds like she did.\n\nNot every album has to change the world.\n\nKaty Perry\n\n\"Smile\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBraxton's 'Name' is (mostly) healthy\n\nToni Braxton’s new “Spell My Name” feels like a healthy break-up album at first.\n\nBusted relationships can be a mess, sometimes driven by devastating heartbreak, desperate attempts at reconciliation and relentless rage. Yet at the onset of “Spell My Name,” Braxton is where she needs to be, with a little bitterness and a lot of pride fueling her resolve to move on.\n\nThe stirring groove of buoyant opening cut “Dance” is all she needs to deliver a kiss-off to a fresh ex, employing her robust vocal with dignified restraint: “Tonight you’ll see I won’t be lonely.”\n\nSubsequent tracks follow a similar theme: Missy Elliott pops in for some sass on the rich call of “Do It” (a unifying anthem to support women who need to break away from a bad relationship), Braxton navigates the unhurried strings and hefty textures of “Gotta Move On,” and “Fallin’” adds a gorgeous context for a biting send off.\n\nBut on the fifth song, “Spell My Name’s” title track, there’s a pivot as Braxton plies the suggestive swirling rhythms and percolating percussion to make a play for a younger man.\n\nThen Braxton simply spins out in all directions – stuck in the limbo of a half-broken relationship on the intoxicating “O.V.E.Rr.” and swamped by ambivalence on the slow sprawling “Saturday Night.” Meanwhile, standout track “Happy Without Me” is a showcase of excruciating heartbreak, with Braxton pouring on the passion with wrenching despair.\n\n“Spell My Name” closes with the earthy soul of “Nothin’,” which finds our hero reduced to rubble with the sobering realization, “Without your love, I ain’t nothin’.”\n\nIt’s a heartfelt, albeit disappointing, finale, but that’s the way love goes.\n\nToni Braxton\n\n\"Spell My Name\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nGeorgas confronts 'All That Emotion'\n\nHannah Georgas has used her immaculate voice as a vehicle for vulnerability. It’s clean and soft and inspires empathy for all the betas and introverts who are overpowered and overshadowed by alphas and extroverts. She can break a heart and prompt a chuckle with one line.\n\nThe Canadian singer-songwriter treads into even darker territory on “All That Emotion,” which suits the title with ambivalence – resentment, resolve, frustration, anger and something more sinister as she confronts what could be lovers, friends, relatives, or perhaps all of the above, who have held the upper hand, manipulated her and left her feeling helpless and untrusting.\n\nNo, this isn’t a traditional breakup album.\n\nWorking with producer Aaron Dessner, Georgas creates a more fleshed out sound for her electronic-based arrangements, and the restless rhythms and muted frenetic touches serve to underscore her anxious lines, though her voice is soothing, save for palpable ache on mesmerizing closing track “Cruel.”\n\nIn the percolating cadence and meditative strains of “Easy,” Georgas contemplates how a dead relationship can transform the soul, on the sweet-sounding “Same Mistake” she calmly notes, “I grew up in a family of wolves,” and on “Pray It Away” she wonders, “Will you still love me even though I’m not what you thought?”\n\nIt’s weighty material and beautifully executed. Listeners may long for more of the dry humor and higher energy that Georgas has employed in the past, but that wouldn’t have been appropriate on most of these songs.\n\nBesides, there’s a refreshing truth at the core of “All That Emotion,” and when Georgas dovetails with the ginger rhythm of opening cut “That Emotion” – singing, “Hide behind all that emotion/See how long, how far, you can keep going” – it’s an oddly liberating challenge.\n\nHannah Georgas\n\n\"All That Emotion\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMorissette's lyrics offset shortcomings\n\nAlanis Morissette released her groundbreaking “Jagged Little Pill” 25 years ago, and now she releases a “Such Pretty Forks in the Road” that is simply grounded.\n\nYes, it’s a letdown, a musically monotonous string of unadventurous arrangements that could use more hooks and shimmer. But it’s also a platform for Morissette’s trademark introspective thoughts.\n\nSo, while “Such Pretty Forks in the Road” is short on sing-along choruses and aural dazzle, the 46-year-old Morissette compensates with moody monologues about middle-age life – in her case, with a focus on motherhood and complex relationships shaded by the residual damage of abuse.\n\n“This is the sound of me hitting bottom,” she warns on opening cut “Smiling” that hints at a darkly sedate Lana Del Rey vibe, but without mystique or sensuality. Subsequent songs are dominated by piano with flourishes of strings as Morissette offers loving warnings and encouragement to her children on “Ablaze,” ponders the elusive keys to successful relationships on “Missing the Miracle” (“You see the figure skater, and I fear the ice is thin”) and grieves “the end of superwomaning” on “Losing the Plot.”\n\nMorissette’s challenges are many, whether sheds concerns about the opinions of others as she collapses into a meltdown on “Diagnosis” (“I’m folding in on myself since I am out of order”), struggles with her paralyzing fear of change on “Nemesis” or falls victim to opportunists on “Pedestal.”\n\nYet her often-poignant thoughts are prone to underwhelm with flaccid sonics as their foundation. It’s not a deal-breaker because Morissette is still that intriguing provocateur she was in her alt-rock 1990s. But it could have been more persuasive.\n\nAlanis Morissette\n\n\"Such Pretty Forks in the Road\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nProducer highlights deserving singers\n\nHitmaking producer Ricky Reed – who has worked with the likes of Lizzo, Halsey and Twenty One Pilots – puts out his own album with the new “The Room,” though he still throws focus on his guest vocalists.\n\nIt’s a smart move: His revolving cast of singers are an underappreciated group of talented performers who deserve a boost to their exposure. Plus, it’s still clearly Reed’s album, his aesthetic of glossy R&B blended with discrete electronic touches and warm jazz creating a signature sound that gives “The Room” smooth continuity.\n\nAnd for their part the vocalists are distinct, though they complement each other in Reed’s finessed sound.\n\nAfter free-floating through the ambience of opener “Shipwreck,” “The Room” brings aboard new singers with every song, and many unpack emotional baggage. There’s romanticism weighted by separation in the lush “Us (How Sweet It Was),” featuring Duendita and My Morning Jacket’s Jim James, and Godfather666 is uneasy in the lonely soul of “No Future” (where he wonders, “How can anybody love me?”).\n\nElsewhere, Malaya dovetails with the busy percussion and throbbing riffs of “In a New Place,” urgently noting, “I ain’t got no time for your words or your games,” and John-Robert and Alessia Cara offer coy humor on their flirty duet “Fav Boy.”\n\n“The Room” also cooks up a heated vibe for “Real Magic” (featuring Terrace Martin and St. Panther) and classic R&B for “Better” (featuring Leon Bridges and Kiana Lede), and Ayoni’s sumptuous delivery brings “The Room” to a spiritual-esque close with “No Stone.”\n\nLyrically, “The Room” is fairly barren, and the well-executed atmosphere sometimes feels more important than the passion of the vocalists. But overall, it’s a sophisticated and engaging package.\n\nRicky Reed\n\n\"The Room\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nErasure is half-lit on 'Neon'\n\nU.K. duo Erasure – aka Andy Bell and Vince Clarke – has been making pop songs on both sides of the Atlantic since the 1980s, though its last release, 2017’s “World Be Gone,” was a marked diversion, a dispirited collection of serious songs that broke from form and came across as clunky.\n\nBut the act’s new “The Neon” is a celebration of ’80s synth-pop, and at least half of the duo is fully invested.\n\nClarke’s production is crisp, synthetic confections that lovingly throw back to the dance floors and airwaves of decades ago. He creates a rolling hook for opener “Hey Now (Think I Got a Feeling),” shifts to the up-tempo percolation of “Fallen Angel,” churns through the gripping groove of “Shot a Satellite” and hitches to springy infection on “Diamond Lies.” And as usual, Clarke’s instrumentation is packed with nuances, decorative touches that dovetail with and add contrast to melodic backing vocals.\n\nUnfortunately, Bell’s vocals, which have in the past matched Clarke’s energy and enterprise, is a tougher sell. Perhaps he still feels drained from the darkness of “World Be Gone,” maybe his voice has aged into a lower range that doesn’t rise to Clarke’s peaks, or it could be that the well-intended-but-often-superficial lyrics don’t inspire him.\n\nWhatever, Erasure’s momentum routinely dips, and Bell is the cause, whether he’s fading in the subtle textures of “Nerves of Steel,” overshadowed on “Tower of Love” or lost in the uneventful “Careful What I Try To Do.”\n\nAt least Bell also turns it up, bringing vocal zest to the brighter arrangements (for example singing on “Diamond Lies,” “I’ve gotta stop pretending I can be that guy … Gotta wash my hands of you”) and supplying sincerity to the lesser material, as when he transcends his own awkwardness on “New Horizons” to sing, “When all is lost, don’t you ever give up hope/There will be new horizons/We will live to love again.”\n\nGiven Erasure’s long history, you have to believe him.\n\nErasure\n\n\"The Neon\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nHalestorm reimagines itself\n\nHard rock band Halestorm has a history or recording EPs of cover songs in between releasing their full-length albums, but with “Reimagined” they mix it up: They cover their own songs.\n\nFans of the bracing Pennsylvania band might be apprehensive to hear the group has stripped down their songs for the new renditions, but they shouldn’t worry: Frontwoman Lzzy Hale has never been one for subtleties, and she makes up for any instrumental restraint with blunt (sometimes too blunt) firepower.\n\nHale carries the newly R&B-flavored “I Get Off” with blistering lines like, “I get off on you getting off on me” as she boils into full fury on the bridge. Her passion is also at the helm of the plaintive “I Miss the Misery,” and Hale bellows and wails through the strident drama of a retro-stadium-anthem version of “I Am the Fire,” asking, “Am I brave enough? Am I strong enough?”\n\nFellow rock belter Amy Lee of Evanescence joins Hale for a new take on “Break In,” turning the song into a raspy duo, an empowering statement of mutual support – which with a bit more finesse could have been a convincing throwback to the Wilson sisters of Heart.\n\nThere’s also an audacious cover of “I Will Always Love You,” which isn’t nearly as moving as the original version by Dolly Parton or the powerhouse rendition by Whitney Houston, but the Parton-penned song’s stately beauty nevertheless shines through.\n\n“Reimagined” comes to life at the end with “Mz. Hyde,” Hale glowing in the added voltage to bask in the electric crunch, bringing a feisty sense of character to the song that doesn’t show as prominently elsewhere on the EP.\n\nThat closing track underscores the fact that though “Reimagined” is an interesting diversion, Halestorm is simply better with all guns blazing.\n\nHalestorm\n\n\"Reimagined\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBrandy makes an eccentric return\n\n“Sorry for the tardy” sings Brandy on “Saving All My Love,” the first track on her new “B7” – the singer’s first release in 8 years. It’s a curious track, with Brandy showing rich nuance with her now-41-year-old voice as she skirts along the irregular rhythm, merging with the music and vocalizing multiple voices as she also declares “I ain’t saving all my love for you.”\n\nBrandy has been missed in the pop/R&B world, yet her return is odd, refreshingly anti-formulaic most of the time and strangely both intimate and obscure. It’s a personal journey that is only clear in flashes.\n\nFrom the sweeping effects and electronic bloops of “Unconditional Oceans” to a swirling duet with her teen daughter Sy’rai (where Brandy uses her rap alias Bran’Nu), “B7” is comfortably erratic.\n\nFor her part, Brandy is also all over the place, luxuriating in the pretty strains of “No Tomorrow” while singing “When you stare at me I feel so beautiful,” funneling an angry rasp over the jazzy piano of “Say Something” to rage, “You take back promises, where did they go?” and accentuating the electric jabs of “I Am More” by declaring she “can’t be the other woman … I need more ’cause I am more.”\n\nBrandy also drops in references to mental health, sadly battling deep insecurities on the humming “Borderline” with “Don’t wanna be schizo this time” and bashing a bad beau on “Bye Bipolar” with a spiritualistic combination of bitterness and humor (“I lost your ring, and you can keep your last name”).\n\nThere are also accessible and rewarding duets with Daniel Caesar (“Love Again”) and Chance the Rapper (“Baby Mama”), which underscore the trippy and sometimes overly eccentric adventures elsewhere on the release.\n\n“B7” is mostly a win, however, and hopefully enough to motivate Brandy to forego another disappearing act.\n\nBrandy\n\n\"B7\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nSwift matures on subtle 'Folklore'\n\nTaylor Swift is 30 years old and several years deep into what appears to be a satisfying relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn. Not coincidentally, her new “Folklore” simmers all of the fire, anger, joy and vindication of her previous albums into a sophisticated and quiet brew, markedly nostalgic and fueled by long-term undercurrents of emotion rather than fresh love or hurt.\n\n“Folklore,” concocted by Swift in quarantine with help from The National’s Aaron Dessner and producer Jack Antonoff, is a boldly thorough departure in form, a gamble that her unwavering fan base will embrace it nonetheless, even if the tone is understated, free from pep … and honestly a bit overlong.\n\nYet it’s also the most consistent of her eight albums, packed with confident and effective songwriting convincingly voiced by Swift and free from pop pandering (not to shade those wildly infectious hits from her past).\n\nListeners will be swayed from her one-two opening punch of tearjerker songs “The 1” and “Cardigan,” the former a mellow heartbreaker with a wistful Swift mourning a lost relationship with someone who should have been “the one,” and the latter a soft-rumbling and poignant tale: “When I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone’s bed, you put me on and said I was your favorite.”\n\nThere are no flops on the release that also finds Swift taking the role of a corpse seeing her tormentor at her funeral (“My Tears Ricochet”), remembering an endangered childhood friend in the gorgeously gauzy “Seven,” tortured by the ache of unrequited infatuation (“August”) and enchantingly broken in the folkish “Mirrorball.”\n\nAnd perhaps in a nod to her unsettled days, Swift closes the release with “Hoax,” where she flails helplessly in the grip of a poisonous relationship: “I am ash from your fire.”\n\n“Folklore” didn’t need a dance song.\n\nTaylor Swift\n\n\"Folklore\"\n\nRating: 4-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\n'Dreamland' shimmers with surrealism\n\n\"Dreamland” is an absorbing trip into emotional otherworldliness from the U.K. band Glass Animals.\n\nThe group layers synth-pop and hip-hop elements to create a luxurious, yet relatively delicate, atmosphere enhanced by frontman Davy Bayley’s high, and melodically inviting, vocals.\n\nIt’s an elusive brew, with rays of truth arcing out of a fanciful foundation, and the effect can be narcotic.\n\nThe shimmering title-track opener sets the tone for connection in a stay-at-home world – “You’ve had too much of a digital love/You want everything live, you want things you can touch,” sings Bayley. And much as society takes on a surrealistic air when its members are self-isolated in their safe spaces, “Dreamland” labors away in an altered state. It’s akin to taking hallucinogens at a crowded festival; sharing the moment, though your experience is yours alone.\n\nThere’s an intoxicating flow in the infatuation-based “Hot Sugar,” hazy minimalism in the peculiar break-up-themed “Melon and the Coconut” and a commanding beat loop for “Waterfalls Coming Out Your Mouth.”\n\nThe themes are provocative – like when Bayley rides the compressed teeter of “Space Ghost Coast to Coast” to address a childhood friend who plotted a mass killing, or when he assumes the role of a child whose mom is abused by his dad on “Domestic Bliss,” and pleas with her to escape with him: “Fight for me.”\n\nEven Bayley’s relationship songs are complicated, such as when the mutually self-destructive pair on the booming “Your Love (Déjà Vu)” prove hellbent on normalizing chaos, and “It’s All So Incredibly Loud” is about the point of no return in a doomed relationship, the moment when one person fatally wounds the bond with a statement that can’t be retracted.\n\n“Dreamland” may not be lucid, but it’s rewarding for the adventurous.\n\nGlass Animals\n\n\"Dreamland\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nDeborah Silver shines on 'Glitter'\n\nDeborah Silver’s new “Glitter & Grits” is a breezy joy, an inventive spin on classic songs from the “Great American Songbook” that serves as a respite from a pandemic year. And Silver knows firsthand about COVID-19: She contracted it and had to spend 58 days in isolation from her family.\n\nShe has since recovered, however, and is actively promoting “Glitter & Grits,” which she made with the help of producer Ray Benson of the Texas swing band Asleep at the Wheel. Benson brought along bandmates to the project, too, putting the “Grits” in these renditions of the standards.\n\n“Glitter & Grits” does more than just swing: It’s flush with other strains of jazz and Americana, awash with the nostalgia of these familiar songs and cushioned by the mildly restrained theatrics of Silver’s delivery.\n\nIt’s unavoidably hokey at times – “Ac-cent-tchu-ate the Positive” sounds like a children’s song, “Get Happy” is steeped in cheesy backing vocals, and “Deep in the Heart of Texas” is cornpone cliché, albeit well-executed.\n\nNevertheless, most tracks are balanced by their dignified arrangements, comfortably lived-in songs dressed up with flare from fiddle, mandolin, harmonica and rootsy piano. For her part, Mississippi-native Silver keeps the tone generally upbeat and polished – and fortunately, never hammy.\n\nSilver is playful in the uplifting cadence of “I Got Rhythm” and romping rendition of “Bill Bailey, Won’t You Please Come Home,” while she stretches out in the regal refrains of “Almost Like Being in Love,” the absorbing rendition of “After You’ve Gone” and the sultry take on ‘I’m Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter.” She’s also oddly perky on “that Old Black Magic,” and stately as she glides along the brushed rhythm on the sauntering “Embraceable You.”\n\nPair “Glitter & Grits” with a cocktail, and you’ll have a relaxing evening.\n\nDeborah Silver\n\n\"Glitter & Grits\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nDenny dip into eccentric 'Exotic Moog'\n\nMartin Denny’s “Exotic Moog” was a peculiar 1969 release, an alternate universe of sound from the father of exotica music in which he reimagined his songs, as well as those of other contemporary performers, by using the Moog synthesizer. The then-futuristic instrument helped birth the electronic music genre, though now it sounds technologically quaint and whimsical.\n\nAs odd as “Exotic Moog” might have sounded when it originally came out, it likely sounds even more bizarre more than 50 years later in its first-ever reissue, which was designed to coincide with Record Store Day (Aug. 29).\n\nDenny built a career on tiki-bar-friendly lush tropical soundscapes, percussion-heavy lulling rhythms, surreal vocals (usually wordless) and signature special effects like (human-made) rare “bird” calls. But whereas exotica provides the perfect narcotic effect for a cocktail party, “Exotic Moog” is something else altogether, establishing a psychedelic backdrop for, say, dropping acid at a sci-fi festival at a planetarium.\n\nIt might be a challenging listen for Denny fans to hear him reconstruct his songs “Quiet Village” and “The Enchanted Sea” into quirky space-jazz themes for cheesy aliens.\n\nWhat’s more, the Everly Brothers’ “Let It Be Me” is recast into something unsettling and trippy, Vince Guaraldi’s “Cast Your Fate to the Wind” veers into cartoonland, and Tom Jones is revamped twice – in a swarm of buzzing faux hornets on “Delilah” and an obstacle course of glitchy nuance on “Love Me Tonight.”\n\nOther dramatic makeovers include works by Herb Alpert (“A Taste of Honey”) and Astrud Gilberto (“Let Go”), and there’s even a baffling take on the theme from “Midnight Cowboy.”\n\nDenny obviously had a grand time with these remakes and “Exotic Moog” is a curious moment in music history.\n\nJust don’t expect to sing along when you listen.\n\nMartin Denny\n\n\"Exotic Moog\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nMichael Love Michael makes mark\n\nThere’s so much going on with Michael Love Michael’s debut, “XO,” that listeners may struggle to break it down. Complicated as it is, however, it’s an ambitiously distinct statement from the artist.\n\nMichael is a nonbinary Black performer from the Midwest who is now based in New York. Although “XO” is rooted in Michael’s specific experiences, “XO” will provoke emotions from a universal audience: It’s unsettling, angry, dreamy, resigned and hopeful.\n\nThe release is likewise complex sonically as the arrangements mash grunge and industrial rock into aggro-techno and cinematic electronica, decorated with elements of mainstream popular music. Many tracks are grounded in high-voltage foundations and hitched to rugged rhythms, while Michael’s singing soars untethered from the mix.\n\nThose vocals – thin and delivered unevenly – will prove a sticking point for some, yet they also serve to underscore Michael’s fears and vulnerabilities, from the anxiety in the menacing “Rope” (“Born to live a life of terror and pain”) to the disheartened observations in the bleak march of “On God.”\n\nThere’s a neo-Goth allure in “XO” as Michael weaves through the unsolvable mazes of “Mother’s Day,” “Million Girls” and “The Hatred,” but the release hits an affecting soft spot midway, where the artist revisits an unrequited love on “Blueberry” (“Without you, I’m barely breathing”) and a former love on the R&B-kissed “Orion.”\n\n“XO” ends with a title track about the kind of love that can be the hardest to come by – self-love – with Michael’s ghostly vocals massaging the atmosphere with a refrain of “I love you.”\n\nThis release may be more phantasm than fantasy, but Michael comes through when it counts.\n\nMichael Love Michael\n\n\"XO\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nNeon Trees want to be remembered\n\nThere’s something revealing about the title of the new release from Neon Trees, “I Can Feel You Forgetting Me”: It’s been 6 years since the Utah pop-rock group’s last release, “Pop Psychology” – a lifetime in pop years.\n\nIn the interim between albums, frontman Tyler Glenn performed on Broadway (in “Kinky Boots”) and put out a solo release, and his return with “I Can Feel You Forgetting Me” is darker and stripped down as it conveys the tale of a man who has been knocked down and is learning to live on his own.\n\nYet the group’s return lacks the infectious spirit of past releases, and the band that has so handily resurrected the sound of 1980s music has now inadvertently conjured another trope from the era: the lackluster follow-up.\n\n“I Can Feel You Forgetting Me” sounds like a selection of B-sides (from when B-sides were a thing), castoffs and filler songs. All the pieces are still there, from the dynamic blend of synth and organic music to the sing-along choruses to the playful attitude. However, it’s mostly a little off, a bit flat, a tad slow or just not catchy enough. And Neon Trees are a little more Yacht Rock than New Wave this time around, which we could have done without.\n\nThe busy arrangement of opener “Nights,” the hum and frustration of “Used To Like,” the classic strains of “Skeleton Boy” … they all help the cause. And later, “Everything Is Killing Me” hitches to an engaging groove and lines like, “I used to lie enough to get by … I couldn’t keep up with it.”\n\nBest of all is the sweeping closing track, “New Best Friend,” the most engaging song in the lot with a self-accepting Glenn seemingly taking comfort that he is “always forever a black sheep.”\n\nBy contrast there’s the inconsequential rumbling of “Holy Ghost,” the random energy of “Going Through Something” and the sappy “Mess Me Up” that at least offers, “If you’re gonna mess me up, don’t do it slowly.”\n\nUltimately, “I Can Feel You Forgetting Me” isn’t very memorable.\n\nNeon Trees\n\n\"I Can Feel You Forgetting Me\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n+++++++++++\n\nPretenders conjure a lovable 'Hate'\n\nPretenders vocalist Chrissie Hynde sings on the jangly new song “Maybe Love Is in NYC,” “Things change and they’re never quite the same for anyone.” Yet her band’s new album, “Hate for Sale,” defies those words.\n\nIt’s been 40 years since the group made its groundbreaking self-titled debut, and Hynde has been the only consistent member of Pretenders over the years. However, “Hate for Sale” could easily pass for an immediate follow-up to 1980’s Pretenders, not something that came about four decades, 10 albums and numerous lineup changes later.\n\nThe group’s 2020 sound is barely different from “Pretenders” and the structure is the same – quickly dispatched rock songs that cruise on infectious melodies and periodically blaze with guitars, contrasted with an occasional ballad or some sonic switch-up. And Hynde’s characteristic warble is remarkably unchanged as she shifts from plaintive tones to punkish derision, gliding along “Hate for Sale’s” complicated jumble of emotions.\n\nFrom the false start of the album’s classic title track to the cello-and-piano foundation of closer “Crying in Public,” Pretenders delivers distinctive diversions, but Hynde’s dominating and empathetic persona lends continuity. She wrestles the crunchy cadence of “Turf Accountant Daddy” to deliver a searing indictment of a womanizing traveling salesman, and she fuses sarcasm and pain on the comfortable “Didn’t Want to Be This Lonely.” And always at ease, whether in the slinky reggae of “Lightning Man” or the R&B vibe of “You Can’t Hurt a Fool,” Hynde is ever tough, pointedly not romanticizing drug abuse in the electrified “Junkie Walk” and taking a shot at vulnerable women on “Crying in Public.”\n\n“Hate for Sale’s” tone is a tad flat at times, though Hynde still sounds amazingly close to her prime.\n\nPretenders\n\n\"Hate for Sale\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nRetro vibe takes unconventional turns\n\nLos Retros methodically builds his aesthetic with his second EP in two years, “Everlasting.”\n\nThe Oxnard, California, native – aka Mauri Tapia – follows the 2019 EP “Retrospect” with an “Everlasting” that fuses elements of early synth music and soft rock for a throwback sound that didn’t really exist before, but maybe it should have.\n\nUndoubtedly by design, the off-center release feels both familiar and unreal as the disparate pieces work together, fitfully, forcing listeners to get in the right head space to accept it.\n\nFor instance, “Sweet Honey” feels like a hallucination when it sets sail on a yacht rock vibe that carries more soul in the mix than typical for the genre, and as it cruises along, the journey becomes increasingly eccentric until it’s facsimilating Prince with its high vocals and lyrics like, “There’s something about the way you look.”\n\n“The Messiah” sounds like a classic pop-rock ballad blended with a sci-fi horror theme, and as it gurgles woozily in a synthetic stew, it simmers into what could be an otherworldly porn soundtrack as Tapia sounds both earnest and stilted with his vocal delivery. Meanwhile, the keyboard-heavy “Cry of the Humble” sounds like an interlude for a rock opera with Tapia crooning away, and “New Humanity” burnishes shinier tones to accompany his drunken meander of la-la-la’s and ah’s.\n\nFinally, “Everlasting” ends with a drowsy “Fruitful” that tops jazzy drums with blooping synths.\n\nAlthough it’s discombobulating the first time around, “Everlasting” makes more sense with repeated listens … so much so that Tapia’s audience may wish the EP had more than five songs.\n\nLos Retros\n\n\"Everlasting\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nPaul Hardcastle takes it easy\n\nPaul Hardcastle came up with a peculiar song in 1985. Using a propulsive, state-of-the-art synthetic foundation for his anti-war single “19,” Hardcastle layered in a spoken broadcaster voice reiterating the point that the average age of a combat soldier in the Vietnam War was 19, with stutter-cut vocals going “nu-nu-nu-nu-nineteen” against a melodic group of backing vocals blithely singing along.\n\nDifficult as it might be in 2020 to think of such a grim song packing out the dancefloors (well, it was the 1980s), “19” went to No. 1 in Hardcastle’s native U.K. and was a hit around the world, including in the U.S.\n\nIn the 35 years since, the 62-year-old has toyed with electronica, dance, funk and pop to settle on what is essentially ambient chill/smooth jazz with his latest, “Nine.”\n\nHe took a long journey to end up with something so deceptively simple and formulaic, yet the release is an effective escape, music to block out the background of noise and implied noise during troubled times.\n\n“Nine” could be the sounds of an upscale hotel lobby or a sedate coffee shop.\n\nOpening cut “Welcome to the Morning” might suit a stretching sequence in a yoga class, while more rhythmic tracks such as the shuffling “Let It Go” and sci-fi-tinged “Falling” could offer soothing strains (with a little kick) for a home project. Meanwhile, the throbbing undertones and percussive loop of “Tropicool” is perfect cocktail music.\n\nHardcastle employs the usual suspects to achieve drowsy mystique – piano, synths, guitar, horn – and occasionally unobtrusive vocals that edge into creepy whispers for “Outside My Window” and bloom into full-blown cheesy splendor on “Lovin You Lovin Me.”\n\nMostly, though, everything about “Nine” stays out of your way so you can do your thing.\n\nPaul Hardcastle\n\n\"Nine\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nKinane does tricks on 'Trampoline'\n\nAs society continues to tweak the line between “entertaining” and “offensive,” comedy takes the brunt of the censorship. For good reason: The “edge” in edgy comedy typically refers to comics pushing the limits of good taste, eliciting laughs from audiences who are taken to the brink (and beyond) of acceptability.\n\nTo be sure, much of what is culturally allowable today will soon enough be forbidden, and that undoubtedly has a chilling effect on some comedians who don’t want to be forced to edit or apologize for their material in the future.\n\nBut not Kyle Kinane, the 43-year-old Midwesterner who is arguably the best active stand-up in the business. His delivery is comfortable, growly-voiced storytelling that gets laughs from jokes, jokes within jokes, asides and overall absurdity. He’s relatable and self-effacing, but winkingly savvy and deceptively smart.\n\nHis themes bounce around on “Trampoline.” He talks about reaching “rock bottom” when he was sober for three weeks and caught himself cleaning his bathroom on a Saturday night. He struggles with the discomfort of self-doubts in an era of sexual harassment claims. And he gently mocks the behavior of an aging couple – his own parents – like when his mom declared, “I’ll never have a mail slot in my door, only a mailbox.”\n\n“Trampoline” also includes satisfying longer tales, about everything from Kinane’s unnerving visit to a walk-in clinic to his attempt to prank his roommate with a life-size dummy that backfires when he freaks out about the prop before his roommate comes home. There’s also a tale about how his DUI in America got him sent out of Canada.\n\nIn other words, much of Kinane’s “Trampoline” humor is connected to getting drunk, sexual harassment, making fun of old people and getting a DUI. And somehow, thanks to Kinane’s thematic pivots and endearing personality, it’s still OK … for now.\n\nKyle Kinane\n\n\"Trampoline in a Ditch\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nWainwright isn't just a showoff\n\nIn the past decade or so, Rufus Wainwright wrote two operas, put William Shakespeare’s sonnets to music, got married and became a father.\n\nSo it’s not surprising that with all that going on, his new “Unfollow the Rules” is his first traditional singer-songwriter release since 2012’s “Out of the Game,” though it might not be accurate to call it mainstream accessible.\n\n“Unfollow the Rules” drips with privilege, from the elevated vocabulary to the worldly lyrical references, and Wainwright’s operatic indulgences seem to have heightened his sense of theater, which will undermine the authenticity of “Unfollow the Rules” for some listeners.\n\nStill, those who can hang with lyrics about a “fecund resource for anger,” “a flaying funeral snare,” the Conservatorio Luigi Cherubini (in Florence, Italy) and Welsh-born actress Sarah Siddons (who died in 1831) will find much to appreciate here, from the lush orchestration led by venerable producer Mitchell Froom to Wainwright’s croon, which has settled into a deeper, more palatable range than the high, sometimes-whining delivery of his youth.\n\nDespite his proclivity to show off, Wainwright fills these beautiful songs with humor, poking at absurd emphasis on regional popularity on the wry “You Ain’t Big” and singing against the resonant beat of “Trouble in Paradise,” “There’s always trouble in paradise/Don’t matter if you’re good of bad or mean or awfully nice.”\n\nWainwright also hits notes that will disarm those dealing with middle-age introspection, including a touching “My Little You” for his daughter and a “Peaceful Afternoon” for his husband, Jorn Weisbrodt, where Wainwright says the relationship is “running at full steam” and then hitches to a swaying melody to sing, “I pray that your face is the last I see on a peaceful afternoon.”\n\nWith lines like that, it’s easy to overlook his esoteric tendencies.\n\nRufus Wainwright\n\n\"Unfollow the Rules\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\n'World' aims to inspire children\n\nAfter building a career of making music for films, TV shows and commercials – as well as pop music for adults – Rhode Island native Greg Lato pivots to his first album for children, “Create My Own World.”\n\nLato is gentle and heartfelt on the release. He’s not one to hype up kids with a barrage of infectious hooks, though a little more bounce could help the momentum lags on “Create My Own World.” Instead, the father of two daughters aims to uplift and inspire as he entertains.\n\nIn one of several spoken interludes, Lato speaks of an imaginary friend named Gene who taught Lato healthy habits when he was a boy. Queue the track “Hi Gene” (“hygiene,” get it?), a sweet synthpop number where the singer references brushing and flossing teeth and keeping clean because, “I don’t want to smell like an elephant!”\n\n“Share My Stuff” is an enthusiastic endorsement of sharing, and fellow children’s music star Bill Harley helps Lato offer encouraging tales of perseverance on “Two Slow Snails.” Elsewhere, Lato’s jazz saxophonist father, Vinny Lato, has a solo part on “Create My World’s” imagination-themed title track.\n\nAlso “Try” is a reggae-lilting mental-health pep talk for kids (a complement to Lato’s sing-along children’s book of the same name), and “What Daddies Do (I Will Be With You)” is a touching vow of support from parent to child.\n\nThe music is a pleasing mix of retro pop-rock, even if Lato isn’t the strongest singer, and those who fear “Create My Own World” is too heavy with messages can enjoy lighter fare such as the dancey tribute “I Like Sprinkles” and the lighthearted mystery “I Can’t Find My Sock!”\n\nStill, the soft sonics and understanding themes of “Create My Own World” would be better suited for introspective children than those who generally bounce off the walls.\n\nGreg Lato\n\n\"Create My Own World\"\n\nRating: 3 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nIris Lune processes grief\n\nThe death of a parent can be a particularly disorientating loss, and artists have shown ingenuous ways to process their feelings. For example, Canadian singer Jane Siberry created a devastating 10-minute song, “The Vigil (The Sea),” about grieving beside her mother’s deathbed, telling her mom it’s OK to let go and leading her to the afterlife. And American singer Poe commemorated her late father on the album “Haunted” by inventing interactions with her dad by using snippets of spoken recordings of him that she found after he died.\n\nIris Lune, aka Brooklyn-based Ella Joy Meir, is similarly enterprising, if not quite as successful, in dealing with her mother’s death on “Love Loss Love.”\n\nMeir’s voice is mellifluous yet vulnerable as she copes with hurt, fear, uncertainty and emptiness while also taking comfort in deep and forever love. Likewise, the songs feature contrasting textures – at their heart, many are uncomplicated folk songs improbably draped in layers of dissimilar electronica.\n\nAt best, “Love Loss Love” pierces the soul with a quiet passage in “Summer Blue” – Meir singing, “I need to know that you’ll be OK, that we’ll be OK, that I’ll be OK” – sends mixed signals in the calming vocals pinned to an anxiety-prompting rhythm on “Haven” and tethers the jazz-parallel arrangement of “Hiding Behind Glass” to glitchy vocals with lines like, “Tried hiding behind glass, but everyone just saw right through me.” And despite the life-affirming softness on “Bottled Up,” Meir drops lyrics such as, “Never thought I’d be so brave with all my insides splashed like roadkill.”\n\nAt worst, the experimentalism goes astray, be it in the clunkily unconventional cadence of “Note to Self” or the wobbly strains of “Treasure.” But even then, “Love Loss Love” is intriguing.\n\nIris Lune\n\n\"Love Loss Love\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\n'Eurovision' kicks up the camp\n\nThe soundtrack for “Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga” is an absolute hodgepodge of music, which is exactly what it should be.\n\nThe Netflix film is a parody of the Eurovision competition, which is often so campy that it seems like a parody of music on its own. Yet Eurovision (which annually pits music acts from mostly European countries against each other) is inescapably popular and ripe for this film starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as a duo from Iceland.\n\nThe soundtrack features goofy brief songs by the duo (with Ferrell doing his own vocals and Molly Sanden of My Marianne singing the vocals for the McAdams character), ranging from the over-the-top EDM of “Double Trouble” (also featuring Tiesto) to the Old World-flavored “Jaja Ding Dong,” which is loaded with hilarious innuendo.\n\nThere are also full-length songs from the likes of the English pop band Anteros (“Fool Moon”), Portuguese crooner Salvador Sobral (“Amar Pelos Dois”), Swedish singer Petra Nielsen, who offers a rousing caberet-esque sing-along “Come and Play (Masquerade),” and “Eurovision” star/American icon Demi Lovato (“In the Mirror”), who plays the ill-fated Icelandic singer Katiana Lindsdottir in the film.\n\n“Downton Abbey” star Dan Stevens also shows up in the cast as one of the competitors, and many former Eurovision competitors appear in cameos – and in a grab-bag cast medley of Cher’s “Believe,” Madonna’s “Ray of Light,” Abba’s “Waterloo,” Celine Dion’s “Ne Partez pas Sans Moi” and The Black Eyed Peas’ “I Gotta Feeling.”\n\nThe soundtrack also includes a pleasantly non-kitschy suite of the film’s score by Atli Orvarsson.\n\nnfortunately, this year “Eurovision” was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But maybe this loving Netflix film tribute, and its soundtrack, can help fill the void.\n\nvarious acts\n\n\"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nAtlanta's 6lack stays in his lane\n\n6lack’s music is rich in a spellbinding, narrowly focused atmosphere on his new “6pc Hot EP.”\n\nBut don’t let that mislead you: The lyrics show that the Atlanta R&B singer has a lot on his mind, despite the monochromatic, albeit bewitching, arrangements.\n\n“6pc Hot EP” will put listeners in an altered state with its textured, relaxed vibe. There are quirks and whimsical twists built into the mix, but nothing that detours away from a chilled and easygoing ambience – the wonky strum of “ATL Freestyle,” the unconventional cadence of “Elephant in the Room” and the offbeat piano of “Outside” are all just decorations to distinguish the individual rooms in the same sonic house.\n\n6lack’s delivery likewise stays in its lane, a soothing voice with nuanced tones (and electronic modulations) to indicate shifts in sentiment and mood. So, if you’re looking for a club banger followed by a crooning ballad followed by trumped-up classic soul, keep looking.\n\nInstead, “6pc Hot EP” intoxicates as 6lack takes a cruise through the streets of Atlanta on “ATL Freestyle,” feeling underappreciated and frustrated. On “Float” he drops wry lines and says he needs a drink to help him get by (“I’m just trying to stay afloat”), he stands up for himself on “Elephant in the Room,” and in the hypnotic “Know My Rights” he counters the music-box intoxication of the arrangement by wearily singing how he’s paid his dues.\n\nHowever, he’s endearing on closer “Outside,” yearning for happier times and confessing, “I’m excited just to hold your hand/I’m still stuck on love like it’s Krazy Glue.” And though he’s looking for carnal pleasure on the sensual “Long Nights,” featuring a sax-garnished jazz groove and flirty guest vocals from Ari Lennox, he indicates that he might be looking for more than a friends-with-benefits relationship.\n\nHe knows how to work it.\n\n6lack\n\n\"6pc Hot EP\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nWare fine-tunes pop sophistication\n\nAmerican pop music is more age-centric than in other countries. Not only does the audience tend to drift away as they get older, the performers (especially the women, unfairly) can be washed up by the time they hit 30.\n\nSo English singer Jessie Ware’s career has more breathing room, at least outside of America, than her U.S. counterparts; the vocalist may be 35, but she’s hardly aged out of the game.\n\nThat said, Ware’s new “What’s Your Pleasure?” doesn’t chase music trends and it doesn’t wallow in teen angst. Instead, the release is a throwback to the 1980s and ’90s, when the “adult contemporary” charts were more vibrant and its hits consistently overlapped with the Top 40.\n\n“What’s Your Pleasure?” is a stylistic hybrid, packed with politely insistent dance songs tempered by Ware’s measured delivery and framed with jazz nuance. And those dance styles typically nod to past, beloved sub-genres.\n\nThe release repeatedly conjures 1980s-era Prince – with tracks like the dancefloor-friendly “Ooh La La,” the funk-kissed “Read My Lips” and a “Soul Control” that finds Ware breathily sidling up to heavy bass. Even better, Ware plays the suggestive chanteuse to the Giorgio Moroder disco-rumble of the title track, and she brings a sophisticated air to opening track “Spotlight” when the synthesizers take over.\n\nElsewhere electronic undertones texturize the sprawling sensuality of “In Your Eyes,” the chiming hypnosis of “Adore You” and the alluring surrealism of “The Kill.” And the infectious “Mirage (Don’t Stop)” echoes Robin Thicke’s “Blurred Lines,” which in turn “borrowed” from Marvin Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up.”\n\nOn the downside, the lyrics aren’t groundbreaking and “What’s Your Pleasure?” stumbles into cheesiness at times. Yet the classy atmosphere more than compensates.\n\nJessie Ware\n\n\"What's Your Pleasure?\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nDream Wife is rousing, if uneven\n\nDream Wife’s new “So When You Gonna …” is a battle between versatility and continuity as the London-based trio reveals itself to be both remarkably well-rounded and distractingly incongruous.\n\nThere’s an exciting punk undercurrent from the band that comes to the surface with fierce attitude and occasional screams from Icelandic-native vocalist Rakel Mjoll, yet on the flipside there’s a catchy pop side that appears with melodious hooks and romanticism.\n\nIn addition to the band’s multi-dimensional character, Dream Wife impresses with dexterous instrumentation, shifting from the indie-rock blast of “Sports!” (where Mjoll asks, “Dropping balls, missing goals/Do you even play this sport?”) to the humming dreampop of “Hasta La Vista” to the edgy rock of “Homesick” (“You got me feelin’ kind of homesick, so I threw up all over you”).\n\nLater Dream Wife serves a surf guitar suitable for a beachside campfire on the disarming “Temporary,” hitches to the fluttering rhythm of the meditative “Old Flame” and escalates the retro-Goth-pop philosophy of “RHRN” into a forceful conclusion: “We are the youngest we will ever be and the oldest we have ever been.”\n\nDream Wife also digs through the off-kilter tension of the title track for a demanding refrain of “When you gonna kiss me? When you gonna kiss me” and succumbs to the cutesy (and complicated) infatuation of “Hold on Me.”\n\nTrouble is, the trio suffers with transitions, flipping from jarring contrast to jarring contrast, and the group gets mired in meandering passages and ultimately slumps into an enervating, near-six-minute mopey closer, “After the Rain.”\n\nSo, while Dream Wife is adroit at handling the extremes, the group struggles in the in-between spaces.\n\nDream Wife\n\n\"So When You Gonna ...\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nDan Cummins fires up for \"Devil\"\n\nDan Cummins is fed up with those who don’t care about others as well as those who concern themselves too much about others, landing himself in a happy middle ground where most of us think we live, even if we don’t.\n\nThe comedian/host of the podcast “Timesuck” lets out a stream of frustrations on his new stand-up release, “Get Outta Here; Devil!” – including his struggle to understand how to use the semicolon (hence the title).\n\nHis targets include flat-Earthers, anti-vaxxers, conspiracy theorists, IRS workers, those who get on elevators before others can get off, those who talk instead of whisper in movies, those who put their phone calls on speaker in public, those who believe in the lizard illuminati, parents who believe teachers have an agenda against their kids, and perhaps most of all, those who think something they read on Facebook or something they watched on YouTube makes them more qualified to speak on a medical issue than someone who actually went to med school.\n\nBut “Get Outta Here; Devil!” isn’t merely a screed against humanity. Cummins is an easy conversationalist who reveals plenty of droll self-effacing material to make him relatable to his audience, such as when he talks about his awkward parenting with his daughter’s questionable art skills and with his well-behaved son’s quest for credibility.\n\nHe also has an even more personal tale of post-puberty embarrassment, and he reveals that as a full-grown man, he has struggled with curved glass, including when he broke a tooth because, “I thought it would be hilarious to scare a fish in a fishbowl.\n\nYet he seems most fired up when he talks about how some easily triggered folks attempt to censor comedians’ jokes: “They want to take the thing they don’t like personally away from everyone else.”\n\nSo be warned, if you don’t like what Cummins has to say, that’s on you.\n\nDan Cummins\n\n\"Get Outta Here; Devil!\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nJuniper has a one-track mind\n\nA press release touts Juniper Shelley, 15, as demonstrating what it’s like to be a “normal teenaged girl in 2020” on her new debut, “Juniper,” though it helps that she’s surrounded by veteran music professionals.\n\nHer dad, radio DJ and singer-songwriter Michael Shelley, is a driving force behind “Juniper” (his daughter gets many co-writing credits), but a few other songs and the instrumentation are credited to members from a number of alt-rock, indie and other noteworthy acts including The Drive-By Truckers, Belle and Sebastian, Marshall Crenshaw, Yo La Tengo, Son Volt, Mekons, Teenage Fanclub and The Muffs.\n\nYet the sound is a blast even further back, to the likes of surf rock and 1960s girl group material, though shaded with a wry edge that brings to mind early Blondie albums before all the No. 1 hits started rolling out.\n\nThen there’s Juniper at the center, a “normal” 15-year-old girl armed with smart lines about falling for a boy at an amusement park (“The Dragon Coaster”), falling in line to fall for the magnetic Chad (“Everybody’s Got a Crush on Chad”), falling for a bad boy in tight jeans (“Punk Rock Boy”) and refusing to fall for all the enticing boys who aren’t her stable boyfriend (“Sticking With My Henry”).\n\nShe waltzes through an R&B-styled “Girls Just Want a Boy to Rest Their Head Upon,” tries to resist her dreamboy in the psychedelic “I Don’t Want to Dream About You” and fusses that “Dreaming about you is taking all of my time” on “Best Kept Secret.” Plus, the title of “Boys! Boys! Boys! Boys! Boys!” speaks for itself.\n\nThe relentless boy-crazy themes are kinda ugh, but you be you, girl.\n\nAnd Juniper does branch out: The jumpy “Kids on My Corner” is a gleeful blast about a local band that “wrote a song/It’s not that good, but it’s not that long.” And “Gotta Draw the Line” is about her undying devotion to her BFF, whom she would do anything for … er, unless she flirts with Juniper’s boyfriend.\n\nStill, despite the narrow focus, “Juniper” is a smart and rewarding release.\n\nJuniper\n\n\"Juniper\"\n\nRating: 3-1/2 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nPeter Manos will get in your head\n\nPeter Manos is fast-tracking his slow-lane style in the music business with his new debut EP, “Do You Turn Red?”\n\nIn 2017 the Texas native was eyeing a music career while studying at Nashville’s Belmont University when he created the song “In My Head” in his dorm room. The brooding, quiet number hinges on lines filled with regret and sadness like, “You say it’s all alright, but you’re not the one who’s up at night.”\n\nThe song went on to be streamed hundreds of millions of times, including more than 100 million times on Spotify alone while also generating almost 70 million views on YouTube.\n\nIt was enough to prompt Manos to move to Los Angeles, where he created a home studio to record “Do You Turn Red?” And as sparse as “In My Head” is, the other songs on the EP are almost subliminal.\n\nManos creates a distinct air in this minimalistic, electronic-based marvel, compounding the woozy instrumentation with indistinct, albeit soulful, enunciation and the somber vibe of downbeat lyrics that dwell in disappointment.\n\nThe chilled environment is surreal and lowkey mesmerizing, whether Manos is reverberating in the smoky realm of “My Mind,” glowing through the gorgeous translucence of “Zach’s Ballad” or slow-dripping emotion in the cool “You Don’t Know Me,” where he sings, “I don’t think you know me like you thought you did.”\n\n“At Night” employs a thickened sound, a relatively dense foundation that creates more impactful support for his lonely vocals, and the swirling tonic of “Tennessee” finds his modulated vocals meandering through a soundscape of compressed bass as he realizes, “Nothing ever changes and nothing ever changes … and I wish I could change this.”\n\nCompared to the other songs, the gentle EP closer “In My Head” sounds downright lively.\n\nNever underestimate the power of understatement.\n\nPeter Manos\n\n\"Do You Turn Red?\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nChiasm gets carried away\n\nLongtime darkwave star Chiasm, aka Emileigh Rohn, gives a taste of her upcoming album “Missed the Noise” with a new EP, “Away.”\n\nThe Detroit-based performer has put out some austere material the past 20-something years, industrial-drenched noise explosions and implosions, but “Away” is considerably more accessible thanks in part to her collaboration with John Fryer, producer for the likes of Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails.\n\n“Away,” featuring four distinctly different mixes of “Away,” is actually accessible from four different directions.\n\nThe original mix is a dramatic, hard-rubbed-synthesizer brand of electro, a Goldfrapp-meets-Grimes instrumental context for the vocals of Rohn, who at times sounds like a dead ringer for the Bangles’ Susannah Hoffs (of all people). The subsequent “Interface Remix” of the song rides a thumping dance beat and rolling electronic pulses plus piano-esque nuance – ideal club music that reverberates with Rohn’s refrain, “Why don’t you take me away?”\n\nLater, a “Skydeck Mix” of “Away” puts the song in sleek-stalker mode, an NIN-reminiscent blend of alt-rock foreboding with suggestions of quiet horror that create an impenetrable mystique. Then a “GW4 Mix” of the song takes the insistent rhythm into a lowkey, electronic-chill mode, the vibe merging with lines about “our lives are churning away, our hearts are churning away …”\n\nFor good measure, the EP closes out with a “:10:” mix of the song “Frantic,” a less-inviting track than any of the versions of “Away” as it disintegrates in the collapsing crunch of an electric fire.\n\nThat closing cut may be a memento to hardcore fans who feast on Chiasm’s artful tangents, but the cornucopia of “Aways” on the EP show broader promise for her next move.\n\nChiasm\n\n\"Away\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)\n\n++++++++++\n\nBerger's \"Moon\" proves enlightening\n\nCalling Mare Berger’s new 8-song “The Moon Is Always Full” a chamber-pop EP doesn’t begin to describe it.\n\nThe jazz-trained performer doesn’t merely sing along to easily digestible string-and-piano arrangements. Instead, the composer/vocalist/pianist creates a provocative alternate universe that basks in a mind-bending assortment of philosophical and existential observations and suggestions, and the tracks are shaded in a range of genres outside the traditional chamber-pop realm.\n\nBut sure, there are strings.\n\n“The Moon Is Always Full” opens with a somewhat strident “Even When We Forget,” with lines like “We are the ocean, we are the drop … Even when we forget, we are … We are everything.” From there, Berger’s pure voice rings out in “Step Away My Dear,” singing, “When we think we know, we know nothing.” Subsequent lines include the mantra “I pray that the seed will grow” on the title track and on the less ornate “Praise This Fear,” “Praise this fear that holds me down … Praise this fear that makes me, me.”\n\nThe latter track has a spiritual air in its clean mix, but other songs display markings of rock (e.g. Lilith rock) and folk (especially indie or alt-folk), and the meditative “Stardust” sounds like an old mountain ballad. Meanwhile, the instruments, especially the strings, are often employed in aggressively experimental bursts to keep listeners alert.\n\nThere’s also a complicated, ever-shifting “Wondering” that pivots and builds into what sounds like a Jane Siberry mini-musical from the 1990s, Bergen asking, “When does a person become a thought? … What does a memory mean?” The release then moves into its swooning finale, “You Are Within.”\n\nIt’s hard not to be temporarily absorbed into Berger’s realm (even if some of the lines sound more like smart bumper stickers than profound thoughts), yet why resist?\n\nMare Berger\n\n\"The Moon Is Always Full\"\n\nRating: 4 (out of 5)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/05"}]}

It's a tax on consumption rather than income, and it ranges from 15-25%. If you pay this tax when shopping abroad, you can often get your money back after you've returned home, since travelers are typically entitled to a refund for the VAT portion of prices for goods. But getting that refund can be a headache. Here are 10 things you need to know about claiming VAT refunds.\n\nRefunds from goods, not services\n\nCountries generally exempt exports from VAT. So when you buy merchandise or other goods as a tourist, what you take home is considered an export. Accordingly, you are entitled to a refund for the VAT portion of the price.\n\nOn the other hand, when you stay in a hotel or eat a restaurant meal, those services are consumed locally rather than exported. Accordingly, tourists are not entitled to VAT refunds on those purchases. Some business travelers are allowed to recover VAT on services, but the process is so complicated that only large corporations with heavy business travel ever try to recover it.\n\nVAT can be big\n\nVAT is the English-language term; other terms include IVA, TVA, moms, MwST, and a handful of unique local terms. EU (much of Western Europe) rules require that member countries impose a VAT of at least 15%; most rates are in the range of 19-25%. Many countries exempt some purchases entirely or apply reduced percentages on \"essential\" purchases such as food, rent, transportation, and medical services. A few countries also exempt certain regions from VAT or apply reduced rates because of quasi-independent status or to encourage economic development. Among Europe's reduced- or no-VAT areas are the Aegean Islands, the Azores, the Canary Islands, and the Channel Islands.\n\nVAT rates in Europe's four non-EU countries are 25.5% in Iceland, 25% in Norway, 8% in Switzerland, and 18% in Turkey, again with some exempted or reduced rates.\n\nKeep in mind that the VAT rate is the amount added to a pretax base price, not a percentage of the final price. Thus, a 20% VAT rate amounts to 16.7% of the purchase price.\n\nIt's included in the price\n\nAs a practical matter, merchandise prices you see in stores almost always include VAT. So do posted hotel rates and restaurant prices. The general rule is that what you see is what you pay. Online travel agencies (OTAs) usually post hotel prices inclusive of VAT—but not always, so check the fine print! Also, some localities impose the equivalent of sales taxes, in addition to VAT, on hotel accommodations, but they do not include these in the posted price; these additional taxes are usually quite low.\n\nYour goods must leave the country\n\nMost European countries allow you to recover VAT when you \"export\" an item. But you must prove that the goods actually left the taxing authority before collecting your refund. (For countries in the European Union, this means you must leave the EU, not just cross an internal EU border.) If you leave by plane, you have to show the goods after you pass through the customs formalities.\n\nTo qualify for a refund, the goods must be new and unused. If you buy some high-fashion accessories in Paris, for example, you shouldn't use them until you leave the EU.\n\nThere are minimum qualifying amounts\n\nMany countries establish a minimum price per item or daily value per store to qualify for a VAT refund. This minimum ranges from zero in Ireland, Germany, and the U.K. to CHF 300 (about $333 USD according to XE.com) in Switzerland, €175 (about $237) in France, €155 (about $210) in Italy, €125 (about $169) in Belgium, and €90 (about $122) in Spain.\n\nWhere to buy\n\nBuy from stores that handle VAT-refund paperwork. Most stores that do this post a \"Tax Free\" or similar sign somewhere on a door or window; big department stores often have special VAT offices. On the other hand, street vendors, sidewalk artists, many small-town stores, and such generally don't provide this service, so you're out of luck when you buy from them.\n\nWhen you buy, have the merchant provide the necessary paperwork, sometimes called a \"cheque,\" and complete the paperwork before you leave the store. (You'll probably have to prove that you're from outside the country or VAT area.)\n\nWhen you leave the EU or the country in which you bought the items, take the merchandise and the paperwork to the border station and have the documents stamped by a local customs agent. Typically, the agent will ask to see the items, so don't pack them in checked baggage—or, at least, be able to check bags after you've cleared customs. This is critical: You won't get the refund without the stamp.\n\nWork with your merchant\n\nThe easiest way to get a refund is to have the merchant handle it at the point of sale. Some merchants ask you to sign two credit card chits: one for the pre-VAT price and another for the VAT. You still have to do the paperwork and have it stamped, but when you clear the checkpoint, you just mail the completed paperwork to the merchant to prove that you really took the goods out of the area. When the merchant gets the paperwork, he or she tears up the credit card slip for the VAT. Alternatively, you sign one chit for the full price and the merchant later refunds the VAT to your card.\n\nYou can also avoid VAT by having a merchant ship the goods to you directly at your home address. In most cases, however, this isn't a good solution. Shipping charges can be very high, and you have to pay U.S. duty, even if you haven't used up your import allowance.\n\nLet the pros do it\n\nTwo agencies specialize in facilitating VAT refunds. Typically, you want to shop at stores that participate in one of these agencies' programs; this will be displayed on a sign. Go through the purchase and customs paperwork, as described. Then, after passing through customs and getting your paperwork stamped, find an agency office to process the refund. The big agencies maintain refund desks in the departure areas of major international-gateway airport terminals, at some ship and ferry terminals, and at some downtown offices. Typically, you have a choice of getting a cash, check, or credit card refund. These outfits generally deduct as much as 30% of the refund amount as a fee for services.\n\nGlobal Blue is the largest; it operates throughout Western Europe, as well as in several Eastern European countries, Argentina, Japan, Morocco, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey, and Uruguay. Premier TaxFree operates in a limited number of European countries but covers Jordan. Check the agencies' websites for more details.\n\nBuy at tax-free airport stores\n\nYou can avoid paying VAT by waiting to buy in a \"tax-free\" airport store, usually located after the departure formalities at major international airports. The post-customs areas of many big European airports are now more like upscale shopping malls than airports. But store prices at most airports are pegged to be just a little below local \"high street\" VAT-inclusive prices, not at the local price minus the VAT. Those fat markups help fund the airport.\n\nBeware of the gotchas\n\nAs noted, the paperwork and the customs stamp are critical to the process. Unfortunately, you can sometimes miss out on the chance to comply. One way to miss out is to buy from a supplier who doesn't do the paperwork. Independent artists, street merchants, and many other sellers don't participate in the programs and don't provide paperwork.\n\nYou can also miss getting the paperwork if you cross an unattended border. These days, you can pass out of a tax zone without encountering any customs office or official at all—for example, when you drive a rented car or take a train or bus through a lightly used border crossing. If you fly home from Geneva but return a rented car on the French side of Geneva International Airport, you'll find that the customs kiosks in the corridor between the French and Swiss lobbies of the terminal building are generally unattended by either country.\n\nSome countries have work-arounds for these problems. Check the agency websites for details, preferably before you encounter a problem.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/06/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2013/08/26/europe-secret-restaurants/2700547/", "title": "Europe's best hidden eats", "text": "Anne Banas\n\nSmarterTravel.com\n\nFrom local holes-in-the-wall to trendy clandestine establishments, travelers to Europe have plenty of ways to veer off the tired tourist track when they dine. At these hidden spots, whether a secret late-night bakery in Lisbon or a dynamic pop-up in London, diners can immerse themselves in the local culture and be in the know despite being far from home.\n\nOn a recent stopover in Lisbon, I met up with Frederico Duarte, Lisboeta and co-author of Fabrico Proprio, a book (and ongoing project) on the design of Portuguese pastry. He led me on a late-night trek in search of the city's underground bakeries, an adventure that became the inspiration for this story on hidden eats in Europe.\n\nRead on to discover these pastry havens, plus lesser-known dining spots in other great European cities.\n\nBolos da madrugada, Lisbon\n\nBehind unmarked doors, down seemingly barren alleys and stairwells, lie the bolos da madrugada, or \"cakes at dawn\" bakeries. The only way to find them is to either be in the know or follow the scent of freshly made pastry as you walk the streets of Lisbon. Open generally from midnight to 6 a.m. (with some variation), these secret pastelarias bring energy to the city in the otherwise quiet wee hours. As Duarte put it, \"These places keep Lisbon alive. Not just by feeding its people -- from nighthawks to early birds, from clubbers to policemen -- but mainly by showing the city's rhythm, and proving our appetite for pastries never really stops.\" Right on cue, as we stood on the stairs leading to Pastelaria Azevedo e Vidal near Praca do Chile in the Arroios neighborhood, a police officer walked past us down to the grated counter and purchased a cake from the selection of traditional favorites -- among them pasteis de nata (small custard tarts) and egg-cream filled bolas de berlim -- as sustenance for the night shift.\n\nPanificacao Reunida De Sao Roque, which is part of a larger pastry factory on Rua da Rosa in Bairro Alto, is another spot worth a stop. There's also a shop in Graca, which Duarte described as being located on the \"tiny street with the Indian restaurant.\" Take a walk through the area and follow your nose; you just might find it.\n\nTavole calde, Rome\n\nWhile most visitors to Italy opt to dine at the trattoria or ristorante, few know about a casual type of eatery where you can nosh on high-quality food at an exceptional value. With an emphasis on home cooking, a tavola calda, which translates into a \"warm table,\" is a type of self-service snack bar or diner where you can enjoy hot (or cold) bites, either inside at a few tables or as takeaway to eat later. According to Tobin Hartnell of Cultural Cache Tours, \"They would have a variety of home-style cooked foods, as well as some salads. Typically, you'd choose a bit of this and a bit of that, and pay by weight.\" At these unassuming establishments, you can grab a quick meal and spend as little as 10 or 15 euros on it.\n\nIn Rome, Hartnell recommends Volpetti Piu, which is located just across from Trastevere on Via Volta and specializes in pizzas, pastas, soups, and fried nibbles, all served at a counter. Bar La Licata, owned by two brothers and located in the heart of the city, is another local favorite.\n\nBary mleczne, Krakow\n\nIn Krakow, locals seek out comfort foods like pierogi and kielbaski, but without any frills. Of their frequented dining spots, the bar mleczny, which translates into \"milk bar,\" is a popular choice. These cafeterias were established during communist times to provide affordable, government-subsidized meals to workers who didn't have on-site canteens at their jobs. The menus were all vegetarian and focused on homemade dairy-based foods (as well as omelets and dishes like pierogi). As communism crumbled, so did the milk bar; however, the simple eating place has been making a comeback in recent years and remains a great find for authentic Polish cuisine if you know where to look.\n\nFlisak on Kosciuszki Street near Wawel Royal Castle offers traditional pierogi with cheese and potatoes. Other milk bars include Warszawianka on Juliana Dunajewskiego and Bar Mleczny on Grodzka. While not a milk bar specifically, Pierozki u Vincenta (Pierogi at Vincent Place), located on Bozego Ciala Street in the Kazimerz neighborhood, also serves dozens of different types of pierogi and is relatively unknown to tourists. Going along with the Cold War theme, Blue Nyska dishes out kielbaski until dusk from a converted communist-era van parked at Market Hall on Grzegorzecka Street. It's a popular haunt for students, actors, and night-shift workers. Ambasada Sledzia (Herring Embassy), on Stolarska Street across from the U.S. consulate, sells pickled herring and vodka shots well into the morning hours.\n\nRestaurants associatifs, Paris\n\nUnderneath the Madeleine, a famous church in Paris' 8th arrondissement, lies a crypt with a secret unknown even to most Parisians. Not only is Le Foyer de la Madeleine literally hidden behind a small side door, but it's considered a restaurant associatif, or an alternative eatery that aims to feed people without profit, is socially conscious, and employs a volunteer staff. At Le Foyer, this mission dates back to 1968, when the parish offered lunches to people in need. Today, anyone is welcome. An annual membership card costs €5 and a fixed-price lunch -- including choice of entree, plat garni, and cheese or dessert -- is just €8 (nonmembers pay slightly more). If the atmosphere, vaulted ceilings, and quality French food weren't enough reasons to visit, knowing that the small price of your meal goes to helping others will surely seal the deal.\n\nRestaurants associatifs can be found throughout Paris. Kiwizine in Belleville is a creative space offering organic coffee and cuisine; membership costs €2. Le Moulin a Cafe in Montparnasse was founded in 2006 and serves drinks, homemade cakes, and cheese and charcuterie plates; basic annual membership costs €10. And Diet Ethique has been focusing on affordable, healthy meals since 2008, with menu items ranging from €3 to €14.\n\nUnderground restaurants, Berlin\n\nFor years, Berlin has been solidifying its place as Europe's capital of hip and cool. And its dining scene, with a current trend of intentionally creative (and secret) restaurants, helps fuel that image. Enter Cookies Cream on Behrenstrasse in the city's Mitte borough. Behind a plain wooden door, in a hotel loading bay, the upscale dive defies its surroundings. And you wouldn't know it was there unless someone told you (or you became suspicious of the incongruous chandelier dangling in the alleyway). Once there, you must ring a bell and walk through a nightclub to get to the warehouse-turned-dining-room. The all-vegetarian menu focuses on seasonal ingredients from regional farmers and collectives, and three-course meals cost €36.\n\nNearby, beneath the S-train bridge at Friedrichstrasse station, Cantina in der Bar Tausend has no sign but is a lively restaurant (and nightclub) serving Asian and Ibero-American cuisine. On a high floor of a nondescript office building behind an auto-parts store, Solar, in the Kreuzberg borough, offers cocktails, fresh menu items, and views of the Berlin skyline.\n\nSpeakeasies and pop-ups, London\n\nIn some destinations, hidden eateries are just that: off-the-beaten-path establishments left undiscovered by throngs of tourists. In others, like London, they are purposefully hidden, with the aim of providing creative, unusual experiences while allowing you to feel like you're in on the \"secret.\" Here, these veiled spaces come in two major forms: speakeasies (unmarked restaurants, often with a password) and pop-ups (temporary restaurants), and all with uniquely British twists.\n\nTo get into The Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town, part of The Breakfast Club cafe on Artillery Lane, you have to address the staff and ask to see the mayor. Only then are you allowed to enter through the Smeg fridge door. The menu (\"The Mayor's Cat Food\") features standard gastropub fare. At Evans & Peel Detective Agency, making an \"appointment\" to discuss your \"case\" is preferred, though a limited number of drop-ins are welcome.\n\nFrom bohemian to refined (see The Art of Dining), pop-ups have sprouted up all over the city. Mostly broadcast via word of mouth or social media, these moving-target restaurants, which tend to come and go, can take place in private homes, rooftops, antique stores, or pretty much anywhere. In a similar fashion, Disappearing Dining Club's Back in 5 Minutes, a restaurant and supper club disguised behind a clothes shop, offers walk-in meals on certain days of the week.\n\nRestaurantes clandestinos, Barcelona\n\nWhen layoffs and high taxes strike, Spaniards get savvy and turn to covert entrepreneurship, even in the restaurant world. Chefs are secretly putting tapas and other local dishes on tables -- but their fees are being paid under the table though unlicensed restaurants, especially in food-rich cities like Barcelona. Spain might have the highest unemployment rate in Europe, but these restaurants are creating opportunities. According toThe Sunday Times, \"In Barcelona, discreet culinary hotspots, though hard to find, are popping up everywhere. Underground hair salons, jazz clubs, and flamenco halls are also said to be thriving.\" Now part of the city's culture, these clandestine venues (legal or illegal), often with creative approaches, typically have no listed addresses and attract diners through budget consciousness and intrigue.\n\nLa Contrasenya, an art-studio-turned-cooking-workshop, offers meals several nights per week; just be sure to know the password. Located in an apartment, Comedor Clandestino, or \"secret kitchen,\" focuses on fresh market cuisine as well as wine tastings and strives to immerse guests in the local culture. And Kokun, a \"gastronomic social club,\" presents a Catalan tasting menu centered on seasonal foods for €45 (including wine). For more options, request an invitation from Urban Secrets, Barcelona's clandestine gastronomical community.\n\nKnow of any hidden restaurants in Europe?

And experts say there's good reason to believe humans are to blame for the animal's odd behavior.\n\nThe sea otter has repeatedly approached surfers and essentially stolen their surfboards off the coast of Santa Cruz in recent months. In documented incidents, the otter — dubbed Otter 841 — pawed and pried surfboards away from people and chomped down hard on their edges, damaging the boards.\n\nThere have been no confirmed reports of Otter 841 injuring a human, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, but experts fear the close encounters with humans could be dangerous to both species. Multiple experts told USA TODAY that a bite could not only harm a person but could lead officials to euthanize Otter 841.\n\nIf and when search teams capture her, Otter 841 will spend the rest of her life in captivity, away from the natural population.\n\nThe otter's behavior is unusual, but it follows a familiar pattern, some experts say. Oftentimes when wild animals begin approaching humans in unusual ways, there is \"clear evidence that there was some human interaction where they formed a positive association and eventually lost their fear of people,\" said Kevin Connor, communications director at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.\n\nWhen any wild animal loses its \"natural inclination\" to avoid humans, it usually starts off as fun, unusual or benign for the human, said Gena Bentall, a sea otter biologist who researches how to protect the animals and their habitats.\n\n\"She jumps up on someone's surfboard and sits there for a while and has a positive experience with that, and over time that builds to a positive association with surfboards,\" Bentall said.\n\nBut in the end, the animal can end up paying a steep price, especially more dangerous animals.\n\n\"The human may get a bite, but the otters are going to be removed from the population and that's what's going to happen with this girl,\" Bentall said.\n\nMother of California otter also removed from wild after interacting with humans\n\nThe otter's own mother is an example of a wild animal that was removed from the wild for behavior traced to humans.\n\nOtter 841's mother, Otter 723, was herself removed from the ocean after she started climbing aboard kayaks in search of tasty treats from humans, Connor confirmed to USA TODAY. Researchers found evidence that her behavior developed after numerous positive interactions with people.\n\nAfter ending up at the Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center in Santa Cruz, Otter 723 gave birth to Otter 841.\n\nBut experts at the Monterey Bay Aquarium say the hereditary connection is very likely a coincidence.\n\nWhy did the Santa Cruz otter lose her natural fear of humans?\n\nIt will likely remain unclear exactly what led Otter 841 to lose her natural fear of humans, Connor said.\n\n“We don’t have any clear evidence for why this otter’s behavior is ... atypical,\" he said. \"We don’t know what could have done this to this specific otter.”\n\nBut history shows a pattern of how human behavior influenced these wild animals.\n\nFor centuries, colonizers on the American west coast hunted sea otters, almost driving them to extinction, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. That dominant interaction between the hunters and the hunted led to southern sea otters having a natural fear of getting too close to humans.\n\nThese days however, southern sea otters can act aggressively towards humans for the following reasons, according to wildlife experts:\n\nHormonal changes due to pregnancy or other biological processes\n\nRepeated interactions with people that give the animal a positive association with humans\n\nHumans interfering with wildlife often harms animals\n\n“There are lessons here that we can take away from the story of Otter 841 and all the interactions she’s had with people,\" Connor said. \"It is something you can point to and say, ‘this otter had to be taken from the wild because she lost her fear of people.’”\n\nIn May, Yellowstone National Park staff euthanized a newborn bison after a visitor \"intentionally disturbed\" the calf, causing its herd to reject the baby, park officials said.\n\nIn 2021, wildlife managers intentionally killed a grizzly bear in Grand Teton National Park they said had become a safety risk after it got used to getting food from humans.\n\nContributing: Emily DeLetter, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/961638/quiz-of-the-week-8-july-14-july", "title": "Quiz of The Week: 8 July - 14 July | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

Tenisha Tate-Austin and her husband, Paul Austin, say they were victims of appraisal bias. After spending months on renovations, a White appraiser valued their home much lower than they had anticipated, the couple told CNN in December. When a White friend showed the couple’s home as her own, its appraisal rose $500,000. The new appraisal for their home was now valued at more than $1.4 million, the couple said.\n\nThe couple filed the lawsuit in December, and it underscored decades long discussions about housing discrimination, Black homeownership and racial bias.\n\nThe DOJ’s Civil Rights Division issued a statement on Monday saying that “combating housing discrimination, including bias in appraisals, is a high priority across the federal government.”\n\nThe interest in the Tate-Austins’ case “directly addresses President Biden’s order to appraisal agencies to advance equity for all people, especially marginalized groups with a deep history of racial discrimination in the housing market,” the statement of interest outlines.\n\nCNN reached out to the Tate-Austins for further comment about the DOJ’s statement of interest.\n\nThe Tate-Austins were one of a few cases in which a lawsuit was filed under a FHA violation, which drew the attention of the federal government, Aryele Bradford, a DOJ spokeswoman, told CNN Friday.\n\n“…Although a number of similar situations have been reported by the media, there are few filed cases that include these types of claims under the FHA,” Bradford said in an email statement.\n\nIn the DOJ’s statement of interest, the civil rights division aims to “provide an overview of the FHA” to address the two issues in the couple’s lawsuit.\n\nThese issues came directly from the defendant, the first appraiser for the Tate-Austin home, the statement of interest outlines. The White appraiser claimed the FHA does not apply to residential appraisers and the couple failed to prove sufficient evidence of racial discrimination in the appraisal.\n\nThe difference in Black homeownership and White homeownership is measured in thousands of dollars, according to a Redfin analysis last year. Homes in Black neighborhoods are undervalued by about $46,000 per home. Devaluation – the percent discount value between homes in neighborhoods with a 50% Black population and those with no Black residents – is detrimental overtime. The more devaluation allows for more segregation and less opportunities for upward mobility, the analysis found.\n\nA history of housing discrimination and racial bias\n\nThe California couple’s lawsuit doesn’t surprise researchers like Carolina Reid, a faculty research adviser for the Terner Center for Housing Innovation based at the University of California at Berkeley.\n\n“Researchers have consistently shown the ways in which Black and other homeowners of color experience bias and discrimination in housing and credit markets,” Reid told CNN.\n\nDiscrimination in the housing market dates to the Great Depression following the Federal Housing Administration redlining of several areas across the US. Neighborhoods were considered hazardous if its residents were “inharmonious racial groups” a label primarily directed toward Black people, according to a Terner Center report on the homeownership gap.\n\nThe Federal Housing Administration, in turn, discouraged banks from making loans on properties in redlined areas thus propelling Black and Brown neighborhoods into poverty and discouraging non-White families from applying for “green lined” housing. Redlining continues to impact these communities today, according to the Terner report.\n\nIn 1968, the Fair Housing Act (FHA), strictly prohibited discrimination against all people – regardless of race, ethnicity, sex or religion – regarding the sale, rental and financing of housing in hopes to address disparities in the housing market.\n\n“What is more unique is that they (the Austins) have evidence of this disparate treatment,” she said.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act provides “plausible entitlement to relief” if the plaintiffs can prove the defendant was engaged in discriminatory practices regarding housing.\n\nThe Terner Center report, which Reid co-authored, said the FHA is intended to protect Black and Brown homeowners, but the homeownership gap continues to widen due to years of systemic oppression.\n\n“The Black/White homeownership gap is as large as it was when the Fair Housing Act was passed,” Reid told CNN. “Addressing appraisal bias/housing discrimination is only one piece of a larger puzzle of reforms that are needed, but it’s an important component of addressing systemic racism in housing.”", "authors": ["Giselle Rhoden"], "publish_date": "2022/02/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/07/12/sea-otter-santa-cruz-california-reports/70404865007/", "title": "Officials look for sea otter in Santa Cruz, CA after human encounters", "text": "Officials are warning swimmers and surfers in California to be aware as capture efforts are underway for a sea otter that has been acting aggressively toward humans.\n\nThe 5-year-old female southern sea otter in the Santa Cruz area is exhibiting \"concerning and unusual behaviors,\" the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told USA TODAY.

Jolie sold her half of the winery in 2021 to Tenute del Mondo, a subsidiary of Stoli Group, controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler.\n\nPitt sued Jolie in February, claiming that he and Jolie had an agreement that neither would sell without the other’s consent.\n\nJolie claims in her countersuit that there was never any such agreement and that she sold her portion of the winery in an effort to have “financial independence” from Pitt and to “have some form of peace and closure to this deeply painful and traumatic chapter of her and their children’s lives.”\n\nIn the court documents, obtained by CNN, Jolie also shares more details about an alleged incident on a private plane on September 14, 2016, five days before she filed for divorce.\n\nIn a section of Jolie’s counterclaim titled “Why Jolie separated from Pitt,” the document alleges that, before arriving to the airport, Pitt got into an argument with one of their six children, who at the time were between the ages of 8 and 15. The filing goes on to allege that on the plane Jolie asked Pitt “what was wrong?” and that Pitt went on to verbally attack her and then an hour and a half later “pulled” her into the bathroom, “grabbed Jolie by the head and shook her, and then grabbed her shoulders and shook her again before pushing her into the bathroom wall.”\n\nThe claim also alleges, “Pitt choked one of the children and struck another in the face. Some of the children pleaded with Pitt to stop. They were all frightened. Many were crying.”\n\nWhile an initial statement from a representative for Pitt called the new allegations “completely untrue,” in an amended statement provided to CNN on Thursday, a representative said: “(Jolie’s) story continues to evolve each time she tells it. Brad has accepted responsibility for what he did but will not for things he didn’t do.”\n\n“He has been on the receiving end of every type of personal attack and misrepresentation,” Anne Kiley, Pitt’s attorney, said in a statement Thursday. “Thankfully, the various public authorities she has tried to use against him over the past six years have made their own independent decisions. Brad will continue to respond in court as he has consistently done”\n\nCNN previously reported some of the details of the flight allegations from a heavily redacted FBI report in August.\n\nPitt was not arrested or charged in connection with the incident after the FBI completed an investigation in 2016.\n\n“In response to allegations made following a flight within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States which landed in Los Angeles carrying Mr. Brad Pitt and his children, the FBI has conducted a review of the circumstances and will not pursue further investigation. No charges have been filed in this matter,” FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said in a statement to CNN at the time.\n\n“All parties have had this information for nearly six years and was used in previous legal proceedings. There is nothing new here and serves no purpose other than being a media stunt meant to inflict pain,” a source close to Pitt said of the August report.\n\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Jolie regarding the most recent court filing, which states that during the plane incident, Pitt allegedly “lunged at his own child and Jolie grabbed him from behind to stop him. To get Jolie off his back, Pitt threw himself backwards into the airplane’s seats injuring Jolie’s back and elbow.”\n\nThe court documents also claim that the children “rushed in and all bravely tried to protect each other” and that Jolie and the children “sat still and silent under blankets. Nobody dared to go to the bathroom.”\n\nFor this reason, the legal documents state, Jolie and her six children have not been able to return to Chateau Miraval due to the “pain Pitt inflicted on the family that day.”\n\nMany of the details in Jolie’s countersuit echo those made in a countersuit filed last month by Nouvel LLC, Jolie’s former company.\n\nIn his earlier claim, Pitt had alleged that Jolie “did nothing to drive (the) growth” of the business, which he turned into a “multimillion dollar international success story.”\n\nIn its countersuit, Nouvel disputed this, saying “Pitt refused to grant Jolie or Nouvel equal access to Chateau Miraval’s records or an equal voice over management,” effectively “holding the most significant part of her net worth hostage.”\n\nJolie’s countersuit adds that “like other couples,” the two “divided their responsibilities and generally split costs.”\n\n“Jolie made her career as an actor and director secondary to her primary responsibility of raising the children. She also oversaw the day-to-day running of the Jolie-Pitt Foundation, to which she not only contributed substantial amounts of time but also substantial amounts of cash (over twice what Pitt contributed),” the document states. “Pitt continued with his Hollywood career and took primary responsibility for renovating the chateau.”\n\nShe also claims that she repeatedly tried to sell her stake in the winery to Pitt, as recently as last year and that Pitt was going to buy her portion for $54.5 million in February but that Pitt “demanded” she sign a broad non-disparagement clause “that would prohibit Jolie from discussing outside of court any of Pitt’s personal conduct toward her or the family,” inherently including the allegations of abuse from the 2016 incident.\n\nJolie claims that she refused to sign this clause and called it “an abusive and controlling deal-breaker.”\n\nThe counterclaim asks the court to declare Jolie’s sale of her stake final so that the actress can “move on from the winery and chateau.”\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect that Pitt’s representative amended their initial statement.", "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "publish_date": "2022/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/01/27/nevada-senate-race-adam-laxalt-steve-bannon-podcast-voter-fraud/9247279002/", "title": "Adam Laxalt on Steve Bannon show: Election integrity 'hottest topic'", "text": "The Republican frontrunner in Nevada's U.S. Senate race characterized widespread voter fraud as \"the hottest topic\" of his campaign during a recent interview with Steve Bannon.\n\n\"We need an election integrity plan.

He could be sentenced to up to five years in prison on the conspiracy count and 10 years on the theft count.\n\nDavis also pleaded guilty to five counts of conspiracy and 13 counts of fraud in Hinds County, District Attorney Jody E.

When State Auditor Shad White announced the finding, he called the scheme “the most egregious misspending my staff have seen in their careers.”\n\nThe eight-month long investigation showed that the department gave more than $98 million to two non-profits: The Mississippi Community Education Center and the Family Resource Center of North Mississippi. Of the $98 million, $94 million was “questioned,” meaning it was either definitively misspent or auditors were unable to determine whether it was legally spent.\n\nThe state auditor has said around $77 million of money was intended for a state welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.\n\nLast week White told CNN, “I think what you had was a lot of money being pushed through a state agency that decided to then funnel that money to a nonprofit. There just were not a ton of checks on how that nonprofit was spending this money until the auditor’s office started digging into it.\n\n“And then, you know, going another step forward into the future, I think that it’s important that we show the public that there are going to be consequences for this.”\n\nFavre’s alma mater got new volleyball arena\n\nAccording to investigators, more than $4 million was used to a build a Brett Favre-backed volleyball center at the University of Southern Mississippi, Favre’s alma mater, and where his daughter played the sport at the time.\n\nThe state of Mississippi filed a civil suit against more than 35 people and entities, including Pro Football Hall of Famer, earlier this year.\n\nText messages were released last week as part of that civil suit by attorneys for the non-profit founded by Nancy New, who has already pleaded guilty to charges related to the welfare funds scheme. They showed Favre discussing getting money through New’s nonprofit and expressing his love for Davis after being told of the funding, as well as meetings with Davis and former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant about the funding.\n\nBryant and Favre have not been criminally charged with any wrongdoing at this time. Bryant is also not named as a defendant in the civil suit.\n\nThe former quarterback’s attorney told CNN that Favre, who retired after the 2010 season and a 20-year NFL career, did not know welfare funds were being used for the volleyball center and that his fundraising efforts for the volleyball center were honorable.", "authors": ["Melissa Alonso Dianne Gallagher", "Melissa Alonso", "Dianne Gallagher"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/01/health/melatonin-overuse-wellness/index.html", "title": "Is melatonin bad for you? Usage is on the rise despite health risks ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nMore and more adults are taking over-the-counter melatonin to get to sleep, and some may be using it at dangerously high levels, a study has found.\n\nThe overall use among the US adult population is still “relatively low,” but the study does “document a significant many-fold increase in melatonin use in the past few years,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. She was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA, found that by 2018 Americans were taking more than twice the amount of melatonin than a decade earlier.\n\nMelatonin has been linked to headaches, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, drowsiness, confusion or disorientation, irritability and mild anxiety, depression and tremors as well as abnormally low blood pressure. It can also interact with common medications and trigger allergies.\n\nWhile short-term use for people with jet lag, shift workers and those who have trouble falling asleep appears to be safe, long-term safety is unknown, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“In an associational study we found that older adults who reported frequent use — every night or most nights — of a sleep aid (over the counter or prescription) had a higher risk of incident dementia and early mortality,” Robbins said.\n\nHowever, researchers could not determine which type of sleep aid — over-the-counter medications, such as melatonin, or prescription medications — was responsible for the findings.\n\nMelatonin’s side effects\n\nSince 2006, a small but growing subset of adults are taking amounts of melatonin that far exceed the dosage of 5 milligrams a day typically used as a short-term treatment, the study found.\n\nHowever, pills for sale may contain levels of melatonin much higher than what is advertised on the label. Unlike drugs and food, melatonin is not fully regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, so there are no federal requirements that companies test pills to ensure they contain the amount of advertised melatonin.\n\nPeople are using twice as much melatonin as they did a decade ago, sometimes at dangerously high levels. Shutterstock\n\n“Previous research has found that that melatonin content in these unregulated, commercially available melatonin supplements ranged from — 83% to +478% of the labeled content,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book “Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.”\n\nNor are there any requirements that companies test their products for harmful hidden additives in melatonin supplements sold in stores and online. Previous studies also found 26% of the melatonin supplements contained serotonin, “a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\n\n“We cannot be certain of the purity of melatonin that is available over the counter,” Robbins said.\n\nTaking too much serotonin by combining medications such as antidepressants, migraine medications and melatonin can lead to a serious drug reaction. Mild symptoms include shivering and diarrhea, while a more severe reaction can lead to muscle rigidity, fever, seizures and even death if not treated.\n\nIs it bad to take melatonin every night?\n\nBecause it is purchased over the counter, experts say many people view melatonin as an herbal supplement or vitamin. In reality, melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, and released into the bloodstream to regulate the body’s sleep cycles.\n\n“There is a view that if it’s natural, then it can’t hurt,” Robbins told CNN in an earlier interview on the impact of melatonin on children. “The truth is, we just really don’t know the implications of melatonin in the longer term, for adults or kids.”\n\nAnother reality: Studies have found that while using melatonin can be helpful in inducing sleep if used correctly — taking it at least two hours before bed — but the actual benefit is small.\n\n“When adults took melatonin, it decreased the amount of time it took them to fall asleep by four to eight minutes,” Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN in 2021.\n\n“So for someone who takes hours to fall asleep, probably the better thing for them to do is turn off their screens, or get 20 to 40 minutes of exercise each day, or don’t drink any caffeinated products at all,” Breuner said.\n\n“These are all sleep hygiene tools that work, but people are very reticent to do them. They rather just take a pill, right?”\n\nTraining your brain to sleep\n\nThere are other proven sleep tips that work just as well, if not better than sleeping aids, experts say. The body begins secreting melatonin at dark. What do we do in our modern culture? Use artificial light to keep us awake, often long past the body’s normal bedtime.\n\nResearch has found that the body will slow or stop melatonin production if exposed to light, including the blue light from our smartphones, laptops and the like.\n\n“Any LED spectrum light source may further suppress melatonin levels,” said Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, who directs sleep basic research in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nSo ban those devices at least an hour before you want to fall asleep. Like to read yourself to sleep? That’s fine, experts say, just read in a dim light from a book or use an e-reader in night mode.\n\n“Digital light will suppress the circadian drive,” Polotsky said, while a “dim reading light will not.”\n\nOther tips include keeping your bedroom temperature at cooler temperatures — about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). We sleep better if we’re a bit chilly, experts say.\n\nSet up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or your days off, experts say. The body likes routine.\n\nIf your doctor does prescribe melatonin to help with jet lag or other minor sleep issues, keep the use “short term,” Robbins said.\n\nIf you are planning to use melatonin for a short-term sleep aid, try to purchase pharmaceutical grade melatonin, she advised.

They were part of a group of five people who reportedly recorded a series of disturbing videos at Circle Four Farms in Milford, Utah, where owner Smithfield Foods was operating one of the country’s largest pig farms.\n\nThe other three people charged in the case struck plea deals earlier, but Hsiung and Picklesimer pursued their cases, saying they hoped they could raise awareness about animal cruelty at factory farms and potentially set new precedent if a jury determined that they were justified in taking the piglets because they feared for the animals’ lives.\n\nDefense bid for mistrial denied\n\nJury selection in the trial was set to start Monday morning at the 5th District Courthouse in St. George, but there was controversy even before the trial could begin after defense lawyers protested they had not received information on prospective jurors and asked for a mistrial.\n\nHsiung, who is representing himself, challenged the start on due process grounds, saying that while prosecutors had received the full names of prospective jurors, he had not.\n\nHsiung said none of the juror questionnaires he’d received included last names, making it impossible for him to conduct research and investigate potential sources of bias.\n\n“I don’t know how we can move forward with jury selection without the information we are constitutionally entitled to,” he said in a social media post he published just before entering the courtroom.\n\nJudge Jeffrey C. Wilcox deliberated in private with Hsiung and the other attorneys for about two hours before emerging to say that the trial would resume, despite what he admitted was his “mistake” in not ensuring that both sides had equal information entering the trial.\n\nMary Corporan, an attorney for Picklesimer, called for a mistrial, and Hsiung asked that he be given time to review the jurors listed and conduct research on them.\n\nState prosecutors disagreed, saying the defendants’ stated reason for wanting more time — to conduct research on prospective jurors, including their social media accounts — had never been part of jury selection before.\n\nWilcox said he would move on with the case regardless, saying a delay would likely mean calling a new set of potential jurors and would punt the case to at least January. Attorneys on both sides had the opportunity to questions potential jurors as well, Wilcox noted.\n\nHowever, Wilcox said that if the defense later found issues of bias with jurors who were chosen, he could declare a mistrial.\n\nJury selection continued for most of the rest of the day, with both sides asking to strike a number of prospective jurors out of a total juror pool of 137.\n\nThe trial, should it move forward as scheduled, is slated to start on Tuesday.\n\nWhat is animal rights advocacy group DxE?\n\nHsiung, a California-based lawyer, is a founding member of the Direct Action Everywhere, also known as DxE, an animal rights advocacy group that says it rescues animals kept in poor conditions and exposes the unethical treatment of animals behind the meat trade and other industries.\n\nMembers, including Hsiung, have been prosecuted for various animal “rescues” in recent years, with backers using the internet and social media to promote videos and push for stricter laws regarding ethical animal treatment.\n\nIn a virtual-reality video taken from Circle Four Farms and shared online by DxE, pigs are shown cooped up in small metal pens, with some clips showing sows gnawing on the bars in an effort to get out. One clip shows piglets climbing over each other to reach a sow’s teats, with several dead siblings lying on the ground near them. Hsiung narrates the video, saying he sees hundreds of sows kept in just one warehouse and that across the entirety of the farm there are 35,000 pigs kept in similar conditions.\n\nRepresentatives for Smithfield Foods have called the videos deceptive, with the Washington Post citing a Smithfield representative as saying the videos were evidence of “trespassing onto company property, breaking into a barn, stealing animals and violating Smithfield’s strict biosecurity policy to prevent the spread of disease onto our farms.”\n\nSmithfield Foods was the largest employer in Beaver County when it announced earlier this year massive cutbacks to its Milford operation, telling officials it planned to cut back its operations by two-thirds. Company releases stated that the move was not related to the DxE cases but instead a response to the closure of a meat processing plant in California.\n\nArguing that it would be too difficult to find enough unbiased jurors in Beaver County, the defendants successfully had the trial moved more than 100 miles south to St. George, in Washington County, which has a much larger population.\n\nBoth men could face more than 10 years of prison time if convicted, as the burglary charge was filed as a state felony.\n\nDavid DeMille writes about southwestern Utah for The Spectrum & Daily News, a USA TODAY Network newsroom based in St. George.

The ruling led to accusations Johnson’s government deliberately misled the monarch as part of its strategy to secure Brexit.\n\nJohnson was forced to personally apologize for embarrassing the monarch, according to the Sunday Times.\n\nBut the botched prorogation was just one example of Johnson’s disregard for parliamentary rules and standards.\n\nHe backed Home Secretary Priti Patel after an investigation into allegations that she bullied staff found that she breached the Ministerial Code and did not “treat her civil servants with consideration and respect,” and had committed “behaviour that can be described as bullying.”\n\nJohnson’s ethics adviser Alex Allen resigned over the issue.\n\nThe flat refurbishment\n\nOne of the first scandals Johnson faced was an allegation of corruption after WhatsApp messages revealed he had asked a Conservative Party donor for funds to refurbish his Downing Street residence. British news outlets reported that the work cost around £200,000 ($280,000).\n\nPolitical donations and loans are tightly controlled in the United Kingdom, with loans of more than £7,500 ($10,400) logged and publicly revealed by the commission four times a year.\n\nJohnson did not report the donations and as a result, the Conservative Party was fined £17,800 by the Electoral Commission in December last year.\n\nOwen Paterson lobbying scandal\n\nLast year, Johnson attempted to force Conservative MPs to vote in favor of overturning the suspension of a fellow Conservative Member of Parliament.\n\nOwen Paterson, an influential Conservative backbencher and former cabinet minister, had been facing a 30-day suspension after being accused of an “egregious” breach of lobbying rules.\n\nFollowing a backlash, Johnson U-turned and Paterson ultimately quit as MP.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats won Paterson’s seat – one the Conservatives had held for almost 200 years – at the subsequent by-election in December.\n\nPartygate\n\nJohnson has faced months of damaging revelations of parties held at Downing Street in defiance of coronavirus lockdowns, with leaks and images dripping into the media since January.\n\nA report published in May by senior civil servant Sue Gray criticized a culture of rule-breaking events, and revealed new photographs of him at two separate gatherings.\n\nAmong the parties: A night of heavy drinking on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral – at a time when strict limits on socializing forced even the Queen to sit alone to say goodbye to her husband of nearly 74 years.\n\nGray wrote that “the senior leadership at the centre” of Johnson’s administration “must bear responsibility” for a culture that allowed the parties to take place.\n\nJohnson himself was fined by London’s Metropolitan Police for attending a party on government premises, making him the first UK premier in history found to have broken the law in office. Sunak, who resigned on Tuesday, was also fined for attending the same event.\n\nJohnson’s handling of the scandal was particularly misguided, with Downing Street first denying there were any gatherings, then saying he didn’t know about them and then claiming he attended them because he believed they were work events.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Damning report reveals Downing Street's party culture 02:54 - Source: CNN\n\nPincher misconduct allegations\n\nThis week’s cascade of resignations was sparked by revelations that Johnson appointed Chris Pincher into his government despite knowing of past allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nPincher, the Conservatives’ deputy chief whip, resigned last week after allegations that he groped two guests at a private dinner. Pincher did not admit the allegations directly, but told Johnson in a letter that “last night I drank far too much,” and “embarrassed myself and other people.”\n\nDowning Street had struggled to explain why Pincher was in government in the first place, amid a wave of revelations about his previous alleged conduct, denying Johnson knew anything specific about the allegations.\n\nOn Tuesday, it emerged that a complaint had been made against Pincher in the Foreign Office about three years ago and that Johnson was briefed on what happened. Downing Street then said he had forgotten.\n\nJohnson acknowledged it “was a mistake” to appoint Pincher to his government on Tuesday, but the damage had already been done. The wave of government resignations started just minutes after he apologized for the decision, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid handing in their notices.

Dozens more members of his government have also quit.\n\nJohnson was ultimately undone by his response to fallout from the resignation last Thursday of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, amid allegations Pincher had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before. While he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson last week that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.” Other historical allegations of misconduct by Pincher emerged in the ensuing days.\n\nJohnson initially denied being aware of some of those allegations, but ultimately the Prime Minister was forced to admit he had been briefed years before and apologize for his decision-making.\n\nIt was the final straw for many political allies who had supported Johnson through crisis after crisis over the years. In recent months the Prime Minister had been facing a barrage of criticism from all sides over his conduct and that of his government, including illegal, lockdown-breaking parties thrown in his Downing Street offices, for which he and others were fined.\n\nJohnson faced numerous other scandals that hit his standing in the polls – despite his 80-seat landslide general election victory just two and a half years ago. These include accusations of using donor money inappropriately to pay for a refurbishment of his Downing Street home and whipping lawmakers to protect a colleague who had breached lobbying rules.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Conservatives lost two key by-elections – results that were blamed on Johnson personally.\n\nIn early June, he survived a confidence vote, but the final count of his lawmakers who rebelled against him was higher than his supporters expected: 41% of his own parliamentary party refused to back him.\n\nThat vote was triggered after months of speculation over Johnson’s future. The so-called “Partygate” scandal, which saw Johnson found guilty of breaking his own Covid-19 laws by attending a gathering to celebrate his birthday at a time when such events were banned, has dogged Johnson since the news broke late last year.\n\nA controversial rise\n\nWith the possible exception of his hero, Winston Churchill, Johnson was perhaps the most famous politician to enter Downing Street as Prime Minister, having forged a successful career as a journalist, novelist, TV personality and London mayor in the preceding decades.\n\nHe was a populist before populists really existed. His controversial comments – comparing Muslim women who wear face coverings to letterboxes, or calling gay men “bum boys” to name but two – appalled many. But he got away with his Lothario image, the public seemingly happy to accept his alleged affairs and love child. It seemed that Johnson could essentially laugh his way through any problem.\n\nYet, for all his ambition and charisma, the job of Prime Minister seemed out of reach for most of his adult life. Those who know Johnson personally say that he loathed the fact that many in the British Conservative elite saw him as a useful campaigning tool but more of a comedian cheerleader than a serious statesman.\n\nBoris Johnson waves from the steps of No. 10 Downing Street after giving a statement in London in July 2019.

Alberto Pezzali/AP In photos: Former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson Prev Next\n\nEven during his time as Mayor of London, winning two terms in a city that traditionally doesn’t vote Conservative, the most memorable moments of his time in office are images such as him inelegantly dangling from a zip wire or forcefully rugby tackling a 10-year-old child while on a trade visit to Tokyo. He just wasn’t considered serious enough for the top job.\n\nThen Brexit happened. Johnson led the successful campaign that defied the odds and saw the UK vote by a narrow majority to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\nOvernight, he went from being a man who seemed to have made a fatal political error by backing the wrong horse in the referendum, to the figurehead of a mass rebellion that had just overrun the entire British establishment.\n\nGuerilla journalism\n\nOn paper, Johnson was an unlikely candidate to become the voice of those who felt themselves to be voiceless. Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York City in 1964 to an internationalist family. As a boy, Johnson would tell friends and relatives that he wanted to be “world king” when fully grown, his sister wrote in a family biography.\n\nHe was educated at Eton College, the most exclusive private school in the UK, alma mater of 20 Prime Ministers, followed by the University of Oxford. While at Oxford, he was a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club: An elite all-male group for wealthy students, famed for ostentatious (and sometimes rowdy) displays of wealth such as vandalizing restaurants, then paying for the damage on the spot in cash. Johnson was never proven to have been personally involved in any such activity.\n\nJohnson worked as a journalist for establishment newspapers, most notably The Daily Telegraph, which made him its Brussels correspondent in 1989. It was here in Belgium that Johnson began writing what would become the most important chapter of his life story: Brexit.\n\nBoris Johnson speaks at a Brexit press conference in London in November 2019. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nAlthough the Telegraph was firmly Euroskeptic, the UK’s exit from the EU was not really on the cards at the time, and even English Conservatives seemed to accept this. However, they lapped up Johnson’s guerrilla journalism, which often stretched the truth of what was actually happening in Brussels.\n\nThe most famous example of this was a story by Johnson that claimed the EU was planning to ban the sale of bendy bananas. The EU repeatedly debunked that and many of the stories that Johnson published.\n\nIn 1999, Johnson was offered the editorship of The Spectator, a weekly magazine often jokingly called the “Conservative bible.” He accepted, agreeing with the owner that he would drop his by now well-known political ambitions, according to a biography by the political journalist Andrew Gimson. He kept his word for all of two years and stood to become a member of parliament in 2001.\n\nIn the years that followed, Johnson was swallowed by the conservative establishment. He carried on writing the conservative script as a journalist and building a base of loyalists both inside and outside of politics.\n\nAs Johnson’s confidence grew, he was determined to show the Conservative Party that his appeal went beyond the British right. In 2008, he was elected the Mayor of London – a liberal, cosmopolitan city that did not traditionally vote Conservative. Johnson believed that he was showing his party that he had the chops to drag them into the 21st century. The problem for Johnson was that they already had a new, young leader – his old schoolfriend and future Prime Minister, David Cameron.\n\nIt was Cameron who ultimately made Brexit possible. After winning his second general election as Conservative leader in 2015, he decided to hold the EU referendum on the understanding that Johnson would fall in line and be an asset for the “remain” campaign.\n\nInstead, in February 2016, Johnson shocked the nation by announcing on the front page of his old paper, the Telegraph, that he would defy Cameron and lead the Brexit campaign.\n\nThe rest is history. Johnson turned the establishment on its head and became the most influential politician in the UK. While he didn’t become Prime Minister immediately, he continued to build his power base, undermining then-incumbent Theresa May as she struggled with Brexit for three years.\n\nAs foreign secretary under May, he was blamed for worsening the predicament of the jailed British-Iranian mother Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe after wrongly saying in 2017 that she was in Iran teaching journalists, rather than on holiday, at the time she was detained. But his patchy record in the role did not appear to cost him much support within his party.\n\nA populist who became unpopular\n\nJohnson’s time finally came in July 2019 when he became leader of the Conservative Party, claiming around two-thirds of the membership vote. His brash style was vindicated later that year, when he silenced all of his opponents in a landslide election victory that would finally allow him to, as his own slogan boasted, “Get Brexit Done.”\n\nIt truly seemed that the stars had finally aligned for Johnson, who desperately wanted to be taken seriously. He made Brexit popular and personally dragged it across the line. He had completed his transition to the role of statesman. He had proved everyone wrong.\n\nYet, as the clock ticked down on so-called Brexit Day, January 31, 2020, a deadly virus was already causing alarm in Asia. It would soon start spreading across Europe and kick off the crisis that would remove him from office.\n\nJohnson had a mixed pandemic. He was lauded by the public for the amount of state spending unleashed to mitigate its impacts on those whose jobs and livelihoods were threatened, but panned by the more conservative elements of his party. He was accused of responding too slowly, but also for making lockdown rules so complicated even he and his team in Downing Street couldn’t follow them.\n\nThe breaking of these rules by Johnson and members of his team, the economic fallout of the pandemic leading in part to a cost-of-living crisis, his handling of the Pincher scandal and a general sense of the shine wearing off the Brexit golden boy were ultimately too much for his party. It seems its members couldn’t stand the thought of Johnson staying on and dragging the party into its grave.\n\nHis political career is a story of near-misses, sex scandals, celebrity, controversy and revolution that ended in personal tragedy. The man who only ever wanted to be taken seriously ended up, ultimately, as the joker once again.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/23/uk/boris-johnson-successor-mess-intl-gbr-cmd/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Boris Johnson's successor will have a huge mess on their ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThe next prime minister of the United Kingdom will inherit a mess that some members of the governing Conservative Party believe will be impossible to manage.\n\nWith just six weeks until Boris Johnson’s successor walks through the famous black door of 10 Downing Street, the two remaining candidates are making a bad situation worse by rubbing acid into the wounds of a party so badly divided it could be forced to call an early election and hope for the best.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, CNN spoke with multiple sources across the Conservative Party on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThere are a few reasons for this, starting with how the new prime minister will be chosen.\n\nJohnson’s replacement will not be elected by the 47 million adults registered to vote, but by a much smaller group of around 160,000 grassroots Conservative Party members. The winner will be announced on September 5.\n\nThis is constitutionally quite proper. In the UK, prime ministers are not elected directly. Instead, members of parliament are elected and the leader of the party with the largest number of MPs conventionally forms a government. The Conservatives still enjoy a healthy majority from Johnson’s 2019 election win, so his successor simply inherits that majority and takes over as the head of government.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson makes a statement at Downing Street in London, Britain, on July 7, 2022. Henry Nicholls/Reuters\n\nIt does, however, create a bizarre dynamic in which the two candidates remaining – Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak – must spend the next few weeks traveling the country and appealing to the priorities of an electorate that represents less than 0.5% of the voting public.\n\nThis means running on campaign issues that the candidates believe are most likely to appeal to this very small and hardly diverse group of people.\n\n“The average age of a party member is late 50s. Just under half are of a pensionable age and they are predominately White,” says Tim Bale, who is professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London and has studied the Conservative Party extensively.\n\n“They mostly live in southern England and are (financially) comfortable. They support a strong line on law and order, they approve of low taxes but believe that public services are important and should be funded properly, especially schools, police and, of course, the health service,” Bale adds.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the cost-of-living crisis, the main issue of debate has been how to handle the economy. Truss is calling for a different approach from Johnson’s tax rises, and claims that cutting taxes immediately would create growth. Sunak argues that he believes this is fantasy economics, given the UK is still recovering from the economic shock of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThis all might sound rather tame until you consider that Sunak was Johnson’s Chancellor of the Exchequer, or finance minister. A narrative has now emerged among Truss supporters that although she was in Johnson’s cabinet as his Foreign Secretary, she was the person most opposed to what are now being painted as Sunak’s tax rises – rather than those of his boss, Johnson.\n\nJohnson and Sunak at a cabinet meeting on June 7, 2022 in London, England. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThis all gets even messier when you consider the past few weeks of British politics and just how personal the battle between Truss and Sunak has become.\n\nMany Johnson allies claim that Sunak’s resignation over a sexual assault scandal involving Johnson’s deputy chief whip was a calculated move to topple Johnson so that he could have a shot at the top job.\n\n“Rishi was clear in his letter the reasons why he resigned. Enough was enough,” a Sunak campaign spokesperson told CNN.\n\nJohnson’s main allies have since piled in to support Truss as the anti-Sunak candidate and are briefing aggressively against Sunak, echoing the line that he was responsible for the government’s economic failures.\n\n“They are trashing our record in government on stuff she voted for in the cabinet,” says an MP who is one of the few Johnson loyalists to support Sunak.\n\n“It’s one thing to say we need a new direction; it’s another to ridicule our record and say anyone who supports Rishi is making a mistake. If they carry on like this, they will really struggle to unite MPs if they win,” the lawmaker adds.\n\nIt’s this issue of whether or not Sunak or Truss can unite MPs in a way that makes it possible to govern that is freaking out many Conservatives.\n\n“The top three candidates each had around a third of the parliamentary party supporting them. They have each offered a very different version of where the party should be going,” Salma Shah, a former Conservative and government adviser, tells CNN. “This will make life difficult for any new whips’ team who will need to bridge the gap. A job made harder by the fact the teams seem to have been tearing chunks out of each other in the press and on TV.”\n\nUK Foreign Minister Liz Truss seen during a joint press conference in Prague, Czech Republic. Tomas Tkacik/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images)\n\nOn top of the brutal fight taking place between the two candidates looms the enormous figure of the outgoing Prime Minister. Lots of MPs continue to believe that Johnson was still the Conservative Party’s best shot of winning the next general election and that his treatment from people like Sunak was unforgivable.\n\nOne veteran MP who joined parliament just after Margaret Thatcher was forced to resign told CNN: “I am worried. Back then the people who stabbed her in the back and the people who remained loyal was such a clear dividing line that defined the party for years. Things are even more complicated now and I am not sure these two (Sunak and Truss) can bridge those gaps.”\n\nSeconds after it was decided the final two were Truss and Sunak, an even less optimistic Conservative MP told CNN: “We’ve just lost the next election.”\n\nIt’s worth noting that some Conservatives, especially those surrounding Truss, are optimistic that MPs will unite when push comes to shove and the party faces the real prospect of losing power. They argue that the opposition Labour party would wreck the UK’s economy and that the next Conservative government would have to fix it. That alone is worth swallowing their pride and fighting for.\n\nBoris Johnson at his final appearance as prime minister in the House of Commons on July 20, 2022. Parliament TV\n\nThat said, it’s an undeniable truth that whoever wins the contest inherits what is currently an unstable parliamentary majority and 12 years of Conservative power in which the country has seen four prime ministers and even more iterations of the Conservative Party.\n\nBoth candidates served in Johnson’s scandal-ridden government – and it’s worth noting that Johnson himself will still be a sitting MP when either takes over, looming large over British politics from the backbenches.\n\nJust as Edward Heath sniped at his successor Margaret Thatcher during her premiership in the 1980s, Thatcher did the same to John Major in the following decade. Theresa May slammed Johnson over the “Partygate” scandal, so the next PM will likely be braced for criticism from Johnson – especially if he resumes his previous career as a newspaper columnist.\n\nThe job of reinventing and uniting the party, which has been struggling in the polls for months and publicly flagellating itself for almost as long, would be tough for anyone. It will be even harder for either of the leadership contenders, both of whom have their hands dirty from previous government jobs and whose supporters have been flinging mud at one another over a long, hot summer.\n\nAnd if the warring factions cannot overcome these differences, they may find that they’ve wrecked their own chances of staying in power and hand the keys over to an opposition party that’s been locked out of Downing Street since 2010. The stakes are that high, but very few in the Conservative Party are behaving like they understand that this is the case.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/16/opinions/british-prime-minister-race-westminster-thomas/index.html", "title": "Opinion: Boris Johnson's greatest disappearing trick of all | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London.

It largely erased the scandal over sexual misconduct that forced Johnson to that hastily-erected lectern in the first place.\n\nThe final straw that had prompted 60 MPs to quit their jobs and call on Johnson to stand down was his appalling reaction the week before to the resignation of MP Chris Pincher, and the catalog of failures that had preceded it.\n\nPincher stepped down from his role as deputy chief whip, a critical administrative and pastoral role in the Conservative party, amid accusations of sexual misconduct spanning over a decade. Johnson initially denied all knowledge of them, but it later emerged that he’d been briefed on Pincher’s alleged history before giving him the job.\n\nSenior officials claimed he’d responded with trademark lack of concern, quipping “Pincher by name, Pincher by nature.” (An official spokesperson refused to comment on this.)\n\nJohnson mentioned none of this during his farewell. The Pincher story had taken Westminster so by storm in the days leading up to it that it drowned out everything else. Even Johnson’s admission in Parliament that he met a former KGB colonel without officials present as foreign secretary in 2018, in itself a potentially sackable offense (his fellow Conservative MP Priti Patel was forced to step down as international development secretary for a similar infraction in 2017), faded into the background.\n\nJohnson’s reticence to retread such unflattering ground was understandable, but what was far more striking was the ease with which the public, the MPs who’d resigned in fury and the candidates vying to replace him as leader abandoned the story too.\n\nSome of the immediate distractions were relatively superficial, but in a country where every public service feels broken, every confirmation of a deficiency in our lawmakers draws fire.\n\nA video clip of the newly-minted education minister Andrea Jenkyns giving the waiting crowds the finger outside Number 10 last week whipped up a storm of excited outrage that was only intensified by the sullen, poorly-phrased letter of so-called apology that followed. Meanwhile according to The Times Education Commission, schools across Britain are currently “failing on every measure.” Johnson’s parting vote of faith in Jenkyns to take on the job of fixing them was absurd and insulting enough to draw our attention away from his own disastrous stewardship.\n\nAs the Conservative leadership race got underway, the diversions became more serious and took a firmer grip on the news agenda. MP Nadhim Zahawi, who Johnson made Chancellor when Rishi Sunak stepped down in protest over the Pincher story – and nevertheless added his voice to the chorus demanding the prime minister resign just 48 hours later – quickly threw his hat into the ring. He’d barely done so before questions about his tax affairs surfaced, along with the revelation that they’re currently the subject of an unresolved probe by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs. Zahawi protested that he was being “smeared,” but the story proved deadly to his candidacy.\n\nThe remaining leadership hopefuls have their own problems. The major issues troubling the country – a cost of living crisis, massive queues for NHS treatment, a backlog of criminal cases suffocating the justice system, and of course, Brexit – are awkward for them to address head-on, given they’ve been members of the party in charge for the last decade.\n\nThe frustrations of the British public are being amplified almost hourly by obfuscations from some of the candidates, whose favorite responses when asked how they plan to steer the country back toward prosperity have included promises of sweeping tax cuts and forays into culture wars too inane to overlook.\n\nMP Kemi Badenoch, one of the most right-leaning of the aspirants, has declared herself the figurehead of a “war on woke” with a zeal almost compelling enough to make us forget no one asked for it. Her ban on gender-neutral toilets at her leadership launch stoked more news lines than her speech, which leaned heavily on quashing “social justice concerns” and championing “free speech.” Her throwdown (and the resultant online backlash) was swiftly followed by a jibe from rival Penny Mordaunt that Westminster is “tying itself in knots” over trans issues – which generated still more headlines.\n\nElsewhere, resurfaced footage of a young Sunak, currently the favorite to win the race, showed him in 2001 laughing and retracting his own suggestion that he might have “working-class friends.” The clip steamrolled social media in a way his opponents could only have dreamed of, prompting retweet after retweet alongside complaints that a man so completely out of touch could never hope to understand the financial straits of the British public. (Sunak told BBC Radio Thursday, “I don’t judge people by their bank accounts, I judge them by their character.”)\n\nThe result of each of these meme-able embarrassments is ever more noise from all corners – and a frenzy of retaliatory self-promotion that’s pushing Chris Pincher and his alleged misdeeds further into the shadows.\n\nThis, really, cinches the ignominy of the last fortnight in British politics. The Pincher story went to the heart of a long and insidious cultural problem of sexual misconduct in Westminster, one which Johnson appears to have presided over during his time in office with little personal discomfort.\n\nIn April this year, in response to the news that 56 MPs (roughly one in 11 of those serving) were under investigation for sexual misconduct, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas asked Boris Johnson whether such behavior was grounds for dismissal. Johnson replied, “Of course it is.”\n\nAt that point, Johnson had already appointed Chris Pincher to the whip’s office, the place where staff would theoretically go to report the kinds of abuses Pincher allegedly committed. That choice exemplified the failings of a politician who had always treated rules as an inconvenience at best, and irrelevant at worst. The national mess Johnson left in his wake, and the clamor to fill the power void caused by his own inability to govern with integrity, have eclipsed what ought to be a damning legacy of complicity and negligence.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter.

It’s weighing on imports and exports, sapping investment and contributing to labor shortages. All this has exacerbated Britain’s inflation problem, hurting workers and the business community.\n\n“The most plausible reason as to why Britain is doing comparatively worse than comparable countries is Brexit,” according to L. Alan Winters, co-director of the Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy at the University of Sussex.\n\nThe sense of gloom hanging over the UK economy is captured by striking workers, who are walking out in ever larger numbers over pay and conditions as the worst inflation in decades eats into their wages. At the same time, the government is cutting spending and hiking taxes to fill the hole in its budget.\n\nWhile Brexit isn’t the cause of Britain’s cost-of-living crisis, it has made the problem more difficult to solve.\n\n“The UK chose Brexit in a referendum, but the government then chose a particularly hard form of Brexit, which maximized the economic cost,” said Michael Saunders, a senior adviser at Oxford Economics and former Bank of England official. “Any hope for economic upside from Brexit is pretty much gone.”\n\nNHS nurses strike over pay outside St Thomas' Hospital in London on December 20, 2022. Maja Smiejkowska/Reuters\n\nBusinesses count the cost\n\nAlthough Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, its exit from the single market and customs union was finalized only on December 24, 2020, when the two sides finally agreed a free trade deal.\n\nThe Brexit deal, known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, came into effect on January 1, 2021.\n\nIt eliminated tariffs on most goods but introduced a raft of non-tariff barriers, such as border controls, customs checks, import duties and health inspections on plant and animal products.\n\nBefore Brexit, a farmer in Kent could ship a truckload of potatoes to Paris just as easily as they might send it to London. Those days are no more.\n\n“We hear stories every single day from small businesses about the nightmare of forms, transportation, couriers, things getting stuck for weeks at a time… the epic length of the problems is just gobsmacking,” said Michelle Ovens, the founder of Small Business Britain, a campaign group.\n\n“The way things have panned out in the last two years has been really bad for small businesses,” Ovens told CNN.\n\nResearchers at the London School of Economics estimate that the variety of UK products exported to the European Union declined by 30% during the first year of Brexit. They said that this was likely because small exporters had exited small EU markets.\n\nTake the example of Little Star, a UK company that makes jewelry for children. Its business took off in the Netherlands and it had plans to expand to France and Germany next. But since Brexit, only two of more than 30 of its Dutch customers are prepared to handle the costs and paperwork to obtain stock from the company.\n\nProducts that took two days to ship are now taking three weeks, while import duties and sales taxes have made it much harder to compete with European jewelers, according to Rob Walker, who co-founded the business with his wife, Vicky, in 2017. The company is now looking to the United States for growth opportunities.\n\n“Isn’t it mad that we have to look to the other side of the Atlantic to do business, because it’s so difficult to do business with people 30 miles away?” Walker said.\n\nA truck passes a Union Jack, at the Port of Dover on April 1, 2021. The UK government has delayed post-Brexit checks on EU food imports until the end of 2023. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA British Chambers of Commerce survey of more than 1,168 businesses published this month reported that 77% said Brexit has not helped them increase sales or grow their businesses. More than half said they were finding it difficult to adapt to the new rules for trading goods.\n\nSiteright Construction Supplies, a manufacturer in Dorset, told the Chamber that importing parts from the European Union to fix broken machines has become a costly and “time-consuming nightmare.”\n\n“Brexit has been the biggest-ever imposition of bureaucracy on business,” according to Siteright.\n\nNova Dog Chews, a producer of snacks for canines, said it would have lost all its EU trade had it not set up a base in the bloc. “This has cost our business a huge amount of money, which could have been invested in the UK had it not been for Brexit,” it added.\n\nA UK government spokesperson told CNN that the government’s export support service has provided exporters with “practical support” on the implementation of the Brexit deal. The deal is “the world’s largest zero tariff, zero quota free trade deal,” the spokesperson added. “It secures the UK market access across key service sectors and opens new opportunities for UK businesses across the globe.”\n\nPermanent damage to trade\n\nBritain won’t easily replace what it has lost by forfeiting unfettered access to the world’s largest trading bloc.\n\nThe only substantive new trade deals it has struck since exiting the European Union, which did not simply roll over the deals it had as an EU member, have been with Australia and New Zealand. By the government’s own estimate, these will have a negligible impact on the UK economy, increasing GDP in the long run by just 0.1% and 0.03% respectively.\n\nBy contrast, the UK Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces economic forecasts for the government, expects Brexit to reduce Britain’s output by 4% over 15 years compared to remaining in the bloc. Exports and imports are projected to be around 15% lower in the long run.\n\nInitial data has borne this out. According to the OBR, in the fourth quarter of 2021, UK goods export volumes to the European Union were 9% below 2019 levels, with imports from the European Union 18% lower. Goods exports to non-EU countries were 18% weaker than in 2019.\n\nThe United Kingdom “appears to have become a less trade-intensive economy, with trade as a share of GDP falling 12% since 2019, two and a half times more than in any other G7 country,” the OBR said in the March report.\n\nThe decline in exports to non-EU countries could be a sign that UK businesses have become less competitive as they battle higher supply chain costs following Brexit, according to Jun Du, an economics professor at Aston University in Birmingham.\n\n“The UK’s trading ability has been damaged permanently [by Brexit],” Du told CNN. “It doesn’t mean it can’t recover, but it’s been set back for a number of years.”\n\nResearch by the Centre for European Reform, a think tank, estimates that over the 18 months to June 2022, UK goods trade is 7% lower than it would have been had Britain remained in the European Union.\n\nInvestment is 11% weaker and GDP is 5.5% smaller than it would have been, costing the economy £40 billion ($48.4 billion) in tax revenues annually. That’s enough to pay for three quarters of the spending cuts and tax rises that UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced in November.\n\nA heavy economic toll\n\nThe United Kingdom is projected to have one of the worst performing economies next year among developed nations.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.4%, ahead only of sanctioned Russia. GDP in Germany is forecast to be 0.3% smaller.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of just 0.3% for UK GDP next year, ahead of only Germany, Italy and Russia, which are expected to contract.\n\nBoth institutions say high inflation and rising interest rates will weigh on spending by consumers and businesses in Britain.\n\nAccording to the Confederation of British Industry, a leading business group, the fall in private sector activity picked up pace in December and has now declined for five consecutive quarters.\n\nThe downward trend “looks set to deepen” in 2023, principal economist at the CBI Martin Sartorius said in a statement.\n\n“Businesses continue to face a number of headwinds, with rising costs, labor shortages, and weakening demand contributing to a gloomy outlook for next year. ”\n\n— Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/15/uk/boris-johnson-parties-scandal-intl-cmd-gbr/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Is 'partygate' one scandal too many for Boris Johnson? | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nThere is never a good time for a sitting government to become consumed by a political scandal so severe that its leader faces daily calls to resign.\n\nBut as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is embroiled in a crisis over allegations of numerous parties held in Downing Street while the rest of the UK was in lockdown, sparking national outrage, the timing is particularly tortuous for the governing Conservative party.\n\nFor weeks, Johnson and his loyalists tried to wait out the scandal by refusing to answer even the simplest of questions related to some of the parties, as a steady drip of revelations emerged on an almost daily basis.\n\nBut news of a “bring your own booze” party held in the Downing Street garden at the height of the UK’s first coronavirus lockdown forced the Prime Minister to apologize this week and admit he attended the event.\n\nOn Friday, the scandal worsened as it was revealed that a party was held in Downing Street the night before the funeral of Prince Philip. It was noted at the time that due to Covid-19 restrictions, the Queen was forced to mourn her husband at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle while sitting alone. The government apologized to the Queen, but more danger lurks on the horizon.\n\nJohnson and the government have largely stuck to their line that further comment on the parties should be withheld until an investigation is completed by Sue Gray, a senior civil servant who has been tasked with producing a report on exactly what happened.\n\nBoris Johnson faced tough questions from lawmakers in Parliament as outrage mounts over a \"bring your own booze\" event held at Downing Street during the height of the UK's first Covid-19 lockdown. Parliament TV\n\nWhile the report itself cannot determine if any laws were broken, a detailed factual breakdown of what happened and why could pile further pressure on Johnson to resign. But the scope of the investigation could be narrow enough to avoid a smoking gun – and might not even be published in full – meaning Johnson may be able to ride out the scandal regardless of what the report says, even if that stokes further fury from his party and the electorate.\n\nDespite his bad poll ratings, public anger at Johnson and his government, and the growing sense that the Prime Minister has become “so toxic he could drag us down with him,” as one senior Conservative put it, it’s likely that for the time being, his loudest critics within the Conservative Party are going to have to suck it up and continue supporting a man they resent.\n\nA government minister told CNN that “he was an electoral asset in 2019 because he personified Brexit. But if it transpires he is no longer an electoral asset, they [Conservative lawmakers] might decide to get rid of him.”\n\nIn just a few months, there will be a perfect opportunity for a check on Johnson’s popularity when local elections are held across England, Scotland and Wales on May 5.\n\nIt is broadly accepted across the party that removing Johnson before this date would be extremely dangerous, as no one could be certain what the consequence would actually be.\n\n“If the Conservatives are serious about removing Johnson, they must also be serious about replacing him with someone who can sincerely relaunch a party that has been in government since 2010,” said Will Jennings, professor of political science at Southampton University. “If they do get absolutely hammered at the locals, which is not out of the question and quite common for sitting governments, it would put that new leader immediately on the back foot.”\n\nBoris Johnson apologized in Parliament on Wednesday. Parliament TV\n\nMultiple senior Conservatives told CNN that they are looking at the long summer recess as a potential window to get rid of Johnson, if the local elections truly are a disaster for Johnson.\n\nThat, one minister said, “would be the cleanest option as politics shuts down for the summer.”\n\nA senior Conservative official said that any new leader would need “time to explain a project which would (have to) be more complicated than ‘Get Brexit Done,’” the slogan that helped Johnson win a landslide victory in 2019.\n\nTheir reasoning for this is that the 2019 issue was dominated by a single issue. Brexit was a roadblock that needed clearing and the public was frustrated and exhausted that three years since the vote, the UK was effectively unable to leave the European Union.\n\nThat new project, no easy task for a party that has been in power since 2010, would need to be fully built and ready to go before May 2024, the date of the next scheduled general election. And while that might sound like a long time in politics, following on from Johnson, a man who enjoyed enormous fame before taking office, would be extremely difficult for even the most competent political operator.\n\nThe scale of that task, combined with the unique nature of Johnson’s public persona, is what makes replacing him, even after potentially disastrous local election results, far from certain.\n\n“It’s a super-tight judgement call, and one that is based more on guts than any actual metrics,” said Salma Shah, a former Conservative Party special adviser.\n\n“On the one hand you have to consider whether it’s worth deposing a sitting PM for someone new who is entirely untested; on the other wonder whether doing nothing means you’re just going to watch your electoral hopes slide into oblivion,” she added.\n\nIt was revealed on Friday that a party was held in Downing Street the night before the funeral of Prince Philip, at which the Queen was forced to sit alone due to coronavirus restrictions. Jonathan Brady/Getty Images\n\nThe case for keeping Johnson rests on the fact that he might, despite everything, still be the best hope of the Conservative Party winning the next general election. According to the Conservative staffer, who has worked on multiple election campaigns, there is “nobody with a proper plan to replace him, the pitch is just ‘I’d do better.’”\n\nAnother senior Conservative, close to Johnson, told CNN that despite broad agreement he was “doing a horrible job,” it could create a bigger mess than it’s worth.\n\n“He really doesn’t want to stop being Prime Minister,” which would make any fight very messy and, whatever the result, “it would probably make the party look disunited and chaotic” to the wider public, the senior Conservative said.\n\nFinally, the economic conditions for the next election will not favor the Conservative Party. There is a looming cost-of-living crisis, inadequate public services, a pandemic to recover from and ongoing difficulties caused by Brexit.\n\nIt will be hard for any Conservative, especially those more economically prudent than Johnson, to handle these problems, given the party has been in power for so long. And there is an argument to be made that for all his flaws, Johnson – the devil they know and a highly successful campaigner – is the best option for the party to hang onto power. If he wins a smaller majority at the next general election, then his graceful exit could be negotiated with the party.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson in Uxbridge, west London, after a visit to a coronavirus vaccination clinic, on January 10, 2022. Dominic Lipinski/Reuters\n\nThe case for removing him is somewhat simpler. Conservative staffers explained to CNN that they are fed up at their expected loyalty being taken for granted by a man who cares more about preserving his own power than that of the party he leads.\n\nThey are also sick and tired of the unforced errors coming from Downing Street. “Partygate” is just the latest in a string of scandals, ranging from Johnson trying to save the skin of one of his political allies after they’d breached lobbying rules, to questions over who was paying for a refurbishment of Johnson’s Downing Street apartment.\n\nAs Shah points out: “They need to consider how demoralized Tory staffers might be from all this. If they have lost faith in the PM then working for his government and campaigning to win an election under him will be a lot harder than in 2019.”\n\nThe Conservative Party is being forced to ask itself some very difficult questions at an incredibly hard time. Johnson is not a normal politician. It is simply impossible to say whether or not these scandals have cost him his ninth life, or if one year from now he will still be in charge.\n\nEither way, Johnson, his government and his party face a horrible few months of pain that will likely get worse before it gets better. The harsh reality is that whatever the party decides to do, it will be an uphill struggle from now until the next general election – which they could well lose.\n\nBetween now and then, the party somehow needs to find the enthusiasm, energy and drive to gear up for a number of political fights. If it doesn’t, then it’s likely a new era of politics awaits the UK, as the party that oversaw austerity, delivered Brexit and tried to change the image of an entire nation, is swept from office and replaced with something very different.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/uk/profile-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-intl-gbr/index.html", "title": "Britain's new prime minister: Rishi Sunak, rich ex-banker who will be ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nJust seven short weeks ago, it looked as if it might be all over for Rishi Sunak.\n\nThe former chancellor of the exchequer – the UK’s title for its chief finance minister – made a high-stakes gamble. He launched an attack that helped to end Boris Johnson’s premiership, put himself forward as his replacement, but ultimately lost to Liz Truss. Admitting defeat, he retreated to the parliamentary back benches.\n\nBut in a sign of just how unpredictable British politics has become, Sunak has returned triumphant from the political wilderness to replace Truss, whose premiership imploded last week.\n\nSunak was the only leadership hopeful to secure the support of 100 Conservative members of parliament, the necessary threshold set by party officials for potential candidates. He will become the first person of color to be British prime minister – and at the age of 42, he is also the youngest person to take the office in more than 200 years.\n\nHe was the last person standing after his rivals – Johnson and the Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt – fell by the wayside.\n\nSpeaking after being declared the new Conservative leader, Sunak said he was “honored and humbled” to become the next prime minister.\n\n“It is the greatest privilege of my life to be able to serve the party I love, and to be able to give back to the country i owe so much to,” Sunak said.\n\n“The United Kingdom is a great country, but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” he added. “We need stability and unity, and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.”\n\nSunak first publicly declared on Sunday morning that he would be standing in the contest. Other than that brief statement, he made no big pitch for the leadership this time round.\n\nIn the last contest, over the summer, he was widely seen as the more moderate of the two candidates. Compared to Truss, he took a less ideological line on matters like Brexit and the economy. (Unlike Truss, a remainer-turned hardline Brexiteer, Sunak voted for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 referendum.)\n\nLike Truss, Sunak promised a tough approach to illegal immigration and vowed to expand the government’s controversial Rwanda immigration policy.\n\nSunak, whose parents came to the UK from East Africa in the 1960s, is of Indian descent.

I am thoroughly British, this is my home and my country, but my religious and cultural heritage is Indian, my wife is Indian. I am open about being a Hindu,” Sunak said in an interview with Business Standard in 2015.\n\nHe will be the first Hindu to become British prime minister, securing the position on Diwali, the festival of lights that marks one of the most important days of the Hindu calendar. Sunak himself made history in 2020 when he lit Diwali candles outside 11 Downing Street, the official residence of the UK chancellor.\n\nHe has faced challenges over his elite background, having studied at the exclusive Winchester College, Oxford and Stanford universities.

He was first elected as an MP in 2015 and spent two years on the back benches before becoming a junior minister in Theresa May’s government. Johnson gave Sunak his first major government role, appointing him as chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019 and promoting him to chancellor in 2020.\n\nSunak has experience of economic crisis-fighting, having guided the UK through the Covid-19 pandemic, and positioned himself as the “sound finance” candidate.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Sunak put in place measures worth £400 billion ($452 billion) aimed at boosting the economy, including a generous furlough scheme, business loans and discounts on eating in restaurants. But that stimulus came at a huge cost and left the government scrambling to find savings.\n\nSunak was an early critic of Truss’ economic plan, which was panned by investors, the International Monetary Fund and credit ratings agencies. While he also advocated for lower taxes, he said tax could only be cut once inflation is brought under control, which could take several years.\n\nHis warning over the summer that Truss’ unfunded tax cuts could spark panic in the financial markets turned out to be true. The British pound crashed to a record low against the US dollar when Truss and her Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled their plan. Prices of UK government bonds rose at the fastest pace ever, sending borrowing costs skyrocketing.\n\nHe also secured the most votes from MPs in the last leadership election – comfortably clearing the new threshold with 137 endorsements. Although Truss eventually won the decisive vote among grassroots members, Sunak was not far behind, gaining 43% of the vote.\n\nSecond chance\n\nJohnson has made no secret of the fact that he believes Sunak betrayed him by resigning from his government, triggering his resignation on July 7 after a string of scandals made his position untenable.\n\nJohnson’s downfall followed months of revelations of parties held in 10 Downing Street while the rest of the country was under Covid lockdown restrictions. Johnson himself was fined by the police, making him the first prime minister in history found to have broken the law in office.\n\nFor a long time, Sunak stood by Johnson – especially since he too was fined in the so-called Partygate scandal.\n\nBut he turned against him after Johnson was slow to act when his deputy chief whip responsible for party discipline, Chris Pincher, was accused of sexually assaulting two men at a party in early July. (Pincher later said he had “drunk far too much,” although has not directly addressed the allegations.)\n\nSunak’s shock resignation from Johnson’s cabinet over the Pincher scandal set into motion a series of high-profile resignations that led to Johnson’s demise – and ultimately, to his own rise to the Downing Street.\n\nSunak faces an enormous task. The UK is in the midst of a deep cost-of-living crisis and soaring inequality. Financial markets are still spooked after Truss’ disastrous economic policy missteps.\n\nThe Conservative party, already unpopular after 12 years in power, has plunged itself into a state of utter chaos over the past four months and is now well behind the opposition Labour party in opinion polls. The only comfort for Sunak is that he doesn’t have to call an election until January 2025.", "authors": ["Ivana Kottasová Luke Mcgee", "Ivana Kottasová", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/956973/how-boris-johnson-lost-the-confidence-of-his-mps", "title": "How Boris Johnson lost the support of his party | The Week UK", "text": "We will use the details you have shared to manage your registration.

This time, it really ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBoris Johnson’s Conservative government is in deep crisis, engulfed once more in a scandal that is at least in part of the Prime Minister’s own making.\n\nAnd this time, it’s a lot worse than all the other times.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, after days in which Downing Street has been on the ropes over its handling of allegations of sexual misconduct by a member of the government, two senior Cabinet ministers quit.\n\nHealth Secretary Sajid Javid said he could not “in good conscience” continue. Finance minister Rishi Sunak also resigned, saying that people “rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously.” Since then, two further ministers have stepped down and multiple Conservative Members of Parliament have publicly withdrawn their support for Johnson’s leadership.\n\nJohnson is still in control of his own fate, for now. Conservative party rules dictate that if a leader wins a confidence vote, as he did in June, then they are immune from another challenge for 12 months.\n\nHowever, so severe is Johnson’s case that it’s possible the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers might rewrite the rules in order to get rid of him.\n\nThe 1922 executive is expected to meet on Wednesday in order to fix a date for elections as to who should be on the committee. If a large enough number of anti-Boris MPs are elected to the executive, then the chances of the rules changing increases dramatically.\n\nUntil that point, the real question is just how much public humiliation can the PM take?\n\nMore ministers will almost certainly resign and opposition sources are talking up the prospect of defections. At Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, Johnson said “the job of a Prime Minister in difficult circumstances when he has been handed a colossal mandate is to keep going and that’s what I’m going to do.”\n\nBut he was eviscerated by opposition MPs, with Labour leader Keir Starmer describing his efforts to cling to power as “a pathetic spectacle” and calling his remaining supporters “a Z-list cast of nodding dogs.”\n\nThe immediate cause of the crisis was the fallout from the resignation last Thursday of deputy chief whip Chris Pincher, amid allegations he had groped two guests at a private dinner the night before. While he did not admit the allegations directly, Pincher said in a letter to Johnson that “last night I drank far too much” and “embarrassed myself and other people.”\n\nWhat landed Johnson in deeper trouble, though, were the contortions that Downing Street press officers went into trying to explain why Pincher was ever in government in the first place, amid a wave of revelations of his previous conduct. On Tuesday, a senior former civil servant published a letter effectively accusing Downing Street of not telling the truth when it said the Prime Minister was not aware of at least one of the historical allegations.\n\nIn an effort to draw a line under the swirling controversy, Johnson issued a statement in which he apologized and said he was wrong to have reappointed Pincher to the whip’s office – which, ironically, is responsible for party discipline – earlier this year. But that was overtaken within minutes by the resignation of the two Cabinet members.\n\nIn Parliament on Wednesday, he said “regret(s) very much” promoting Pincher despite concerns about his behavior, adding: “In hindsight, I should have realized that he would not change.”\n\nThe details of how Downing Street got itself into such a mess bear laying out. At first, when new reports of Pincher’s historical conduct emerged in the light of his resignation, Downing Street initially denied the Prime Minister knew anything about the allegations.\n\nWhen it became clear this would not hold, Johnson’s team said he had known about the historical allegations, but that they had been “resolved.” When it emerged that one of the previously unreported allegations against Pincher had been upheld, Johnson’s spokesperson explained that “resolved” could mean that it had been upheld.\n\nThen on Tuesday morning, Simon McDonald, the former top civil servant at the Foreign Office revealed that Johnson had been briefed in person about the outcome of an investigation into Pincher’s conduct.\n\nRegardless of any justification Downing Street has attempted to provide, Johnson’s judgment – and his handling of this latest crisis – is now in serious doubt.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Our friends and neighbors look on us with sadness': Journalist on UK government scandals 17:14 - Source: CNN\n\nA common theme of the plethora of scandals surrounding him – from “Partygate,” when Johnson was fined by police for breaching lockdown rules, to his attempts to protect an MP who had breached lobbying rules – is how the government has mishandled the fallout from the initial problem.\n\n“The biggest threat to this government is its own staggering incompetence,” said one senior government official. “Discipline has completely broken down.”\n\n“The team around the Prime Minister seems to have no idea how badly it’s going,” they added. “No one is good at giving interviews. We cannot stick to a single line. We’ve completely lost control.”\n\nA government minister told CNN they believe that one key problem is that Johnson sets the tone for behavior.\n\n“It’s hard for someone with a personal life as colorful as his to reprimand people for behaving inappropriately,” they said.\n\nThe growing sense of chaos – and the view that the government has lost control of yet another story – is doing nothing for Conservatives who think Johnson has become the party’s biggest electoral turn-off.\n\nBoth the Prime Minister’s personal approval ratings and the party’s polling numbers have plummeted since the Partygate scandal broke. Trust in Johnson as a leader appears to be breaking down both with the public and with his own MPs. Conservative Party lawmakers tried – and failed – to unseat him last month.\n\nBut Conservative MPs are starting to lose hope that even if Johnson is removed from power, it won’t be possible to undo the damage he has done to the party before the next scheduled election in 2024.\n\nEven more worryingly for those who have lost faith in the PM, he seems determined to fight on.\n\nThis alarms Conservative MPs, especially those in marginal seats who have all but given up hope of retaining them. Few of them think that Johnson has any real grip on how bad things have got – and they can’t see a way to make the Prime Minister see sense.\n\nThe government’s poor handling of Pincher’s resignation means the scandal is now tied to Johnson personally. He was the one who chose to appoint Pincher to a top job in government – despite knowing how serious the allegations against him were, and even though he was aware that a complaint against him had been upheld.\n\nFor years, Johnson’s main selling point has been his ability to connect with voters, personally. His brand of optimistic populism was – so Conservative MPs thought – the force of nature that had made a majority of the British public vote for Brexit in 2016 and had given the Tories a parliamentary majority of 80 in 2019.\n\nBut as Johnson’s government veers from one crisis to the next, his MPs now fear they are learning the hard way just what happens when a populist loses their popularity.", "authors": ["Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}]}

Kilbourn Ave. in downtown Milwaukee, the 259-unit building will offer one-bedroom (starting at $1,715 per month), two-bedroom (up to $4,450 per month), and three-bedroom apartments (up to $7,860 per month).\n\nCompared to typical high-rise buildings — which are constructed using concrete and steel — structures like Ascent use treated wood sourced directly from trees.\n\nAnd like the forests they came from, mass timber buildings actively remove carbon (CO2) from the atmosphere, locking it inside the structure for as long as the building stands.\n\nFurther, mass timber buildings aren't only healthier for the planet; they're healthier for their inhabitants, too. Studies suggest that simply being in a room with exposed wood reduces stress — an effect that appeals to our \"biophilia,\" or the innate desire we have to be surrounded by nature.\n\nMilwaukee enters the global dialogue\n\nAlex Timmer, assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's School of Architecture and Urban Planning, said a mass timber building like Ascent places Milwaukee in an unexpected spotlight.\n\n\"The conversations happening around timber right now are happening globally,” Timmer explained. The most notable mass timber structures are in Europe, so it's unusual that a building of this type is being built in Milwaukee.\n\nAscent will serve as a test for future technological advances in architecture. Rather than asking, “How does a building like this happen in Europe?\" Timmer says we can start to ask: \"How does a building like this happen here in Milwaukee, in the state of Wisconsin ... and globally?\"\n\nAssessing how Ascent performs in our city will potentially open the door for more conversations concerning mass timber as an entire industry — rather than as a one-off example in one city, one state.\n\nConstruction is consumption\n\nTimmer and a team of collaborators from Rivion, WoodWorks and the Forest Products Laboratory are currently working on collecting life cycle data for Ascent, an effort that measures the building's total environmental impact.\n\nTimmer explained they are analyzing Ascent's \"embodied carbon\" and \"embodied energy\" — measures of how much energy is required for the creation of the building and how much carbon is produced during construction.\n\n\"Architecture is almost purely consumption — it consumes energy,” which, in turn, releases carbon, he said.\n\nThis is important to consider any time a new building is constructed.\n\nExperts estimate that the demand for new housing will double by 2060, requiring 2.4 trillion square feet of new housing — the equivalent of adding the entirety of New York City to the world every month for the next 40 years, according to the 2021 Global ABC Global Status Report.\n\nMore:A 15-story downtown Milwaukee apartment project that will use mass timber construction has broken ground\n\nThat same report states that the construction industry accounts for 47% of global CO2 emissions each year. And approximately 22% of global CO2 emissions come from construction’s two biggest offenders: concrete and steel.\n\n“Embodied carbon is the most important for us as architects to tackle because it has the most immediate impact,\" he said. We can change how we build new buildings, turning the industry into one of reuse, reduction and sequestration.\n\nThis starts with mass timber.\n\nMass timber is a 'no-brainer'\n\nMass timber structures directly address embodied carbon because they involve considerably less construction on-site. For Ascent, the building process was estimated to require 90% fewer vehicles and 75% fewer workers to complete the work, which was done in a quarter of the time, according to the building's website.\n\nMass timber buildings not only reduce embodied carbon, they also directly pull CO2 from the atmosphere and store it within the structure for decades.\n\nAccording to CD Smith Construction Co., the company contracted for Ascent's construction: \"An 18-story mass timber building has a negative carbon footprint equal to taking 2,350 cars off the road per year.\"\n\n“Mass timber is definitely one of the really, really important tools that architects have right now,\" Timmer said. \"It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nSourcing timber mindfully, sustainably\n\nWith mass timber structures, significantly less steel and concrete is used, making it more \"green\" than the typical high-rise.\n\nThat’s not to say these materials are completely absent. Steel and concrete are still needed for Ascent's foundation, parking garage, pool, stairwells and elevator shafts.\n\nThis is part of the trade-offs that exist when designing any structure. As Timmer explained, a building is rarely made using one material; functionality has to be a factor.\n\n\"You're not going to build a pool out of mass timber, right?\" he said. “What's interesting about (addressing) embodied carbon is that it allows you to make an informed choice about what material you're using.”\n\nTimmer explained that it's important to look for Forest Stewardship Council standards before purchasing any wood product. This group has standardized metrics that identify whether a material was harvested sustainably.\n\n“As great as mass timber is at sequestering carbon, if you're destroying a tree farm in order to produce it, you're preventing it from being a sustainable product,” he said. \"As long as those trees are sustainably forested, sustainably harvested, we potentially have a renewable resource, and we can sequester more and more embodied carbon.\"\n\nAscent redefines building codes\n\nWhile mass timber represents a future for sustainable architecture, building codes have not caught up to technological advancements.\n\nTimmer explained the current U.S. building codes prescribe safety standards that a building must meet. These mandates originally prevented Ascent's height-to-timber ratio due to fire safety concerns.\n\nAscent was exempted from this code by doing something differently: Providing performative measures, rather than prescriptive ones.\n\nDevelopers showed that when mass timber burns, it burns only on the outside, creating a 'char zone.' This char zone protects everything inside it, keeping the structure intact. \"It is completely safe,\" he said.\n\nBy Ascent's example, Timmer predicts that we'll see building codes evolve and become more sophisticated.\n\n\"We're going to get better at building buildings, and we're going to understand them better,\" he said. \"This means that we will be able to ask more of this particular construction typology, and we can ask more of it from an environmental standpoint.\"\n\nBuilding a structure like Ascent is part of an experiment that comes with constructing any building, Timmer said. \"You learn a ton through the process of building. As much as we do an immense amount of testing in laboratories on these materials, it’s that the actual construction, the actual building that teaches you.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/25/asia/china-navy-aircraft-carrier-analysis-intl-hnk-ml-dst/index.html", "title": "China's new aircraft carrier: Never mind the Fujian, these are the ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nChina made a big statement about its naval ambitions with the recent launch of its third and most advanced aircraft carrier.\n\nThe Fujian – by far China’s biggest, most modern and most powerful aircraft carrier to date – is the 80,000-ton jewel in the crown of a military expansion that has seen Beijing grow its navy into the world’s largest.\n\nIts new combat systems – such as an electromagnetic catapult-assisted launch system – show China is fast catching up with the United States, experts say, and will give it the ability to launch more aircraft, more quickly, and with more ammunition.\n\nThat should be enough to give any would-be opponent pause for thought, especially given China’s increasing aggression in its territorial disputes with Japan in the East China Sea, a host of Southeast Asian nations in the South China Sea, and its repeated harassment of the self-governed island of Taiwan – where it has pointedly refused to rule out an invasion.\n\nChina's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, at Jiangnan Shipyard on June 17. Li Tang/VCG/Getty Images\n\nStill, while the launch of the Fujian amid much fanfare was clearly meant as a message to Beijing’s rivals, analysts caution against swallowing too much of the hype just yet.\n\nFirstly, the Fujian likely won’t be operational for another three to four years, said Carl Schuster, a former US Navy captain and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center. And even when it is operational, its size will make it an obvious target – any enemy will be keenly aware that sinking such an iconic vessel would be as much of a morale blow as a military disaster for China.\n\nThe launch ceremony for China's third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, at Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, on June 17. Li Tang/VCG/Getty Images\n\nThen there is the simple fact that, impressive as they seem, aircraft carriers aren’t necessarily best suited to what experts see as the most plausible conflict scenarios in the near future – including clashes in the East and South China Seas and an invasion of Taiwan.\n\nEssentially, experts say, the Fujian might be China’s biggest ship, but it’s probably not the biggest problem on the minds of US naval commanders right now.\n\nHere are four types of ship at China’s disposal that arguably pose a far greater threat to US naval dominance.\n\nChina's type 055 guided-missile destroyer Nanchang in the Western Pacific on October 19, 2021. Sun Zifa/China News Service/Getty Images\n\nType 055 destroyer\n\nLaunched in 2017, these 13,000-ton stealth guided-missile destroyers are considered by many to be the most powerful surface combatants in the world.\n\nThe Type 055, big enough to be considered a cruiser by NATO standards, is equipped with 112 vertical launch tubes that can used to fire everything from anti-ship missiles to long-range land-attack missiles.\n\n“This ship in particular has a sophisticated design, stealth features, radars, and a large missile inventory. It is larger and more powerful than most US, Japanese, and South Korean destroyers,” RAND Corp. senior analyst Timothy Heath told CNN in 2018, when Beijing launched two of the warships in a single day – a testament to China’s impressive shipbuilding capabilities.\n\nA US Congressional Research Service report in March said at least 10 Type 055s are thought to have been launched or are under construction.\n\nThe deployment of the Lhasa, the second of Beijing’s five active Type 055s, to the Sea of Japan for drills amid growing tensions over Taiwan, was championed by China’s state-run Global Times tabloid last week.\n\n“The ship has achieved full operational capability and demonstrated its capabilities in deterring possible foreign military interference in the Taiwan Strait at a time when the US and Japan have been repeatedly provoking China over the Taiwan question,” the Global Times reported.\n\nThe potency of the Type 055 was underlined in footage that emerged on social media in April. It showed one launching what naval analyst H I Sutton said was a hypersonic YJ-21 anti-ship ballistic missile – a weapon often referred to as a “carrier killer.”\n\nGlobal Times played down the footage, describing the missiles as part of the country’s defensive strategy.\n\n“If the US does not make military provocations against China, including over the Taiwan question, it does not need to worry about the missiles,” it said.\n\nChina's Liaoning aircraft carrier is accompanied by navy frigates and submarines during an exercise in the South China Sea. Li Gang/AP\n\nType 039 submarine\n\nThese Yuan-class submarines are almost silent diesel-electric-powered boats with capabilities that could prove tough for US military planners to deal with.\n\nBeijing has built 17 of the Type 39A/B subs, with plans to increase that total to 25 in the next three years, according to the US Defense Department’s 2021 report to Congress on China’s military power.\n\n“The Type 039 SSs provide formidable ‘defense in depth’” in waters close to China, “and they appear to be developing some capability to engage” US forces farther out to sea, Schuster said.\n\nThe subs are equipped with air independent propulsion (AIP), which means they do not need to surface as frequently to get the air required for diesel combustion, which can then power their batteries.\n\n“When operating on batteries, AIP-equipped submarines are almost silent, with the only noise coming from the shaft bearings, propeller, and flow around the hull,” US Navy officers Michael Walker and Austin Krusz wrote in a 2018 report for the US Naval Institute’s Proceedings magazine.\n\nChina is pushing to launch more of the super-quiet subs, which are armed with anti-ship cruise missiles, the Defense Department report said.\n\nOne potent method of attack used by the Type 039 is to fire a “wake-homing” torpedo across the stern, or back, of a target vessel. The torpedo then follows in the wake of the target ship before exploding near its propulsion and steering systems.\n\nBecause surface ships detect submarines and torpedoes by sound waves, wake-homing torpedoes are particularly tough to defend against.\n\nThe advances in Chinese submarines come just as the US Navy is experiencing trouble with its anti-submarine capabilities.\n\nChief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday told Congress last month that the service wants to scrap nine of its littoral combat ships, some of the newest ships in the US fleet, because their anti-submarine systems “did not work out technically.”\n\nA merchant ferry at Yantai Port in Shandong province of China. Tang Ke/VCG/Getty Images\n\nMerchant ferries\n\nMerchant ferries might not be the first thing that springs to mind when you think about deadly naval capabilities – but therein lies their power.\n\nTo invade Taiwan, China would likely need to transport an invading force of hundreds of thousands of men – some analysts have suggested more than a million would be needed.\n\nVarious analysts – and US government reports – have concluded the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) naval fleet is not up to that task.\n\nBut what China does have is a massive fleet of civilian ferries that could be swiftly converted for military use – and according to some, may even have been designed for just that possibility.\n\n“China’s biggest ferry shipbuilder stated publicly in 2015 that one of its largest roll-on/roll-off ferries was built for dual military and civilian purposes, and one of China’s largest ferry operators has been similarly described as having a dual civil-military development philosophy,” Thomas Shugart, a former US Navy submarine commander now a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, wrote in a 2021 essay for War on the Rocks.\n\nHe added that civilian ferry companies operating in the Yellow and South China Seas have already been organized into PLA auxiliary units.\n\nCrunching the numbers, said Shugart, was staggering. He estimated that using civilian ships would give China an extra 1.1 million displacement tonnes. That figure is more than three times the displacement tonnage of all of China’s amphibious assault ships put together. And if China tapped Hong Kong’s roll-on/roll-off vehicle carriers it could gain an extra 370,000 tonnes of sealift, according to Shugart.\n\nIs that enough to take Taiwan by force?\n\nThat is hard to know. But Shugart said it did answer one question.\n\n“How many transport (ships) does the Chinese military have? Very probably, more than you might think.”\n\nChinese vessels moored at Whitsun Reef in the South China Sea in 2021. AP\n\nMaritime militia\n\nFerries aren’t the only supposedly civilian vessels military planners have on their radars.\n\nExperts also accuse China of creating a maritime militia, made up of more than a hundred vessels supposedly engaged in commercial fishing, to enforce its wishes in disputed seas.\n\nThe militia – which Beijing denies even exists – is made up of at least 122 vessels and likely as many as 174, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nBut the actual number could be even greater. Various experts suspected the militia’s involvement when more than 200 Chinese fishing boats crowded the waters around Whitsun Reef in the South China Sea in early 2021. The reef is claimed by both China and the Philippines, which described the presence of the boats as a “clear provocative action.”\n\n“The People’s Armed Forces Maritime Militia don’t fish,” Schuster told CNN last year. “They have automatic weapons aboard and reinforced hulls, making them very dangerous at close range. Also, they have a top speed of around 18-22 knots, making them faster than 90% of the world’s fishing boats.”\n\nThe militia has two main parts: professional militia boats and actual fishing boats employed by the Chinese military under a subsidy scheme, according to a November report from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nThe professionals lead such activities as harassing foreign drilling ships or blocking foreign fishing boats, and the subsidized fishers bring pressure in numbers, the CSIS report said.\n\nAnd with the world’s largest fishing fleet, China has plenty of reserves to call on.\n\nAbout that carrier again\n\nStill, none of this is to say that the launch of the Fujian is not a significant moment.\n\nAs in the US, aircraft carriers will in time become the centerpiece of the PLA’s navy – and a symbol of what the modern Chinese military is capable of, Schuster said.\n\n“Fujian’s launch should be viewed for what it portends rather than its limited immediate impact,” Schuster said.\n\n“China has now launched three carriers and brought two into full operational status during a period where the US Navy has struggled to bring one new unit to full operational status,” he said.\n\nSchuster was referring to the USS Gerald Ford, a supercarrier that has been plagued by problems since its commissioning in 2017 (by which time it was already three years late).\n\nThe supercarrier is yet to make its first operational deployment, though that is expected this fall.\n\nMeanwhile, China forges ahead.\n\n“They are building their navy at a faster rate than the US and all of its allies,” Schuster said.\n\n“Imperfect, but a good foundation.”", "authors": ["Brad Lendon"], "publish_date": "2022/06/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/world/denmark-brain-collection-scn-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "Denmark's brain collection: The dark and mysterious origins of ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Watch the special documentary, “World’s Untold Stories: The Brain Collectors,” November 12-13 on CNN International.\n\nCNN —\n\nFor years, there had been whispers.

As a child, Inger remembers Kirsten as quiet and smart, the two sisters sharing a close bond. Then, when Kirsten was around 14 years old, something began to change.\n\nKirsten experienced outbursts and prolonged bouts of crying. Inger asked her mother if it was her fault, often feeling that way because the two girls were so close.\n\n“At Christmas, they were supposed to go on a visit to some family members,” Søgaard said, “but my great-grandmother and father, they stayed home and sent all of their children away except for Kirsten.”\n\nWhen they got back from that family visit, Søgaard said, Kirsten was gone.\n\nIt was the first of many hospitalizations, and the start of a long and painful journey that would ultimately end in Kirsten’s death.\n\nThe diagnosis: schizophrenia.\n\nThe brain collectors\n\nKirsten was first hospitalized towards the end of World War II, when Denmark and the rest of Europe were at last on the verge of peace.\n\nLike so many places, Denmark was also grappling with mental illness. Psychiatric institutions had been built across the country to provide care for patients.\n\nDoctors prepare a patient for electroshock therapy at Augustenborg Psychiatric Hospital in Denmark, 1943. A E Andersen/Ritzau Scanpix/AP\n\nBut there was limited understanding of what was happening in the brain. The same year peace came to Denmark’s doorstep, two doctors working in the country had an idea.\n\nWhen these patients died in psychiatric hospitals, autopsies were routinely performed. What if, these doctors thought, the brains were removed – and kept?\n\nThomas Erslev, historian of medical science and research consultant at Aarhus University, estimates that half of all psychiatric patients in Denmark who died between 1945 and 1982 contributed – unknowingly and without consent – their brains. They went to what became known as the Institute of Brain Pathology, connected to the Risskov Psychiatric Hospital in Aarhus, Denmark.\n\nDoctors Erik Stromgren and Larus Einarson were the architects. After roughly five years, said Erslev, pathologist Knud Aage Lorentzen took over the institute, and spent the next three decades building the collection.\n\nDr. Larus Einarson, shown here teaching a class, was one of the co-founders of the brain collection at the Institute of Brain Pathology. Arne Sell/Aarhus University\n\nThe final tally would amount to 9,479 human brains – believed to be the largest collection of its kind anywhere in the world.\n\nNearly 10,000 brains on the move\n\nIn 2018, pathologist Dr. Martin Wirenfeldt Nielsen got a call. The brain collection, as it would come to be known, was on the move.\n\nA lack of funding meant it could no longer stay in Aarhus, but the University of Southern Denmark in the city of Odense had offered to pick up the mantle. Would Wirenfeldt Nielsen be interested in overseeing it?\n\nPathologist Dr. Martin Wirenfeldt Nielsen now oversees the brain collection, housed in Odense, Denmark. Samantha Bresnahan/CNN\n\n“I’d sort of heard of it in the periphery,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen recalled. “But my first real knowledge about the vast extent of it was when they decided to move it down here … (because) how do you actually move almost 10,000 brains?”\n\nThe yellowish-green plastic buckets housing each brain, preserved in formaldehyde, were placed into new white buckets that were sturdier for the transport, and hand-labeled in black marker with a number. And then the brains, give or take a few (no one knows where bucket #1 is, for example) made their way to their new home in a large basement room on the university’s campus.\n\n“The room wasn’t actually ready when they moved it down here,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen said. “The whole collection was just standing there, buckets on top of each other, in the middle of the floor. And that’s when I saw it for the first time … That was like, okay, this is something I’ve never seen before.”\n\nAn ethical reckoning\n\nEventually, the nearly 10,000 buckets were placed on rolling shelves, where they remain today – waiting – representing lives, and a range of psychiatric disorders.\n\nThere are roughly 5,500 brains with dementia; 1,400 with schizophrenia; 400 with bi-polar disorder; 300 with depression, and more.\n\nWhat separates this collection from any other in the world is that the brains collected during the first decade are untouched by modern medicines – a time capsule of sorts, for mental illness in the brain.\n\n“Whereas other brain collections … (are) maybe specified for neurodegenerative diseases, dementia, tumors, or other things like that – we really have the whole thing here,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen said.\n\nBut it has not been without controversy. In the 1990s, the Danish public got wind of the collection, which had been sitting idle since former director Lorentzen’s retirement in 1982.\n\nIt would kick off one of the first major ethical science debates in Denmark.\n\nA history of The Brain Collection 1945 The Institute of Brain Pathology is founded, connected to the Risskov Psychiatric Hospital in Aarhus, Denmark Risskov, pictured here in the early 1900s.

Then the least we can do to those patients and their relatives is to make sure that the brains are used in research.”\n\nAfter years of intense debate, SIND changed its position. “All of a sudden, they were very strong proponents for keeping the brains,” Erslev said, “actually saying this might be a very valuable resource, not only for the scientists, but for the sufferers of psychiatric illness because it might prove to benefit therapeutics down the line.”\n\n“For (SIND),” Kristensen said, “It was important where it was placed and to make sure that there would be some sort of control of the future use of the collection.”\n\nBy the time it moved to Odense in 2018, the ethical debate was largely settled, and Wirenfeldt Nielsen became caretaker of the collection.\n\nA few years later, he would get a message from Søgaard. Was it possible, she asked, that he had a brain there belonging to a woman named Kirsten?\n\nSearching for Kirsten\n\nIn the search for what happened to her great aunt Kirsten, Søgaard realized there were clues all around her. But piecing together what exactly had happened to her grandmother’s sister was slow, filled with dead ends and false starts.\n\nYet she was enthralled, and began officially reporting her journey for Kristeligt Dagblad, the Copenhagen-based newspaper where she worked – eventually bringing it to light in a series of articles.\n\nAt one point, Søgaard decided to focus on a single word her grandmother had told her, the name of a psychiatric hospital: Oringe.\n\n“I opened my computer and I searched for ‘Oringe patient journals,’” she said. After putting in a request through the national archives, “I got an email that said, ‘Okay, we found something for you, come have a look if you want.’ … I felt this excitement … like, she’s out there.”\n\nJournalist Lise Søgaard made it her mission to find out what happened to her grandmother's little sister, Kirsten -- a journey that would take her places she never imagined. She shared that experience with CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta at her home outside Copenhagen in April 2022. Cameron Bauer and Samantha Bresnahan/CNN\n\nThat excitement was short-lived. At the national archives, they placed a mostly empty file in front of her. It wasn’t much to go on, but it confirmed Kirsten’s diagnosis of schizophrenia.\n\nWithout another solid lead, Søgaard wondered where to go next. Then, almost in passing, as they looked through old family photos together, her mother said something that she’d never heard before.\n\n“She said, ‘You know, they might have kept her brain,’ and I said, ‘What?!’” Søgaard told CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta at her house outside of Copenhagen. “And she told me what she knew about the brain collection.”\n\nLiving with schizophrenia\n\nAt age 95, Søgaard’s grandmother, Inger, could still clearly picture visiting her little sister Kirsten in the hospital, after the symptoms she first started experiencing at age 14 continued to progress.\n\nUpon one visit, Inger remembered, “(Kirsten) was lying there, completely apathetic. She was not able to speak to us. … Another day we went to visit her, and she was gone from her room. They told us she had thrown a glass at a nurse, and they had sent her to the basement, to a room where they (restrained) her with belts. And we were not allowed to go in, but I saw her through a hole in the door; she was lying there, strapped up.”\n\nOne floor of the Oringe psychiatric hospital is now a museum, which displays medical treatments and patient rooms such as this one. Samantha Bresnahan/CNN\n\nInger felt confused and scared, she said, because it could have been anyone, including her, that might get “sick.”\n\nAt Sankt Hans, one of the largest and oldest psychiatric hospitals in Denmark, Dr. Thomas Werge walks the same grounds he did as a child, when his own grandmother was hospitalized there. Now, he runs the Institute for Biological Psychiatry there, where he and his team study the biological causes that contribute to psychiatric disorders.\n\nA 2012 study found that roughly 40% of Danish women and 30% of Danish men had received treatment for a mental health disorder in their lifetimes – though Werge estimated that number would “almost certainly” be higher if the same study was done today. (By comparison, that same year, less than 15% of US adults received mental health services.) Among the other Nordic countries, including Sweden and Norway, Werge said the numbers would be comparable to Denmark’s, as there are “similar [universal] health care systems and standards for admission.”\n\n“Mental (health) disorders are all over,” he added. “We just do not recognize this when we walk around among people. Not everybody carries their pain on the outside.”\n\nFor schizophrenia, there are no blood tests or biomarkers to signify its presence; instead, doctors must rely only on a clinical exam.\n\nSchizophrenia presents itself in what the World Health Organization (WHO) calls “significant impairments in the way reality is perceived,” causing psychosis that can include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized behavior or thoughts, and extreme agitation.\n\nRoughly one in 300 people are affected by schizophrenia worldwide, according to the WHO, but less than one-third of those will ever receive specialist mental health care.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Visiting a 'cemetery of the brainless' in Denmark 02:10 - Source: CNN\n\nThe standard treatment since the mid-1950s has been anti-psychotic drugs, which typically work by manipulating dopamine levels: the brain’s reward system. But, Werge said, it can come with a cost.\n\n“Schizophrenia and psychosis are linked to creativity,” he said. “So, when you try to inhibit the psychosis, you also inhibit the creativity. So, there’s a price for being medicated … Whatever causes all these problems for humans is also what makes us humans in the good sense.”\n\nBrain #738\n\nThough there haven’t been many significant scientific breakthroughs regarding an understanding of the disease, researchers have confirmed that genetics and heritability play a significant role.\n\nAccording to Werge, the heritability estimate is as high as 80% – the same as height. “It’s not a surprise to people that if you have very tall parents … there’s a lot of genetics in that,” he said. “The genetic component is equally large in most of the mental disorders actually.”\n\nThose inherited genetic factors either come from the parents, he added, or can arise in a child even if the parents don’t carry the gene.\n\nSøgaard, who has two young children, said the genetic connection was not a driving motivator in her mission to find out what happened to Kirsten, but she has thought about what it means for herself and her family.\n\nWhen families reach out about possible relatives in the brain collection, “that’s an ethical dilemma that we need to take into consideration,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen said. In Søgaard’s case, she received approval for the Danish National Archives to check the set of black books that contain the names of every person whose brain is in the collection.\n\nThere on the list was Kirsten’s name.\n\n“I got an email back [from the National Archives], and they scanned the page where Kirsten’s name was, and her birthday, and the day they received the brain. And in the column out to the left, there was a number,” Søgaard remembered. “Number 738.” She immediately wrote an email to Wirenfeldt Nielsen, asking if that number corresponded to the bucket with Kirsten’s brain.\n\n“I said, ‘Yes, that’s it,’” Wirenfeldt Nielsen recalled. But he also said he couldn’t be sure the bucket was there because a few are missing for unknown reasons. He ventured down to the basement storage room to verify it was there.\n\nOn one of the rolling shelves sat bucket #738.\n\nKirsten’s brain.\n\nBucket #738 -- Kirsten's brain -- sits on a shelf among the rest of the brain collection in the basement at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense. Samantha Bresnahan/CNN\n\nWhen Søgaard first saw it, she felt compelled to hug the bucket.\n\n“I had learned a lot about Kirsten,” she said. “I feel some kind of connection … (and) I know the pain that she felt, and I know what she went through.”\n\nThe ‘white cut’\n\nWhat Kirsten went through was another extraordinary beat in this incredible story, and the long history of psychiatric care in Denmark.\n\nAs part of her treatment, Kirsten received what’s known commonly in Denmark as “the white cut.”\n\nIn medical terms: a lobotomy.\n\nThe procedure was an integral part of the country’s psychiatric history. During the time the brain collection was running from the 1940s until the early 1980s, Denmark reportedly did more lobotomies per capita than any other country in the world.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback A look at the brain like you've never seen it before 03:08 - Source: CNN\n\n“It’s a very poor treatment, because you destroy a big part of the brain,” Wirenfeldt Nielsen said. “And it’s very risky, because you can kill the patient, basically – but they had nothing else to do.”\n\nTreatment options were limited, and in many ways extreme. Seizures were induced by placing electrodes on either side of the head; insulin shock therapy meant patients were administered large doses of insulin, reducing blood sugar and resulting in a comatose state; and the lobotomy, either transorbital – using a pick-like instrument inserted through the back of the eye to the front lobe – or prefrontal.\n\nThe prefrontal lobotomy was pioneered by a Portuguese neurologist, Antonio Egas Moniz. Now considered barbaric, he actually won the Nobel Prize for the procedure in 1949.\n\nA tool is inserted into the frontal lobe, scraping away tracts of white matter – the reason behind the “white cut” moniker. “Emotional reactions … are located at least in part in the frontal lobe,” explained Wirenfeldt Nielsen, “so they thought that just by cutting (there), that could sort of calm the patient down.”\n\nLeft: Portuguese neurologist Antonio Egas Moniz was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1949 for pioneering the prefrontal lobotomy.

Busch\n\nIn Kirsten’s case, Inger said there were glimpses of “the old Kirsten” before she got the white cut – but after that, she was gone. In 1951, the year after her lobotomy, Kirsten died.\n\nShe was just 24 years old.\n\nA promise for the future\n\nOn a metal table in a small, standalone building on the grounds of Oringe psychiatric hospital, Kirsten’s brain was removed, set into a small plastic bucket, placed in a wooden box, and shipped – by regular mail carrier – to the Institute of Brain Pathology at Risskov, to join the brain collection.\n\nSøgaard saw the metal table, where a white wooden block still sits on one end – where the heads were placed – and upon which small marks are still visible today. This is where the skulls were opened.\n\nThe standalone building at Oringe (left) housing the autopsy room where Kirsten's brain was removed in 1951 still stands today, and includes the wooden boxes (right) that were once used to ship the brains to Risskov. Samantha Bresnahan/CNN\n\nDespite the graphic reminders, in reporting out this story both for herself, and for the newspaper, “it was important (for me) to not write a story that was a horror story,” she said, adding it was easy to look back and say, “How could you do that?”\n\n“I don’t think the doctors wanted to do bad. I think they actually wanted to do good. … I think the most ethical thing you can do is to make sure that you know exactly what you can do with these brains. And that’s what they’re doing now. They’re trying to find out, ‘How can they help us?’”\n\nThere have been studies using the collection over the years, including a discovery in 1970 of what is now known as familial Danish dementia, and a new study is ongoing, focused on mRNA in the brains, by Danish researcher Betina Elfving.\n\nFor the most part, the brains represent untapped, enormous potential. Yet the one in bucket #738 has already done something extraordinary, thanks in large part to Søgaard herself. She worked to break the cycle of stigma surrounding mental health disorders by sharing her most personal, intimate family details with the world.\n\n“(My grandmother) expressed gratitude,” Søgaard said. “She also said, ‘I feel like I’m moving closer to my sister now.’”", "authors": ["Samantha Bresnahan Dr. Sanjay Gupta Susanne Gargiulo Sandy Thin", "Samantha Bresnahan", "Dr. Sanjay Gupta", "Susanne Gargiulo", "Sandy Thin"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/world/water-battery-switzerland-renewable-energy-climate-scn-hnk-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "This giant 'water battery' under the Alps could be a game-changer ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSwitzerland has unveiled its latest renewable energy innovation: a giant water battery.\n\nBeginning operations last month, the water battery, called Nant de Drance, is a pumped storage hydropower plant that provides the same energy storage capacity as 400,000 electric car batteries.\n\nLocated high in the Swiss Alps in the canton of Valais, the plant is equipped with agile, reversible turbines that offer new levels of flexibility, says Robert Gleitz, a delegate of the board of directors of Nant de Drance: with the flick of a switch, the plant can go from storing energy to providing electricity.\n\nThe massive project took 14 years to complete. Around 17 kilometers (10.5 miles) of subterranean tunnels were excavated through the Alps while the six turbines are stored 600 meters (1970 feet) below ground, in a giant cavern the length of two football fields.\n\nThe six turbines are powered by water cascading down a steel pipe that's taller than the Eiffel Tower. Nant de Drance/Sébastien Moret\n\nNant de Drance repurposed two existing reservoirs, raising the upper one by 21.5 meters (71 feet) to double its capacity – it now holds more water than 6,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools.\n\nAs one of the largest facilities of its kind, the $2 billion project could play a vital role in stabilizing Europe’s electricity grid as the continent transitions to renewable energy, says Gleitz.\n\nMaking a splash\n\nPumped storage hydropower plants, which have been around for over a century, are particularly important for renewable energy because wind and solar rely heavily on the weather and don’t provide a consistent power supply.\n\n“We can take energy (from the grid) when there is too much, and generate it again when it’s needed,” says Gleitz.\n\nUnlike many of the plants that preceded it, Nant de Drance uses variable speed pump-turbines, says Pascal Radue, CEO of GE Renewable Energy Hydro which supplied equipment for the facility.\n\nThe turbines help to stabilize the electricity grid, says Radue.\n\n“With a fixed speed turbine, you have to wait until the power plant is running at exactly the right speed to be synchronized to the grid,” says Radue, adding that this wastes time and energy. Variable speed turbines supply electricity to the grid immediately so there’s less risk of blackouts.\n\nA big impact\n\nHistorically “open-flow” pumped storage hydropower stations, which are built on river systems and require dam construction, disrupted wildlife and damaged ecosystems. In Switzerland, where the first pumped storage hydropower plant was built in 1890, almost half of total river lengths have been artificially altered, with very few Alpine rivers in a natural state.\n\nNant de Drance used existing dam and reservoir infrastructure, with the majority of the building work carried out underground -- limiting its impact on the landscape. Nant de Drance/Sébastien Moret\n\nThat’s why modern projects favor closed-loop systems, like Nant de Drance, which don’t impact river systems, says Andrew Blakers, a professor of engineering at the Australian National University.\n\n“The era of dam building is nearly over,” says Blakers, adding that these closed loop power plants take up a relatively small space given the energy security they provide. He estimates that to power a city with one million inhabitants for 24 hours would require around two square kilometers of flooded land, adding that pumped storage hydropower offers one of the highest efficiency energy storage solutions currently available.\n\nNant de Drance returns around 80% of the electricity it takes in back to the grid, and stores around 20 hours of backup energy, says Gleitz.\n\nTransitioning to renewables\n\nHoping to become the “first climate-neutral continent,” Europe has big ambitions for renewable energy: in 2020, just over one-fifth of the continent’s total energy came from renewable sources but in May this year, the European Commission increased its 2030 renewables target from 40% to 45%.\n\nTo achieve this, new, high-capacity storage facilities are essential, says Blakers. The European Association for Storage of Energy estimates that the continent will need 200 gigawatts of storage by 2030 – more than four times its current storage capacity. In the decade between 2010 and 2020, just 8 gigawatts of storage was added to the grid.\n\nThe turbines are stored in an underground cavern the length of two football fields. Nant de Drance/Sébastien Moret\n\nThat’s why Nant de Drance is so significant. Located at the geographical heart of Europe, Switzerland could offer stability to the grid across the continent, says Rebecca Ellis, energy policy manager at the non-profit International Hydropower Association. Nant de Drance has increased Switzerland’s installed energy capacity by 33%, says Ellis, adding that it “shows the leadership of Switzerland” in the transition to renewables.\n\nHowever, as the nation is not a member of the European Union, regulations are currently a barrier, says Gleitz. “The market rules are not easy,” he says. “We still need to have closer agreements with the EU.”\n\nPumped storage hydropower could provide energy security outside of Europe, too: Blakers and his team have identified around 600,000 potential sites for closed loop systems – although just 1% of these would be needed to meet total global energy storage needs, he adds.\n\nAs the climate crisis intensifies, Gleitz hopes that Europe embraces the potential of the “clean energy storage” provided by pumped storage hydropower plants. “If we want to go in the direction of having clean power, Nant de Drance is one of the stepping stones on this path,” he says.", "authors": ["Rebecca Cairns"], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/05/europe/cern-hadron-collider-third-run-scn/index.html", "title": "CERN's Large Hadron Collider fires up for third time to uncover ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA decade ago, the Large Hadron Collider, Earth’s most powerful particle accelerator, proved the existence of an subatomic particle called the Higgs boson – thought to be a fundamental building block of the universe dating back to the big bang billions of years ago.\n\nNow, physicists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) on the Swiss-French border are restarting the collider with the aim of understanding more about the Higgs boson, other subatomic particles and the mysteries of dark matter – an invisible and elusive substance that can’t be seen because it doesn’t absorb, reflect or emit any light.\n\nConsisting of a ring 27 kilometers (16.7 miles) in circumference, the Large Hadron Collider – located deep underneath the Alps – is made of superconducting magnets chilled to ‑271.3°C (-456 F), which is colder than outer space. It works by smashing tiny particles together to allow scientists to observe them and see what’s inside.\n\nProton beams have already been circulating in the accelerator complex since April, when it was switched on after being closed for three years of maintenance and upgrades.\n\nOn Tuesday, scientists at CERN will begin collecting data for their experiments, and the Large Hadron Collider will run around the clock for almost four years. It’s the third run for the massive machine, with greater precision and discovery potential than ever before thanks to the upgraded data readout and selection systems, as well as new detector systems and computing infrastructure.\n\n“When we do research we hope that we will find something unexpected, a surprise. That would be the best result. But of course the answer is in the hands of nature, and it depends on how nature answers open questions in fundamental physics,” said Fabiola Gianotti, CERN Director-General, in a video posted on CERN’s website.\n\n“We are looking for answers to questions related to dark matter, to why the Higgs boson is so light and many other open questions.”\n\nUnderstanding the Higgs boson\n\nPhysicists François Englert and Peter Higgs first theorized the existence of the Higgs boson in the 1960s. Physics’ Standard Model lays out the basics of how elementary particles and forces interact in the universe. But the theory had failed to explain how particles actually get their mass. Particles, or bits of matter, range in size and can be larger or smaller than atoms. Electrons, protons and neutrons, for instance, are the subatomic particles that make up an atom. Scientists now believe that the Higgs boson is the particle that gives all matter its mass.\n\nIn 2013, one year after the particle’s discovery, Englert and Higgs won a Nobel prize for their far-sighted prediction. But there’s still much that’s unknown about the Higgs boson, and unlocking its secrets may help scientists understand the universe at its smallest scale and some of the biggest mysteries in the cosmos.\n\nThe Large Hadron Collider, which opened in 2008, is the only place in the world where the Higgs boson can be produced and studied in detail. The third run got successfully underway at 10.47 a.m. ET on Tuesday.\n\nIn the latest round of experiments, CERN’s scientists will study the properties of matter under extreme temperature and density, and will also be searching for explanations for dark matter and for other new phenomena, either through direct searches or – indirectly – through precise measurements of the properties of known particles.\n\n“While all the results obtained so far are consistent with the Standard Model, there is still plenty of room for new phenomena beyond what is predicted by this theory,” said CERN theorist Michelangelo Mangano in a news release.\n\nDark matter is thought to make up most of the matter in the universe and has previously been detected by its ability to create gravitational distortions in outer space.\n\n“The Higgs boson itself may point to new phenomena, including some that could be responsible for the dark matter in the universe,” said Luca Malgeri, a spokesperson for CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid), one of the four big Large Hadron Collider experiments, which is built around a huge electromagnet.", "authors": ["Katie Hunt"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/19/energy/eu-carbon-border-tax/index.html", "title": "EU agrees to the world's largest carbon border tax | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN —\n\nEuropean Union governments have reached a deal on the world’s first major carbon border tax, as part of an overhaul of the bloc’s flagship carbon market that aims to make its economy carbon-neutral by 2050.\n\nEU ministers finalized details of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism early Sunday after reaching a provisional agreement earlier on in the week.\n\nThe landmark measure adds a pollution price on certain imports to the European Union. Carbon-intensive industries inside the bloc must comply with strict emissions standards, and the tax is designed to ensure those businesses are not undermined by competitors in countries with weaker rules.\n\nThe measure will apply first to iron and steel, cement, aluminum, fertilizers, electricity production and hydrogen before being extended to other goods.\n\nIt also disincentivizes EU companies from moving production to more tolerant countries, something that EU lawmakers refer to as “carbon leakage.”\n\nUnder the new mechanism, companies will need to buy certificates to cover emissions generated by the production of goods imported into the European Union based on calculations linked to the EU’s own carbon price.\n\nMohammad Chahim, a Dutch socialist politician who has led negotiations on the law for the European parliament, said in a statement that the measure will be a “crucial pillar” of European climate policies.\n\n“It is one of the only mechanisms we have to incentivize our trading partners to decarbonize their manufacturing industry,” he added.\n\nBut the plan has been met with resistance by countries including the United States and South Africa, which are worried about the impact that carbon border taxes could have on their manufacturers.\n\n“There are a lot of concerns coming from our side about how this is going to impact us and our trade relationship,” US trade representative Katherine Tai said at a conference in Washington last week, according to the Financial Times.\n\nThe European Union and the United States have already butted heads over President Joe Biden’s $370 billion climate plan under the Inflation Reduction Act, which EU officials say will hurt European companies selling into the US market.\n\nIn a nod to the challenge posed by the Inflation Reduction Act, the latest EU deal makes more money available for the development of clean energy technologies in Europe.\n\nThe EU carbon measure could lead to a “rapid deindustrialization” of African countries that export to the European Union, warned Faten Aggad, a senior adviser on climate diplomacy at the African Climate Foundation.\n\nAnother risk is that clean energy capacity in poorer countries will simply be shifted to the production of exported goods while industry aimed at local consumption relies on dirty fuels, Aggad said on Twitter. She added that certifying carbon emissions in producing countries remains a “challenge.”\n\nClimate policy overhaul\n\nThe carbon border tax is part of a wider deal agreed to Sunday that reforms the EU carbon market to cut its emissions 62% by 2030, compared to 2005.\n\nThe EU carbon market, known as the Emissions Trading System (ETS), already caps greenhouse gas emissions from more than 11,000 power and manufacturing plants, as well as all internal EU flights, covering some 500 airlines.\n\nCompanies receive or buy emission permits or “allowances,” which can subsequently be traded. The ETS, which on Sunday was extended to shipping, is key to the European Union’s bid to become the world’s first carbon-neutral continent.\n\nUnder the latest reforms, the quantity of free emissions allowances will be phased out between 2026 and 2034. The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism will be phased in at the same time, in that way protecting domestic firms from being undercut by foreign competitors.\n\nAfter almost 30 hours of talks, negotiators also agreed to launch a new carbon market for heating and transport fuels starting in 2027, with the option to delay that by one year if energy prices remain at current high levels.\n\n“This deal will provide a huge contribution towards fighting climate change at low costs,” Peter Liese, lead negotiator for the European parliament said in a statement. The deal will “provide a clear signal to European industry that it pays off to invest in green technologies,” Liese added.\n\nThe European Parliament and European Council will have to formally approve the deal before it comes into force in 2026.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/05/13/lithium-valley-look-major-players-near-salton-sea-seeking-billions-funding/9665978002/", "title": "Lithium Valley: A look at the major players near the Salton Sea ...", "text": "Janet Wilson and Erin Rode\n\nImperial Valley has a new nickname these days: Lithium Valley. Or as California Gov. Gavin Newsom likes to call it, “the Saudi Arabia of lithium.”\n\nThe monikers are a nod to vast reserves of the white-hot mineral deep below the Earth’s surface in California's hot, southeast corner, near the Salton Sea. While likely one of the world's largest lithium deposits, it will be at least two years before major tonnage will be produced.\n\nBut because lithium is a main ingredient in electric vehicle and power grid batteries, and will be jointly produced with clean geothermal steam power, the pressure in on as the United States, California and others ratchet up clean energy mandates, and as potential profits grow.\n\nWith China in particular ramping up electric vehicle production and sales, prices there soared to an estimated $450,000 for a ton of finished lithium in late April, more than double a previous high at the end of January, according to Brad Franklin, a Riverside-based economist for The Nature Conservancy. Prices for lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide — the compounds likely to be produced in Lithium Valley, have also spiked to record highs.\n\nThree companies, Controlled Thermal Resources, EnergySource and Berkshire Hathaway Renewables, are testing or scaling up pilot technologies at the Salton Sea, running the gauntlet of environmental approvals and permits, and seeking billions of dollars in private and public funding for construction of up to half a dozen facilities in the next decade.\n\nGov. Newsom on Friday proposed major grants, loans and infrastructure funds to help developers and county officials speed up pilot tests, approvals and construction, and to educate a skilled workforce and build vital transmission lines.\n\nDeveloping quickly is \"extremely, extremely essential, the market demand for lithium is absolutely outrageous. I mean, it is huge market demand,\" said Jim Turner, chief operations officer for Controlled Thermal Resources, an Australian energy company. \"If it's supply out of the Salton Sea, regardless of whether it's Energy Source, or Berkshire or us, that means that's the less lithium that the automakers are going to go overseas to get.\"\n\nPrices have plateaued in recent weeks, but with limited global supplies and surging demand, they will likely stay high for some time.\n\n“The lithium market is very dynamic, it's changing constantly, but in general, the skyrocketing prices right now are giving everybody a big incentive to get their projects up and running,” Franklin said.\n\nBut he and other experts believe it is critical to examine potential environmental impacts as well as benefits.\n\nVast underground reserve\n\nLithium, the lightest known metal on Earth, is capable of holding an electric charge for long periods, and has emerged as a critical ingredient not just in EV batteries, but in smart phones and large grid storage. Worldwide, lithium production increased in 2021 by 21% to approximately 100,000 tons, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, in response to strong demand for lithium ion batteries and rising prices. State energy researchers say ultimately a third of global supply could come from Lithium Valley — or more precisely, what lies underground.\n\nFor decades, a raw form of lithium was considered part of the waste stream from a 10-square-mile stretch of large power plants atop a massive underground brine pool likely twice that size, known as the Salton Sea Geothermal Reserve, about 90 miles south of Palm Springs. The plants produce largely toxic-free power by extracting huge amounts of superheated brine from more than a mile underground that “flashes” into steam when it is brought to the surface. Along with other trace minerals, lithium salts, which can form pipe clogging deposits similar to white crust from hard tap water, were filtered out and discarded.\n\n“It was worth so little, we used to just inject it back into the ground,” said Turner with CT Resources, who in previous roles for other companies oversaw the construction and operation of several of the Imperial Valley's geothermal power plants.\n\nGetting it done\n\nThe key piece of the Lithium Valley puzzle has been figuring out how to extract the lithium from this geothermal brine at commercial scale.\n\nSeparating that metal and others with potential market value from the brine is less invasive than blasting and other hard rock mining done in Australia, or huge, open air evaporation pounds in South America. But it's not easy.\n\n\"The traditional ways of mining lithium are really destructive and really hard on the environment for local communities, and so the attraction of geothermal lithium is that the footprint is small,\" UC Riverside geochemist Michael McKibben said. \"You're not digging pits, you're not putting huge evaporation ponds on the surface, because the brine is already brought up for the steam, so it's just a matter of tacking on a lithium filter to that brine before you reinject it back into the ground.\"\n\nIndustry representatives say it's more complicated than simply adding a filter, though that is a key piece. And environmentalists and public health experts say dust, and emissions from trucks traveling to and from the site, could worsen existing health issues, and full health impact analyses should be done for all projects.\n\nMcKibben and other scientists are working on a new study led by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to map lithium deposits, extraction and potential consequences.\n\nMcKibben said he understands the concerns over potential impacts like truck traffic.\n\n\"Nothing is going to be completely clean,\" he said. \"But this is the cleanest way we can do it, using geothermal.\"\n\nCT Resources and the other companies are hoping to capitalize on the opportunity to extract lithium in a cleaner way. They're pressing forward with projects to extract, soften and refine the soft, whitish metal into a usable form for battery manufacturers. They’ve hired specialty firms to scale up successful pilot production methods and are seeking partners and funds — both private and public — for what could ultimately be a huge development zone.\n\nEnergySource eyes construction this summer\n\nThe company closest to the starting line is EnergySource, which could begin construction of the nation's first commercial-scale brine to lithium plant this summer. The San Diego-based company received the necessary approvals from the Imperial County Planning Commission for Project ATLiS in November, marking a first for a full processing plant beyond a pilot or demonstration-scale project.\n\n“We are highly, highly confident (in the project’s commercial viability). We have piloted this, we know that it works, and that it works economically, and we would like this to be the first brine-based lithium extraction facility in the U.S.,” EnergySource President and CEO Eric Spomer told The Desert Sun.\n\nNow that EnergySource has a conditional use permit from the county, the company just has a few “contractual hurdles” to address before potentially starting construction this summer “if everything goes perfectly,” Spomer said. If construction goes as planned, Project ATLiS could be operational in 2024. It is expected to create 60 permanent jobs.\n\nProject ATLiS will extract lithium from the brine that is already brought to the surface at the John L. Featherstone Plant located near Calipatria, which EnergySource estimates could result in 20,000 tons a year of lithium hydroxide monohydrate. The 55-megawatt plant has been operating near the Salton Sea since 2012, and currently sells its power to the Salt River Project in Arizona under a 30-year power purchase agreement.\n\nEnergySource began pilot testing its lithium extraction technology platform, ILiAD (Integrated lithium Adsorption Desorption), at the Featherstone plant in 2016. The technology was developed by Charles Marston, and while specific details on the technology are limited, Spomer described it as “a combination of an absorbent and a piece of mechanical equipment that together are a completely disruptive, really revolutionary step forward on extracting lithium from brines.” In addition to Imperial County, the technology has been deployed at other sites in North and South America.\n\nEnergySource started working on lithium extraction “before it was cool,” Spomer said, as a way to make geothermal energy more financially competitive.\n\n“Geothermal power in the Salton Sea is hard. Mineral recovery is hard. And being first is harder still. But when we're successful, it validates everybody, and the other projects, it makes everything real. Because right now, until somebody actually does it, it’s a lot of talk,” Spomer said.\n\nHell's Kitchen reviews begin\n\nWhile Energy Source is slightly out in front, Hell’s Kitchen, a California subsidiary of Controlled Thermal Resources, has publicly unveiled the largest potential extraction plans.\n\n\"Whichever company is first, frankly we're not really competing with each other, we're just cheering each other on,\" Turner said. \"Because if Berkshire developed everything that they have their arms around, and Energy Source did the same thing, and we did the same thing, you know, the automakers or the battery companies, they're going to buy up everything that comes out of the Salton Sea.\"\n\nHe said if Energy Source begins successful commercial production from the brine, it will help quell global uncertainty from investors and manufacturers about whether it can really be done.\n\nCT Resources is also working as fast as it can. The company punched two exploratory well lines more than a mile deep into the hot magma over the past six months, and is currently preparing \"float\" tests and other work with consulting companies on a 3 acre drilling and processing site. They've perfected a technique for separating the lithium from the brine and attaching it to tiny beads, and will test scaling it up to commercial tonnage levels.\n\nMeanwhile the Hell's Kitchen subsidiary — named for a long shuttered restaurant on what was formerly an island in the Salton Sea but is now a landlocked hill — has applied for county approvals for a 49.9 megawatt geothermal plant and a related lithium plant that could produce 20,000 tons of the highly sought after mineral annually by 2024.\n\nThe $500 million joint project is the first piece of a master plan that could ultimately cover 7,000 acres — some of it now under the shallow edge of the receding sea, but expected to emerge in coming years — with more power plants generating up 260 megawatts each, and producing a whopping 300,000 tons of lithium annually. Hundreds of construction jobs and 1,000 permanent jobs on site could ultimately be created, along with up to 300 back office positions in the city of Imperial, population 18,631.\n\nThe company has strategic backing from General Motors, and leased a large chunk of land from local heavyweight Imperial Irrigation District, with an agreement to supply the power from the first, smaller power plant to the utility, as well as pay royalties. It is seeking millions in federal or state clean energy and clean air funds, too.\n\nCompany officials hope to persuade GM or another major automaker to build a full lithium ion battery manufacturing plant nearby, and also have signed a letter of intent with Statevolt, based in Italy, to use the lithium and produce batteries from its operations. The company's head, Lars Carlstrom, was convicted of tax fraud in Sweden in the 1990s, but has rebounded since.\n\nA public “scoping” period closed on Friday for the first joint project, with a few objections expressed at a planning session from area residents about possible noise and dust, and questions from neighboring would-be developers about project boundaries and a road leading to it. A full environmental impact report and other approvals could be done between Thanksgiving and Christmas, Turner said. Possible impacts to wildlife, archeology, air quality and other resources — \"the whole nine yards,\" will be evaluated and mitigation conditions imposed as necessary.\n\nTo date there’s little of the fierce opposition like that expressed by environmentalists about possible hard rock mining sites in Nevada and California’s Death Valley, though the chair of the state Lithium Valley Commission, community groups and public health academics all want robust heath assessments done.\n\nBHE: Commercial possible by 2026\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Energy Renewables, part of Warren Buffet's empire, is in the early stages of a demonstration project to determine the commercial viability of lithium extraction at its 10 geothermal plants near the Salton Sea, which produce more than 50,000 gallons per minute of geothermal brine. The stalwart of Imperial County’s geothermal industry, BHE Renewables and predecessor company CalEnergy have operated plants in the region for over 40 years.\n\nBHE Renewables is testing lithium recovery in two phases. The first demonstration project, which will recover lithium from geothermal brine, is expected to come online soon. Jonathan Weisgall, vice president for legislative and regulatory affairs for Berkshire Hathaway Energy, discussed the company’s lithium extraction plans at the Salton Sea Summit on April 7, where he said the first demonstration project would come online within “the next couple of weeks.” The demonstration project is one-tenth of commercial scale.\n\nWeisgall is also a member of the Lithium Valley Commission. The Salton Sea Summit is a multi-disciplinary conference focused on the Salton Sea region, organized by the Pacific Institute, the UC Riverside School of Public Policy, and UC Riverside-Palm Desert.\n\nBHE Renewables is currently developing the second demonstration project, which will convert the lithium chloride into battery-grade lithium carbonate. That demonstration project is expected to come online in spring 2023.\n\n“We are crawling before we are walking, and we are going to walk before we run. We have to be incredibly deliberate about this, as exciting as lithium is, it has never been produced on a commercial scale before… Scaling up to demonstration takes work and then scaling from demonstration to commercial takes a lot of work,” Weisgall said at the April event.\n\nBHE Renewables won a $6 million matching grant award from the California Energy Commission in May 2020 to design and build the first demonstration project, and the second phase of the demonstration project received a $14.9 million grant from the Department of Energy.\n\nAfter successfully completing the two demonstration projects, construction of the first commercial plant could begin as soon as 2024, according to BHE Renewables.\n\nThis would put BHE Renewables on a path to commercial scale production of lithium by 2026, according to a February announcement. Once at commercial scale, BHE Renewables facilities could produce an estimated 90,000 metric tons of lithium per year.\n\n“We’re going about this in a deliberate manner. We have every reason to think this will be successful. We have every reason to think - we know - that there’s more lithium in the Imperial Valley than virtually any other place in the world. We think we’ll be successful, but again, we’re at the beginning stages with these demonstration plans,” Weisgall said.\n\nJanet Wilson is senior environment reporter for The Desert Sun, and co-authors USA Today's Climate Point newsletter.

Here's why ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSweden and Finland are set formally to end decades of neutrality and join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in a historic breakthrough for the alliance that deals a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe last major hurdle to the two nations’ entry to the bloc was removed when Turkey dropped its opposition on Tuesday.\n\nThat breakthrough came during a NATO summit in Madrid that has already become one of the most consequential meetings in the history of the military alliance.\n\nThe two countries are now expected to become full NATO members quickly, shoring up the bloc’s eastern flank within months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHere’s all you need to know about why the move happened, what comes next and why it matters.\n\nWhat are the latest developments?\n\nSweden and Finland both announced their intention to join NATO in May, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused a sudden shift in attitudes toward joining the bloc.\n\nThat announcement was welcomed by almost all of NATO’s leaders – but there was one significant obstacle. Turkey’s President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said he was not looking at both countries joining NATO “positively,” accusing them of housing Kurdish “terrorist organizations.”\n\nUnder NATO rules, just one member state can veto a new applicant’s membership.\n\nHowever, a big diplomatic breakthrough between the three countries took place at the NATO summit in Madrid on Tuesday. Turkey signed a trilateral memorandum with Finland and Sweden, lifting its opposition and officially welcoming them to join the bloc.\n\n“In NATO, we have always shown that whatever our differences, we can always sit down, find common ground and resolve any issues. NATO’s open door policy has been an historic success,” NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told journalists in Madrid.\n\nOn Wednesday, NATO formally invited Sweden and Finland to join, kickstarting a multistage process that will end with both countries holding full membership.\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday addressed the Madrid NATO summit, where a key diplomatic breakthrough has paved the way for Sweden and Finland to join. Manu Fernandez/AP\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nStoltenberg said Wednesday that he expects Sweden and Finland to become members of the military alliance quickly.\n\nThe invitation sparks a seven-step accession process. Key moments along that path include talks between NATO and the candidate countries. The candidates must formally accept the obligations of membership, and then current member states sign an Accession Protocol, before individually ratifying it back home.\n\n“We need a ratification process in 30 parliaments – that always takes some time but I expect also that to go rather quickly because allies are ready to try to make that ratification process happen as quickly as possible,” Stoltenberg explained Wednesday.\n\nAfter that, the candidate country is formally invited to accede to the Washington Treaty, the founding document of the alliance.\n\nNATO has an “open door” policy – any country can be invited to join if it expresses an interest, as long as it is able and willing to uphold the principles of the bloc’s founding treaty.\n\nThe ratification process usually takes about a year, from the signing of the Accession Protocol by existing members to the country joining the Washington Treaty.\n\nBut the war in Ukraine has added unprecedented urgency to Sweden and Finland’s membership, and the timeline could be accelerated accordingly.\n\nHow have leaders reacted?\n\nUS President Joe Biden praised the breakthrough with Turkey, saying it sent a clear signal to Russia that NATO was united and growing.\n\nSweden and Finland’s “decision to move away from neutrality and the tradition of neutrality to join the NATO alliance is going to make us stronger and more secure and NATO stronger,” Biden said. “We are sending an unmistakable message in my view… that NATO is strong, united, and the steps we are taking during this summit are going to further augment our collective strength.”\n\nBiden said the two Nordic countries’ accession was a sign Putin’s aims had backfired.\n\n“Putin was looking for the Finlandization of Europe,” he said, referring to the so-called Finlandization dynamic that saw Russia dominant over the foreign policy of its smaller neighbor for decades. “He’s going to get the NATOization of Europe, and that is exactly what he did not want, that’s exactly what needs to be done to guarantee security for Europe. And I think it’s necessary,” Biden said.\n\nThe move was met with delight across the countries that make up NATO’s eastern front, many of which have expressed concern that they could be next in Russia’s crosshairs if it is successful in Ukraine.\n\nEstonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said the step was “significant,” and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda called it “wonderful news.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Europe now at 1938 moment says fmr. NATO deputy commander 17:04 - Source: CNN\n\nWhat does NATO membership entail?\n\nThe reason most countries join NATO is because of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which stipulates that all signatories consider an attack on one member an attack against all.\n\nArticle 5 has been a cornerstone of the alliance since it was founded in 1949 as a counterweight to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe point of the treaty, and Article 5 specifically, was to deter the Soviets from attacking liberal democracies that lacked military strength. Article 5 guarantees that the resources of the whole alliance – including the massive US military – can be used to protect any single member nation, such as smaller countries that would be defenseless without their allies. Iceland, for example, has no standing army.\n\nFormer Swedish leader Carl Bildt told CNN didn’t foresee new big military bases being built in either country if they joined. He said joining the alliance would probably mean more joint military training and planning between Finland, Sweden and the 30 current members. Swedish and Finnish forces could also participate in other NATO operations around the globe, such as those in the Baltic states, where several bases have multinational troops.\n\n“There’s going to be preparations for contingencies as part of deterring any adventures that the Russians might be thinking of,” Bildt said. “The actual change is going to be fairly limited.”\n\nWhy haven’t Finland and Sweden already joined NATO?\n\nWhile other Nordic countries like Norway, Denmark and Iceland were original members of the alliance, Sweden and Finland did not join the pact for historic and geopolitical reasons.\n\nBoth Finland, which declared independence from Russia in 1917 after the Bolshevik revolution, and Sweden adopted neutral foreign policy stances during the Cold War, refusing to align with either the Soviet Union or the United States.\n\nSweden’s policy of neutrality goes back to the early 1800s, when the country steadfastly stayed out of European conflicts. Its King Gustav XIV formally adopted that neutral status in 1834, according to NATO, and Sweden declared a policy of “non-belligerency” during World War II – allowing Nazi troops to pass through its land into Finland, while also accepting Jewish refugees.\n\nSweden opted to maintain its neutral status after the war ended.\n\nFinland’s neutrality has historically proved more difficult, as it shared a long border with an authoritarian superpower.\n\nA Finno-Soviet treaty known as the Agreement of Friendship, signed in 1948 and extended on occasion through the decades, prohibited Finland from joining any military alliance considered hostile to the USSR, or from allowing a Western attack through Finnish territory.\n\nTo keep the peace, Finns adopted an arrangement sometimes called Finlandization, in which leaders acceded to Soviet demands from time to time. The term was coined during the Cold War and has been applied to other countries in which a superpower exerts control over smaller neighboring states.\n\nBoth countries’ balancing acts effectively ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Sweden and Finland joined the European Union together in 1995 and gradually aligned their defense policies with the West, while still avoiding joining NATO outright.\n\nFinnish infantry on skis fighting the Soviets during World War II. Following the war, Finland adopted a neutral stance that remained in place for decades. Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nHow Russia’s invasion changed everything\n\nSweden and Finland have been inching toward the West on security issues since joining the EU shortly after the end of the Cold War. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dramatically accelerated that process, pushing them to pull the trigger on NATO membership.\n\nIf the Kremlin was willing to invade Ukraine – a country with 44 million people, a GDP of about $155 billion, and armed forces of 200,000 active troops – what would stop Putin from invading smaller countries like Finland or Sweden?\n\n“Everything changed when Russia invaded Ukraine,” Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said in April. “People’s mindset in Finland, also in Sweden, changed and shifted very dramatically.”\n\nSince the invasion of Ukraine in February, Finnish public support for joining NATO has leaped from around 30% to nearly 80% in some polls. The majority of Swedes also approve of their country joining the alliance, according to opinion polls there.\n\nHow has Russia reacted?\n\nRussia lambasted the May decision by Finland and Sweden to seek to join the alliance. Its Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said at the time that the move would be a “mistake” with “far-reaching consequences,” according to Russian state news agency TASS.\n\nThat followed similar threats from high-ranking Moscow officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said after the announcement that “NATO expansion does not make the world more stable and secure.” He added that Russia’s reaction would depend on “how far and how close to our borders the military infrastructure will move.”\n\nRussia currently shares about 755 miles of land border with five NATO members, according to the alliance. Finland’s accession would mean that a nation with which Russia shares an 830-mile border would become formally militarily aligned with the United States.\n\nThe addition of Finland and Sweden would also benefit the alliance, which would frustrate Russia. Both are serious military powers, despite their small populations.\n\nBut Putin has so far been more muted in his rhetoric than some of his officials. Last month he said that “Russia has no problems with these states,” adding that the expansion of NATO “does not pose a direct threat to Russia.”\n\n“But the expansion of military infrastructure into this territory will certainly cause our response,” he added at the Collective Security Treaty Organization in Moscow. “We will see what it will be based on the threats that will be created for us.”\n\nWhy is Russia so opposed to NATO?\n\nPutin sees the alliance as a defense against Russia, despite the fact that it spent much of the post-Soviet era focusing on issues like terrorism and peacekeeping.\n\nBefore Putin invaded Ukraine, he made clear his belief that NATO had edged too close to Russia and should be stripped back to its borders of the 1990s, before some countries that either neighbor Russia or were ex-Soviet states joined the military alliance.\n\nUkraine’s desire to join NATO, and its status as a NATO partner – seen as a step on the way to eventual full membership – was one of the numerous grievances Putin cited in an attempt to justify the invasion.\n\nIronically, his invasion has given the alliance new purpose – and increased its strength.\n\nCorrection: This story has been updated to correct the GDP of Ukraine, which was $155.5 billion in 2020, according to the World Bank.", "authors": ["Rob Picheta Joshua Berlinger", "Rob Picheta", "Joshua Berlinger"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/10/12/skanska-construction-industry-giant-has-had-more-than-one-major-misstep/5873526002/", "title": "Skanska, a construction industry giant, has had more than one major ...", "text": "Despite being one of the largest construction companies in the world, Skanska only recently became a household name in Pensacola and for all the wrong reasons.\n\nTwenty three Skanska construction barges carrying cranes, beams and other equipment broke free during Hurricane Sally, sending the vessels careening into shorelines, backyards and bridges across Escambia and Santa Rosa counties. While there were no reported injuries in the incidents, the barges caused damage to the Pensacola Bay Bridge that is expected to put it out of service for at least six months.\n\nLocal residents and officials have been less than pleased with how Skanska has responded to the incident. Beyond a few written statements, Skanska has given no public accounting for why their barges got loose or how they plan to recompense affected parties. State Rep. Alex Andrade put a voice to the local community's concerns, noting during a press conference Wednesday that Skanska had been a \"frustrating partner\" to work with and challenging anyone in the community to \"put a face to Skanska.\"\n\nThe situation has many wondering, who exactly is Skanska anyway?\n\nFounded in Sweden in 1887, Skanska is one of the world’s largest construction and development companies. Its global revenue totaled approximately $18.7 billion in 2019, and its American arm, Skanska USA, boasted $7.6 billion in revenue in 2019.\n\nAccording to the company, Skanska has invested a total of $2.7 billion in commercial and multi-family projects in the states. It has built notable infrastructure and facilities such as the new transportation hub at the World Trade Center; Metlife Stadium, the home of the NFL’s New York Giants and Jets; and hundreds of other airports, hospitals, highways and office buildings across the country.\n\nHowever, Skanska has also been associated with:\n\nFive deaths in an Orlando highway construction project\n\nA $20 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over fraudulent labor practices\n\nBribery scandals in Brazil and Argentina that reportedly crippled Skanska’s ability to do business in South America\n\nA $95,000 settlement with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over allegations that Black subcontractors were subjected to racially-motivated harassment at a job site — including having “urine and feces” thrown at them — and that they were fired when they filed a complaint.\n\nIn fairness, almost any company of Skanska’s size and scope will generate some amount of controversy, lawsuits and dirty laundry. It’s also not hard to demonize any entity by cherry-picking a few missteps from more than 100 years of history.\n\nStill, it’s worth noting that all the issues listed above happened in the past 15 years, many of them during periods when Skanska was working in our proverbial backyards.\n\nSkanska has led three major NWFL bridge replacements projects since 2005\n\nDespite being a multi-national company, the U.S. represents Skanska's single largest market. Headquartered in New York, Skanska USA has offices in 28 cities around the country, more than 9,000 employees and projects in almost all 50 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nSkanska has been a fairly consistent presence in Northwest Florida over the last decade and a half.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, it shepherded the $243 million rebuild of the Escambia Bay Bridge on Interstate 10 after it was destroyed in Hurricane Ivan. The project reportedly came in on time and on budget, and won awards from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Highway Administration and entities.\n\nSkanska also led the almost $120 million rebuild of U.S. 331 over Choctawhatchee Bay in Walton County from 2013 to 2017.\n\nThe firm has been toiling away at the new Pensacola Bay Bridge since 2016. The $400 million bridge replacement has been touted as the largest infrastructure project in the history of Northwest Florida.\n\nSkanska beat out four other firms and joint ventures to seeking to be awarded the project. After receiving the lowest design scores of all firms vying for the project, Skanska ultimately won the bidding process by reporting it could build the bridge for almost $70 million less than the next lowest competitor.\n\nDespite a few hiccups, the project has proceeded mostly apace. Work stopped twice for a few days in 2018 when cracks appeared in the bridge deck, but state officials dismissed them as routine and repairs were made quickly.\n\nDamaged:Three Mile Bridge suffers massive damage after Hurricane Sally topples crane, section missing\n\nSix months:Pensacola Bay Bridge repairs are expected to take six months\n\nIn February 2019, Skanska missed an early completion deadline for the project that would have earned the company a $15 million incentive bonus. The missed deadline wasn't unexpected however, as FDOT officials said it had been set on an “aggressive” timeline. The west span of the new bridge opened to traffic about a month late in September 2019, but at the time it was still anticipated the east span would be completed on schedule in mid-2021.\n\nThen Skanska met Sally.\n\n\"We were as surprised as the rest of the community\"\n\nHurricane Sally made landfall near Gulf Shores, Alabama, as a Category 2 hurricane on Wednesday, Sept. 16. In the lead up to the storm, it had been expected to make landfall much further west near Louisiana.\n\nBrian Stieritz, executive vice president of Skanska USA’s Civil Southeast Region, said via email that Skanska made its preparations based on those projections.\n\n\"We began preparing for expected high winds on the Saturday preceding the storm and continued those preparations on Sunday and Monday,\" Stieritz wrote. \"Equipment and barges were secured, and we were prepared for what was expected at that time, which was tropical storm force winds.\"\n\nStieritz said the storm intensified dramatically and unexpectedly mid-day Monday into Tuesday, resulting in 105 mph sustained hurricane-force winds.\n\n\"Storm surge and sea conditions deteriorated rapidly throughout Tuesday, rendering it impossible to make hurricane-level preparations before the ultimate landfall early Wednesday morning,\" Stieritz wrote. \"We were as surprised as the rest of the community and had little notice to take additional measures without jeopardizing the safety and lives of our workers given the unexpected change in the storm trajectory, speed and intensity.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a barge was jarred loose by the storm and was temporarily lodged beneath the Pensacola Bay Bridge before being removed and secured. A second vessel damaged the bridge Wednesday, knocking chunks out of the structure's surface.\n\nOver the next few days, it was determined that 23 barges had been scattered throughout the area from shorelines in downtown Pensacola to private properties in Milton.\n\nThroughout those crucial first days, Skanska was silent.\n\n'Very frustrating partner':Skanska a 'very frustrating partner' legislators say after Pensacola Bay Bridge meeting\n\n'You don't get a second chance':Local officials put Skanska on notice ahead of Hurricane Delta\n\nA few days later on Sept. 21, Skanska USA released an email address where citizens affected by barges were urged to report their issues. Citizens reported going days without a response. By Sept. 23 Skanska reported it had made contact with the majority of property owners who had barges on their properties or received damage from barges coming ashore.\n\nStieritz wrote in his emailed response Oct. 9 that \"we have personally met with all known affected parties who have reported property damage as a result of our barges and equipment. Also, our insurers and adjusters have made initial assessments and are in the process of reviewing claims.\"\n\nStill, a lingering question for many is if and how Skanska will make good with the many businesses and commuters adversely affected by the bridge's six-month shutdown.\n\nAbout 55,000 vehicles traveled the Pensacola Bay Bridge each day prior to the barge disaster. The fastest alternate route between Pensacola and Gulf Breeze, taking Garcon Point Bridge in Santa Rosa County, adds more than 30 miles to the trip.\n\nMany workers have reported seeing their commute times and fuel costs more than triple. Currently the $5 toll to use the bridge is suspended by order of the governor until Oct. 23, but if the toll is reinstated, workers crossing the bridge twice a day, five days a week, could be spending $200 a month on tolls alone.\n\nMeanwhile, businesses at the foot of the Pensacola Bay bridge are quickly wasting away with no thru-traffic.\n\nLocal and state officials are exploring the idea of creating a ferry service to expedite travel between Pensacola and Gulf Breeze, but it will take approximately$480,000 to build a serviceable dock in Gulf Breeze. Officials are still trying to locate a source for the funds, as well as a long-term solution for the toll costs.\n\nThe prevailing sentiment is that Skanska should be the one footing the bill, but the company has offered little comment and no commitment in terms of solutions.\n\nStieritz simply noted, \"Skanska is focused on working with FDOT as expeditiously as possible to repair and reopen the eastbound bridge and to work with local property owners who may have been impacted by our equipment. In addition, our insurers are reviewing damage and claims to restore those impacted properties.\"\n\nFive workers killed in I-4 Ultimate project\n\nElsewhere in Florida, Skanska's recent track record appears similar to its record locally: largely solid, but overshadowed by a troubled project.\n\nSkanska USA Civil Southeast completed a $91 million project in 2010 to restore the Bridge of Lions in St. Augustine. In 2016, it completed a $225 million joint venture project to rebuild and widen Interstate 275 in the Tampa area. This year, it wrapped up the $92 million replacement of the St. Petersburg Municipal Pier and Pier Approach situated in the heart of downtown St. Petersburg.\n\nWhen the new pier was opened, St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman said, “Skanska has been a tremendous partner for us in St. Petersburg and we will forever be grateful for both their expertise and their dedication to this ambitious, generational project.”\n\nHowever, assessments of a Skanska project in Orlando have been less glowing.\n\nSGL Constructors, a joint venture between Skanska USA, Granite Construction and The Lane Construction Corp, is leading a $2.3 billion renovation project of 21 miles of Interstate 4 in the Orlando area.\n\nSince the I-4 Ultimate project began in 2015, five workers have been killed in an array of construction accidents.\n\nA 34-year-old worker, Marvin Franklin, died when a dump truck backed over him in February 2016. In December of that same year, 59-year-old Curtis Popkey was killed by a piece of falling steel.\n\nIn March 2018, Michael Tolman, 56, was crushed beneath a rebar cage. In February 2019, James Hardy Mills, 59, died when a steel pipe rolled off a trailer and landed on him.\n\nIn September 2019, two workers fell off an aerial lift while setting a concrete girder on a new bridge. One was hospitalized, and the other, Ulises Corrales Ibarra, 37, was killed.\n\nFollowing each death there were brief work shutdowns, along with both internal and external investigations. The U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration only cited SGL in three of the incidents. OSHA records indicate SGL paid $12.471 in penalties related to Franklin's death, $13,269 in penalties in Mills' death and, after negotiating the bill down by half, $26,988 in Corrales Ibarra's death.\n\nIn a statement on the incidents, Skanska wrote, \"we strive for an injury free environment for all of our projects. Providing a safe work environment for our workers is our utmost priority, and we will continue to reinforce a culture of safety and accountability on all our projects. At I-4 Ultimate we have focused heavily on reinforcing our safety policies and procedures. Today, the Skanska-Granite-Lane team has achieved approximately 3.7 million safe hours without a lost-time incident.\"\n\nSkanska has faced battled allegations of bribery, fraud and discrimination\n\nNationally and internationally, many of the Skanska's controversies have revolved as much around its corporate offices as its job sites. Its South American operations in particular were mired in scandal.\n\nIn 2007, a half dozen former Skanska executives were arrested for tax evasion and investigated for bribing public officials in Argentina to secure a gas pipeline contract.\n\nIn 2015, Brazil's Administrative Council for Economic Defense announced that Skanska subsidiary Skanska Brasil was among 21 companies under investigation for bribing officials at a state-run oil company in exchange for exorbitant contracts. Although litigation in the sweeping investigation is ongoing, in 2016 Skanska was barred from accepting public contracts in Brazil for a period of two years. The same year, Skanska fully divested itself of all its Latin American subsidiaries, a process it began in 2014 after many projects in the region underperformed.\n\nSkanska has run afoul of government entities in North America as well.\n\nIn 2009, three Black subcontractors in working on a Memphis-area children's hospital said they were subjected to racism on a daily basis. They claimed they were called racial slurs in person and over walkie-talkies, and frequently found racially offensive graffiti written inside portable toilets. One of the men, Maurice Knox, said someone threw liquid from a portable toilet onto his arms and into his eyes.\n\nU.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charged that Skanska failed to not only properly investigate complaints, but that they terminated the subcontractors after they filed the complaints. In 2015, Skanska settled with the EEOC for $95,000, and settled separately with Knox for an undisclosed amount.\n\nBesides the monetary relief, a three-year consent decree settling the lawsuit enjoined Skanska from subjecting employees to racial harassment or retaliation, and required the company to implement discrimination training and provide annual reports to the EEOC.\n\nIn a statement to the News Journal, Skanska USA wrote, \"The unfortunate incident in Memphis 11 years ago does not define us, nor represents Skanska. We are defined by our core values. We are a company that prides itself on the many accomplishments across our enterprise that demonstrate and reinforce those values such as the investments Skanska has made nation-wide toward disadvantaged, minority-owned, woman-owned and emerging small businesses and combat-disabled, veteran-owned firms as well as the public agencies, organizations and large, private companies that support them.\"\n\nBarge removal:Removals of Skanska barges underway, but no timeline for completion yet\n\nRecovery:Skanska has recovered nine of its 22 runaway barges following Hurricane Sally\n\nNonetheless, in 2011, Skanska USA Civil agreed to a pay $19.6 million to the U.S. Department of Justice to settle criminal allegations of fraud regarding \"disadvantaged\" subcontractors.\n\nOver a span of more than a decade, Skanska was contracted to lead numerous public works projects in the New York metropolitan area, including the World\n\nTrade Center Transportation Hub and an airline terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\nThe contracts came with a requirement that the general contractor make a \"good faith effort\" to subcontract \"Disadvantaged Business Enterprises\" and minority- and woman-owned businesses.\n\nFederal prosecutors alleged that instead of working with legitimate DBEs, Skanska skirted the requirements by funneling its DBE subcontracts to a company called Environmental Energy Associates. EEA reportedly received a fee, and Skanska purportedly completed the work itself or gave it to third parties that did not meet DBE requirements.\n\nAt the time, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said \"the alleged conduct of these defendants deprived legitimate DBEs from receiving millions of dollars in lucrative government contracts.\"\n\nThe DOJ's investigation focused primarily on the owners of EEA, and with the settlement no criminal or civil charges were filed against Skanska. The company reported it complied fully with the government's investigation, and admitted no wrongdoing in the incidents. A statement from the company said \"to avoid a protracted and costly legal battle, Skanska made a difficult business decision to settle the matter.\"\n\nIn announcing the settlement, Skanska said it had \"reinforced\" its DBE compliance program and beefed up best practices such as employee training, third-party audits and internal compliance officers.\n\n\"We expect to remain an active part of the community\"\n\nWhatever its challenges, Skanska has undoubtedly had positive impacts.\n\nApproximately 250 staff and craft workers live in work in the greater Pensacola area, and Skanska has 13 major subcontractors who employ approximately 180 people.\n\n\"In total, these more than 400 individuals are active contributors to the community and local economy each and every day,\" Skanska said in a statement.\n\nThey noted that beyond working here, the Skanska team give back to the community here. In 2019, Skanska employees volunteered more than 10,800 hours in the community. Some of the charitable efforts include feeding the homeless at the Waterfront Rescue Mission, providing barges to Sertoma's annual Fourth of July fireworks show and sponsoring the Florida Engineering Society's annual Math Counts events for local students.\n\nSkanska has also received an array of national accolades for good works in communities around the world.\n\nEngineering News-Record, a top industry publication, ranked Skanska at No. 6 on its 2020 list of Top Green Building Contractors. Skanska was an individual signatory to the Paris Climate Accord, an agreement between more than 170 nations to help fight climate change.\n\nFortune ranked Skanska at No. 17 on its \"Change the World\" list, which charts companies that achieve strong business results while also creating measurable social change and innovating in their field. Skanska was recognized for building 12,000 sustainably designed modular homes across Scandinavia and the United Kingdom to serve working class and lower-income communities.\n\nIn 2019, Skanska landed on Forbes' lists of both America's best employers and the world's best employers. In 2019, it also cracked the list of best employers for diversity, though it dropped off in 2020.\n\nIn a statement on Skanska USA's core principals and values, the company wrote, \"In construction, the most tangible reward for a job well done is the physical end-product, whether it is a tunnel, bridge, roadway, hospital, school, stadium, or high-rise office building. Every employee on our projects helps create these facilities and structures, and for them and their families, they take great pride in knowing what they built matters and that they had a part in contributing to the community in which they live and work.\"\n\nIn his email discussing the Pensacola Bay Bridge, Southeast Region Executive VP Brian Stieritz said Skanska understood how significant the bridge closure is and how its affecting the community. Stieritz said Skanska was marshaling resources from around the country to get the bridge opened as quickly as possible.\n\n\"We have worked in the Florida panhandle for over 15 years, beginning with the replacement of the Escambia Bay Bridge in the wake of Hurricane Ivan, and we expect to remain an active part of the community well beyond the completion of the new Three Mile Bridge,\" Stieritz said.\n\nKevin Robinson can be reached at krobinson4@pnj.com or 850-435-8527.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/12"}]}

After South Korea, Pelosi will travel to Japan.\n\nShe met South Korean National Assembly Speaker Kim Jin Pyo and other senior members of Parliament on Thursday. After that hourlong meeting, Pelosi spoke about the bilateral alliance, forged in blood during the 1950-53 Korean War, and legislative efforts to boost ties, but didn't directly mention her Taiwan visit or the Chinese protests.\n\nPelosi in Taiwan:Pelosi gives strong backing to Taiwan's democracy; US braces for Chinese military drills\n\n\"We also come to say to you that a friendship, (the) relationship that began from urgency and security, many years ago, has become the warmest of friendships,\" Pelosi said in a joint news conference with Kim. \"We want to advance security, economy and governance in an inter-parliamentary way.\"\n\nNeither Pelosi nor Kim took questions from journalists.\n\nKim said he and Pelosi shared concerns about North Korea's increasing nuclear threat. He said the two agreed to support their governments' push for denuclearization and peace on the Korean Peninsula based on both strong deterrence against North Korea and diplomacy.\n\nPelosi and her delegation later spoke by phone with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on the alliance, foreign policy and other issues. Yoon is on vacation this week, but critics accuse him of intentionally shunning a face-to-face meeting with Pelosi in consideration of ties with China, South Korea's biggest trading partner. Yoon's office said it had reviewed national interests and that Yoon's vacation plan had already been set up when, about two weeks ago, Pelosi's side contacted his office about a possible meeting.\n\nDuring the phone conversation, Pelosi and other members of her congressional delegation didn't bring up the Taiwan issue, and Yoon also didn't raise the matter, Yoon's office said.\n\nIn recent years, South Korea has been struggling to strike a balance between the United States and China as their rivalry has deepened. Yoon, a conservative, took office in May with a vow to boost South Korea's military alliance with the United States and take a tougher line on North Korean provocations.\n\nPelosi expected to visit North Korean border\n\nLater Thursday, Pelosi was to visit a border area with North Korea that is jointly controlled by the American-led United Nations Command and North Korea, South Korean officials said. If that visit occurs, Pelosi would be the highest-level American to go to the Joint Security Area since then-President Donald Trump visited in 2019 for a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nYoon said Pelosi's visit to the JSA would demonstrate \"a strong deterrence against North Korea\" by the allies, said Kim Tae-hyo, a deputy presidential national security adviser.\n\nSouth Korean media, citing no sources, later reported that Pelosi visited the JSA but gave no further details. The U.S. Embassy in Seoul, the U.N. Command and the South Korean Defense Ministry couldn't immediately confirm the reports.\n\nSitting inside the 2.5-mile-wide Demilitarized Zone, a buffer created at the end of the Korean War, the JSA is the site of past bloodshed and a venue for numerous talks. U.S. presidents and other top officials have often traveled to the JSA and other border areas to reaffirm their security commitment to South Korea.\n\nAny statement critical of North Korea by Pelosi is certain to draw a furious response. On Wednesday, the North's Foreign Ministry slammed the United States over her Taiwan trip, saying \"the current situation clearly shows that the impudent interference of the U.S. in internal affairs of other countries … (is) the root cause of harassed peace and security in the region.\"\n\nChinese launch military exercises\n\nThe Chinese military exercises launched Thursday and planned to last until Sunday involve its navy, air force and other departments. They include missile strikes on targets in the seas north and south of the island in an echo of the last major Chinese military drills aimed at intimidating Taiwan's leaders and voters in 1995 and 1996.\n\nChina's official Xinhua News Agency said the exercises are joint operations focused on \"blockade, sea target assault, strike on ground targets, and airspace control.\"\n\nTaiwan has put its military on alert and staged civil defense drills, while the U.S. has numerous naval assets in the area. Taiwan's Defense Ministry called the Chinese drills \"unreasonable actions in an attempt to change the status quo, destroy the peace and stability of the region.\"\n\nChina views Taiwan as a breakaway province to be annexed by force if necessary. It considers visits to Taiwan by foreign officials as recognizing its sovereignty.\n\n\"Today the world faces a choice between democracy and autocracy,\" Pelosi said in a short speech during a meeting with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday. \"America's determination to preserve democracy, here in Taiwan and around the world, remains ironclad.\"\n\nThe Biden administration and Pelosi have said the United States remains committed to the \"one-China policy,\" which recognizes Beijing as the sole, legitimate government of China but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. The administration discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from visiting.\n\nPelosi noted in Taiwan that congressional support for Taiwan is bipartisan, and she praised the island's democracy. She stopped short of saying that the U.S would defend Taiwan militarily and emphasized that Congress is \"committed to the security of Taiwan, in order to have Taiwan be able to most effectively defend themselves.\"\n\nTsai said at her meeting with Pelosi that \"facing deliberately heightened military threats, Taiwan will not back down.\"\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Wednesday that U.S. officials \"don't believe we're at the brink now, and there's certainly no reason for anybody to be talking about being at the brink going forward.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations called for calm in the Taiwan Strait, which separates mainland China and Taiwan, and urged the avoidance of any \"provocative action.\" ASEAN foreign ministers, who are meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for a regional forum, said they were concerned the situation could \"destabilize the region and eventually could lead to miscalculation, serious confrontation, open conflicts and unpredictable consequences among major powers.\"\n\nPelosi's focus has always been the same, she said, going back to her 1991 visit to Beijing's Tiananmen Square, when she and other lawmakers unfurled a small banner supporting democracy two years after a bloody military crackdown on protesters at the square. That visit was also about human rights and what she called dangerous technology transfers to \"rogue countries.\"\n\nChina and Taiwan, which split in 1949 after a civil war, have no official relations but multibillion-dollar business ties.\n\nWu reported from Taipei, Taiwan. Associated Press writer David Rising in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/environment/2015/12/10/costs-perus-farming-boom/76605530/", "title": "The costs of Peru's farming boom", "text": "Story by Ian James | Photos and video by Steve Elfers | Dec. 10, 2015\n\nICA, Peru – The fight began early one morning on a sandy dirt road between fields of lima beans, where farmers discovered an excavator machine digging a trench for a water pipe. Infuriated that the pipe would carry water pumped from beneath their farms, a crowd gathered and drove away the crew of workers in a fit of shouts.\n\nThen the protesters set fire to the plastic pipes, leaving them charred and warped on the side of the road.\n\nAs tensions rose in the days after that confrontation, threats flew between the protesters and a group of men sent by the company that was laying the pipes. Some of the men wielded wooden clubs, a machete and a baseball bat. Some of the protesters faced criminal charges.\n\nIn this feud over water, small farmers in the Peruvian town of Ocucaje are trying to challenge what they view as a water grab by a company that exports grapes and asparagus. It’s a type of conflict on the rise in parts of the world where groundwater is overexploited and in decline. And in southern Peru, disputes over water have grown especially bitter as some big farms have bought up wells and started piping water to fields miles away.\n\nDuring the past two decades, an agricultural boom has transformed the Ica Valley, turning a desert bordered by sand dunes into rows of asparagus, grapevines and avocado orchards that supply supermarkets in the United States, Europe and Asia. As more and more water has been pumped from wells, groundwater levels have been falling throughout much of the Ica Valley.\n\nSome wells have gone dry, and farmers with small plots complain the newly arrived mega-farms are using up their water.\n\nLeading the resistance in Ocucaje is Joselyn Guzmán, a 21-year-old college student whose family grows lima beans, corn and cotton on their 25-acre farm.\n\nIf the company manages to lay the pipeline, Joselyn said, it would then be able to send the water miles away to one of its farms. She and others in town fear that could leave their fields dry.“We don’t want them to come and exploit our water,” Joselyn said emphatically as she walked down an unpaved lane, followed by more than a dozen farmers and townspeople.\n\n“That’s what we don’t want, for them to take Ocucaje’s water,” Joselyn said. “We don’t want the water to be taken away because it’s the only livelihood we have.”\n\nThe company, Agrícola La Venta, has applied to the government water authority to start pumping from three inactive wells that it bought from an association of local farmers. Water from the wells would flow through about eight miles of pipes to a farm that produces table grapes for export.\n\nThe company insists its wells wouldn’t have any negative effects for neighboring farmers. But Joselyn and others are worried that allowing the pumping would shrivel their crops, which are flood-irrigated once a year when the Ica River swells with seasonal rains, and are then sustained by the moisture that remains in the soil.\n\nThey’re also alarmed about the idea of letting the company pipe away water because in town they’re already struggling with serious water shortages. Their drinking water comes from a well located beyond some dry hills on the other side of town.\n\nThe taps usually flow just once every 10 days or so, and people collect their rations in buckets and barrels. Those struggles for water, Joselyn said, have magnified people’s outrage about the company’s plans.\n\n“What is it they want? To extend their pipes in order to just wait for the permit and suck out the water and take it to their farm,” Joselyn said. She stood beside the charred sections of water pipe, which were strewn in the sand along the road several hours after the confrontation.\n\nPointing down the road, she exclaimed: “Look there. There are the thugs.”\n\nIn the distance, a group of men stood among the trees near one of the company’s wells. She said they weren’t from Ocucaje and had been brought in by the company to intimidate the protesters. She said the men had insulted and threatened people.\n\n“Every time we want to defend what’s ours, because in reality it’s ours, they always send thugs, always,” Joselyn said.\n\nTownspeople stood around listening to Joselyn. Her mother, María Agustina Trillo, chimed in: “We’re David and they’re Goliath.”\n\nWhen night came, the group retreated to a crossroads in the countryside. They vowed to keep vigil through the night to prevent the digging machines from coming back.\n\nThe next morning, Joselyn said she had heard the company was digging in another spot, and she wanted to go. She led the way, giving directions from the backseat while I drove.\n\nOn the road, we passed the men who had been standing guard at the well. I had tried to talk with them earlier, but one of them had told me “we’re just workers,” and said we could talk with a higher-up later.\n\nNow, as we drove past them, one of the men held a large machete as he walked. Others carried wooden clubs. They were joined by a woman who stood watching us pass, holding a baseball bat at her side.\n\nAs we drove on, a car cut in front of us and stopped, blocking the way. Men climbed out.\n\nThey no longer held their weapons, but they quickly approached the car. As one man walked toward us, he motioned for us to turn back, his hand making a circle in the air.\n\n“What’s going on, buddy?” Joselyn asked as she opened the door and stood to face him.\n\nWithout warning, he threw a punch. The jab hit her squarely in the mouth.\n\nAs she retreated into the car, one of the men cursed. Another yelled: “We’re going to go to your house!” They tapped on the windows.\n\nThe man who had punched her yanked open the front passenger door. “Don’t film!” he barked at us.\n\nAnother man slammed the door shut.\n\n“Back up, back up,” Joselyn said as we began to roll away. In tears, she held a hand to her mouth and phoned her parents. “Mamá! Come over here. They’ve hit me.”\n\nAlong the highway north of Ica, a large sign reads: “The Drilling of New Wells is Prohibited.”\n\nAt the bottom is a phone number and a plea: “Report clandestine drilling.”\n\nThe signs were put up by the National Water Authority to underline a ban on new irrigation wells that has been in effect for many years in this part of Peru.\n\nDespite the ban, new wells have continued to proliferate across the Ica Valley and the neighboring farming areas of Villacurí and Lanchas. In one 2012 report, the government estimated that 74 percent of the 1,760 wells in the area were unlicensed and illegal.\n\nThe declines in the aquifers have been so pronounced, and so potentially devastating to the local economy, that the water authority’s officials say they have been trying to reinforce their policies and get a better handle on the quantities of groundwater being used. This year, the government has for a limited time allowed owners of unpermitted wells to apply for licenses and avoid penalties.\n\nIt’s unclear whether that step will bring greater order to a situation that some describe as a chaotic, unmanaged free-for-all in which the aquifers are being progressively depleted.\n\n“The same thing is happening with water as it is with other aspects of society in Peru. That is, there is no regulation,” said María Teresa Oré, a professor of water resources management at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru in Lima.\n\n“You can see the same thing in traffic. People don’t obey the stoplights. They blow the horn. That’s what is happening,” Oré said. She said regulations have been largely unenforced, licenses for wells have been doled out despite the ban, and heavy pumping has been allowed to continue unchecked.\n\n“If you have the ability to run your pump 24 hours a day, you do it,” she said. “There’s nobody who can tell you no. And that’s what has happened.”\n\nThe depletion of coastal aquifers in Peru mirrors similar crises in places from California to China and India. Year after year, much more water is being drawn from the ground than the rains and snow can naturally replenish.\n\nMeasurements taken by NASA’s GRACE satellites, which have been monitoring changes in water supplies around the world, show losses of water since 2002 across large portions of South America.\n\nThe satellites have measured the impact of severe drought in Brazil and the melting of glaciers in the Andes due to global warming. They have also recorded major declines in parts of Chile and in the vast Guaraní Aquifer, which underlies farming areas and cities in northern Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and southern Brazil.\n\nA team of researchers led by University of California, Irvine professor Jay Famiglietti, who is also senior water scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, has produced maps from the satellite data. The map of South America shows the melting of glaciers in Peru, Bolivia and other Andean countries as patches of yellow, orange and red. But the map doesn’t capture the depletion of smaller coastal aquifers, apparently because of the relatively large-scale nature of the satellite data, which show regional changes at a resolution of roughly 200,000 square kilometers. There are also other limitations with the satellite data, including that the effects of groundwater pumping are lumped together with changes in rainfall, snowpack and surface water.\n\nStill, measurements of water levels in wells show that significant groundwater depletion is occurring in parts of Peru.\n\nThe aquifers in and around the Ica Valley are a case in point. The National Water Authority has estimated that wells are pumping out roughly double the amount of water – in some areas more – than what naturally seeps back into the aquifers from the water that flows down from the Andes.\n\nA USA TODAY/Desert Sun analysis of Peruvian government data found that groundwater levels have been falling in about 60 percent of the wells for which measurements are available in the Ica area. The average drop over the past 12-18 years has been about 16 feet.\n\nIn some areas, the water levels have plunged by more than 80 feet since 2001. In one well in Villacurí, the water table has fallen 128 feet since 1997.\n\nThe drawdown accelerated in the 1990s, when the Peruvian government started a push to attract more investment in export crops.\n\nIn the Ica area, the acreage planted with asparagus has exploded, skyrocketing from 1,015 acres in 1991 to 25,698 acres in 2011. Peru has become the world’s top exporter of fresh asparagus.\n\nOther crops such as grapes and paprika peppers have also proliferated, along with pomegranates, blueberries, snow peas, tangelos and avocados.\n\nMuch more groundwater is pumped from this stretch of the coastal desert than any other part of the country. The National Water Authority has warned in its most recent plan for the Ica area that without action to slow the decline of aquifers, severe water shortages could lead to plunging farm output and job losses within years.\n\nWhile large farms have been investing to keep the water flowing, other farmers in the area are struggling.\n\nIn the community of La Venta, an association of farmers sold two of their wells a decade ago to an asparagus export company because the wells were failing and no longer worked. The group didn’t have the money to fix the wells, and facing debts, they chose to sell.\n\nLooking back on that decision, Mamerto Cuya Villagaray said his 15-member association ended up with a raw deal. The new owners promptly fixed up the wells and ran pipes miles away to its fields.\n\n“These wells run day and night, and we’ve realized that it’s taking away flow from the wells around here,” Cuya said, standing next to the brick pump house, which was topped with an electrified fence. “They’ve caused us harm.”\n\nHe complained that the company quickly obtained permission to run a power line to the well, something he has been unable to secure for his association’s one remaining well, despite years of trying. “Maybe they need to be bribed. I don’t know. I’m waiting for them to give me the license.”\n\nWithout electricity, they must rely on a diesel pump which costs more to run.\n\n“Every year we end up in debt,” Cuya said. The banks have started foreclosing and farmers have been losing their land.\n\nWells all around the area have been declining, he said, and within several years the association’s well could go dry.\n\n“It’s going to make us disappear,” he said. “Without water, what are we going to do?”\n\nAt dawn, Cuya flicked a switch and the diesel motor roared to life, sending water coursing through a canal to flood rows of cotton.\n\nNear the well, he passed an empty field dotted with scraggly weeds. The farmer, he explained, couldn’t afford to pump water to this part of his land. “If you don’t have money, you can’t buy water.”\n\nIn the moments after she was punched, Joselyn held a hand to her mouth and wept. She met her parents and a dozen other townspeople on a dirt road just outside town. They crowded around her to hear the story: how the men surrounded the car, how one of them gave her a kick and punched her.\n\n“We were going through a public place,” she said, anger rising in her voice. “I’m going to continue with this. This gives me even more courage to continue on. I don’t care if my life’s in danger. I don’t care.”\n\nShe went to the doctor and filed a police report that same day in August. Some people from the town kept watch on a dirt road, saying they hoped to prevent Agrícola La Venta’s workers from starting to lay pipe again.\n\nThe company has offices in Lima and Ica, and on its website promotes its efforts to be socially responsible and use water sustainably.\n\nReached by phone, Javier De los Ríos, the company’s manager and director, insisted he wouldn’t approve of any violence by his workers.\n\n“I haven’t hired anyone to attack anyone,” De los Ríos said. He said the people who were trying to block the pipe-laying work had acted aggressively and forced the company to pull its machines out of the area. “Didn’t they go looking for a fight, as we say here?”\n\n“They burned seven of our pipes,” he said. Referring to Joselyn, he added: “The little chubby one, the one that you say they hit… she poured the gasoline to set the pipes on fire.” He said his workers had seen her do it.\n\nAs for the rest of the incident, he said, “I’ve asked my security people and they’ve told me that they haven’t tried to do anything to the journalists who came and that they haven’t seen them.”\n\n“They could be lying to me because they aren’t exactly little angels, and if that were the case, I apologize. But that’s not endorsed by us,” he said.\n\nDe los Ríos defended his company’s plans. He said the company didn’t yet have government permission to use the three wells but was applying for authorization.\n\nAs for his opponents in Ocucaje, he said, “the issue here is political.” He said an “ultra-leftist” group has been stirring up controversy, and he accused a local governor of being an “agitator.”\n\nHe argued that pumping water from the aquifer won’t affect the shallow layer of moist soil that the town’s farmers rely on. Their complaints, he said, are based on false concerns.\n\nHe pointed to one 2014 report by the government water authority showing groundwater levels remain relatively high in Ocucaje – between 7 feet and 23 feet underground – and that the water level has been stable in the area. The report focused on the problem of salt buildup in the soil, which has ruined some farmland, and concluded it’s due to poor drainage and farmers’ reliance on flood irrigation.\n\nIn another report in 2012, government engineers recommended monitoring groundwater levels and allowing Agrícola La Venta to start using three wells.\n\nThe National Water Authority is still evaluating the company’s proposal. Jorge Ganoza Roncal, director of the authority’s regional Chaparra-Chincha branch in Ica, said the agency will determine whether local farmers would be affected by the pumping. While the company has been awaiting approval, dissension has been festering in the town.\n\nDe los Ríos said some people in Ocucaje have faced death threats for siding with his company. He pointed out police detained three men suspected of making those threats after finding ammunition and explosives in their car. According to an account in the Peruvian newspaper Correo, a prosecutor found the evidence insufficient and released them.\n\nJoselyn argued the explosives were planted to discredit those who oppose the company. As for the torched pipes, she said, “it was the people.”\n\n“If we didn’t burn something, they weren’t going to pay attention to us,” she said. “It was a protest.”\n\nShe and four other people are facing criminal charges including endangerment of public safety, causing damages by starting a fire, extortion and rioting.\n\nTheir conflict parallels similar frictions between small-acreage farmers and large industrial farms in places around the world. And it also carries echoes of Peru’s right-versus-left political battles and entrenched tensions between the poor and the wealthy.\n\nCompanies have been buying up wells from old farming cooperatives. Those cooperatives are a legacy of the agrarian reform of the late 1960s and 70s, which was promoted by the leftist military ruler Juan Velasco Alvarado and involved seizures of plantations nationwide.\n\nIn Ocucaje, Agrícola La Venta bought inactive wells from one of those farming cooperatives. The deal was approved in a vote by the cooperative’s members, and while the company obtained legal title to the wells, complaints about the process have persisted among some in Ocucaje.\n\nIn Joselyn’s home, a protest sign hangs on a wall facing the front door. It reads: “DON’T TAKE AWAY THE WATER, WE’RE THIRSTY”\n\nShe said her family’s farm is at risk along with others. If they company is able to pump from the wells, she said, it could end up taking over much of the area and pushing out the small farmers.\n\n“It’s our water,” Joselyn said. “I want people to realize the danger we’re in.”\n\nHer mother, María Agustina, added: “The water belongs to the people – to us, who were born and raised here.”\n\nShe vowed to continue the fight, and tears welled up in her eyes.\n\nWhen strong winds blow in from the Pacific and sweep across the dunes, they stir up huge clouds of sand and dust that blot out the sun. They leave towns covered in an orange-brownish haze.\n\nThese dust storms are a reminder that the desert of southern Peru is among the driest places on the planet. But where water is pumped from beneath the sand, the desert blooms into productive farmland.\n\nAt the end of a road that cuts through wind-rippled sand dunes, Miguel Bentin and his brother Juan Pablo have created an island of green in what was previously barren desert.\n\nWhen they founded their company, Valle y Pampa, in 2008 and started building a fence on the land, some veteran farmers were skeptical they could make farming work among the undulating dunes.\n\n“When we first came, you needed a GPS to know if you were in or outside the property,” Miguel said.\n\nThey had studied the area in the province of Pisco, north of Ica, and had confirmed there was water to be tapped. The Pisco River lies about 4 miles to the north, and they found water underground that appeared to be seeping downhill from the river.\n\nThey have six wells on their 3,700 acres but for now are using only two. On more than 500 acres, they’ve planted asparagus, blueberries and pomegranate trees.\n\nThey also invested in an ultra-efficient irrigation system. Called high-frequency irrigation, the system uses sensors called tensiometers to measure the moisture in the soil and automatically sends out small pulses of water at short intervals throughout the day in order to keep soil moist around the plants’ roots. This technology, while costlier than others, uses much less water than conventional drip irrigation.\n\n“We are as efficient as we can be with the conditions we have,” Miguel said, standing on a dune overlooking the pomegranate trees.\n\nThe Bentin brothers have made efficiency a priority because they want to avoid the water problems that are plaguing other areas. While groundwater levels have been falling elsewhere, Miguel said the levels of their wells have held steady.\n\nThat doesn’t mean technology alone can save Peru’s aquifers, he said, because when farmers can squeeze more earnings from the same amount of water, they can be tempted to vastly expand their acreage and keep overpumping. But he said the technology, combined with other efforts, can certainly help.\n\n“I think we have a green future,” he said, “if we do things right.”\n\nHis brother Juan Pablo led a tour of the farm, where workers were moving along rows cutting sprigs of asparagus. Harvesting the crop is especially labor-intensive because a shoot of asparagus can grow 4 inches in a day. If it isn’t collected quickly enough, the asparagus can grow too large for export and be wasted.\n\n“This crop is coming very well,” Juan Pablo said, driving past a field of bushy plants. While asparagus requires more water than other crops, he said, their farm has managed to grow it with half the water that other farms use.\n\nTo the south in Villacurí, flower farmer Amalia Ghiglino has also adopted similar water-saving technology. She said her company, Florisert, has cut its water use by more than 50 percent by switching from a conventional irrigation system to high-frequency irrigation.\n\nShe made that change after the water from one declining well became too salty and the farm lost more than 60 acres of wax flowers. Ghiglino secured permission to seal the well and drill a new one, and since then has dramatically reduced the farm’s water footprint.\n\n“People are getting more conscious of the importance of maintaining and taking care of our water,” Ghiglino said. She said farmers, after years of overexploiting the aquifer, now realize that without action, “we can just collapse.”\n\nGroundwater levels in the area have fallen from 131 feet to 177 feet deep during the past 15 years, but she said the water table has recently stabilized. And her business has taken off, sending wax flowers that end up in bouquets in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, Korea and Japan.\n\nWorking with the government, she and other farmers in Villacurí have formed an association. They’ve been backing a government plan, the Pisco River-Seco River Basin Water Consolidation Project, which will capture water from the Pisco River and bring it by canal to supply farms and relieve the pressures on the aquifer, which receives very little natural recharge.\n\nThe canal is to be built with both government money and private sector funding, similar to the Chavimochic Special Project, an irrigation system that channels water from the Santa River to Peru’s northern coast and has made possible a major expansion of farmland.\n\nBuilding the canal from the Pisco River would help ease the water problems in the Villacurí area, but the proposal doesn’t make it any less urgent for farmers to reduce their water use, said Micha Hadas, an Israeli irrigation specialist who works with both Ghiglino and the Bentin brothers. He said if more of the big companies that use the bulk of the water shift to similar water-saving systems, they would go a long way toward safeguarding groundwater.\n\n“It’s definitely in danger due to overexploitation, due to wasting of water, due to irrigating in a less efficient and irresponsible way,” Hadas said.\n\nHe said if the authorities would simply enforce the rules that already exist, that could help address the depletion problem. “We take the water, and everybody takes what they can. It’s without control and without discipline.”\n\n“We’re damaging the aquifer in an almost irreversible way,” Hadas said. “The aquifer is falling and the water is growing saltier and saltier. In very little time, that could cause an economic disaster.”\n\nIn Ica, mototaxis swarm around the entrance of the shopping mall, where the bustling crowd shows how the farming boom has rippled through the economy.\n\nA billboard across the street advertises a new housing development, apparently for the wealthier set, with an attractive pledge: “A home with water 24 hours a day.”\n\nMany people in the area would jump at the chance to have that. In rural towns south of Ica, residents say their taps have been running once or twice a week, usually for just a couple of hours.\n\nFarmworker Marta Bellido, who was at work harvesting asparagus, said the water often comes on while she and her husband are at work. When they can’t be there, they ask neighbors to collect water for them in jugs and barrels.\n\n“We get what we can, and sometimes there’s none,” Bellido said after emptying a load of asparagus into a crate.\n\n“The big farms have water. We on the other hand don’t,” she said. “They have it because they have money to bring groundwater.”\n\nShe said she wishes her family could receive at least an hour of water a day.\n\nMany Peruvians lack access to running water, both in rural areas and in growing urban slums.\n\nIn the slums that blanket the hills around Lima, tanker trucks rumble down dirt roads selling water. On some of the hilltops stand large rectangular nets that capture droplets of water from the fog that rolls in from the ocean. Water trickles from the netting and is collected to be used in community gardens.\n\nIn the Ica Valley, public water agencies run the taps sporadically. Jesus Natividad Neyra said she pays 8 soles – or about $2.50 – a month for water that comes twice a week.\n\n“We have to fill up quickly because it’s only two hours that they give us,” Neyra said. She had just finished filling her plastic barrels with a hose and was scrubbing laundry in a tub on her front porch. When the hose stopped flowing, she said: “They should give us better service.”\n\nOn another street, farmer Flor Gamboa said that on top of the dismal water service, less has been flowing to her field of asparagus from a well operated by the local farming cooperative. She said in the past there was plenty of water, but that changed when Chilean-owned businesses put in large farms nearby.\n\n“Where is there going to be enough water? They dig deeper. They take the entire flow. Nothing is left here, just very little water,” Gamboa said. “The big farms hurt us, the small farmers. They harm us a lot.”\n\nShe said some of her neighbors have stopped farming due to the lack of water, and at some point the only option may be to go work for a big farm. “What do they care? They only care about shipping off their crops.”\n\nHuman rights activist Jorge Aparcana said agro-export companies have been aggressively buying up wells, pumping heavily, and leaving small farmers with dry wells.\n\n“That’s injustice and exclusion,” said Aparcana, a leader of the Ica Human Rights Commission. “I agree with having investment, but it can’t be done in whatever way without any sort of control.”\n\nAparcana said it’s nothing short of a “crime” to grow asparagus in the desert because it’s such a thirsty crop. He argued there ought to be gradual efforts to outlaw water-guzzling crops in the area. And even though the big farms have brought jobs, he said, tensions have grown as small farmers have been pushed aside.\n\n“My fear,” he said, “is that it could be a breeding ground for more violence.”\n\nConflicts have surfaced before, such as in 2009, when protesters tried to block a company from laying pipes to carry water from wells to farmland miles away. Police in anti-riot gear were called out and used tear gas to disperse the crowd. The company eventually was able to complete its project.\n\nDavid Bayer, an American activist who has lived in Peru for decades and who joined farmers in those protests, said he’s concerned about the potential for violence and hopes conflicts can be avoided. If supplies of drinking water run out, he said, anger could spill over.\n\nBayer is a former USAID official who first came to Ica as a Peace Corps volunteer in the 1960s, and he has studied and written about the problem of groundwater overdraft in Ica. He said one agro-exporter who moved away to another area had acknowledged being concerned about possible violence. Bayer said the man told him he feared that if townspeople run out of water, they could storm his farm and burn it down.\n\n“It’s a very serious situation,” Bayer said, “and the most important thing is we have no emergency plan.”\n\nOthers argue the agro-exporters unfairly get a bad rap. They say that the big farms use water much more efficiently than small farms, and that towns have faulty water service due to a lack of government investments in infrastructure.\n\n“I’ve had problems with communities that think by putting a well in an area, we’re affecting water they never had,” said Jorge Vargas Corbacho, who grows avocados, grapes and citrus on about 1,200 acres. “There’s a lot of ideology in this issue because there are people who complain, rightly, that they don’t have water, but the government doesn’t have a presence in some communities, and the one they complain to is the business next-door or the biggest farmer, which doesn’t replace the government.”\n\nHe acknowledged that agriculture is using much of the water and it’s leading to declining groundwater levels. But he said if a drinking water well is drilled deep enough and in the right place, it will gush water. He offered an analogy: “The government has to build a sidewalk for people to walk on.”\n\nDriving out the gates of his farm, Vargas Corbacho continued to a neighborhood where he said the city government had paid a high price to drill a well – and in an area where there’s little water to pump. Only small quantities have been flowing from the well, leaving people coping with a shortage.\n\n“Close to the hills is the worst part, and they drilled it right over there,” he said, pointing to the pump house. “A bad place to look for water.”\n\nIn the middle of the desert, a lagoon shimmers.\n\nThe oasis of Huacachina has long been naturally fed by groundwater seeping into a low spot between mountainous sand dunes. The views of silvery water and palm trees against the sand have made it a popular destination. People come to explore the waterfront and take tours on dune buggies that go racing over the hills of sand.\n\nThe lagoon that visitors see isn’t entirely natural anymore. Its water level has been falling. In order to maintain it, the community has been periodically pumping water into the lagoon to offset the declines.\n\nWater was added twice during the past year because the shores were receding, said Luis Oliva Fernandez Prada, a former mayor of Ica. “They regained one meter.”\n\nFernandez Prada said he also refilled the lagoon once during his tenure as mayor a decade ago. He suspects less water from the Ica River is recharging the aquifer because the city has grown, covering the ground with concrete and homes in areas where water used to seep into farmland.\n\nThe city’s name, Ica, means “springs” in the indigenous Quechua language. A century ago, water gushed from the ground in several spots around the city, including in its central plaza. Those springs have long since disappeared, along with other wetlands similar to Huacachina.\n\nDespite the decline in the aquifer, Fernandez Prada is optimistic. He said farms are making water-saving changes, the government is improving its oversight by making sure wells are licensed and metered, and projects are being drawn up to bring more water from the Andes to the desert.\n\n“This place has generated jobs, money for the country, food for the world,” Fernandez Prada said. “Ica is destined to be the California of Peru in accelerated economic growth.”\n\nThe future of this farming region, though, depends on a supply of groundwater that continues to shrink. And the country also faces challenges as Andean glaciers melt and rainfall patterns shift due to global warming.\n\nGroundwater could help the country through dry times, but there will be less to draw on if Ica and other regions continue to draw down their reserves.\n\nIn a detailed 2010 report, researchers with the organizations Progressio, Water Witness International and the Peruvian Center for Social Studies concluded that unsustainable water use in the Ica Valley has had a negative impact on small and medium-sized farms and has contributed to social conflicts.\n\n\"Unless action is taken, the overexploitation of the aquifer will eventually exhaust the water resources which the city of Ica and its population of over a third of a million people depend on,\" the researchers said in the report. \"In a perverse process of self-destruction, all but the most powerful farmers will be forced out as the resource becomes scarcer and more expensive to access.\"\n\nPeru passed a water law in 2009 that established measures to regulate groundwater. Since then, organizations made up of groundwater users have been formed. But in practice, government controls remain weak and rules often go unenforced.\n\nThe government has recognized the proliferation of unlicensed wells as a problem and is trying to solve it by permitting well owners in the Ica area to apply for licenses this year, said Ganoza, director of the National Water Authority’s regional branch. Anyone caught drilling a new well without permission in 2015 or thereafter, he said, could face criminal charges.\n\nGanoza said regulators are also working to gather better information about how much groundwater is actually being pumped.\n\nWhen the agency studies whether to grant permission for a well, officials look at whether that pumping would affect other adjacent wells. Ganoza said he has assured people in Ocucaje that the agency will carefully evaluate whether the proposed pumping by the company would be detrimental to their farms. And if there are harmful effects, he said, the water authority would not grant permission.\n\nWater managers in Ica have also been backing proposals to capture more water in the Andes and route it to the Ica River to alleviate the stresses on the aquifer.\n\nThere have long been tensions over water between Ica’s farm owners and people in the neighboring Andean region of Huancavelica, where impoverished communities that rely on herding llamas and alpacas have opposed the diversion of water to the coast.\n\nGovernment officials from both regions have recently been in talks backed by the Peruvian government aimed at smoothing over those tensions. They’ve been discussing a proposal to build a canal that would bring water from the Pampas River, which flows on the other side of the Andean divide toward the Amazon, to the Ica River.\n\nBringing more water from the highlands is critical in order to avoid a “collapse” in the Ica area, said Alfredo Sotil, manager of the Ica Valley Groundwater Users Board, who recently attended a meeting in Lima where officials of the two regions discussed plans for a watershed-level council.\n\nSotil’s association has already been carrying out projects to recharge the aquifer using water from the Ica River. He said those efforts seem to be paying off. Up until 2013, the aquifer was declining by an average of about 1.5 meters per year. But last year, after the organization routed more water to areas where it could seep into the aquifer, he said, the average annual decline slowed to about 1 meter.\n\n“If it’s slowing down the decline, we know that some of what we’re doing is working,” Sotil said. He said the area can still capture more of the water that flows down the Ica River, and that can help farms use their wells less.\n\n“The aquifer could end up being in balance at some point,” he said. “That’s the idea.”\n\nSlowing the depletion will be a monumental challenge, especially because water levels have been dropping so rapidly.\n\nPeruvians could look to neighboring Chile for examples of ways to manage their dwindling coastal desert aquifers. In Chile’s Copiapó Valley, in the Atacama Desert, wells have gone dry and some farmland has been abandoned as groundwater levels have dropped. To try to address the problem, the association of groundwater users in Copiapó is actively monitoring water levels in wells, promoting water-saving irrigation and working on a proposal that would require cutbacks in water use.\n\nAs Peruvians confront growing strains on water supplies, they could also look to the country’s ancient waterworks for an example of collective ingenuity that carried a sustained flow of water to the coastal desert year after year.\n\nCenturies ago, people built the Aqueducts of Cantalloc – dozens of subterranean water collection tunnels that capture groundwater from sources at the base of the mountains and carry the water downhill to farmland in the desert. Archaeologists say this engineering feat was the work of the Nazca people, the same culture that left the mysterious Nazca Lines in the desert.\n\nThey built distinctive spiral-shaped openings above the canals called puquios.\n\nSome of the aqueducts have been cleaned and maintained by groups of farmers, and they still carry water to fields of potatoes and other crops. Standing above a puquio, it’s still possible to see water flowing down through a passage that was built perhaps 1,500 years ago.\n\nIn Peru today, the question is whether people will develop analogous innovations to use water more sustainably – and whether they will act before many more wells dry up.\n\nUSA TODAY Investigative Reporter Steve Reilly contributed to this report.\n\nThis special report was produced with a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\n.​", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/10"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/china/955728/all-countries-china-territory-disputes", "title": "All the countries in which China claims territory | The Week UK", "text": "Fears that China could launch an invasion of Taiwan have dominated headlines for months, fuelled by a series of incendiary interventions by senior officials in Beijing.\n\nConcerns that China could order a strike on the self-ruling island are so high that the US has passed a $100m support contract aimed at “boosting the island’s missile defence systems” to maintain “political stability” and “military balance” in the region, Al Jazeera said.\n\nThe decision followed a warning by China’s ambassador to the US that the countries could descend into “military conflict” over the independence of the government in Taipei. But while Taiwan has proved to be the most troubling flashpoint in recent months, there are 16 other countries embroiled in territorial disputes with China.\n\nMaritime The Philippines In November, Chinese vessels “blocked and used water cannons” on two Philippine supply boats that were “heading to a disputed shoal occupied by Filipino marines in the South China Sea”, The Guardian reported. The hostility, which triggered “an angry protest from Manila”, was the latest flare-up in the South China Sea, with China claiming “virtually the entire waterway” and transforming “seven disputed shoals into missile-protected island bases”. Manila is “facing a deadlock in a dispute it cannot resolve alone”, the International Crisis Group warned. And while “armed conflict directly involving the Philippines is unlikely”, there remains a “growing potential for incidents at sea to escalate”.\n\nMaritime Vietnam In another South China Sea dispute, China and Vietnam have long faced “​​maritime territorial disputes over the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands”, said the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a US-based think tank. Despite efforts to resolve the issue through diplomacy, breakthroughs have proven “elusive”. “These disputes remain the main point of contention between Vietnam and China, and in many respects, they constitute a main driver of Vietnam’s foreign policy.”\n\nMaritime Japan China and Japan have repeatedly clashed over a group of uninhabited islands called the Senkaku Islands in Tokyo, the Diaoyu Islands in Beijing and the Tiaoyutai Islands in Taiwan. Beijing began raising the question of sovereignty over the islands in the the 1970s when evidence of oil reserves in the region surfaced. The area is also close to key shipping lanes and rich fishing grounds. For some years, Beijing has “been aggravating tensions by increasing the presence of China Coast Guard vessels in the contiguous zone of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands”, The Diplomat said. Their presence is “irritating and appears threatening to Japan”, but “foreign ships sailing within the contiguous zone is not a violation of international law”.\n\nLand Nepal Just this week China was accused of encroaching on Nepal’s territory along the two countries’ shared border. According to the BBC, a leaked government report is “the first time there have been official claims from Nepal of Chinese interference in its territory”. The document claimed China has been trespassing in the district of Humla, in the far west of Nepal. The Chinese embassy in Kathmandu denies any encroachment. It is “unclear why the report has not yet been published by the Nepalese government”, the BBC said. “But it has over recent years improved ties with China to counterbalance its long-standing relationship with India, its giant neighbour to the south.”\n\nLand Bhutan China shares a contiguous border of 292 miles with Bhutan and territorial disputes have been a source of potential conflict. Since the 1980s, the two governments have conducted regular talks on border and security issues aimed at reducing tensions. Last month Voice of America reported that Beijing had begun “construction of villages and settlements along its Himalayan borders”. Bhutan “has not responded to reports of the Chinese settlements along its border”.\n\nLand India One of the disputes that has the potential to trigger a huge global fallout is China’s ongoing disagreement with India over its land border in the Himalayas. “Thanks in part to slapdash colonial cartography, the boundary between India and China is undefined,” The Economist said. The countries fought a “bloody border war in 1962, ending in a ceasefire that established the Line of Actual Control”, Newsweek added. In June 2020, soldiers clashed in hand-to-hand combat as a border dispute threatened the uneasy truce between the world’s most populous nations. The clashes were the first to result in fatalities in the border area in at least 45 years.\n\nMaritime Indonesia Another South China Sea dispute. China has repeatedly demanded that Indonesia “halt an oil and natural gas” project in the region, Nikkei Asia said, claiming that the efforts to extract natural resources are an “infringement on its territorial waters”. Drilling began last year “near the Natuna islands within Indonesia’s exclusive economic zone”, the site added. The area “overlaps China’s expansive ‘nine-dash line’ territorial claim covering much of the sea”.\n\nMaritime Malaysia In June last year, Malaysia summoned China’s ambassador after 16 military aircraft flew over disputed waters off its eastern state of Sarawak.

Russian authorities said she carried vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage; Griner said during the trial that took place in Khmiki, Russia, that she accidentally packed them in haste and pleaded guilty \"without intent.\" The court, however, claimed she committed the crime deliberately.\n\n“The hard work that my parents instilled in me is what brought me to play for the best EuroLeague and Russian team here in Ekaterinburg,” Griner said Thursday from a cage inside the courtroom. “I want to apologize to my teammates, the club, the fans and the city of (Ekaterinburg for) the mistake that I made and the embarrassment I brought.\n\n“This is my second home.

The state’s answer to the first abortion rights ballot question since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade sent shockwaves across the nation’s political landscape, signaling the issue may be a greater motivator to vote in the midterm elections than previously thought.\n\nJarrolyn Quinones, 65, a paralegal and Democrat, was \"stunned\" by the vote in her largely conservative home state, she told USA TODAY late Wednesday morning.\n\nThe results taught her something: The abortion issue cuts through partisan politics. Women who feel the same way she does about abortion rights might not have signs in their yard or be from the same political party, but they were silently aligned at the ballot box.\n\n\"Women understand their rights are being taken away ... and if they don't act, we will be back in the 1950s,\" Quinones said. \"Regardless if women have different political beliefs or different religious beliefs, they agree they want the right to make their own choices.\"\n\nIf Kansas’ turnout is replicated nationwide in November, it would benefit Democrats, who count on the Roe reversal to improve their odds this fall as the party faces headwinds that include high consumer prices, President Joe Biden's low approval numbers and a historical record that shows midterms typically go against the sitting president's party.\n\nThe monkeypox outbreak that has infected more than 6,600 people in the United States is officially a public health emergency, the Biden administration declared Thursday. --Ella & Amy", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/03/07/us-moves-parts-controversial-missile-defense-s-korea/98846080/", "title": "U.S. moves parts of controversial missile defense to S. Korea", "text": "KIM TONG-HYUNG\n\nAssociated Press\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. missile launchers and other equipment needed to set up a controversial missile defense system have arrived in South Korea, the U.S. and South Korean militaries said Tuesday, a day after North Korea test-fired four ballistic missiles into the ocean near Japan.\n\nThe plans to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, within this year have angered not only North Korea, but also China and Russia, which see the system's powerful radars as a security threat.\n\nChina responded quickly, saying it will take \"necessary measures\" to protect itself and warning that the U.S. and South Korea should be prepared to bear the consequences.\n\nWashington and Seoul say the system is defensive and not meant to be a threat to Beijing or Moscow. The U.S. military said THAAD can intercept and destroy short and medium-range ballistic missiles during the last part of their flights.\n\nRelated:: North Korea, Malaysia bar each other's citizens from leaving\n\n\"Continued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday's launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to South Korea,\" Adm. Harry Harris, head of the U.S. Pacific Command, said in a statement.\n\nSome South Korean liberal presidential candidates have said that the security benefits of having THAAD would be curtailed by worsened relations with neighbors China and Russia.\n\n\"China firmly opposes the deployment of THAAD,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing Tuesday. \"We will definitely be taking necessary measures to safeguard our own security interest. All consequences entailed from that will be borne by the U.S. and (South Korea). We once again strongly urge the relevant sides to stop the process of deployment and refrain from going further down that wrong path.\"\n\nChina's condemnation of South Korean plans to deploy THAAD has triggered protests against a South Korean hypermarket chain, Lotte Mart, whose parent company agreed to provide one of its golf courses in southern South Korea as the site of THAAD. Visits by South Korean film stars and singers have been canceled and shipments of South Korean cosmetics have been held up at customs.\n\nExperts say China could also send Chinese coast guard ships to escort fishing boats into waters claimed by South Korea, dispatch military aircraft and ships into South Korean air and sea space, and suggest that it might do less to restrain North Korea from provocative behavior.\n\nRussia has supported China's opposition to the system. Militarily, Russia and China could deploy more missiles, especially those with maneuverable warheads to overwhelm THAAD, along with the use of decoys and attempts to jam the system, analysts say.\n\nOn Tuesday, China's Global Times, an outspoken nationalist tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's flagship People's Daily, criticized North Korea over its missile tests.\n\n\"By firing four missiles at once this time, the military confrontation between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington escalates a notch,\" the newspaper said. \"Noticeably, the Chinese public is angry that Pyongyang's nuclear program has provided an excuse for Seoul to deploy THAAD.\"\n\nAn official from South Korea's Defense Ministry, who didn't want to be named, citing office rules, said the equipment that arrived in South Korea included launchers, but didn't confirm how many.\n\nWhile South Korean media speculate that the THAAD deployment could be completed as early as April, the ministry official couldn't confirm those reports. The official said the plan was to have the system operational as soon as possible.\n\nOn Monday, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles in an apparent protest against ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal. The missiles flew about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) on average, three of them landing in waters that Japan claims as its exclusive economic zone, according to South Korean and Japanese officials.\n\nThe North's state media on Tuesday said leader Kim Jong Un supervised a ballistic rocket launching drill, a likely reference to the four launches reported by Seoul and Tokyo. Involved in the drills were artillery units tasked with striking \"U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in Japan,\" according to the Korean Central News Agency.\n\nThere was pride and defiance among the elite citizens who live in North Korea's showcase capital, Pyongyang.\n\n\"If the U.S. imperialists and their South Korean puppets shoot even just one spark into our sovereign territory, we will completely destroy those aggressors, without any mercy, with our invincible Hwasong artillery, which are loaded with nuclear warheads,\" Sim Chol Su, echoing the propaganda often found in state media, told The Associated Press.\n\nNorth Korea uses \"Hwasong\" to describe a broad range of its ballistic missiles, including Scuds and the mid-range missiles that are referred to as Rodong and Musudan by outside analysts.\n\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the missiles fired by the North were believed to be \"improved versions\" of Scud missiles. South Korean experts say North Korea's extended-range Scuds and mid-range Rodong missiles are capable of hitting Japan, including U.S. military bases in Okinawa.\n\nKim \"ordered the KPA (Korean People's Army) Strategic Force to keep highly alert as required by the grim situation in which an actual war may break out anytime,\" a KCNA dispatch said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2021/07/26/ou-sooners-sec-move-dont-be-angry-22-million-stake/8090735002/", "title": "Don't be angry with OU over the SEC move, with $22 million at stake", "text": "When news surfaced that OU and Texas were considering leaving the Big 12 for the Southeastern Conference, anyone with a trace of allegiance to the state had to be pained. Especially when we realized the considering was long since finished.\n\nWhat would such a move mean for OSU? What would such a move mean for the Big 12? What would such a move mean for Kansas State and Iowa State and Kansas, schools that have been competing with OU for literally 100 years?\n\nA variety of opinions settle on this theory. The remaining Big 12 schools are angry with the Longhorns and disappointed in the Sooners.\n\nI never split such sentiments. Texas always got too much blame for conference acrimony, OU never enough. Both are big dogs that exerted their will on the Big 12. If you’re going to be angry, be angry at both.\n\nBut don’t be angry.\n\nAll the emotion of OU’s exit went away when the numbers started percolating. The Sooners and Longhorns figure to make around $60 million per year with SEC payouts, a boost of $22 million over the last full-year Big 12 payout.\n\nTramel:OU's and Texas' move to the SEC spurred by lost faith in the Big 12\n\nYou make $20 million or so more per year, and there’s no decision to be made.\n\nWho among us wouldn’t move to the other side of town, if offered a 50% raise?\n\nThe Monday ScissorTales finish up our series on repicking the NBA Draft and check in on Bill Hancock’s Olympic adventure.

It’s every man for himself.\n\nCarlson:Why the Bedlam rivalry wouldn't have to end if OU, OSU Big 12 affiliation does\n\nAnd the Big 12 knows that.\n\nAfter presidents for the eight remaining schools met last week, The Athletic reported last week that “the eight remaining schools pledged on their call last night to stay together, but they also are making contingency plans … the process is in play among remaining Big 12 members to assess their potential value to other conferences.”\n\nAnd of course that’s the plan. There could be no other plan. OSU and Baylor and Iowa State and Kansas and West Virginia and Texas Christian and Kansas State and Texas Tech have to look out for themselves.\n\nAnd that’s what OU did.\n\n“It’s not our job to support those schools,” said an OU source.\n\nNot when the difference to OU is $20 million or more.\n\nRepicking the 2019 NBA Draft\n\nWe finish our series of repicking the NBA Drafts of the 21st century. The 2019 draft is the least relative to this endeavor, because who the heck knows how any of these players will turn out?\n\nOK, Zion Williamson is going to turn out fine. But will Ja Morant become Russell Westbrook or Tyreke Evans? Will R.J. Barrett be Donovan Mitchell or Brandon Jennings?\n\nTwo seasons isn’t enough to make too many declarations, including the quality of the draft. I ranked the 15 best players from that draft so far, using basketball-reference.com metrics and my own judgment. The top five were selected 1-2-3-20-12.\n\nThat makes sense. The highest picks usually get the quickest chances. We’ll see if the quality and the selections remain in step.\n\nHere are the top 15:\n\n1. Zion Williamson (first to the Pelicans): Zion has missed 53 games over two seasons because of injury. Other than that, he’s been everything his massive reputation built him up to be, including average 25.7 points a game.\n\n2. Ja Morant (second to the Grizzlies): A superstar in the making, averaging 18.4 points and 7.3 assists as the Memphis cornerstone point guard.\n\n3. R.J. Barrett (third to the Knicks): Played much better as an NBA sophomore, shooting 40 percent from 3-point range while averaging 17.6 points.\n\n4. Matisse Thybulle (20th to the 76ers, via trade): Second-team all-NBA defense in 2020-21, a huge achievement for a second-year player. Has averaged only 4.3 points a game, but his production went up in the 2021 playoffs.\n\n5. P.J. Washington (12th to the Hornets): Underrated forward who has averaged 12.6 points and 6.0 rebounds a game while shooting 38.1 percent from 3-point range and playing solid defense.\n\n6. Brandon Clarke (21st to the Grizzlies, via trade): An immediate contributor in Memphis who always will be linked with OKC’s Darius Bazley. The Thunder drafted Clarke then immediately traded him for the just-drafted Bazley. Clarke was the better player instantly. But Clarke turns 25 in September. Bazley turned 21 last month. Bazley’s numbers went way up his second year (13.7 points, 7.2 rebounds), while Clarke’s went down (10.3, 5.6). Bazley’s production was a matter of playing time and volume; his stock probably fell his second year. If this list was based on the future, Bazley would be listed higher.\n\n7. Darius Garland (fifth to the Cavaliers): Has made 109 starts in two years and averaged 14.8 points while shooting 37.4% from deep. But the advanced metrics are not a fan.\n\n8. Coby White (seventh to the Bulls): Made 54 starts for Chicago last season and averaged 15.1 points and 4.8 assists per game. But do the Bulls want him as their point guard of the future?\n\n9. Rui Hachimura (ninth to the Wizards): Productive in Washington, averaging 13.7 points and 5.8 rebounds in two seasons, during which he’s started all 105 games of his career.\n\n10. Tyler Herro (13th to the Heat): A hero on Miami’s run to the 2020 NBA Finals, Herro has averaged 14.3 points over his 109 NBA games. But his defense can be a problem.\n\n11. Cameron Johnson (11th to the Suns, via trade): A key cog in Phoenix’s run to the NBA Finals, averaging in the playoffs 8.2 points and shooting 44.6% on 3-pointers. But his regular seasons have been about the same, 9.2 points, but with 36.7% 3-point shooting.\n\n12. Keldon Johnson (29th to the Spurs): One of San Antonio’s seemingly-endless supply of wings who can do all kinds of things. Johnson broke out in 2020-21, averaging 12.8 points and 6.0 rebounds, though with just 33.3% 3-point shooting.\n\n13. DeAndre Hunter (fourth to the Hawks, via trade): Injuries have limited Hunter, but he’s been an excellent wing defender while averaging 13.0 points over 86 games.\n\n14. Terance Mann (48th to the Clippers): Wouldn’t be on the list without his playoff breakout. Mann has averaged 5.3 points over 108 NBA games. Then Mann averaged 7.6 points for the Clippers in the 2021 playoffs and shot 43.2 percent from 3-point range, including a 39-point game to close out the Jazz in the West semifinals.\n\n15. Cam Reddish (10th to the Hawks): Reddish is a good example of why it’s too early to tell about this draft. The Hawk wing, picked 10th overall, has been mostly hurt but returned during the Eastern Conference finals and played well.\n\nOther notables from the 2019 draft:\n\n► Another warning sign — don't get too caught up on players getting an extensive run with a bad team. Eric Paschall, picked 41st overall, was productive as a rookie, but he got a bunch of minutes on a bad team.\n\n► Kevin Porter Jr., 30th overall to the Cavaliers via trade, had a 50-point game for Houston in April against Milwaukee. But that can happen with opportunity.\n\n► Everyone is high on Talen Horton-Tucker of Iowa State, taken 46th overall, but sometimes Lakers can be overrated. Horton-Tucker has averaged 8.7 points and 2.5 rebounds in 71 career games.\n\n► It’s too early to declare anyone a bust, but Texas Tech’s Jarrett Culver, picked sixth, has done little in two Minnesota seasons. Another Big 12 player, center Jaxson Hayes of Texas, has been promising in New Orleans.\n\nMailbag: Fixing the Big 12\n\nReaders are consumed with ways to salvage the Big 12 – or ways that would have kept the dissolution from happening in the first place:\n\nMark: “Here are some miscellaneous ramblings that will mostly just demonstrate my naivete about big time college football. It is fairly obvious the Big 12 has pretty much failed all of its members, not just OU and Texas. They obviously should have rebuilt to 12 teams years ago, and with the best schools they could possibly attract. It is probably too late to save the conference already. However, here are a couple of ideas that would require the conference to basically admit it is going to be stuck at a secondary level, at least for now. Texas A&M just might be willing to come back to the Big 12 if it means they can escape Texas. If Texas A&M were willing to return, perhaps Missouri, who hasn't had a lot of fun in the SEC, might also be willing to come back. Also, without Texas lording it over everybody, in spite of their current program quality, maybe Nebraska would reconsider its membership in the Big Ten. Then one more decent school brings us back to 12 members. If we can go looking, seriously looking, there may be some schools ready to make us 14 or more; Louisville (whom we should have reached out to last time we lost schools), Cincinnati, Arkansas (probably not interested, but why not check) and Boise State to name a few. Like I said, I am probably showing how naive I am about college football, but maybe?”\n\nTramel: Mark, you’re right. You are naive. Yes, this is all wishful thinking.\n\nFirst of all, the Big 12 had no options to rebuild to 12 members, without crippling the value of its television contract. No available prospect would have meant as much television money to the conference as it was losing with Nebraska (and eventually A&M). The networks sacrificed to keep the Big 12 stable, paying the same rate for TCU and West Virginia as it was for A&M and Missouri. It wasn’t going to add a similar bump for Louisville and Cincinnati, or Boise State and Brigham Young, or Houston and Central Florida.\n\nAdding two more mouths to feed would have lessened the per-school payout. That would have made the gap between the Big 12 and the SEC/Big Ten even greater. OU and Texas would have been looking to get out even sooner.\n\nAs for A&M or Nebraska or anyone else coming back to the Big 12, there's no way. Who functions that way? Come join us for less money (a lot less) and less prestige (a lot less) and less certainty (a lot less).\n\nNo school is going to take a massive cut in television money, with no great promise of it rising. Businesses don’t do that. People don’t do that. You might take a risk, but only with a big reward. The Big 12 offers no big reward.\n\nThis is a market-driven problem.\n\nBill Hancock’s Olympic adventure\n\nAnother Olympiad has arrived, and you know what that means – daily dispatches from everyone’s favorite Oklahoman, Bill Hancock.\n\nThe Hobart native who has carved a career as director of college sports’ biggest events – the Final Four for decades, now the College Football Playoff since its 2014 inception – is a long-time Olympic volunteer, going back to the 1984 (summer) and 2006 (winter) games.\n\nHancock writes a daily letter to family and friends, giving them an inside look at Olympic life. He and his wife, Nicki, are in Tokyo:\n\n“July 23, Friday: (Please excuse the typos and lousy writing in this friendly message to family members. They are sweethearts and so will not object to sloppiness. Must hurry, because there is much Olympics to explore.)\n\n“Commute by bus from the Hotel Sunroute Ginza through the thrilling city, then across the graceful Rainbow Bridge — 42 minutes to the Media Transport Mall (MTM), then seven more easy minutes on a different bus to the Main Press Center (MPC).\n\n“The MPC and IBC (International Broadcast Center) are in the splendid Tokyo Big Sight convention center. It’s a big ole place.\n\n“Breakfast: Fruit cocktail, YLS (yummy little sausages), fried eggs, pasta and corn.\n\n“Experimental Japanese Food Du Jour – Sticky soybeans. Looked like a cross between dippin’ dots and a French delicacy, but tasted a lot like shoes. Came with little packets of sauce. If I had been able to open the packets, maybe the sticky soybeans would have tasted like shoes avec sauce.\n\n“The MPC is hoppin’ today. It’s opening ceremony day! (Pet peeve that I picked up from Mark Jones: don’t call it ‘ceremonies.’ There’s only one. It’s like the College Football Playoff. Singular.)\n\n“Volunteer du jour: Tom, American college student, trying to direct reporters to their seats. And, maybe more importantly, to the concession stand.\n\n“I’ll bet if you asked 100 Olympics people what year it is, 50 would say 2020, because of Tokyo 2020. I haven’t heard anyone bat an eye about these being the 2020 Games.\n\n“They did bat for a couple of days because your shirt is the only way to dry hands in the restroom. No paper towels. No blow driers. I usually just shake them, like the hokey pokey.\n\n“Comment from a friend back home in America: ‘I assume they’ll be busing you to the Olympic sites? Are you all running the press area on this trip? That’s what you have done in the past. Correct?’ Answer to same friend: Yes on the buses. But no on ‘running’ anything. I am a minion. And loving it!\n\n“In the airport we saw an ideal example of suiseki, the Japanese art form with beautiful arrangements of small rocks designed around plants and larger rocks. The ground is ridges of small rocks, looking like a perfectly plowed, newly planted cotton field.\n\n“In the MPC there is a small house filled with examples of ikebana. The sign says to just stand, smell the flowers, and relax and pray for the end of Covid and for world peace. Nicki does that every day.\n\n“Lunch: Granola, carrots and a roll with butter and strawberry jelly, left over from breakfast. Oh, and two Oreos.\n\n“In PyeongChang, the local hosts gave us little plastic cups with noodles for free. Here, we get chocolate bars the size of dominoes. Four times a day, a guy fills a tray with milk, dark and super-duper milk versions. They’re gone in 37 minutes or so. Yummy.\n\n“I need to say this: even for us devotees of Allen Fieldhouse, the Olympics is the greatest sporting event in the world.\n\n“Weather: Hot and windy again. High 90. Low a sweet low-70s. The bay brings romance.\n\n“Japan Fact that surely must be true because somebody told me: Tokyo was formerly known as Edo. The name was changed to Tokyo in 1890 in the Meiji Restoration.\n\n“This evening I carried tickets to the Olympic stadium and stuck around for most of the opening ceremony. The bus dropped us in the wrong place. We deboarded into a neighborhood with no one to show us where to go. Being ‘lost’ was kinda fun. I got off first and felt like I had landed in Oz, except with no Munchkins—and certainly no Lollipop Guild. We walked through a lovely sort of a garden with beautiful trees and emerged into a rugby stadium, smelling the grass.\n\n“We walked a little more. No one paid a bit of attention to us; I wondered if we were supposed to be where we were, but didn’t see any escape and didn’t really care because it was fun to walk among the trees. Suddenly we were next to the Armenia team all decked out in Armenia outfits. We watched them stop at a little aid station for individually shrink-wrapped bananas and other snacks. (Yes, I know what you’re thinking: ALL bananas are individually wrapped. But these had a second layer of man-made shrink.)\n\n“Finally inside the mostly empty Olympic stadium, it was impossible not to feel crushing disappointment for everyone who should have been here enjoying the moment -- people who lost their lives to the pandemic, parents who carried their sons and daughters to this pinnacle and then had to stay home watching Savannah Guthrie, and Japanese folks who put their hearts and souls and dreams into the Olympics. Imagine.\n\n“But the parade of nations always brings a pleasant tear to my eye. More so tonight. The participants are just so blasted happy! Against the steepest odds since Appalachian State-Michigan, the people of the world have come together again. Bless its heart, the human spirit is strong.\n\n“Dinner: Noodles, something deep-fried, ham, broccoli and other delicious stuff in a box — bento box. I called it a Benton box but Nicki corrected me.\n\n“We caught the 12:10 bus from the MPC to the Hotel Sunroute Ginza. The city lights were spectacular.\n\n“P.S. We heard someone yelling or screaming off to the right as we left the stadium. ‘You’re from the sixties!’ I thought, like James Earl Jones. Mostly we just saw dozens of people standing silently along the little fence next to the security area. Like when TV doesn’t show a streaker on the field, that’s all I have to say about that.\n\n“What a privilege to be here! Every day is an adventure. Sayonara, for now.\n\n“July 24, Saturday: Breakfast — Fruit cocktail, carrots, corn, tasty little sausages, roll with butter and jelly and BPSE (the best potato salad ever.) We fill a little box with food and take it back to our room to eat it.\n\n“Experimental Japanese Food — Seaweed. Dark green but not spinach-slimey. Tasted like rubber bands.\n\n“The sky was drizzly when we walked from the Hotel Sunroute Ginza to the bus stop. Which caused me to make a mental note to load my umbrella into my backpack which is already straining at the zippers.\n\n“Commute by bus from the Hotel Sunroute Ginza through the thrilling city, then across the graceful Rainbow Bridge — 29 minutes to the Media Transport Mall. Then I walked the 20 minutes to the Main Press Center. The weather was already hot but the walk was pleasant. And I saw some crepe myrtle! Red! I’ll walk again. And again. And again.\n\n“Bad news: now that more reporters are staying at the Hotel Sunroute Ginza, the WiFi is slow and inconsistent. I have a few Zooms next week. Maybe I will have to ride the media bus around and around, like Charlie and the MTA.\n\n“When I talked to the woman at the front desk about the poor WiFi, she smiled and said something to the effect that ‘I called the company.’ It’s the non-confrontational Japanese way. I don’t expect any improvement. Sigh.\n\n“By the way, the name of the WiFi on the media buses is ‘Sushi 2020.’\n\n“Set your watches: when it’s 11 a.m. Monday in Binger, it’s 1 a.m. Tuesday in Tokyo.\n\n“Best phrase in Japanese so far, even more important than Donde esta el bano? ‘Watashi wa negatibu ni tesuto shimashita.’ It means, ‘I tested negative.’\n\n“私はネガティブにテストしました\n\n“Volunteer du jour: Yoki, age 26, who was working at the MPC. Tiny and cute (redundancy), she went to school in Oregon.\n\n“Note from a friend back in America: As a Trojan alum … while I appreciate the shoutout of our cornucopia of Olympians, I feel compelled to remind you (as Tim Tessalone has done for about 35 years at this point) that USC does not like to be referred to as Southern Cal. Comment from Bill: Duly noted. Fight on.\n\n“Lunch: Carrots, BPSE, granola, chocolate bar.\n\n“Comment from a friend back home in America -- ‘So you’re staying in Ginza. That’s THE most expensive part of Tokyo. There are some nice departos (department stores) in that area and there are a million good, but very expensive restaurants. Ginza is usually quite clean and the auto traffic (and parking) is crazy around there.’\n\n“I need to say this: even for us devotees of spring training baseball, the Olympics is the greatest sporting event in the world.\n\n“Weather: Hot and windy again, high 90. Low 70-something.\n\n“Japan Fact that surely must be true because somebody told me: ‘The cherry blossom is the national symbol of Japan. In 1912, Mayor Yukio Ozaki of Tokyo City gave 2,000 Japanese cherry trees to Washington, D.C. Those trees were found to be infested with beetles and had to be destroyed before they were planted, so Mayor Ozaki donated 3,000 more trees. They were planted and the gift has been commemorated every year in Washington since 1934 with the National Cherry Blossom Festival.’\n\n“Dinner: Pizza from the little pizza restaurant in the MPC. Darn fine. Thank you, Kate!\n\n“Tonight one of our drivers took us back to the Hotel Sunroute Ginza. Fun! It was like we were in a new city because cars can go where buses can’t. And vice-versa.\n\n“What a privilege to be here! Every day is an adventure. Sayonara, for now.\n\n“Sunday, July 25: Breakfast — Fruit cocktail, sausages, pasta, corn, carrots, little sausages, BPSE (best potato salad ever.)\n\n“So far, the buses have been little Felix Ungers. On time, tidy and organized.\n\n“Yesterday we were told that our bus now arrives at :59 after the hour, rather than :44. Today Nicki and I were lounging in the shade of the pedestrian overpass, happily reading the news on our phones, out of sight from the bus stop, when a French journalist shouted, ‘Sir, the bus is here!’ Indeed, it had arrived at :43. Merci beaucoup!\n\n“Commute by bus from the Hotel Sunroute Ginza through the thrilling city, then across the graceful Rainbow Bridge — 28 minutes to the Media Transport Mall, then seven more easy minutes on a different bus to the Main Press Center.\n\n“I totally LOVE riding the bus. I see something different every day. Today, a sign on a window: ‘Men’s Eyebrow Salon.’\n\n“Sunday…Sunday…SUNDAY! The city was quieter than usual but still beautiful.\n\n“Our friend Bob Condron always advised to check that you have the three C’s before leaving your hotel room at the Olympics: cell phone, credential and key. Tokyo will be my 14th Olympics. Nicki’s 8th. (I have listed our lodging, too.)\n\n“1984: Los Angeles (Biltmore Hotel, downtown LA; Nicki went as a spectator);\n\n“1988: Seoul (‘Olympic Family Town’ apartments)\n\n“1992: Barcelona (Hotel Victoria)\n\n“1996: Atlanta (Marriott Residence Inn near Georgia Tech; Nicki went as a spectator)\n\n“2000: Sydney (apartment in Bankstown)\n\n“2004: Athens (hospital near the Main Press Center)\n\n“2006: Torino (apartment near the Main Press Center)\n\n“2008: Beijing (Beijing Normal University)\n\n“2010: Vancouver (Coast Vancouver Hotel near the airport)\n\n“2012: London (Montague Hotel in Bloomsbury adjacent to Russell Square)\n\n“2014: Sochi (nice apartment in the media village)\n\n“2016: Rio (Hotel Mercure in Barra)\n\n“2018: Pyeongchang (apartment in the high-rise media village in Gangneung)\n\n“2021: Tokyo (Sunroute Ginza Hotel)\n\n“We added a fourth to Bob’s list back in London: computer. And now there’s a fifth: ‘covering, face.’ (Mask doesn’t begin with a ‘C.’)\n\n“Now I added another C each day: to make sure Nicki is with me: ‘Chick.’\n\n“One little glitch: I am not real fond of Japanese Kleenex.\n\n“Covid Counter-Measure du jour: Yes, everyone at the Olympics wears a mask all day, except when eating or drinking, of course. Every. Single. Person. And no one complains. No. One. Complains. (Must admit some guilty pleasure when I return to the hotel room and rip off the mask as Mr. Trump did on the balcony.)\n\n“By the way, do you remember those World War II movies, when the plane is going down and the pilot pulls his mask aside and says to the co-pilot, ‘Tom, we’re not going to make it; you’ve been a great partner and you should bail out now.’ Then Tom pulls his mask aside and refuses to leave and the movie ends and we all cry? I feel like that when I slide my mask aside to gulp some water.\n\n“Japanese Food Experiment: Trout. It tasted like American trout, which I like in Colorado with beer.\n\n“I’m sure many Hobart people have been to Tokyo. I know about these three:\n\n“1. R.J. Stephens, Hobart High class of 1933, who flew to Tokyo April 18, 1942, with 79 other guys who were Doolittle’s Raiders. He was in Group 4. His plane crash-landed in China; he made his way to India and returned to the war. He moved back to Hobart later.\n\n“2. Nathan Gardner, also HHS class of ‘33, who reportedly was with General MacArthur’s party on the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay September 2, 1945, just a stone’s throw from where we are this morning. Well, maybe a few stones or a Garth Brooks javelin throw. I’m dreaming of going to where the Missouri was berthed but am not optimistic -- and not convinced that there’s anything to commemorate the site.\n\n“3. James Barnes, HHS class of ’67, brilliant musician, son of a feed-lot operator and possibly America’s premier composer for wind ensemble, who has been visited Japan maybe 30 times to do clinics and conduct his works which are extremely popular here.\n\n“Despite the perfection and efficiency there must be 9,017 things to trip over. Inexplicable raised spots in the sidewalk, curbs, pebbles, power cords under carpets, peas (for Princess Nicki) and paving stones. And I have hit about 37 of them already. But it’s early. I will be on the podium in that sport.\n\n“Volunteer du jour: Minami, who wouldn’t tell me her age. Her job was in collecting tubes containing saliva to be shipped off somewhere for COVID testing. It’s not a glamorous job, but in 40 years, she will be able to tell her grandchildren that she worked on the Olympics. And that will mean something!\n\n“Sign on bus: ‘Please do not leave anything behind you.’ Olympics motto: Never make fun of signs that were written in our own language. At least there ARE signs. And how good would our signs be if we wrote them in Cyrillic. Or in Japanese characters?\n\n“I enjoy the Olympics always, of course, but there’s a special magic in a country where folks don’t speak English. It just requires a little more effort.\n\n“Lunch: Granola, roll, BPSE (best potato salad ever), carrots, corn. All left over from breakfast. We’re not supposed to eat at our desks in the office, so Nicki and I grab our lunch and sit in the eight-table media lounge on the fourth floor. People make fun of us. I say, ‘I am taking my special date to a fancy restaurant.’\n\n“I need to say this: even we devotees of the Bedlam Series have to acknowledge that the Olympics is the greatest sporting event in the world.\n\n“Weather: Hot and windy. 91 and 70-something. Again. People were roasting at outdoor events such as skateboarding.\n\n“But change is ahead. A man breathlessly said today that a typhoon is headed for Tokyo. Tuesday. The organizers of the rowing event even changed the schedule because of it. (‘It’s not a typhoon,’ another journalist whispered. ‘At home, we would call it a tropical depression.’) Dueling journalists…I love it!\n\n“But the storm is big enough to have a name —Nepartak.\n\n“Japan Fact that surely must be true because somebody told me: Tokyo has the most top-rated restaurants in the world and has over 14 three-star Michelin restaurants.\n\n“I wonder how many different varieties of noodles are in Japan? I wonder how many I will be able to consume? If there’s a Guinness record, I will try to achieve it.\n\n“My job here is to help reporters. The help sometimes begins before they arrive, as you will see in this email exchange:\n\n“‘Sir, Thanks for your help. Quick question: this will be my first time leaving the country, is there anything I need to know? I see that it is a big cash culture in Japan so I am squared away on that end. Sincerely, Brenae (not her real name).\n\n“‘Dear Brenae, thanks. You are in for a great experience! There’s so much to learn, and you will be a real veteran by the time you return home. I assume you have followed the requirements for entry into Japan. When you get here, just remember that (1) you will be exhausted from the flight, but it will pass, (2) you MUST drink plenty of water, and (3) everything takes longer than at home! And know that you are not alone; many people are here to help, including those of us here in the Main Press Center. Come see us. Bill.’\n\n“Dinner: Carrots, corn, BPSE, roll with butter and jelly. Oreos.\n\n“My friend Bill got the idea to take a taxi from the MPC to the Hotel Sunroute Ginza, rather than riding the bus. There’s a taxi stand at the MPC, so we connected with a driver. Unfortunately he didn’t speak English. I got the idea to put the hotel into Google Maps on my phone to show him. Something even better popped up: the hotel’s street address in Japanese characters! What a world!\n\n“We zoomed back, cutting 30 minutes off the trip, which allowed me to arrive in time to watch Japanese soccer with Japanese commentary and Japanese commercials on the TV in the room while catching up on email.\n\n“By the way, our cozy hotel room gets 10 channels, one in English: BBC World News. But we’re only in the hotel to sleep, fiddle with clothes and bump into each other walking sideways between the bed and the little shelf to brush our teeth.\n\n“What a privilege to be here! Every day is an adventure. Sayonara, for now.”\n\nClassic Pick Flicks: “Network”\n\nPlaywright Paddy Chayefsky always had a winner in “Network,” which for decades was considered an American classic. Then the 2010s came along, with populism returning en masse, and “Network” became prescient.\n\n“Network”, released in 1976, is the story of a fictional U.S. television network using an angry, aging new anchor to rally the masses, with his “I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore.” The resulting fanfare triggers a variety of results that are both stunning and horrific.\n\nThe plot of “Network” probably seemed preposterous in the 1970s. Forty years later, not so much.\n\nThe cast is superb, with Peter Finch as the angry news anchor, Faye Dunaway as the ambitious program director who seizes the opportunity to market the anger, William Holden as the news director trying to maintain standards, Beatrice Straight as the news director’s wife, Ned Beatty as the corporate chairman and Robert Duvall as yet another network executive.\n\nFinch won the Oscar for best actor, Dunaway won for best actress, Straight won for best supporting actress and Chayefsky won for best original screenplay. “Network” also was nominated for six other Oscars, including best picture, best actor (Holden), best director (Sidney Lumet) and best supporting actor (Beatty).\n\n“Network” is the ultimate satire and black-comedy that 45 years later comes much too close to the truth.\n\nBerry Tramel: Berry can be reached at 405-760-8080 or at btramel@oklahoman.com.

In his first Oval Office appearance, before heading to inaugural balls, he signs an executive order directing agencies to find ways to \"ease the burden\" of Obamacare.\n\nDay 2: Jan. 21\n\nTrump makes an appearance at CIA headquarters, expressing his support for the intelligence community while attacking the media for reporting that he had a \"feud\" with them over investigations into Russian hacking and the election. He also criticizes media coverage of his inauguration, echoed later by press secretary Sean Spicer in an angry briefing room debut. Meanwhile, millions of people join Women's March protests around the world, including in Washington.\n\nDay 3: Jan. 22\n\nTrump starts the day with tweets touting his inauguration TV ratings and weighing in on the weekend protests against him: \"Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote?\" Top aide Kellyanne Conway makes waves with a Meet the Press appearance in which she says Spicer \"gave alternative facts\" in his press briefing in regard to inauguration crowd sizes.\n\nDay 4: Jan. 23\n\nTrump signs three presidential directives: withdrawing U.S. support for a Pacific trade deal; imposing a hiring freeze in civilian agencies; and restoring the so-called Mexico City policy that prohibits U.S. aid from supporting international groups that promote abortion. In a meeting with congressional leaders, Trump revives claims of voter fraud, blaming his popular vote loss on 3 million to 5 million people voting illegally.\n\nDay 5: Jan. 24\n\nTrump signs five executive actions on energy and infrastructure projects, including two memoranda intended to expedite the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. In a late-night tweet, he references plans to address one of his key campaign promises the following day: \"Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!\"\n\nDay 6: Jan. 25\n\nTrump starts the day with tweets vowing a \"major investigation\" into alleged voter fraud. In the afternoon, he visits the Department of Homeland Security and signs executive actions aimed at building a wall on the Mexican border and clamping down on \"sanctuary cities.\"\n\nDay 7: Jan. 26\n\nTrump floats a proposal for a 20% tax on imports from Mexico to pay for his planned border wall. His plans for the wall drive a divide between the two countries and lead Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to cancel a meeting between the two leaders. Trump takes his first Air Force One ride, traveling to Philadelphia to speak at the GOP congressional retreat.\n\nDay 8: Jan. 27\n\nTrump has an hourlong phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto. He has his first official meeting with a foreign leader, British Prime Minister Theresa May. During their news conference, Trump declines to say whether he supports a reduction of sanctions against Russia. He visits the Pentagon to charge his new Defense secretary with rebuilding the military and announce an executive action to clamp down on refugee admissions in the U.S.\n\nDay 9: Jan. 28\n\nTrump's executive order from the previous evening — which suspends the U.S. refugee program for 120 days, bans all immigrants from seven Muslim countries for 90 days, and orders the administration to develop \"extreme vetting\" measures — causes reverberations across the country, with stranded travelers, airport protests and legal challenges. The president makes a round of phone calls to world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump also signs more executive orders: one to reorganize the National Security Council, another to strengthen ethics rules for the executive branch, and a third directing the military to present him a plan to defeat the Islamic State.\n\nDay 10: Jan. 29\n\nTrump, the target of protests, lawsuits and global criticism over his new refugee policy, takes to social media to defend it as a counter-terrorism measure. Some congressional Republicans suggest the order may have been too broad and hastily written. The president also faces blowback after giving chief strategist Steve Bannon an elevated role on the National Security Council.\n\nDay 11: Jan. 30\n\nAmid continued criticism over his temporary travel ban, Trump says that stopping terrorism involves hard choices and adds that he's following through on campaign pledges. Former president Barack Obama's office releases a statement that applauds those protesting the ban. That evening, acting Attorney General Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, says she won't defend the president’s travel ban in court. Three hours later, the White House announces that she's been relieved of her duties.\n\nDay 12: Jan. 31\n\nThe morning after firing his acting attorney general, Trump mocks his Democratic congressional critics and demands that the Senate confirm his attorney general pick, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions. He meets with drugmakers and pledges to cut taxes and streamline regulations for the pharmaceutical industry in a bid to drive down drug prices. The president caps off the day with his long-awaited Supreme Court nomination, announcing his selection of Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.\n\nDay 13: Feb. 1\n\nTrump says the Senate should \"go nuclear\" and eliminate Democratic filibuster rights if that's what it takes to confirm Gorsuch. His nomination of Betsy DeVos for Education secretary takes a hit when two Republican senators say they'll vote against her. The president makes an unannounced trip to a Delaware military base to receive the remains of a Navy SEAL killed during a counter-terrorism raid.\n\nDay 14: Feb. 2\n\nIn remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump references leaked conversations between himself and Mexican and Australian leaders, telling attendees not to worry about his \"tough phone calls\" and that the country has to be \"tougher\" in meeting its challenges. He raises eyebrows by also asking for prayers for his Apprentice successor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and the show's ratings, which Trump said have gone \"down the tubes\" in his absence. And he vows to make good on his promise to overturn the so-called Johnson Amendment, which bans public charities — including churches — from campaigning for or against a candidate for elected office.\n\nDay 15: Feb. 3\n\nThe Trump administration imposes new sanctions on Iranian individuals and companies, citing the Tehran government's missile tests and support for rebels in Yemen. The president signs executive actions rolling back key financial regulations of the Obama era, including restrictions on Wall Street banks and on financial advisers who sell clients expensive financial products with higher commissions.\n\nDay 16: Feb. 4\n\nTrump spends his weekend at Mar-a-Lago, the \"Winter White House.\" He asks a federal court to overturn a Seattle judge’s injunction halting his immigration ban, after he criticized the judge’s ruling as “ridiculous” and a “terrible decision.” In excerpts of a Fox News interview with Bill O'Reilly set to air before the Super Bowl the following day, Trump reiterates his desire to improve relations with Russia and dismisses concerns that Putin is a “killer.”\n\nDay 17: Feb 5\n\nTrump continues to attack the federal judge who voided his travel ban. \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,\" he tweets. \"If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" As the Justice Department appeals the judge's decision, Trump also tweets that he has \"instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!\"\n\nDay 18: Feb. 6\n\nAs an appeals court reviews his travel ban, Trump claims that the public is with him, despite polls indicating otherwise. \"Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election,\" Trump tweets. \"Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.\" In a visit to the headquarters of the U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Trump tells troops he is 100% behind them in the fight against \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and claims that \"in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn’t want to report\" on terrorist attacks.\n\nDay 19: Feb. 7\n\nTrump tells a group of county sheriffs that he will help them fight terrorism and illegal immigration, and he vows to take his travel ban all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. DeVos is confirmed as Education secretary after a contentious battle in the Senate, with Vice President Pence breaking a 50-50 tie vote. Later that day, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals hears oral arguments over a lower court's decision to halt Trump's travel ban.\n\nDay 20: Feb. 8\n\nTrump urges the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold his travel ban, arguing that national security is at stake and suggesting that judges sometimes act politically. The president attacks Nordstrom for dropping daughter Ivanka's fashion line, drawing criticism for mixing government and his family's business interests. The Senate debate on the Sessions attorney general nomination turns ugly after Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is silenced by the GOP during a speech for \"impugning\" Sessions.\n\nDay 21: Feb. 9\n\nTrump accuses Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., of distorting what Gorsuch said about the president's attacks on judges, even though administration officials and fellow senators confirm the gist of Gorsuch's comments. The president also uses Twitter to attack Sen. John McCain over his criticism of the White House calling the Yemen raid a “huge success.\" Watchdog groups file ethics complaints against Conway for promoting Ivanka Trump's fashion line during a TV interview. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit weighs in that evening, refusing to reinstate Trump's travel ban.\n\nDay 22: Feb. 10\n\nIn a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Trump reaffirms the U.S. commitment to the defense of Japan but says both countries need to contribute more to military cooperation. He says he’ll take action the following week to strengthen border security in the wake of the appeals court ruling against his travel ban, but he declines to specify what that action might be. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Virginia blasts his travel ban, citing a lack of evidence that travelers from the seven Muslim-majority countries represent a specific threat.\n\nDay 23: Feb. 11\n\nTrump golfs with Abe at Trump National Jupiter Golf Club in Florida, while Melania Trump and Abe’s wife, Akie, spend the morning touring the Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens in Palm Beach County. It's a relatively quiet day for the president on Twitter, with Trump vowing that cost estimates for his border wall will \"come WAY DOWN\" once he is involved with design and negotiations.\n\nDay 24: Feb. 12\n\nTrump takes to Twitter in the morning to again defend his travel ban. In Sunday show appearances, policy adviser Stephen Miller says the president is assessing all of his legal options on the ban, ranging from appealing to the Supreme Court to revising the executive order.\n\nDay 25: Feb. 13\n\nAfter a day filled with mounting questions and criticism, National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigns, citing \"incomplete information\" that he provided White House officials about his dealings with the Russian ambassador. Earlier that day, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visits the White House. Trump pledges \"bridges of commerce\" with Canada and says he wants relatively minor changes to NAFTA, adding that most of his problems with the trade deal involve the third partner, Mexico.\n\nDay 26: Feb. 14\n\nIn the aftermath of Flynn's exit, Spicer says Trump knew for more than two weeks that Flynn lied about his contact with a Russian ambassador and demanded his resignation because he could no longer trust him. That night, The New York Times reports that phone records and intercepted calls show members of Trump's campaign team \"had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election.\"\n\nDay 27: Feb. 15\n\nAmid the renewed questions about contacts between Trump's associates and Russia regarding the 2016 election, the president denounces \"conspiracy theories\" about his relationship with the Russians and said \"illegal\" news leaks brought down Flynn. Trump hosts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House for a series of meetings. Andrew Puzder, the president’s embattled pick to become Labor secretary, withdraws his nomination.\n\nDay 28: Feb. 16\n\nIn a lengthy, fiery, wide-ranging news conference, Trump defends his administration as a \"fine-tuned machine,\" laments the \"mess\" he inherited from his predecessor and excoriates the \"fake news\" media. He says he asked Flynn to resign because he misled Pence about his phone calls to the Russian ambassador, but Trump says he didn't believe Flynn did anything wrong by making the calls and faults leakers for providing contents of the intercepted calls to the media.\n\nDay 29: Feb. 17\n\nThe Associated Press reports on the details of an internal Department of Homeland Security memo from January that proposes calling up as many as 100,000 National Guard troops to round up undocumented immigrants; it draws an angry response from the White House, with Spicer calling the AP report \"100% not true\" and insisting the memo is “not a White House document.” Trump conducts his first presidential visit beyond the Beltway with a stop in the Boeing facility in North Charleston, S.C., where he stresses his \"America First\" trade and economic policies.\n\nDay 30: Feb. 18\n\nTrump kicks off his third straight weekend at Mar-a-Lago seeking to calm reports of turmoil within his administration. \"Don't believe the main stream (fake news) media.The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it,\" he tweets that morning. He holds a campaign-style rally in the evening in Melbourne, Fla.\n\nDay 31: Feb. 19\n\nTrump is ridiculed for apparently denouncing a non-existent terrorist attack in Sweden in his rally the night before but says he was referring to a Fox News report on violence in Sweden allegedly perpetrated by refugees. In New York City, more than a thousand people protest Trump's travel ban in the \"I Am A Muslim Too\" rally.\n\nDay 32: Feb. 20\n\nAcross the country, anti-Trump activists mark Presidents Day with “Not My Presidents Day” protests. The president spends the holiday at Mar-a-Lago and announces that Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster will be his new national security adviser, replacing Flynn.\n\nDay 33: Feb. 21\n\nTrump speaks out against a series of bomb threats to Jewish community centers across the nation after coming under fire for sidestepping earlier opportunities to condemn several anti-Semitic acts since he took office. The Department of Homeland Security issues new directives to increase deportations among the country's 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nDay 34: Feb. 22\n\nTrump and his aides say they’ll roll out a proposed budget, a revamped health care plan and a new tax reform package over the following two months. The president, while meeting with budget officials, doesn't give specifics, but he tells reporters that \"our moral duty to the taxpayer requires us to make our government leaner and more accountable” and “we must do a lot more with less.” Later that evening, the Trump administration issues new guidance on transgender students' restroom use, rolling back the policies put in place by the Obama administration last year.\n\nDay 35: Feb. 23\n\nTrump meets with manufacturing executives at the White House and later holds a listening session on human trafficking. The Conservative Political Action Conference kicks off just outside of Washington. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Bannon make a joint appearance at the annual confab, in which they dispute media reports casting them as rivals and say they are working together to advance the president's agenda.\n\nDay 36: Feb. 24\n\nTrump starts off the day criticizing FBI \"leakers\" as he and aides push back on news reports that his chief of staff asked the bureau to \"knock down\" stories about investigations into possible contacts between Trump campaign associates and Russian officials. At his CPAC speech later that morning, Trump launches into a full-throated attack on journalism, saying some reporters make up unnamed sources for \"fake news\" and describing the media as \"the enemy\" of the American people. News organizations protest a White House decision that afternoon to hold a news briefing by invitation only.\n\nDay 37: Feb. 25\n\nThe president takes to Twitter in the morning with further complaints about the media. “The media has not reported that the National Debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs a $200 billion increase in Obama first mo,” he tweets. In the evening, he announces via Twitter that he will not attend the annual White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April.\n\nDay 38: Feb. 26\n\nThe president tweets that the Democratic National Committee election \"was of course, totally 'rigged' \" and takes another swing at the media, tweeting, \"Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!\" In the evening, Trump hosts the nation's governors for an annual dinner at the White House.\n\nDay 39: Feb. 27\n\nTrump signs off on top-line numbers in a budget outline that bolsters military spending while making deep cuts to other federal agencies. \"This defense spending increase will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the federal government,\" he says. \"We're going to do more with less.\" The president rejects the idea of a special prosecutor to look into Russian connections during the election and says, “I haven’t called Russia in 10 years.\"\n\nDay 40: Feb. 28\n\nTrump uses his first address to Congress to proclaim American greatness and push an ambitious agenda of economic nationalism, declaring, \"The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us.\" He opens the possibility of a comprehensive immigration deal, pitches $1 trillion for \"Buy American, Hire American\" infrastructure spending, and says he will propose \"historic\" tax cuts. Earlier that day, the president signs executive orders targeting a water-protection rule and elevating an initiative on historically black colleges and universities.\n\nDay 41: March 1\n\nA day after Trump struck a more conciliatory tone in his address to Congress, critics predict he'll revert back to the more combative and divisive approach that characterized much of his first month in office. Aides, however, say the president is focused on enacting his campaign agenda. White House Deputy Counsel Stefan Passantino says in a letter that Conway did nothing \"nefarious\" when she promoted Ivanka Trump's fashion line on television and that a White House inquiry \"concluded that Ms. Conway acted inadvertently and is highly unlikely to do so again.\"\n\nDay 42: March 2\n\nThe news of Sessions' 2016 meetings with the Russian ambassador, contradicting his testimony during his confirmation hearing that he had no contact with the Russian government during the campaign, dominates the day. Trump says he \"wasn't aware at all\" of the meetings. Speaking to reporters during a tour of the USS Gerald Ford in Newport News, Va., the president says he still had \"total\" confidence in his attorney general. Later that afternoon, Session recuses himself from the Russia investigation.\n\nDay 43: March 3\n\nSeeking to get past stories about Sessions and Russia, Trump spends the day visiting a school in Florida. He uses Twitter to express his displeasure with Democrats, knocking them over his full Cabinet having not yet been approved and calling Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer a \"hypocrite\" in a tweet displaying a 2003 photo of Schumer and Putin.\n\nDay 44: March 4\n\nIn a morning tweetstorm, Trump accuses Obama of wiretapping him at Trump Tower prior to the November election: \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\" the president tweets. An Obama spokesman rejects the accusation as \"simply false.\" Thousands of Trump supporters convene near Trump Tower and in other cities around the U.S. in what organizers bill as \"March 4 Trump\" demonstrations on behalf of the president.\n\nDay 45: March 5\n\nIn the morning, the president calls for a congressional investigation of his claims that Obama had him wiretapped during the election — while critics accuse Trump of trying to distract from the investigation into his own relationship with Russia. That evening, news reports indicate that FBI Director James Comey over the weekend sought a public rebuke from the Justice Department of Trump's wiretapping claim.\n\nDay 46: March 6\n\nTrump issues the long-awaited revised version of his travel ban, which no longer restricts travel from Iraq, one of the seven majority Muslim countries listed in his original order. The new order, set to take effect 10 days afterward, includes Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen as part of the 90-day ban. Meanwhile, when White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders is asked on ABC's Good Morning America whether the president accepts Comey's statement that Obama did not authorize any wiretaps, she says: \"You know, I don't think he does.\"\n\nDay 47: March 7\n\nTrump kicks off the day by using Twitter to again bash Obama — this time in a false claim about Guantanamo Bay prisoner releases. He also denies reports of dissension within his staff. \"Don't let the FAKE NEWS tell you that there is big infighting in the Trump Admin,\" the president tweets. He praises the House GOP health care bill amid pushback from conservatives attacking the new plan. \"We're going to do something that is great,\" the president says during a meeting with House deputy whips. The plan is \"complicated, but it's very simple ... it's called good health care.\"\n\nDay 48: March 8\n\nWhile refusing to confirm or deny the authenticity of CIA documents released by WikiLeaks, Spicer says that \"this alleged leak should concern every single American in terms of the impact it has on our national security\" and says there's a \"massive, massive difference\" between exposing the emails of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and other Democratic officials, and leaking national security secrets. The president dines with former foe Sen. Ted Cruz. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Sheldon Whitehouse send a letter to the FBI director and acting deputy attorney general asking for specific information on Trump's wiretapping accusation against Obama.\n\nDay 49: March 9\n\nTrump meets with his National Economic Council and representatives of community banks. As GOP leaders try to quell concerns about the new health care legislation, the president tweets, \"Despite what you hear in the press, healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!\" Meanwhile, legal challenges mount from several states for Trump's revised travel ban.\n\nDay 50: March 10\n\nAs the president reaches the halfway point of his first 100 days, administration officials kick off a plan to use social media and interviews to promote \"50 days of action.\" Trump meets with House committee leaders and predicts a fairly rapid approval of the GOP health care bill. \"This is the time we’re going to get it done,\" he says. \"I think it’s just something that’s going to happen very shortly.\" He welcomes a better-than-expected jobs report showing that the economy added 235,000 jobs the previous month.\n\nDay 51: March 11\n\nTrump has lunch with a group of White House staff and Cabinet members at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va. His administration moves forward with plans to dismiss 46 U.S. attorneys held over from the Obama administration amid criticism, and news reports emerge that an intruder was arrested on the White House grounds after scaling a fence the previous evening.\n\nDay 52: March 12\n\nTrump administration officials mount a vigorous defense of their effort to repeal and replace Obamacare while bracing for what could be a skeptical assessment from the Congressional Budget Office the next day. Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price says the bill would lead to \"more people covered than are covered right now, and at an average cost that is less.\"\n\nDay 53: March 13\n\nThe CBO releases its analysis of the GOP health plan, determining that the bill would lead to 14 million fewer Americans with insurance by 2018 and 24 million by 2026. Price calls the projections \"just not believable.\" Trump launches an ambitious effort to reorganize the federal government, signing an executive order that he said would \"make it less wasteful and more productive.\"\n\nDay 54: March 14\n\nA senior White House official confirms that Trump paid $38 million in taxes in 2005 on an income of more than $150 million. The rare acknowledgement came in anticipation of a report by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in which she disclosed a portion of the return. The news capped off an otherwise relatively quite day for the president during which Spicer pushed back against the CBO analysis of the Obamacare repeal and Trump hosted the deputy crown prince of Saudi Arabia for lunch in the State Dining Room.\n\nDay 55: March 15\n\nA federal judge in Hawaii issues a nationwide halt to Trump's second travel ban. Earlier that day, the president spars on Twitter with journalist David Cay Johnston over the previous night's leaked tax return, tweeting, \"Does anybody really believe that a reporter, who nobody ever heard of, 'went to his mailbox' and found my tax returns?\" Trump also travels to Detroit to speak to autoworkers before heading to a rally in Nashville.\n\nDay 56: March 16\n\nIn his first formal budget proposal to Congress, Trump seeks to increase defense spending by $54 billion and offsets that with cuts to non-defense spending, including steep cuts to education, environmental protection, health and human services and foreign aid. Senate Intelligence Committee leaders say in a statement that there are \"no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance,\" a day after the House Intelligence panel offered a similar assessment. Trump also meets with Irish leader Enda Kenny and attends the Friends of Ireland Luncheon on Capitol Hill.\n\nDay 57: March 17\n\nDisputing media reports that the GOP health care bill is in political trouble, Trump says he is \"100% behind\" the plan and is working with skeptical conservatives. He welcomes German Chancellor Angela Merkel to the White House after months of back-and-forth between the two leaders. During their news conference, Trump again defends his surveillance allegations. \"At least we have something in common, perhaps,\" he says, referencing past disclosures during the Obama administration that Merkel's cellphone had been monitored.\n\nDay 58: March 18\n\nThe president spends the weekend at Mar-a-Lago. In a pair of morning tweets, Trump lashes out at the media and Germany: \"Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Nevertheless, Germany owes ... vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!\" Meanwhile, at the White House, the Secret Service apprehends a person who jumped a bike rack near the security perimeter.\n\nDay 59: March 19\n\nA day before a high-stakes hearing featuring Comey's testimony, the leaders of the House Intelligence Committee say on Sunday talk shows that there's no evidence to back Trump's claims that Obama wiretapped him, though the committee's chairman, Rep. Devin Nunes, says investigators are looking at other types of possible surveillance of Trump and his aides during the campaign.\n\nDay 60: March 20\n\nAppearing before the House Intelligence Committee, Comey says the FBI and DOJ have \"no information to support’’ Trump’s assertions that Obama wiretapped him, and he also confirms for the first time publicly that the FBI is investigating Russian interference in the election. Trump heads to Kentucky to take part in a rally to build support for the GOP health care bill.\n\nDay 61: March 21\n\nThe morning after congressional Republicans released a modified version of their health care legislation seeking to win more conservative votes, Trump meets with GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill, emphasizing how important it is that they stay united to pass the legislation. The president also signs a $19.5 billion bill to fund NASA programs and reaffirm what he called a \"national commitment\" to \"human space exploration.\"\n\nDay 62: March 22\n\nThe White House dismisses a report that Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, received a $10 million contract a decade ago to advance the interests of Putin. Nunes says communications involving members of Trump's transition group were \"incidentally collected'' by intelligence officials after the election. The president meets with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and negotiations continue over the looming health care vote in the House.\n\nDay 63: March 23\n\nIn a setback to Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan's efforts to repeal Obamacare, the House postpones its vote on the bill as negotiations continue with both conservative and moderate groups. The president touts the House Intelligence chairman's assertion that spy agencies engaged in \"incidental collection\" of Trump associates' communications, saying it's evidence to support his claim that Obama \"wiretapped\" Trump Tower. Trump also holds a listening session on health care at the White House with truckers and trucking CEOs.\n\nDay 64: March 24\n\nAs the Obamacare repeal bill bleeds GOP support ahead of its rescheduled vote, Ryan pulls the legislation from consideration — a major bump in the road for Trump's campaign promise to repeal and replace the health care law. The president blames the bill's failure on the lack of Democratic support. Earlier that day, Trump signs a permit to allow the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, calling it \"a great day for American jobs.\"\n\nDay 65: March 25\n\nThe morning after Republicans' Obamacare repeal plan fell apart in Congress, Trump tweets, \"ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE. Do not worry!\" The president stays in the D.C. area for the weekend, venturing to Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Va.\n\nDay 66: March 26\n\nTrump takes aim at the House Freedom Caucus in a morning tweet: \"Democrats are smiling in D.C. that the Freedom Caucus, with the help of Club For Growth and Heritage, have saved Planned Parenthood & Ocare!\" In Sunday show appearances, Priebus and budget director Mick Mulvaney say Trump has not blamed Ryan for the failure of the Obamacare repeal bill.\n\nDay 67: March 27\n\nTrump taps son-in-law Jared Kushner to lead a new White House office designed to bring ideas from the private sector into the federal government. The president rolls back more Obama-era regulations, signing four bills that reverse rules on education, land use and federal purchasing, and he holds a meeting at the White House with female small-business owners.\n\nDay 68: March 28\n\nTrump signs an executive order on energy independence, a sweeping repudiation of Obama-era environmental initiatives that substitutes a strategy of combating climate change through international cooperation for an America-first energy policy. Nunes faces pressure to recuse himself or step down as leader of the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDay 69: March 29\n\nThe president kicks off the day with complaints on Twitter about the media. \"Remember when the failing @nytimes apologized to its subscribers, right after the election, because their coverage was so wrong. Now worse!\" he tweets. Trump later holds an opioid abuse listening session, joined by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, leader of the White House's new commission to combat the opioid crisis.\n\nDay 70: March 30\n\nTrump takes to Twitter to threaten the conservative group that opposed him on health care: \"The Freedom Caucus will hurt the entire Republican agenda if they don't get on the team, & fast. We must fight them, & Dems, in 2018! \" Later that day, The New York Times reports that two White House officials played a role in providing intelligence reports to Nunes. The president meets with Denmark’s prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen.\n\nDay 71: March 31\n\nWhile Trump encourages Flynn to offer testimony to investigators in exchange for immunity, congressional leaders investigating Russia's interference in the election signal that it's too early to consider such an agreement. Trump promises to crack down on \"foreign importers that cheat\" with two executive orders that he said would lead to a historic reversal of the nation's trade deficit.\n\nDay 72: April 1\n\nTrump kicks off another Saturday with tweets attacking the media, with NBC's Chuck Todd as the target: \"When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?\" The president also uses Twitter to praise a New York Times article on Obamacare, though he still describes the newspaper as \"failing.\"\n\nDay 73: April 2\n\nTrump expresses confidence, both on social media and at the golf course, that he and aides can resurrect their attempt to repeal Obamacare. Before hitting the links with one of his critics on health care, Republican Sen. Rand Paul, the president tweets: \"Anybody (especially Fake News media) who thinks that Repeal & Replace of ObamaCare is dead does not know the love and strength in R Party!\"\n\nDay 74: April 3\n\nTrump welcomes Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to the White House, praises him for doing a \"fantastic job,\" and solicits his help in the fight against terrorism. The president donates $78,333.32 — his salary since taking office — to the National Park Service. Senate Democrats reach the threshold required to block Gorsuch's confirmation, setting up a major Senate rules change later in the week for the GOP to advance the Supreme Court nomination.\n\nDay 75: April 4\n\nFormer national security adviser Susan Rice, appearing on MSNBC, says she didn't seek to \"unmask\" the names of Trump associates for political purposes. Meanwhile, in a statement on a chemical attack in Syria, Trump blames the Assad regime and calls it a consequence of the Obama administration’s “weakness and irresolution.” The president promotes his \"America First\" domestic plan at the North America’s Building Trades Unions national legislative conference.\n\nDay 76: April 5\n\nA senior White House official confirms Trump has removed Bannon from the National Security Council and says Bannon was given the post as a check on Flynn. In an interview with The New York Times, Trump floats the possibility that Rice committed a crime, but he provides no evidence. In a news conference with Jordan's King Abdullah, the president denounces the chemical attack in Syria and suggests his administration will develop a new policy toward Bashar al-Assad's government.\n\nDay 77: April 6\n\nTrump orders a cruise missile strike against Syria, saying \"no child of God should ever suffer\" the horror of the chemical weapons attack Syria launched on its own people. Earlier that day, Trump meets with Wounded Warriors at the White House before heading to Mar-a-Lago to host a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Senate Republicans invoke the \"nuclear option\" to strip Democrats of their power to block Trump's Supreme Court nominee from being confirmed.\n\nDay 78: April 7\n\nTrump's decision to strike Syria in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack draws wide political support, though some lawmakers say he should have consulted with Congress, while Russia said the strike would undermine international cooperation. The president concludes his meetings with the Chinese president at Mar-a-Lago, and his Supreme Court nominee is confirmed by the Senate.\n\nDay 79: April 8\n\nTrump does not rule out additional military action against Syria, telling Congress that he was acting \"in the vital national security and foreign policy interests of the United States\" when he ordered the launch of cruise missiles at a Syrian air field. He provides his justification in a letter to Congress under the War Powers Resolution. Kushner and Bannon hold a negotiation session to try to mend a rift that triggered speculation about a White House staff shakeup.\n\nDay 80: April 9\n\nAdministration officials confirm that Trump will ask K.T. McFarland to step down as deputy national security adviser and serve instead as ambassador to Singapore, giving McMaster a chance to pick his own lieutenant. The president heads back to D.C. in the afternoon following a weekend at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nDay 81: April 10\n\nTrump takes part in the swearing-in ceremony for Gorsuch. The White House echoes its threat of additional missile strikes against Syria if Assad's government again uses chemical weapons, and Trump aides say the administration is reworking its tax reform plan and doesn't know whether it can put together a final proposal before Congress' August recess.\n\nDay 82: April 11\n\nSpicer makes waves during the daily briefing when he states, while comparing Assad and Adolf Hitler, that Hitler \"didn't even use chemical weapons.\" He attempts to clarify by saying Hitler \"was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing.\" In a second attempt to clarify, he says he was \"trying to draw a contrast of the tactic of using airplanes to drop chemical weapons on innocent people.\" Meanwhile, the White House says there's overwhelming evidence that Syria used a sarin nerve agent to attack opponents of the government and that Russia is trying to help Assad's government cover up the illegal use of chemical weapons.\n\nDay 83: April 12\n\nTrump meets with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg and says at a press conference afterward that he's satisfied that NATO has responded to the criticism he leveled at it during his campaign: \"I said it was obsolete. It is no longer obsolete.\" He also says relations with Russia \"may be at an all-time low\" following Syria's use of chemical weapons the previous week and the U.S. airstrike that followed.\n\nDay 84: April 13\n\nThe U.S. military announces an attack on an Islamic State tunnel complex in Afghanistan, and Trump says he endorsed the strike. Asked about the use of the \"mother of all bombs,\" Trump says \"what I do is I authorize my military. ... We have given them total authorization and that’s what they’re doing and frankly that’s why they’ve been so successful lately.\" The president tweets on foreign policy, including on North Korea: \"I have great confidence that China will properly deal with North Korea. If they are unable to do so, the U.S., with its allies, will! U.S.A.\"\n\nDay 85: April 14\n\nTrump hits the golf course at Mar-a-Lago as he and his aides braced for what North Korea calls a \"big event.\" Administration officials say they are hopeful that China can dissuade its communist neighbor from conducting a nuclear explosion or a missile test. The Trump administration says records of visitors to the White House will stay secret until at least five years after Trump leaves office, a reversal of policy quickly denounced by advocates of transparent government.\n\nDay 86: April 15\n\nNorth Korea attempts to launch a new missile, but the device blows up almost immediately. Pence arrives in Seoul hours after the failed missile test and says U.S. resolve to support and defend South Korea is unwavering \"in these troubled times.\" Meanwhile, thousands of protesters gather in U.S. cities for Tax Day rallies and marches, demanding that Trump release his tax returns.\n\nDay 87: April 16\n\nThe Trump administration takes a low-key approach to the previous day's failed missile test in North Korea and continues to express hope that China will rein in its nuclear-armed neighbor. The president says he's unimpressed with tax protests over the weekend and indicates he has no plans to release his tax returns anytime soon. \"Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!\" Trump tweets. He returns to D.C. after spending Easter weekend in Mar-a-Lago.\n\nDay 88: April 17\n\nTrump marks his first Easter Egg Roll by defending his record in office. \"We will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before and we are right on track,\" he says during remarks on the South Portico balcony. The White House declines to detail Trump's future strategy toward North Korea, even as its government threatens more missile tests. \"I think that the action that he took in Syria shows that when appropriate this president will take decisive action,\" Spicer says.\n\nDay 89: April 18\n\nTrump heads to Snap-On Tools in Kenosha, Wis., to speak about manufacturing and sign a \"Buy American, Hire American\" executive order. The order clamps down on guest worker visas and requires agencies to buy more goods and services from U.S. companies and workers. Watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington expands a lawsuit against the president, adding new plaintiffs who claim they are hurt by the \"unfair\" advantage he enjoys in the hotel and restaurant industry.\n\nDay 90: April 19\n\nWith the closely watched special election in Georgia headed to a runoff, Trump pats himself on the back: \"Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG \"R\" win with runoff in Georgia. Glad to be of help!\" he tweets. He signs the Veterans Choice Program Extension and Improvement Act and welcomes the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots to the White House.\n\nDay 91: April 20\n\nThe Trump administration launches an investigation into whether steel imports threaten national security, a move aimed at China's growing dominance in steel production. The president welcomes Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni to the White House. During their joint press conference, Trump says he's confident he can block North Korea's nuclear program, get a health care bill though the House, and avoid a looming government shutdown.\n\nDay 92: April 21\n\nWith a little over a week before Trump hits the 100-day mark of his presidency, he tweets, \"No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill!\" Trump aims to dismantle even more financial regulations with executive orders, directing Treasury officials to take another look at tax rules and oversight of \"too big to fail\" financial institutions. The president also says he intends to unveil a tax reform plan the following week.\n\nDay 93: April 22\n\nTrump announces his plans for the night of the annual dinner of White House correspondents — and the 100th day of his presidency. \"Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!\" he tweets. He makes his his first official visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, awarding a Purple Heart to a soldier injured in Afghanistan. People take part in protests across the country as part of the the March for Science.\n\nDay 94: April 23\n\nAs the 100-day mark approaches, Trump and his staff plan a busy week of events — including a new tax reform outline, a renewed effort to get a health care bill through the House, a high-profile National Rifle Association speech and a 100th day rally in Pennsylvania — all topped by the need for a new spending bill to keep the government open.\n\nDay 95: April 24\n\nTrump speaks with astronauts aboard the International Space Station, lauding NASA's work and praising a crew member who set a record for longest time spent in space. As his administration slaps new sanctions on Syria, Trump tells a group of U.N. diplomats that they need to work harder to confront the Syrian government and other \"serious and growing threats\" such as North Korea. He attempts to atone for past blunders on the history of the Holocaust with a strongly worded Week of Remembrance proclamation, pledging that \"we must never forget\" the annihilation of 6 million Jews by Nazi Germany.\n\nDay 96: April 25\n\nTrump vows to fight anti-Semitic violence during a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol to commemorate the memory of the Holocaust. \"Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to this horrible evil, and we will never be silent,\" Trump says. Later that day, the president expresses confidence that he'll be able to build a wall along the Southwest border but stops short of saying whether he would insist that money to finance the barrier be included in a new spending bill to keep the government open past the end of the week.\n\nDay 97: April 26\n\nTrump signs an executive order calling into question the future of more than two dozen national monuments proclaimed by the last three presidents to set aside millions of acres from development. The administration pitches a tax reform outline calling for big corporate rate cuts, a simpler tax code and big increases in standard deductions. After briefing senators at a White House meeting, members of Trump's national security team said they're trying to coerce North Korea into giving up its nuclear weapons program by cutting off foreign money they need to finance it.\n\nDay 98: April 27\n\nTrump signs an executive order seeking to provide more protections to whistle-blowers at the Department of Veterans Affairs. A week after directing a wide-ranging investigation into whether foreign steel poses a threat to U.S. national security, Trump signs an order doing the same for aluminum. He welcomes Argentinian President Mauricio Macri and first lady Juliana Awada to the White House.\n\nDay 99: April 28\n\nCongress passes a stopgap funding bill to keep the government open another week, eliminating the threat of a shutdown starting on Trump's 100th day in office. He signs an executive order that could eventually open up Arctic waters and millions of coastal acres off U.S. shores to oil and gas drilling. He heads to Atlanta to speak at the National Rifle Association convention, where he vows to defend gun rights and reminisces about his election victory.\n\nDay 100: April 29\n\nTrump is set to hold a campaign rally in Harrisburg, Pa., as White House correspondents hold their annual dinner in Washington that is traditionally attended by the president.\n\nContributing: Katie Smith, David Jackson, Gregory Korte, Donovan Slack\n\nUSA TODAY coverage of Trump's first 100 days:\n\n100 days into Trump presidency, Americans are united on this: They're divided\n\nTrump’s 5 biggest wins and losses in Congress in his first 100 days\n\nOne Republican congressman's wild ride on the Trump train\n\nIn Gettysburg speech, Trump made 100 days of promises.

Russian troops are retreating en mass, having lost more territory in a week than they captured in five months.\n\nChina has so far refused to outright condemn Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine while stepping up economic assistance to its neighbor, boosting bilateral trade to record levels in a boon to Russian business amid Western sanctions.\n\n“We highly appreciate the balanced position of our Chinese friends in connection with the Ukrainian crisis. We understand your questions and concerns in this regard,” Putin said in an opening speech of the meeting. “During today’s meeting, of course, we will explain in detail our position on this issue, although we have spoken about this before.”\n\nXi said China would “work with Russia to extend strong mutual support on issues concerning each other’s core interests” and “play a leading role in injecting stability and positive energy into a world of change and disorder,” according to a readout from the meeting provided by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nXi also said he appreciated “Russia’s adherence to the one-China principle and stressed that Taiwan is a part of China.”\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, on Thursday. Alexandr Demyanchuk/Sputnik/Kremlin Pool Photo via AP\n\nThe two authoritarian leaders have emerged as close partners in recent years, propelled by growing conflict with the West and a strong personal bond.\n\nChina has offered tacit support for Russia’s actions in Ukraine, while Moscow has backed Beijing and criticized Washington over US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei in August. Beijing responded to her trip with unprecedented military drills around the self-governing democratic island, which it claims as its own territory.\n\nThe White House sought to downplay the meeting between Putin and Xi on Thursday, saying Beijing had not yet violated Western sanctions on Moscow nor provided direct material assistance to Russia.\n\n“Our message to China, I think, been consistent: that this is not the time for any kind of business as usual with Mr. Putin, given what he’s done inside Ukraine. This is not the time to be isolated from the rest of the international community, which has largely condemned what he’s doing in Ukraine and not only condemned it, but stepped up to help the Ukrainians defend themselves and their territorial integrity,” National Security Council coordinator for strategic communications John Kirby told CNN.\n\nKirby said Putin was “very much under strain and stress. In Ukraine, his army is not doing well, and I think it certainly behooves the Kremlin to want to cozy up to Beijing with respect to what’s going on there.”\n\nIn their meeting Thursday, Putin condemned the United States for what he said were “provocations” in the Taiwan Strait, and criticized what he claimed were attempts to “create a unipolar world.” Those attempts, he said, have “recently taken an ugly shape and are absolutely unacceptable to most states on the planet.”\n\nThe two are holding talks on the sidelines of a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional security-focused grouping that also includes India, Pakistan and four Central Asian nations.\n\nIn a symbolic show of force and unity, Russian and Chinese navies conducted joint patrols and exercises in the Pacific Ocean just hours before their leaders’ meeting, according to Russia’s Ministry of Defense.\n\nAt the start of the meeting Thursday, Putin stressed the deepening economic ties between China and Russia, noting bilateral trade exceeded $140 billion last year. “I am convinced that by the end of the year we will reach new record levels, and in the near future, as agreed, we will increase our annual trade turnover to $200 billion or more,” he said.\n\nPutin last met with Xi during a visit to the Chinese capital for its Winter Olympics in February this year. It was at that meeting that the two leaders framed their “no-limits’ partnership, and released a 5,000-word document voicing their shared opposition to the “further enlargement of NATO.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Russia's invasion of Ukraine reveals 'limits' of Russia-China relations 03:05 - Source: CNN\n\nFor Xi, meanwhile, Thursday’s meeting comes as part of his first trip outside of China’s borders in more than two years, and just weeks before he seeks to secure a norm-breaking third term at a major political meeting in Beijing – a move that will cement his status as China’s most powerful leader in decades.\n\nChina has turned increasingly inward since the beginning of the pandemic, and continues to maintain a strict zero-Covid policy that limits outbound travel.\n\nXi’s trip to Central Asia is a return to the world stage and offers him an opportunity to show that despite growing tensions with the West, China still has friends and partners and is ready to reassert its global influence.\n\nBefore arriving at the summit, Xi visited Kazakhstan, where he unveiled in 2013 his flagship Belt and Road Initiative, a massive infrastructure project that stretches from East Asia to Europe.\n\nIn a meeting with Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Wednesday, Xi said China would like to partner with Kazakhstan to “remain pioneers in Belt and Road cooperation.”\n\nXi also told Tokayev that “China will always support Kazakhstan in maintaining national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Chinese state media reported.\n\nThe Chinese leader traveled to Uzbekistan on Wednesday evening and met with Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev.

How can a community learn and be better?” Joseph said to CNN Monday.\n\nOn October 22, Bobbi was walking through her Caldwell, New Jersey, neighborhood, spraying a homemade mixture to kill lanternflies. The 4th-grader had first learned about the spotted lanternfly last summer. Once she found out the invasive species damages trees by feeding on the sap found in leaves and tree trunks, she wanted to stop the infestation. On this fall morning, she was excited to see if the mixture whose recipe she found on Tik Tok would work.\n\n“That’s her thing,” Joseph told CNN. “She’s going to kill the lanternflies, especially if they’re on a tree. That’s what she’s going to do.”\n\nSo, when her neighbor’s call led to police stopping and questioning the child, Joseph said she was very confused and upset. In the call, Gordon Lawshe told the dispatcher, “There’s a little Black woman walking, spraying stuff on the sidewalks and trees on Elizabeth and Florence. I don’t know what the hell she’s doing. Scares me, though.”\n\nWhen asked for a description, Lawshe told the dispatcher that she was a “real tiny woman” and wearing a “hood.”\n\nBobbi was invited to tour Yale last week. Courtesy Dr. Ijeoma Opara\n\nAccording to Joseph, Lawshe initially told her that he thought Bobbi was either a “lost little girl” or a “little old lady with dementia.” He immediately apologized, but Joseph couldn’t understand why he’d call the police instead of figuring out himself who the girl was, especially since their families knew each other and have been friendly for years.\n\nLawshe’s attorney, Gregory Mascera, told CNN in an emailed statement that, “He (Lawshe) did not want to become involved in a confrontation, so he called the Caldwell police to look into the matter. Mr. Lawshe did not call 911 but called the police non-emergency dispatch line. Mr. Lawshe had no reason to believe that he would be putting anyone in harm’s way by calling the police.”\n\nAccording to Mascera, Lawshe attempted to again apologize to Joseph and her daughter the following morning.\n\n“Mr. Lawshe told Mrs. Joseph that had he known that it was her daughter that he had seen, he certainly would not have called the police. Mrs. Joseph did not accept Mr. Lawshe’s apology.”\n\nThe ‘adultification’ of Black girls\n\nJoseph points out that, in a country perpetually plagued with police killing unarmed Black and brown children, Lawshe should understand that he put her daughter in harm’s way. They’ve been next-door-neighbors for nearly eight years, so she can’t understand not only how he didn’t recognize Bobbi but also why he’d see a 9-year-old girl as an adult woman.\n\nThis incident underscores the “adultification bias” that young Black girls like Bobbi face in American society, Rebecca Epstein, the executive director of the Georgetown Law Center on Poverty and Inequality, told CNN.\n\nIn 2017, the center released “Girlhood Interrupted: The Erasure of Black Girls’ Childhood,” a quantitative analysis showing that adults perceive Black girls as less innocent and less worthy of protection than White girls and explaining how this bias subsequently makes Black girls targets of harsh treatment by police.\n\n“It’s a very pervasive form of bias that does not know boundaries, in terms of which fields it occurs in. In emergency rooms, we’re seeing it affect the treatment and diagnosis of Black girls. In schools, we’re seeing it come up in the form of harsher and more frequent discipline against Black girls,” Epstein said in an interview with CNN.\n\nWhile Epstein noted the police handled the situation with Bobbi extremely well, she also pointed to times where they didn’t – like last year when a Rochester police officer handcuffed a 9-year-old Black girl, put her in the back of a police car, and remarked “you’re acting like a child” before pepper-spraying her as she cried out for her father.\n\nThere are “statistics that unequivocally show that Black people of whatever age and whatever gender are treated more harshly and violently than white people. And if that’s not known, it should be,” Epstein added.\n\nJoseph said Bobbi has not been the same since that day. She’s confused and still trying to process everything, much like the rest of the family.\n\n“I’m her mom. I’m doing my job to shield her from as much as I can.” But with the continued support comes the constant reminder of her experience being stopped by police.\n\nAfter the officer realized Bobbi was a child, he waited with her until Joseph came walking down the sidewalk to see what was happening.\n\n“Am I in trouble?” Joseph recalls Bobbi asking once she arrived. Joseph pulled her daughter close while both she and the officer reassured her that nothing was wrong.\n\n“When she asked that, I knew that while she was holding it in, she was scared,” Joseph said. “I immediately went into mommy mode.”\n\nA community rallies behind Bobbi\n\nJohn Kelly, the mayor of Caldwell, told CNN he was “horrified” by the incident. He said he immediately apologized to Joseph once he heard about the call and assured her that she and Bobbi had his support.\n\nKelly said he’s not prepared to label the incident racist, but that he’d be naïve to believe racism does not exist – in Caldwell and nationwide.\n\n“The fact that this was a Black family in a predominately White neighborhood certainly introduced race to the equation,” he said.\n\nCalling the police on a 9-year-old girl, regardless of the race of the individuals, is very troubling, Kelly said.\n\nOnce the responding officer exited the vehicle, he quickly realized that Bobbi was a preadolescent girl and saw she was only catching lanternflies. This immediately de-escalated the situation, according to Kelly, who was thankful for the police’s handling of the situation.\n\nLater, the West Caldwell Police Department invited Joseph and her daughters to tour the station and assured the family that there’s no reason to be afraid of them.\n\nJoseph says she she’s received a lot of support, and some friends in the area have even set up a GoFundMe to “support Monique, Bobbi and Hayden.”\n\nOlder sister Hayden, 13, spoke at a city council meeting on Nov. 1 to discuss the racist implications and the emotional impact of Lawshe carelessly calling the police on her 9-year-old sister.\n\n“She was not only doing something amazing for our environment, she was doing something that made her feel like a hero,” Hayden said in her speech to the city council, Bobbi standing right beside her.\n\n“What Mr. Gordon Lawshe did to my sister was extremely offensive, traumatic, and scarring towards my family. I can confidently assure you guys that she will never forget this,” she added.\n\nThe Caldwell Environmental Commission voted unanimously to award Bobbi one of their annual Sustainability Awards – given to those who have helped to better the town’s environment – once they heard about Bobbi’s mission to save the neighborhood trees from lanternflies. They plan to formally grant her the award during the December 6 city council meeting.\n\n“Bobbi Wilson is a recipient of this award this year as she has tried very hard to eradicate lantern flies from the trees on her street. We are very proud of her efforts and are happy to give her this certificate to recognize her efforts,” they said in an emailed statement to CNN.\n\nAfter clips of the council meeting went viral on social media, the family began receiving national support from people like science writer Jason Bittel and Ijeoma Opara, an assistant professor at Yale.\n\nBobbi -- with her sister, left, and mom, right -- looks at butterflies during a tour at Yale. Courtesy Dr. Ijeoma Opara\n\nBittel is a freelance writer whose articles on scientific studies and human-animal conflicts have been published in The New York Times and The Washington Post. Last month National Geographic published a story he wrote on spotted lanternflies. He told CNN he was outraged about Bobbi’s story and wanted to send her free copies of the science-related children’s books that he’s written.\n\n“This, to me, was the worst possible affront to that little bit of wonder that she was experiencing,” Bittel said.\n\nBittel also organized a Twitter campaign seeking donations to Bobbi of science books, animal stickers, and other biology-related swag.\n\n“People just want to make sure that this little budding naturalist, scientist, chemist … that she doesn’t lose her spark,” Bittel said.\n\nJoseph told CNN that Bobbi reads every single night, so she’s “really excited” about receiving the books from Bittel and his associates. Opara is an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, and she runs the “Black Girls Go to Yale” program. She invited Bobbi and her family to Yale University and gave them a tour of the institution on November 15.\n\nDuring the tour, to the surprise of even Opara, Yale Entomology announced they’ll ensure Bobbi’s name is always attributed to the lantern flies or any other specimens she contributes, according to the Entomology Collections Manager of the Yale Peabody Museum.\n\n“It’s beautiful to be able to replace that memory of somebody calling the cops on her for doing something that she was excited about to now people clapping, awarding her,” Opara said.\n\n“They don’t want her to lose her fire and her passion for doing this work.”", "authors": ["Jalen Brown Meron Moges-Gerbi", "Jalen Brown", "Meron Moges-Gerbi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}]}

Some industry experts are now predicting an advertiser exodus could be coming sooner than expected.\n\nWithin the first 24 hours of his ownership, there were several reports that racist comments, hate speech and other objectionable content had increased significantly on Twitter as users tested Musk’s promise that he would allow “free speech” on the platform. Then over the weekend, Musk was widely criticized for tweeting (then deleting without providing a reason) a link to a fringe conspiracy theory about the violent attack on Paul Pelosi, husband of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n“I think advertisers are bracing to leave,” said Claire Atkin, co-founder of the adtech watchdog Check My Ads. “It’s very possibly a seismic shift for marketers and advertisers.”\n\nAfter months of uncertainty about Musk’s pending acquisition, advertisers must now confront questions around how Musk will change the platform, which is already an also-ran in the digital ad space despite its outsized political influence. Musk, known as both an innovative entrepreneur and an erratic figure, has promised to rethink Twitter’s content moderation policies and undo permanent bans of controversial figures, including former President Donald Trump.\n\nBrands have long been sensitive to the types of content their ads run against, an issue made more complicated by social media. Most marketers bristle at the thought of having their ads run alongside toxic content such as hate speech, pornography or misinformation. And if Twitter continues to struggle with an uptick in such content — or if Musk updates Twitter’s policies to explicitly allow some of it — companies may cease advertising there for fear of risks to their brands, or because they’re reaching a smaller audience if regular users also depart.\n\n“If you think about the money, investment and care, real care and attention that goes into connecting with consumers, and then to have your ad be published next to lies … it goes against everything a brand wants to do,” Atkin said.\n\nMusk, who has previously tweeted “I hate advertising” and indicated he wants to make the platform less reliant on it, is also confronting the reality that about 90% of Twitter’s revenue comes from advertising. In addition to the open letter to advertisers, Musk’s team spent Monday “meeting with the marketing and advertising community” in New York, according to Jason Calacanis, a member of Musk’s inner circle.\n\nIn public and private conversations with advertisers, Twitter has also stressed that its content policies have not changed following the acquisition, and Musk has said they won’t change until a new content moderation council is appointed (apparently to replace the company’s existing Trust and Safety council).\n\nBut Musk may face an uphill battle. Twitter’s digital advertising business is much smaller than those of Meta, Google and Amazon, and doesn’t have growth and user demographics of TikTok. And many brands have already reduced digital ad spending in recent months amid the economic downturn. It may not take much for brands to cut back more.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM), which competes with Musk’s Tesla (TSLA), said on Friday it would pause paying for advertising on Twitter while it evaluates “Twitter’s new direction.” CNN on Monday reached out to more than a dozen other brands that advertise on Twitter, most of which did not respond. Toyota (TM), another Tesla (TSLA) competitor, told CNN that it is “in discussions with key stakeholders and monitoring the situation” on Twitter. Ben & Jerry’s said that “at this point we have not considered taking any action.”\n\nOn Monday, advertising giant Interpublic Group advised clients to pause advertising on Twitter for the next week as it awaits more clarity on the platform’s plans for trust and safety and its capacity to carry out those plans under new owner Elon Musk, a person familiar with the situation told CNN. The guidance was sent via an internal memo to IPG employees who work with clients in its Mediabrands ad-buying arm, which include major consumer brands including Coca Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Spotify, Unilever and more.\n\nAlso on Monday, the Global Alliance of Responsible Media, a leading consortium of advertisers and platforms, including Twitter, published an open letter to Musk, encouraging him to ensure Twitter continues to align with the group’s standards, which designate hate speech, violence, harassment and insensitive treatment of debated social issues as “not appropriate for any advertising support.” In response to the letter, Musk said in a tweet, “Twitter’s commitment to brand safety is unchanged,” and Twitter Chief Customer Officer Sarah Personette added that the company takes seriously brand safety and its partnership with the organization. (Personette tweeted on Tuesday that she resigned from the company last week.)\n\nAlso on Monday, Angelo Carusone, CEO of media watchdog Media Matters for America, tweeted calling on major Twitter advertisers “to be putting pressure on Twitter right now” to better address the increase in hate and other toxic content. On Tuesday, a group of more than 40 civil society organizations, including Media Matters, the NAACP, GLAAD and the Center for Countering Digital Hate, sent an open letter to Twitter’s top advertisers calling on them to halt advertising on the platform if Musk cuts back on content moderation.\n\n“Advertisers are very sensitive to the changing landscape of social media,” said Atkin, adding that the question for Twitter is now “whether Elon Musk can continue to broker trust with advertisers or if he’s going to continue to sow uncertainty and fear.”\n\nIn response to a request for comment on this story, a Twitter representative pointed CNN to the earlier tweets by Musk and Personette and Musk’s letter to advertisers, as well as a tweet by Twitter Head of Safety and Integrity Yoel Roth noting that the platform’s policies hadn’t changed, although it was facing an uptick in hate content from mostly non-human accounts.\n\nIn a separate tweet thread Monday, Roth said that the company had since Saturday “been focused on addressing the surge in hateful conduct on Twitter.” He added: “We’ve made measurable progress, removing more than 1500 accounts and reducing impressions on this content to nearly zero.”\n\n‘A reasonable time to rethink things’\n\nOne advertising executive told CNN on Monday that dozens of their clients had reached out in recent days for guidance on the situation.\n\n“It seems like a reasonable time for advertisers to rethink things,” said David Karpf, associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University. “I think advertisers are going to look at this and say, is the weak Twitter advertising product becoming a better or worse investment? And it’s going to be the same or a little worse … advertisers certainly aren’t going to start spending more on Twitter anytime soon.”\n\nThere is precedent for advertisers stepping away from platforms because of hateful content. In 2020, dozens of brands publicly signed on to the #StopHateForProfit advertiser boycott of Facebook, which called out the platform for its “repeated failure to meaningfully address the vast proliferation of hate on its platforms.”\n\nBut when it comes to Twitter, brands may have to tread carefully to avoid backlash. After GM announced its Twitter advertising pause, some users on the platform, including some right-leaning political figures, have called for a boycott of the automaker.\n\nBecause Musk has positioned himself as a “free speech” maximalist, and one with strong support among many conservative politicians, brands risk being framed as anti-free speech if they exit the platform. But brands also risk appearing to implicitly endorse hate speech and other harmful content if they stay, meaning that many may decide to quietly pause their advertising on the site without a formal announcement.\n\n“Advertisers are finding it hard to weigh in publicly on what is kind of an unwinnable position to take,” the advertising executive told CNN.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/tech/facebook-internet-tracking-settlement/index.html", "title": "Meta agrees to pay $90 million to settle lawsuit over Facebook ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFacebook (FB)-parent Meta has agreed to pay $90 million to settle a decade-old class action lawsuit over a practice that allowed the social network to track users’ activity across the internet, even if they had logged out of the platform.\n\nThe settlement, announced on Tuesday, is one of the largest in the history of the social media company, but it’s unlikely to impact the bottom line of the $590 billion internet giant. If approved, the agreement will also rank among the 10 largest data privacy class action settlements in the United States, according to DiCello Levitt Gutzler, one of the law firms involved in bringing the case.\n\n“Reaching a settlement in this case, which is more than a decade old, is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders and we’re glad to move past this issue,” Meta spokesperson Drew Pusateri said in a statement to CNN Business. The company has denied any wrongdoing as part of the deal.\n\nThe case, filed in 2012, dates back to a 2010 update by Facebook called “Open Graph,” which was designed to give users’ friends a closer look at their activity and interests across the internet. As part of the update, the company launched a “Like” button plug-in on sites across the internet, which users could hit to highlight their interests to their Facebook networks.\n\nThe “Like” button plug-in also allowed Facebook to gather data, using cookies, about users’ activity on that site — including, for example, what sites they visit, items they viewed or purchased, and communications they had with that site — regardless of whether the user actually used the button or even knew it was there, according to court documents.\n\nTo alleviate privacy concerns, the company said at the time that it would not collect user-identifying cookies about a user’s activity on partner websites while they were logged out of Facebook. However, researchers found that Facebook continued to collect some identifying cookies on users’ internet activity even after they logged out of the platform, contrary to its promise. After the issue was publicized in 2011, Facebook initially defended the practice but later issued a fix and clarified its policies. The class members in the case accused the company of breach of contract.\n\nThe legal battle dragged on for years. In 2017, after the plaintiffs had submitted a third updated complaint, a judge granted Facebook’s motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal and in 2020, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit partly reversed the decision. Facebook appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case, opening the door for the parties to begin negotiating the settlement.\n\nThe settlement applies to US Facebook users who had an account between April 22, 2010, and September 26, 2011, and who visited non-Facebook websites that displayed the “Like” button, a list that included everything from Pandora to ESPN.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Meta agreed to delete the user data it collected through this practice.\n\n“It’s truly a wake-up call for internet and advertising companies who collect user data and use advanced browser tracking,” Stephen Grygiel, one of the lead attorneys representing the class members, said in a statement about the settlement.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/opinions/liz-cheney-seat-loss-wierson-honan/index.html", "title": "Opinion: In Cheney's loss, Biden has an opportunity | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Arick Wierson is an Emmy Award-winning television producer and former senior media adviser to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

And they might be right. But Liz Cheney made it clear in her barn burner of a concession speech that she is not planning to ride off quietly into the sunset; rather, she plans to “do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it.”\n\nArick Wierson Tunheim\n\nNo longer chained to a party whose leaders have abandoned its core values and principles, Cheney is now poised to become the Obi-Wan Kenobi of American politics. Like Kenobi’s famous line in “Star Wars,” “If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine,” uttered moments before he’s killed by Darth Vader, the same can now also be said about Cheney.\n\nBradley Honan c/o Bradley Honan\n\nBut with her rejection from Republican voters in Wyoming comes an unparalleled opportunity for President Joe Biden and the Democrats, and one they should not squander.\n\nAs a conservative with a dynastic last name who, in this hyper-partisan climate, wields uncommon and genuine respect on both sides of the aisle, Cheney would be a valuable addition to the Biden administration. The President should appoint her as a cabinet-level czar on election integrity and the preservation of democracy once her term is up in January. Creating this post would allow her to continue the work she so adroitly began as the co-chair of the January 6th Committee and empower her to fight against the violent and pseudo-autocratic undercurrents that have seeped into conservative politics and pose a real existential threat to our democracy.\n\nWe don’t agree with much, if any, of Cheney’s politics, but at this point, when our democracy is hanging on by a bare thread, principles trump policy, and we commend Cheney for sticking to her guns amid a hail of incoming fire.\n\nSadly, Cheney was one of the last Republicans standing among those who voted to impeach Trump. Regardless what anyone thinks of her political stances, Cheney has displayed courageous leadership in the face of staunch opposition and even threats to her physical safety. She has proven her mettle as an unapologetic defender of democracy and the rule of law.\n\nIn her concession speech on Tuesday, Cheney made no formal commitments about what the future may hold for her beyond her work as co-chair of the January 6th Committee, but her speech left the door wide open for any number of moves down the road.\n\nShe invoked the name of President Abraham Lincoln, a Republican who lost a US Senate bid only a few years before winning the presidency – a move that surely added to already rampant speculation that she too might seek the nation’s highest office.\n\nBut should Trump declare himself a presidential candidate for 2024, a Cheney run in a Republican primary would likely be nothing more than a constant irritant. She would likely use the megaphone that comes with a national profile to blanket the media with strong anti-Trump messaging and truth telling in the hopes of chipping away at the former President’s support among those who might be on the fence about backing him a third time.\n\nBut primarying Trump is not Cheney’s best play. Nor is running as an independent, a move that might actually serve Trump’s interests by splitting the conservative anti-Trump vote. And certainly, what the country does not need is another ex-pol turned TV pundit.\n\nCheney’s smartest move would be to join the Biden administration in a bespoke senior-level role where her mandate is clear: coordinate the fight for free and fair elections and wage all-out war against the anti-American and undemocratic forces that Trumpism has unleashed. Cheney is the ideal crusader in this fight.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nSuch a move by Biden certainly has ample precedent. Both Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama appointed notable Republicans to serve in their Cabinets. The symbolism of bringing members from an opposing party into an administration is a strong signal of bipartisanship, putting the country ahead of party. Placing a high-profile conservative like Cheney in a senior-level position would be a powerful signal to our nation’s shared, bipartisan commitment to the rule of law and the right to free and fair elections.\n\nThis is a perilous time for our democracy, and Biden should recognize that Cheney can be a national force for good by taking the helm of our nation’s fight to push back the dark, homegrown forces and ideologies that threaten our future. It’s clear that, despite her Tuesday night primary defeat, her star continues to shine brightly.\n\nBiden would be well-served to act decisively and harness her star power.", "authors": ["Arick Wierson Bradley Honan", "Arick Wierson", "Bradley Honan"], "publish_date": "2022/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/tech/tech-layoffs-workers-silicon-valley/index.html", "title": "The balance of power is shifting in the tech industry | CNN Business", "text": "San Francisco CNN Business —\n\nFor much of the past decade, tech companies have showered their corporate employees with money and lavish perks to attract and retain talent in a hyper-competitive industry. That dynamic only kicked into overdrive the past couple of years amid a pandemic-fueled boom for tech products and services.\n\n“The hiring … was off the charts, paying [salaries] that were probably too high or out of range, where companies would hire four or five people for a sales position when they really only needed two,” said Bill McHargue, founder of San Francisco-based recruitment firm Talent House.\n\nBut the situation has started to cool as the tech industry and the broader economy have been hit by the perfect storm of inflation, rising interest rates, fears of a recession and Russia’s war in Ukraine. A wave of tech companies that had been aggressively hiring, from Netflix (NFLX) to Coinbase, have announced layoffs in recent weeks. Many others are also moving to cut costs, with Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT), Snap (SNAP), Twitter (TWTR) and Apple (AAPL) all planning to slow or pause hiring.\n\n“They’re not going to hire as many people, they’re going to do much more due diligence, that interview process is going to take a lot longer, the [compensation] is going to get a little bit softer,” said McHargue, whose firm mainly works with early-stage startups.\n\n“I think it’s back to some realistic numbers,” he added, describing the current reduction as returning to pre-pandemic levels. “I think the correction was going to happen, it had to happen, now we just don’t know how long it’s going to last.”\n\nFor some tech workers, that could mean whiplash — not just in how easily they can secure a high-paying job, but also in how much leverage they have with management in pushing for specific workplace conditions.\n\nExperienced senior engineers at major tech companies may still have an upper hand in the job market, but the downturn may serve up a reality check for tech employees used to getting what they want, whether it was office perks pre-pandemic or going up against their corporate overlords during the pandemic for the right to work however and wherever they wanted.\n\nDuring the tech boom of the past decade, “competition for employees created a Disney-esque set of experiences/expectations in high tech companies,” prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist Bill Gurley, an early investor in Uber, wrote in a recent Twitter thread. “For employees that have only known this world, the idea of layoffs or cost reduction (or being asked to come into the office) is straight up heresy,” he added.\n\nNow, billionaire CEOs of some of tech’s biggest companies are starting to adopt a sterner approach, implying that employees must either shape up or ship out — possibly with the intention of encouraging layoffs by attrition.\n\n“Realistically, there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn’t be here,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly told employees in a Q&A session last week. “Part of my hope by raising expectations and having more aggressive goals, and just kind of turning up the heat a little bit, is that I think some of you might decide that this place isn’t for you, and that self-selection is OK with me.” Meta did not respond to a request for comment from CNN Business.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk also issued an ultimatum last month — weeks before announcing layoffs — that workers who don’t come to the office at least 40 hours a week should leave the company, in a sharp departure from the current policies of many tech companies, including Twitter, which he has agreed to acquire.\n\nReturning to the office is one of the most hot-button issues that tech employers and employees have clashed over. Amir Hamja/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut the growth in worker activism spurred by the pandemic and the willingness of employees to advocate for their interests — including their comfort level with being back in an office — may not be that easy to reverse overnight, according to Y-Vonne Hutchinson, founder of inclusion consultancy firm ReadySet.\n\n“The demand for tech and knowledge workers is still global, and there’s still a shortfall,” Hutchinson said. “So I think that workers that don’t want to go back into that environment aren’t going to.”\n\nIn fact, across the tech industry, the downturn may produce a more favorable outcome for tech employees fighting for the right to work remotely, according to Nicholas Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University whose research focuses on workplace management issues.\n\n“For some industries, like banking, a recession will give management more leverage to force employees back to the office. Tech seems to be going the other way,” said Bloom. “Right now most tech firms are giving employees roughly what they want, which is about two days a week in the office.”\n\nBut the move towards remote work could end up being a double-edged sword for many American tech employees, particularly in places like Silicon Valley, with the possibility of companies using it to cut costs further.\n\n“As we enter a recession tech firms will tighten belts by cutting back on office space and moving to hire cheaper workers outside big cities and abroad,” Bloom said, mentioning countries such as India and Mexico as destinations for outsourced jobs.\n\nHarley Lippman, CEO of technology staffing firm Genesis10, said one trend that he sees starting to emerge is a greater tendency to hire contractors rather than permanent employees because of the flexibility it provides companies. “Work still has to get done,” he said.\n\nWhatever form it ultimately takes, it’s clear that tech employees will have to brace for a significant course correction across their industry.\n\n“We saw candidates take offers and then not show up at the new company. Like, that happened,” said McHargue. “I don’t think we’re going to see that sort of thing.”", "authors": ["Rishi Iyengar"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/06/tech/marjorie-taylor-greene-big-tech/index.html", "title": "Republicans wasted no time dragging Big Tech into the culture wars ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAlmost exactly one year after the Capitol insurrection that led to former President Donald Trump being suspended from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, Big Tech was again in the political crosshairs this week for cracking down on an account from another Republican.\n\nOn Sunday, Twitter permanently banned one of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s accounts over multiple violations of the company’s Covid-19 misinformation policy. The final straw, a person familiar with the decision told CNN, was a tweet containing a graph that misleadingly purported to show deaths related to Covid-19 vaccines, a statistic Greene claimed has been ignored. (All Covid-19 vaccines available in the United States have been scientifically proven to be extremely safe and highly effective.)\n\nSince the insurrection, Republicans have only stepped up their attacks on Big Tech platforms as mustache-twirling manipulators of partisan politics. And judging by the backlash from Greene and her allies this week, Republicans seem determined to make Big Tech a central ideological villain in 2022. But even as many have labeled this year a “do or die” moment for tech regulation, the strident, almost gleeful attempts by some politicians to caricature tech platforms risks setting back the effort and further endangers those who would benefit the most from tougher tech oversight — everyday users, including their own constituents who are being bombarded daily by public health misinformation and conspiracy theories.\n\nIn a statement following the ban, Greene labeled Twitter “an enemy to America.” Within hours, Greene began fundraising off of the ban and hinted at “big plans to fight back,” though she currently sits on no congressional committees and, according to a CNN analysis, spends most of her time filing politically charged yet moribund legislation. Greene also claimed to have been locked out of her Facebook account for 24 hours. (Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, later acknowledged having removed one of Greene’s posts for violating its policies but said removing her account was “beyond the scope of our policies.”)\n\nAs if in lockstep, other prominent Republicans chimed in Monday to level their own allegations of Big Tech censorship. Trump called Twitter a “disgrace to democracy” and a “low-life” along with Facebook, and encouraged followers to “drop off” of both platforms. Sen. Rand Paul announced in an op-ed that he was “quitting YouTube” as a New Year’s resolution and urged his followers to join him on alternative social media platforms. House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy issued a statement decrying what he said was a “dangerous” decision by Twitter.\n\n“It is clear any speech that does not fit Big Tech’s orthodoxy gets muzzled,” McCarthy said.\n\nThese sorts of criticisms are hardly new. For years, they have been identified and described as attempts to “work the refs” — the refs, in this context, being social media platforms. Social media companies have vocally denied that their technologies are ideologically biased — statements that put them on the hook with investors, financial regulators and consumer protection authorities — and reports routinely highlight how some platforms have even bent over backwards to accommodate conservatives. Credible, non-partisan reporting has not proven the allegations of anti-conservative bias in any meaningful, systemic sense. Research has shown that conservative voices on social media are sometimes among the loudest and most influential, and that misinformation from right-wing sources can be far more successful at driving engagement compared to left-wing misinformation and even credible conservative sources.\n\nBut as the country barrels toward another round of high-stakes elections this year in which social media will surely play a pivotal role, expect Republican claims of Big Tech’s bias to intensify further.\n\nGreene and other lawmakers’ vilification of tech platforms as partisan actors fits into a much broader pattern reflecting America’s dysfunctional politics. Many of the country’s biggest political battles today are no longer about the what of politics — as in, which concrete laws and policies will serve the public best and hopefully leave Americans better off — but about the how of politics. Who gets to vote and when; which judges get to serve on the Supreme Court; and now increasingly, who gets to say what on private social media platforms.\n\nDrawing tech platforms into the middle of the culture war grants considerable benefits to the politician willing to do it. So long as users like Greene enjoy exposure on a mainstream platform, they can use it to amplify fringe conspiracy theories that otherwise would not receive airtime. And when they are finally exiled from the platform for those claims, they can use their supposed outsider status to activate an engaged base of donors and voters who are already primed to believe the platform was motivated to discriminate.\n\nUnderscoring the point, Greene posted on an alternative social media platform after her ban that “silly punishments” do nothing but “make me more determined, stronger, & effective.” She hinted vaguely that her Twitter ban “started very big things” and claimed, without evidence, that “the sun is setting on Twitter.”\n\nSome close to the tech industry say public figures know they can capitalize on the attention generated by social media bans, even ones that were made by mistake. “Political groups privately admit that nothing juices their web traffic more than an accidental account suspension,” tweeted Nu Wexler, a former Washington-based spokesman for Facebook, Google and Twitter.\n\nSo imagine the dividends that Greene is likely to reap this week from her ban from Twitter. By the time she was permanently suspended, Greene’s main account had earned temporary suspensions at least three times for violating Twitter’s policies. (Her official congressional account remains unblocked.)\n\nIt’s not just the politicians that stand to benefit from this song-and-dance. If the tech companies must be dragged into the culture war, the logic seems to go, then they may as well play the game, too. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that in meetings with conservatives about its whistleblower problem, Facebook’s strategy was to discredit former employee Frances Haugen as a Democratic activist. According to the Journal, the goal was to keep Republicans and Democrats from uniting and erecting tougher regulations for social media platforms. (Facebook has previously said the Journal’s reporting on Haugen’s leaks mischaracterized the platform’s internal research. The company responded to the Journal’s latest report by saying that it would defend its record and not apologize for mischaracterizations of its work.)\n\nTech platforms do currently face a certain level of legislative risk. In recent months, House lawmakers have coalesced around the idea of imposing new requirements on algorithms. Other bills are in play that target the platforms’ market dominance, their impact on teen mental health, and consumer privacy. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who chairs a Senate subcommittee on consumer protection, told CNN Business he intends to introduce a new proposal this year meant to protect kids online, though he declined to give specifics.\n\n“Congress must seize this historic moment — a pivotal turning point for reining in Big Tech,” Blumenthal said. “Having seen Big Tech’s harms and abuses, in our hearings and their own lives, Americans are ready for action — and results.”\n\nCongressional Republicans have widely expressed concerns over these same issues. But their added insistence on legislation addressing claims of anti-conservative censorship — often containing ideas of dubious constitutionality, according to First Amendment experts — has contributed to the legislative deadlock and slowed Congress’s progress on other forms of tech regulation.\n\nIt has been years of hearings, reports and press conferences on Big Tech’s alleged excesses. And yet amid the obvious standstill, a coterie of lawmakers including Greene continues to eke political mileage out of seeming perpetually on the verge of making Silicon Valley pay.\n\nThis everlasting limbo highlights a perverse incentive that afflicts not just members on the right, but those on the left, too. So long as Big Tech remains politically useful to elected officials as a punching bag and an object of the culture wars, the public may be the one that pays.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/03/media/new-year-2022-questions/index.html", "title": "The most pressing questions about media, tech, Covid-19 and ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter.

Where the “Reliable Sources” team assembles, the wall carries a reminder that “news is only the first rough draft of history,” a maxim first attributed to Alan Barth.\n\nThe halls are empty again due to the extraordinary surge in Covid cases right now. CNN and other major media companies have paused return-to-office plans and reverted to essential personnel only, hopefully just for a period of weeks, while Omicron is on the march. The empty office is a humbling reality, much as “first rough draft” quotation is a reminder about the limitations of journalism. We can’t always see around the corner. We can screw up when we try.\n\nSo: I’m not making any grand pronouncements or sweeping predictions about 2022 here. Instead, I’m sharing stories from some of the wisest people in the media world, along with some questions that may be answered in the months ahead.\n\nQuestions for 2022, news and politics\n\n– Will the midterm elections rejuvenate engagement and subscription stats for news publishers?\n\n– Brian Lowry asks: “How will the Jan. 6 Committee play as a TV show, once the televised portions begin?”\n\n– Which authors will surprise everyone with new books about the aftermath of the Trump years?\n\n– What will CNN and MSNBC decide to do in the key 9 p.m. Eastern hour?\n\n– Will Tucker Carlson remain all-powerful at Fox News? Who will Fox choose as his 7 p.m. lead-in?\n\n– With Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell’s contracts coming up for renewal, what is Neeraj Khemlani’s master plan for CBS News?\n\n– Which Oz will fare better: Mehmet, in Pennsylvania’s GOP primary, or his daughter Daphne, co-hosting a show in his former time slot?\n\n– Will Congress make any meaningful moves against Big Tech?\n\n– Oliver Darcy asks: “What will become of Trump’s ‘Truth Social’ app concept? Will it actually launch?”\n\n– When can we start to talk about Covid-19 in the past tense?\n\nQuestions for 2022, business and entertainment\n\n– Brian Lowry asks: “Will streaming start to consolidate, given the assumption that some of the go-it-alone players lack the necessary bulk to survive?”\n\n– When will the Discovery-WarnerMedia deal take effect and what will change at the combined company?\n\n– How will Bob Chapek “re-fire the creative engines” at Disney?\n\n– Where will the next “Squid Game” come from, and will it be on Netflix or a rival?\n\n– Will Parag Agrawal make any major moves in his first few months running Twitter?\n\n– Will TikTok continue its explosive growth or will copycats like Reels slow it down?\n\n– Who or what will buy Tegna? What else is up for sale?\n\n– Brian Lowry asks: “Can awards shows rebound at all in 2022? Or will the losses associated with the pandemic year, and the continued uncertainty about traditional everyone-in-a-ballroom events, continue to plague them?”\n\n– Where will the “apes” take AMC Entertainment?\n\n– What will the “metaverse” look like at the end of the year? Will any major news orgs start to leverage the technology as a storytelling tool?\n\n– What’s the biggest unknown in the media business that no one is even thinking about right now?\n\nNews streaming wars\n\nCNN’s forthcoming streaming service CNN+ “has the potential to reshape the market,” Variety’s Brian Steinberg wrote in this story about the news streaming wars. Plus-sized ads for the product appeared in Times Square on New Year’s Eve. New dad Anderson Cooper announced that he’ll have a weekly show called “Parental Guidance” in addition to his show “Full Circle” which is moving over to the platform from CNN.com. And if I had to guess, I’d expect more programming news soon.\n\nA lot more streaming content is expected this year, per Steinberg’s story: “Newsmax 2,” a rebranding of CBSN, more MSNBC content on Peacock’s The Choice channel, streaming extensions of ABC’s “GMA,” and “a new show from Piers Morgan set to stream on Fox Corp. assets around the world, including Fox Nation,” just to name a few.\n\nLoss and rebirth in local news\n\nThere are, sadly, many reasons to believe that “the fortunes of the local newspaper industry will continue to decline in 2022, with journalists in remaining newsrooms stretched thin,” Elahe Izadi wrote for the Washington Post’s “Year in Preview.”\n\nShe noted Alden’s pursuit of Lee Enterprises, among other data points. “But 2022 will also be a year of new ventures and projects,” Izadi wrote. “Nonprofits such as States Newsroom, which covers state governments, will expand to states such as Alaska and Nebraska. Brand-new outlets will launch, such as the nonprofit Capital B, which aims to provide ‘high-quality civic journalism tailored to Black communities.’”\n\nNBC’s Olympic challenge\n\nWinter Olympics rights-holder NBCUniversal is under pressure “to avoid abetting China in presenting the event as a kind of nationalistic pageant, as the network will face scrutiny over how it covers the Games and the international protests against the Beijing regime,” Deadline’s Ted Johnson wrote in his look-ahead to 2022.\n\nPredictions from beat reporters\n\nRoku is “poised to become a streaming power on its own,” Puck’s Matthew Belloni says, calling it “the company to watch in 2022.” That’s what Belloni told Bloomberg’s Lucas Shaw for this 2021/2022 feature. Shaw asked other reporters for year-ahead predictions, and here are just a few:\n\n– Bloomberg’s Mark Bergen: “YouTube will make a big splash in augmented/immersive reality (but won’t call it ‘metaverse’).”\n\n– The Information’s Kaya Yurieff: “We’re going to stop romanticizing the creator economy and start having a labor discussion about internet personalities, similar to the gig economy.”\n\n– Sports Business Journal’s John Ourand: “Amazon will buy a 49% stake in the NFL’s digital media properties, including NFL Network, RedZone and NFL.com, in the first quarter of the year. That deal will not include Sunday Ticket, which will go to ESPN+ and DirecTV.”\n\nShaw is also out with a new column with his own 2022 forecasts, including “a bumpy year for streaming services” in the US; “the concert business will return to normal;” and “top of the line talent will make more money than ever before.", "authors": ["Brian Stelter"], "publish_date": "2022/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/media/platform-power-struggles-reliable-sources/index.html", "title": "Platform power struggles: Joe Rogan, Dan Bongino, banned books ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.\n\nEvery day, there’s another tug-of-war over who gets heard and where and how, another power struggle over platforming. “The battle lines over truth and falsehood aren’t just cutting across the political sphere,” CNN Opinion managing editor Rich Galant wrote on Sunday, “they are dividing people in media, music and sports.”\n\nDepending on your political affiliation and your partisan media preferences, you may care more about “Maus” being removed from a Tennessee school district or more about Dan Bongino being banned from YouTube. You may support Spotify for keeping Joe Rogan in place or you may side with the artists who have boycotted the service. Or you may not care much at all, and I’ll get to that in a minute. But first, some updates on all the “content wars” of the past few days:\n\nSpotify’s solution?\n\nJudging by the rushed nature of Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s Sunday afternoon statement, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell and Nils Lofgren were not the only artists complaining about the platform’s stance on Covid-19 B.S. Or maybe Ek was trying to stop other producers from following Brené Brown’s lead and pausing her Spotify-exclusive podcast. Or maybe he was trying to stem a wave of customer cancellations. Maybe it was all of the above.\n\nEk’s announcement didn’t mention Rogan at all. But it said Spotify is “adding a content advisory to any podcast episode that includes discussion about Covid-19,” CNN’s Ramishah Maruf wrote. “The advisory will direct listeners to a Covid-19 hub that will include links to trusted sources, the company said. Spotify will also for the first time publicly post its long-standing Platform Rules.” (Those are the very loose rules that The Verge’s Ashley Carman obtained and published on Friday.) So, in short, Spotify is doing what platforms like Twitter did at the start of the pandemic. Recode’s Peter Kafka summed it up in three words: “Nothing is changing.”\n\nBut it has the appearance of change. So will it be enough? We’ll see. Ek sure came across like a CEO in damage control mode. He said the Covid hub “will roll out to countries around the world in the coming days,” so in other words, it hasn’t even been translated into multiple languages yet. The same is true for the platform rules. Spotify seems to be doing this in a hurry. The Verge EIC Nilay Patel tweeted that the company is running “the ‘content moderation is an impossible challenge’ playbook instead of the ‘we bought and distribute this media property’ playbook.” His point: Spotify is “spending $100 million to exclusively distribute” Rogan’s show and promote it across the platform, but is portraying itself like Facebook rather than a distributor…\n\nSix Spotify notes\n\n– Kara Swisher tweeted: Tech execs like Ek “want all the power and money and none of the responsibilities when things get dicey, as things always get…”\n\n– Kat Rosenfield said on “Reliable Sources” that Rogan is “like a weed that sprang up outside the mainstream media ecosystem.” If Spotify removed him tomorrow, “it wouldn’t make a dent in his audience,” she argued. “People would still listen to him and, crucially, they still wouldn’t trust more mainstream media sources…”\n\n– Renee DiResta tweeted a similar point about the Covid info hubs promoted by Spotify and other sites: “These things add information supply,” but “they don’t address the demand, or the entertainment element…”\n\n– Kelly Weill observed that “so many US political conflicts are just proxy battles through customer service complaints,” meaning, “in a disempowered electorate, the only common sense of individual power is as a consumer who *will* be leaving an unfavorable Yelp review…”\n\n– Just how big is this Spotify story? Well, the WSJ homepage has been leading with it all evening long…\n\n– Variety: The alt-rock band Belly “wants to delete its music from Spotify, but it’s contractually complicated – so the group wrote ‘Delete Spotify’ on their Spotify page…”\n\nThe big picture\n\nOliver Darcy writes: “Consider the fact that we are nearly six years from the 2016 election, when the issue of misinfo really surfaced in an unavoidable way, and some tech companies are still having incredibly difficult problems establishing basic protocols. A lot of the reporting about viral lies simply involves asking companies for their policies and then often why brazen violations aren’t enforced…”\n\n“Book Ban Efforts Spread Across the U.S.”\n\nThat’s one of the top headlines on the New York Times website Sunday night. “Parents, activists, school board officials and lawmakers around the country are challenging books at a pace not seen in decades,” Elizabeth A. Harris and Alexandra Alter wrote.\n\nKey stat: “The American Library Association said in a preliminary report that it received an ‘unprecedented’ 330 reports of book challenges, each of which can include multiple books, last fall.”\n\n“Conservative groups in particular, fueled by social media, are now pushing the challenges,” and the “most frequent targets” include books about race, gender and sexuality, though “book challenges aren’t just coming from the right,” the reporters noted. Fox recently hyped a Washington state school district’s action against “To Kill a Mockingbird.” However, the network has not mentioned “Maus,” according to a TVEyes search. CNN and MSNBC have cited both books in recent coverage…\n\n“Maus” hits #1 on Amazon\n\nYou’ve surely heard about the McMinn County, Tennessee school board voting to ban the Holocaust-themed graphic novel “Maus” from its classrooms. But did you know the vote happened way back on January 10? It only became national news when the vote “was reported by a local news outlet, The Tennessee Holler, on Wednesday,” as the NYT noted here.\n\nSince then, copies of “Maus” have become a hot commodity. “Three different editions of the Pulitzer Prize-winning work are in the top seven of books on Amazon as of Sunday afternoon,” Slate’s Daniel Politi wrote. “The Complete Maus, which includes the two volumes of the novel, was number one on Amazon’s bestseller list. The first volume of the book was number three on the list, while the second was number seven.”\n\n“They are creating a parallel economy”\n\nThat’s what Fox’s Dan Bongino, newly banned from YouTube and Google Ads, argued on his show Saturday night. Some studies have shown that deplatforming “works” in so far that it reduces toxicity on social networks. But the counterargument, advanced by Bongino, is that the offending content doesn’t disappear, it merely moves.\n\n“You look so much younger now that you’re no longer on YouTube,” his guest Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump’s social media company, quipped. Then he predicted “millions of Americans” would leave Big Tech for platforms like Trump’s, which has yet to launch. “I think they’re doing this to themselves, these big tech companies,” Bongino said. “They are creating a parallel economy right under their noses, in a similar way the news ecosystem bifurcated in the 90s with the advent of Fox News.”\n\n“Complicate the narrative”\n\nMy lead guest on Sunday’s “Reliable Sources” was Amanda Ripley, the author of “High Conflict,” an essential read about how to de-escalate existential “us versus them” disputes. Journalists should stop “simplifying and amplifying,” she said. Don’t become “conflict entrepreneurs.” Instead, try to “complicate the narrative.”\n\nFor example, highlight the stories of those who are making a positive difference. And show the context for conflicts in the news: “How many school boards are imploding in conflict,” out of how many overall? “How many electoral districts are restricting voting rights?” Watch the two clips on CNN.com…", "authors": ["Brian Stelter"], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}]}

Other winter weather alerts are in effect for blizzard conditions, ice, snow as well as flooding.\n\n“The National Weather Service’s Watch Warning graphic depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever,” the agency said Thursday.\n\nRecord cold Christmas Eve for many\n\nNotably, parts of Montana, South Dakota and Wyoming have already seen wind chills below minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the past two days.\n\nThe entire state of Texas was seeing temperatures below freezing by early Friday afternoon, according to weather observations from around the state.\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned residents about the “epic, statewide hazard” of winter weather.\n\n“I called it a kitchen sink storm because it is throwing everything at us but the kitchen sink,” Hochul said at a press conference Friday afternoon. “We’ve had ice, flooding, snow, freezing temperatures, and everything that mother nature could wallop at us this weekend.”\n\nFor Brian Trzeciak, the storm was “living up to the warnings” at his home in Hamburg, New York. Buffalo’s airport, just to the north, reported zero visibility shortly after noon on Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions, frigid temperatures, and the waves are like what you would see during a hurricane,” he told CNN.\n\nHe and his family decided to cancel their Christmas plans because of the dangers from the storm.\n\n“My mother lives about 30 minutes away and so does my sister and her family, in the other direction,” he said. “We always get together for Christmas Eve and Christmas, but we’re all hunkering down in our houses until it all stops on Monday.”\n\nDriving bans are in place in Erie, Genesee, Niagara and Orleans counties in Western New York because of whiteout conditions.\n\nAs many as 250 people could be stranded in their cars in Erie County in a situation that Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said put first responders at unnecessary risk. Brown told CNN Friday night that forecasts call for 36 to 48 inches of snow. The area has had wind gusts of 79 mph.\n\nMany will experience a cold holiday unlike any other: Atlanta, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Tallahassee, Florida, are all forecast to have their coldest high temperature ever recorded on December 24, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nWashington DC is forecast to see its second coldest Christmas Eve, only behind 1989. In New York, it will be the coldest Christmas Eve since 1906. Chicago is expecting temperatures to rebound above zero, but will still experience its coldest Christmas Eve since 1983.\n\nMuch of Florida will experience the peak of their cold on Christmas Day. It will be coldest Christmas Day since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nStorm expected to become ‘bomb cyclone’\n\nCars drive in whiteout conditions in Orchard Park, New York on Friday. Mark Mulville/The Buffalo News/AP\n\nOn Friday, the storm unleashed more heavy snow and blizzard conditions, particularly in the Midwest.\n\nAs it treks east across the country, the storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone,” a rapidly strengthening storm which drops 24 millibars of pressure within 24 hours. The storm’s pressure was forecast to match that of a Category 2 hurricane as it moved into the Great Lakes on Friday morning.\n\nGovernors in at least 13 states, including Georgia and North Carolina in the South, have implemented emergency measures to respond to the storm. Declarations of a state of emergency in several states have included the activation of National Guard units.\n\nMore than 5,500 Friday flights have already been canceled as of 9:30 p.m. ET, after nearly 2,700 cancellations on Thursday, according to flight tracking site FlightAware.\n\n• It will remain very cold: Friday will bring record-low temperatures in large swaths of the US, including from the Lower Mississippi Valley, northeastward into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and stretching across large sections of the east from the Southeast, through the Southern to Central Appalachians and into the mid-Atlantic, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n• Dangerous wind chills: The plummeting temperatures will be accompanied by high winds, which will create dangerous wind chills across nearly all the central to eastern US.\n\n• Blizzard warnings: The Upper Midwest will see frigid temperatures, heavy snow and high winds. The warning applies to parts of Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Michigan. Buffalo, New York, will go under a blizzard warning Friday morning. Such warnings go in effect when snow and wind of 35 mph will reduce visibility to less than a quarter of a mile for at least three hours.\n\n• Whiteout conditions: Blizzard conditions may exist even if snowfall stops, because high winds can pick up snow already on the ground and cause low visibility.\n\nSeparate storm system in Pacific Northwest\n\nA separate storm system is bringing heavy mixed precipitation to the Pacific Northwest on Friday.\n\nA winter storm warning is in effect for western Washington, including Seattle, until 7 p.m. PST Friday. Additional snowfall of up to 2 inches is possible and ice accumulations could reach a quarter of an inch. Precipitation will begin as snow and transition to sleet/freezing rain and then finally to rain. More power outages are likely and travel will be made very difficult.\n\nThe ice caused the closure of runways at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, where nearly half of flights going into and out of the airport were canceled, according to FlightAware.

The alerts stretch across 37 states, dipping as far south as the Texas/Mexico border.\n\nThe number of people under winter alerts and wind chill alerts has grown to over 100 million people, or roughly a third of the US population, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe cold will stick around for Christmas weekend, making this the coldest Christmas in roughly 40 years for portions of the Plains and Midwest.\n\nLIVE UPDATES ON THE WINTER STORM FOR THURSDAY\n\nStorm timeline:\n\nWednesday: The storm will strengthen over the Northern Plains through the day as heavy snow falls across much of the Rockies, the Northern Plains and into the Midwest. Slick roads will lead to travel headaches and airport delays through places like Minneapolis, Omaha and Rapid City.\n\nThis system will bring 5 to 9 inches of light fluffy snow across the region, with “the highest amounts just north and west of the Twin Cities,” said the weather service office in Twin Cities. While snow will steadily fall across the region, the high winds won’t kick in until Thursday.\n\nDenver will go from a high of 47 on Wednesday to a low of minus 14 on Thursday morning. That would be the city’s coldest day in 32 years, according to the weather service.\n\nTemperatures in the Denver metro area will drop drastically once the front passes in the next couple of hours.\n\nBy sunrise, the temperature is expected to be around 10 degrees below zero and gusty north winds will create a wind chill of around minus 25. The high-temperature tomorrow will likely not make it above zero degrees.\n\nA wind chill warning is in effect as well as a winter weather advisory. Several inches of snow will also make for difficult travel late this afternoon through early Thursday.\n\nThursday: Thursday will be the most difficult day for travel. The storm will be hitting the Midwest extremely hard with heavy snow and strong winds. Western Minnesota will face not only blizzard conditions, but potentially deadly wind chills Thursday and Friday.\n\n“Whiteout conditions are expected during that time with travel becoming very difficult or impossible,” said the weather service. “This event could be life-threatening if you are stranded with wind chills in the 30 below to 45 below zero range.”\n\nChicago could also face blizzard conditions with winds gusting as high as 50 mph, with 2 to 4 inches of snow forecast.\n\n“Overall, concern continues to increase in the quick development of dangerous conditions Thursday afternoon with potentially significant impacts to the evening peak travel window,” warned the weather service office in Chicago.\n\nSnowfall early Wednesday in Glasgow, Montana. Angel Enriquez\n\nAdditionally, strong winds may knock out power lines in the Midwest, especially in areas where heavy snow fell last week and is already weighing down tree branches. This will leave millions finding a way to stay warm as temperatures plummet to well below freezing.\n\nSnow could fall as far south as Jackson, Mississippi, Memphis and Nashville in Tennessee and even Birmingham, Alabama, on Thursday. Little to no accumulation is expected for most of the southern cities, however, Nashville could pick up about an inch of snow.\n\nIn anticipation of what will be a week of travel nightmares, United, American, Delta, Southwest and Jet Blue have issued travel waivers for dozens of airports across the country from the South to the Northeast, because in addition to snow covering roadways, low visibility could make air travel dangerous.\n\nAt least 1,000 flights had been canceled across the US, according to the flight tracking site Flightaware on Wednesday evening.\n\nChicago’s O’Hare International Airport leads the way, followed by Denver International and Chicago’s Midway International.\n\nCancellations at those airports could have a wider impact because they are busy hubs where travelers often change planes in order to reach other destinations. Thursday is expected to be the busiest pre-Christmas day for travel.\n\nFriday: The storm is expected to become a “bomb cyclone” Thursday evening into Friday. A bomb cyclone is when a storm rapidly intensifies – and drops 24 millibars (a term used to measure atmospheric pressure) in 24 hours.\n\nThe storm is expected to reach the pressure equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane as it reaches the Great Lakes, with the weather service describing the strength of the low a “once-in-a-generation” event.\n\n“This is a case in which snow totals may not tell the whole story. Even small snow amounts, when combined with very strong wind gusts and plummeting temperatures, can cause poor visibility and slick spots on roads. The sudden arrival of these conditions can increase the danger,” the weather service explained.\n\nThe storm will be over the Great Lakes on Friday and continuing to produce heavy snow across much of the Midwest. Portions of Michigan could pick up more than a foot of snow by Friday, making travel impossible at times.\n\nBlizzard warnings are in effect for parts of the Dakotas, Montana, Minnesota, Iowa, Indiana and Michigan – where travel conditions will become difficult to impossible as the storm peaks Thursday into Friday. Major cities like Chicago, Kansas City, St Louis, Twin Cities and Detroit are under winter storm warnings for heavy snow and near blizzard conditions.\n\nHeavy rain will also blanket much of the I-95 corridor, adding to the travel troubles and lengthy airport delays.\n\nEven in places where the snow has ended, strong winds will continue to blow 30 to 40 mph across much of the Midwest and into the Northeast.\n\nFriday night into Saturday morning, New England will get a quick shot of snow and windy conditions.\n\nTravelers check in at Minneapolis' St. Paul Airport, Wednesday, December 21, 2022. Abbie Parr/AP\n\nLife-threatening cold\n\nPlaces that will escape the snow, won’t escape the cold. Areas from eastern Montana through the Dakotas will experience the coldest air beginning Thursday morning. Temperatures will be running 40 degrees below normal for these places. The combination of cold temperatures and windy conditions will send wind chills as low as 50 degrees below zero.\n\nRapid City will feel like 45 degrees below zero on Thursday morning. By Friday morning, Chicago’s wind chill will bottom out at 30 degrees below zero.\n\n“The dangerously cold wind chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 5 minutes,” warned the weather service office in Bismarck.\n\nEven the South will be dangerously cold. Nashville and Atlanta’s wind chill will drop to minus 11 on Saturday morning and Birmingham will feel like minus 5.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday declared a state of emergency due to the upcoming “historic low temperatures” across the state, with near zero or negative digit wind chills by midday on Friday.\n\nGreg Behrens, of Des Moines, Iowa, tries to stay warm as he makes his way on a snow-covered sidewalk, Wednesday, December 21, 2022, in Des Moines, Iowa.

Andy Beshear also declared a state of emergency, with wind gusts expected to reach 40 to 50 mph on Friday and minus 10 to minus 26 degrees wind chills expected on Saturday. Beshear asked residents to stay off roads and to have a backup heat source.\n\nJackson and Birmingham will both spend more than 80 hours below freezing between Friday and Monday.

An apparent tornado at North Perry Airport in Broward County caused “significant damage” to several aircraft and hangars, Mayor Michael Udine said on Twitter.\n\nThe Category 3 storm was churning 120 mph winds Tuesday night with its center roughly 180 miles south-southwest of the city of Punta Gorda, close to where it’s expected to make landfall in less than 24 hours. City authorities there announced Tuesday night emergency services, including police and fire response will be suspended until after the storm passes, when it will be safe to resume response calls again.\n\nFor days, forecasters and Florida officials have warned this will be a dangerous storm with life-threatening storm surge and flooding and fierce winds. Tuesday night, Ian’s hurricane-force winds extended 40 miles out from its center and tropical storm-force winds extended roughly 140 miles out, with some parts of the Florida Keys reporting wind gusts stronger than 50 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n“I implore, I urge everyone that is in an evacuation zone that has been asked to evacuate – the time is now. You must evacuate now. There will be a time when it will not be safe to travel the roads,” Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie warned in a news conference Tuesday evening.\n\n“There will come a point in time when local public safety officials will not be able to respond to your cry for help. You may be left to fend for yourself,” he added.\n\nIan will likely make landfall Wednesday afternoon to evening between Sarasota and Port Charlotte as a Category 3 or Category 4 hurricane. (Hurricanes are designated as Category 4 when winds reach speeds of 130 mph to 156 mph.) Whichever of the two it is, one forecaster warned the storm still be a “large and destructive hurricane” for the state, urging residents to listen to local leaders’ advice.\n\nAnd it’s not just southwest Florida taking a hit.\n\n“This is going to be a lot of impacts that will be felt far and wide throughout the state of Florida,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said in Tuesday evening’s news conference. “As the storm moves in, you’re going to potentially have (evacuation) directives issued from folks in the interior of our state or even the east coast of the state for low-lying areas that absolutely could end up flooding.”\n\nAll of Cuba in the dark\n\nIan made landfall in Cuba earlier Tuesday as a Category 3 hurricane. Tuesday night, Cuban state media reported the entire island was in a nationwide blackout. Cuban officials said the hurricane caused the power outage and they hoped to begin restoring electricity late Tuesday or early Wednesday.\n\nEarlier, state electric company Unión Eléctrica de Cuba said they would keep power off in Havana to avoid deaths and property damage until the weather improved. The company said they had turned the power off in the area ahead of the storm to avoid electrocutions and to prevent fires.\n\nCuba’s tobacco-rich Pinar del Rio province lost power because of the storm, according to Cuban state television. Floodwater covered fields and fallen trees lay in front of buildings in San Juan y Martinez, a town in the province, images from state media outlet Cubadebate show.\n\nUp to 16 inches of rain and mudslides and flash flooding were possible in western Cuba, the hurricane center said. Mayelin Suarez, a resident of Pinar del Rio city, told Reuters the storm made for the darkest night of her life.\n\n“We almost lost the roof off our house,” Suarez told Reuters. “My daughter, my husband and I tied it down with a rope to keep it from flying away.”\n\nA man walks down a street in Havana, Cuba, on Tuesday during Hurricane Ian. Yamil Lage/AFP/Getty Images\n\n‘It’s becoming too late’\n\nOf the 2.5 million Floridians under some kind of evacuation directive, more than 1.75 million were under mandatory evacuation orders Tuesday afternoon. Most were in Lee County, which encompasses Fort Myers.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were issued for parts of counties in the hurricane warning area stretching from north of Tampa to the Fort Myers area. That included Pinellas, Hillsborough and Manatee counties in the Tampa area, Hernando, Sarasota and Charlotte counties, and parts of Lee County. Emergency shelters have been opened.\n\nIn Pinellas County, where more than 440,000 people are under mandatory evacuations, Clearwater Mayor Frank Hibbard told CNN Tuesday afternoon it was becoming too late for residents to leave.\n\n“If you have not yet evacuated, if you have not yet gotten supplies, it’s becoming too late. You just need to shelter-in-place and wait out the storm,” the mayor said.\n\nState agencies were also working to help prepare and protect senior residents, conducting on-site visits to nursing homes and assisted living facilities in the path of the storm.\n\nAhead of the storm, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also issued a state of emergency Tuesday, warning of heavy rainfall and damaging winds in the state later in the week.\n\nSign up for CNN’s free Weather Brief newsletter to get email updates on Hurricane Ian.\n\nWhat the threats are\n\nThe approaching storm threatens several perils for west-central Florida:\n\n• Storm surge: A storm surge warning – meaning the surge could threaten life – is in effect for much of Florida’s west coast, from Suwanee in the Big Bend region to the peninsula’s tip in the Everglades.\n\nA warning also is in effect for far northeastern Florida’s coast, from near the Georgia state line down to Marineland, as well as for St. John’s River further inland.\n\nThe worst – 8 to 12 feet – is forecast for Florida’s west coast from just south of Bradenton down to Bonita Beach south of Fort Myers, the hurricane center said. Large storm surge also is possible in areas outside that zone, including Tampa Bay.\n\nForecasters in South Florida warned the storm surge could damage buildings and wash many away.\n\nA broken section of road and destroyed houses are seen in Matlacha, Florida, on Saturday, October 1.

More than double the normal amount of rain has fallen over southern Florida in the past two weeks, with widespread amounts of more than 6 inches of water dumped over some areas.

The chill and the winds together aren’t like anything we’ve felt here that I can remember.”\n\nLow temperatures were set to reach 40 degrees over the weekend in the area. Meanwhile, 3 million Californians awoke Friday morning to a winter storm warning stemming from the storm that first rolled into the Golden State the day before, leaving more than 100,000 customers without electricity.\n\n\"The craziest part of this is that you could see anything from this storm,\" Fox Weather meteorologist Amy Freeze told USA TODAY. \"We've talked about blizzard warnings, we've talked about flash flooding, but we can also get serious thunderstorms this morning.\"\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA:Blizzard will unleash 'real danger' upon unhoused people\n\nAs much as 5 feet of snow may fall in some mountains near Los Angeles, creating whiteout conditions as winds gust to 75 mph. The conditions raise the risk of avalanches, according to forecasters.\n\nThe weather service in San Diego issued its first-ever blizzard warning for mountain areas including Big Bear, Lake Arrowhead and Wrightwood through Saturday.\n\nHeavy snow wasn't the only concern in California. Forecasters say they're worried about torrential rain leading to flash flooding in downtown LA, where parts of the city are expecting up to 8 inches of rain, according to AccuWeather.\n\n\"In urban areas where we've got a lot of concrete, the water runs very, very quickly. And if you've got too much of it and it can't drain, all of a sudden you've got ponding on roadways and intersections,\" she said.\n\nCentral and northern California were at risk for damaging thunderstorms, hurricane force winds and waterspouts — which are tornadoes over water — that can come onshore as landspouts, Freeze said.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Friday's weather:\n\nUnusual cold poses challenges for homeless in Palm Springs\n\nUnhoused people in Palm Springs are bracing for an atypically cold weekend of wind and rain in the Coachella Valley.\n\n“It was so cold and windy last night, it felt like what trying to sleep through a tsunami would feel like,” said 62-year-old Cheryl Shannon, who lives in her car in Palm Springs. The car’s windows are broken, allowing cold air in at night.\n\nLast year’s annual homeless count identified 222 unsheltered homeless people in Palm Springs, the second-highest number in the county after the city of Riverside, with only 15 overnight shelter beds available.\n\nJulian Garza, 54, said he planned on staying at the shelter tonight due to the cold, but hasn’t stayed there consistently since it opened because, “There’s a limited capacity here, and I don’t want to take a space that could go to someone who is elderly.”\n\nBut after waking up one morning this week to find his two sleeping bags “crystalized and stiff” with ice, he decided to try to secure a bed space tonight.\n\nMichael Lee May, 60, has slept at the shelter most nights since it opened in early January, arriving promptly by 4:15 p.m. to line up for a bed. He said most nights there are more than 20 people in line. He’s not sure where he or others might go once the winter shelter closes at the end of the month.\n\n“It’s really cold right now, and there’s really not a good place to go,” he said.\n\nHe’s heard of some people sleeping across the street inside the airport, but is wary to try after hearing that the police will start giving citations.\n\nMudslides close Grapevine highway near Santa Clarita; Parts of I-80 closed\n\nParts of Interstate 5 near Santa Clarita, referred to as the Grapevine, were closed Friday afternoon due to a mudslide and snow, the state department of transportation said. The highway, which runs northwest of LA, is a major route connecting the northern and southern parts of the state.\n\nParts of the Grapevine were also closed Thursday night due to heavy snow, the department said on Facebook.\n\nNortheast of LA, parts of State Route 2 along Angeles Crest Highway were closed Friday morning, the department said on Twitter.\n\nIn northern California, lack of visibility led to roads closures along Interstate 80, a major east-west corridor connecting San Francisco, Sacramento and Reno, Nevada.\n\nTruckers attempting to travel along parts of I-80 that were open Friday were being checked to make sure their tires were outfitted with the proper chains, according to the state transportation department.\n\nVentura County prepares for flooding\n\nEvacuation warnings were issued through Saturday morning in Ventura County for areas considered unstable after being hit hard by storms that killed more than a dozen people last month.\n\nMountain areas in Ventura County had received up to 3 inches of rain by Friday morning, and crews were out monitoring flooding hotspots on the roads.\n\n“We’re just watching hour by hour,” Dave Fleisch, the county's assistant public works director, told the Ventura Country Star, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nResidents were lining roads with sandbags Friday morning, as the county expects the heaviest rain later Friday.\n\nSome of the heaviest rain had stalled over Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties, said Ryan Kittell, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard, California. The band over Santa Barbara is expected to move in Ventura County later Friday afternoon or evening, he said.\n\nWhen that happens, the county will experience the brunt of the \"very cold\" storm. By Friday evening, periods of intense rain could reach half an inch to an inch an hour.\n\n\"We do expect quite a bit of flooding over the roads developing, if not earlier, certainly by tonight,\" Kittell said.\n\n5 feet of snow expected in Big Bear\n\nThe winter storm could dump as much as 5 feet of snow in Big Bear, about two hours northeast of Los Angeles, said Bob Larson, senior meteorologist at AccuWeather.\n\nSustained winds are expected to reach 25 to 35 mph, with gusts between 50 and 60 mph, making travel \"very difficult to impossible,\" the weather service said.\n\n\"This storm should not be taken lightly!\" the city of Big Bear Lake said in a tweet. \"Stay home.

All but one were in central and southern Mississippi.\n\nA strong storm that hit Lowndes County, Mississippi, this evening left behind a path of destruction, with reports of damaged homes, Lowndes County Sheriff Eddie Hawkins told CNN affiliate WTVA.\n\nThis comes as severe storms could hit a much wider area of the United States from Tuesday into early Wednesday, from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest, with tornadoes, damaging winds and hail, forecasters said.\n\nBut prediction center forecasters focused especially on Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, saying “parameters appear favorable for strong and long-tracked tornadoes,” meaning ones that stay on the ground for an extended period, Tuesday afternoon and early evening in the watch area.\n\n“Numerous tornadoes (are) expected with a few intense tornadoes likely,” along with scattered large hail and scattered damaging wind gusts up to 70 mph, forecasters said in the special tornado watch.\n\nOverall, more than 41 million people from southeastern Texas eastward to Georgia and northward to central Indiana and Illinois are under at least a marginal threat of severe weather Tuesday, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nSeparate from the special tornado watch, the prediction center laid out an area where it believed the largest potential for severe weather, including tornadoes, existed – covering 1.6 million people in east-central Louisiana; a sliver of southeastern Arkansas; much of Mississippi, including Jackson; and northwestern Alabama. The threat for that area – a Level 4 of 5, or moderate – is relatively rare for this time of year, and tornadoes, though they can happen year-round, are more frequent in the spring and summer.", "authors": ["Jason Hanna Aya Elamroussi", "Jason Hanna", "Aya Elamroussi"], "publish_date": "2022/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/25/weather/christmas-arctic-winter-storm-power-outages-sunday/index.html", "title": "Prolonged winter storm causes at least 37 deaths and leaves ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe prolonged winter storm that brought heavy snow, high winds and brutal cold to most of the US this past week has killed at least 37 people and had hundreds of thousands without power on Christmas morning.\n\nPerhaps the worst impact was around Buffalo, New York, where 43 inches of snow fell as of Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service.

The warnings are associated with a system the National Hurricane Center has designated as Potential Tropical Cyclone Four, located in the southern Gulf of Mexico, about 400 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Rio Grande.\n\nThe hurricane center uses the potential tropical cyclone designation to issue warnings for a system prior to it actually being named.\n\n“Since the system is likely to develop further and make landfall as a tropical storm in less than 36 hours, advisories are being initiated on Potential Tropical Cyclone Four with tropical storm warnings being issued for portions of the coasts of northeastern Mexico and South Texas,” the Hurricane Center said in its forecast discussion.\n\nRegardless of development, the system is expected to bring heavy rain to northeastern Mexico and extreme southern Texas. Rainfall amounts of up to eight inches are possible in Mexico, and one to three inches expected in far South Texas.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the desert Southwest, an area dealing with long-term megadrought, is bracing for a moderate risk, Level 3 of 4, of extreme rainfall, which could lead to flash flooding Friday and Saturday.\n\n“A multi-day significant rainfall event is forecast across the Southwest US this weekend,” the Weather Prediction Center said. “Impactful rainfall is most likely across parts of southeast Arizona into southwest New Mexico with storm total amounts approaching 5-6 inches.”\n\nFlood watches are posted for nearly 10 million people across the Southwest, including Tucson, Phoenix, Albuquerque, and El Paso, through Saturday.\n\nSee if rain is expected where you live right here >>>\n\nZack Taylor, a senior meteorologist at the Weather Prediction Center, pointed out there are multiple factors creating the new surge of moisture, including the remnants of a tropical wave currently over northern Mexico embedded within the larger-scale monsoon.\n\nOne thing making the particular event different is the timing of the storms. Typically, monsoon storms are diurnally driven, meaning they occur in the afternoon and early evening. This time, the chance for rain will be around the clock. Storms will fire up in the afternoon and early evening as usual, but will also occur Friday overnight and early Saturday morning.\n\nThere are also two timelines as far as the impact goes with the next system: the short term, which would be flash flooding, and the long term, which would be the influence on the rivers, creeks, and streams in the area.\n\n“The main concern is with the flash flooding initially,” Jeff Davis, senior meteorologist for the National Weather Service office in Tucson told CNN. “But we’re transitioning into a situation where we may have some of the larger washes that are normally dry and some of the main stem rivers starting to see significant flows by Monday.”\n\nCNN Weather\n\nBy the end of the weekend, the rain will spread east into Texas, another state experiencing significant drought. By early next week, 3-5 inches of rain is possible from Lubbock, Texas, to Shreveport, Louisiana, increasing the potential for flash flooding in those areas.\n\nMonsoon rains are helping the drought, but not enough\n\nWhile the desert Southwest may not be known as a wet part of the country, this time of the year is when it is most likely to get rainfall. The rainy season helps the Southwest, but it often leads to superficial improvement.\n\nThe drought-plagued region is already dealing with a water crisis, so they need the rain, but it may not be as beneficial as it appears.\n\nOne of the concerns with the upcoming heavy rain is it is not expected to surge far enough north or west where the water is needed most: California, Nevada, Oregon, and northern Utah.\n\n“Several large areas of improvement were noted this week, with the heaviest rains and most widespread improvement covering Arizona,” the latest US Drought Monitor details. “After an extended period of serious drought, the heavy rains have prompted broadscale improvement in monsoon-affected areas.”\n\nThe recent rains have helped, but only for some areas of the West. Roughly 70% of the West is still in some level of drought, down from 90% just three months ago. Most of the improvements have been in just two states, Arizona and New Mexico. The recent rains have helped those two states even more.\n\n“Monsoonal rains are only a fraction of the water needs of the West,” said Chad Myers, CNN meteorologist. “That said, the recent rains have raised the level of Lake Mead by 1.8 feet over the past three weeks.”\n\nMyers pointed out the main driver for water in this region is the melting winter snowpack, but it doesn’t mean the rainfall isn’t beneficial.\n\n“Although the heaviest of the upcoming rain will miss the Colorado River basin and Lake Mead, plenty will still fall in Utah and Colorado directly into the upper drainage basin of the river,” Myers said.\n\nThe US Southwest monsoon officially runs from June 15 to September 30, putting the region beyond the halfway point of the season.\n\nThe recent rain in Las Vegas has brought its monsoon total up to 1.29” marking the wettest monsoon season in a decade. However, the city is still well below where it should be at this time in the year, having received just over half of its average rainfall up through mid-August. The 1.29” this season already makes 2022 Vegas’ third-wettest monsoon in the 21st century. It comes just two years after the driest monsoon on record back in the summer of 2020 when there was no measurable rain.\n\nDown the road in Tucson, they’ve had a roller coaster of monsoon seasons recently. 2020 was the second-driest on record (1.62”) while 2021 managed to be the third wettest (12.79”). So far this season, a little over 2” has fallen in the city, below the average to date of 3.48”.\n\nSalt Lake City has had 6.70” so far this year, but their average is more than 10 inches. It is an ever-present sign of how bad the drought has been over the last few decades in the region that we are celebrating getting a little more than half of what is normal.", "authors": ["Allison Chinchar Haley Brink Taylor Ward", "Allison Chinchar", "Haley Brink", "Taylor Ward"], "publish_date": "2022/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/weather/2023/03/15/wednesday-weather-forecast-winter-storm-new-york-new-england/11473008002/", "title": "Live winter storm updates: Snow in Northeast; California power ...", "text": "Thursday updates: Read the latest weather news here.\n\nThe heavy snow, rain and gale-force winds from two storms that slammed the Northeast and California eased Wednesday but still threatened havoc to both coasts with flooding, power outages and travel woes.\n\nBoth regions were bracing for more snow, rain and other wintry weather throughout the day on Wednesday, although most winter storm warnings were lifted through the day.\n\nThe dig-out was underway in places such as Peterborough, New Hampshire, and Ashby, Massachusetts, where almost 3 feet of heavy, wet snow fell.

If people must travel, they should keep an extra flashlight, food and water in their vehicles, officials advised.\n\nSome New England residents were astonished at the depth of the snow: “It just snowed and snowed and snowed,” said Geoff Settles, a supervisor at a manufacturer who lives in Peterborough, New Hampshire. “My wife and I were helping some of the neighbors dig out. Literally, we had to shovel five and six different times just to keep it from being basically up to our chest.”\n\nSettles, who grew up in Leominster, Massachusetts, remembered blizzards there in the late 1970s. “I would say this is the most snow I’ve seen all my life,” he said Wednesday.\n\nFreeze warnings, advisories hit the South\n\nFreezing temperatures blanketed a stretch of the Southeast from Arkansas to the Carolinas on Wednesday morning, and another round of freezing weather was forecast for early Thursday in some states.\n\nA freeze warning was in effect for Thursday morning in parts of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.

They point to the example this fall of Salmonella found at a Sunland Inc. peanut butter\n\nprocessing plant in New Mexico that caused 42 people, mostly children, in 20 states to become ill. The facility had a history of food safety violations.\n\n\"The Obama administration has already seen a number of very serious outbreaks while we have been waiting for these rules to be released,\" said Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \"The cost of delay is really the likelihood that more people will get sick and some may get seriously ill, may end up in the hospital and some could even die while we're waiting for these rules to be finalized.\"\n\nFoodborne illnesses strike an estimated 48 million people in the United States each year, or about one in six Americans, killing 3,000, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A study released in 2010 by consumer and public health groups said foodborne diseases cost the United States $152 billion in health-related expenses each year, far more than prior estimates. Despite the outbreaks, the United States is widely regarded as having one of the safest food supplies in the world.\n\nThe Food Safety Modernization Act signed into law by President Obama in January 2011 marked the biggest change of U.S. food safety laws since 1938 when Congress gave the FDA authority to oversee the safety of food, drugs and cosmetics.\n\nFor years, the FDA, tasked with regulating 80 percent of the U.S. food supply, was widely seen by lawmakers, consumer groups and the agency itself as understaffed and underfunded. That leaves the agency able to inspect only of a fraction of the plants under its watch.\n\nA handful of power-boosting rules went in place immediately after Obama signed the new law. Among the most prominent were regulations that:\n\nGave the FDA access to documents at a food company tied to an illness or death\n\nIncreased the frequency of plant inspections\n\nGave the agency the power to order a mandatory recall\n\nAllowed the FDA to suspend a company's operation's \"\" something the agency did last month in the case of Sunland.\n\nBut implementation of other measures -- such as requiring food production facilities to have a plan in place to identify and prevent contamination along with stricter requirements for overseeing the production and harvesting of fresh produce -- are months behind. Tougher oversight of imported foods also has been delayed. The law requires importers to verify the food they bring into the United States meets domestic safety standards. The food could be denied entry if it fails to do so.\n\nThe produce rule, for example, has been besieged with criticism that it was poorly written, and an insufficient job was done analyzing the costs and benefits for producers. All this has caused the rule to swell in excess of 700 pages, likely contributing to its subsequent delay, according to those who follow the food safety legislation.\n\n\"It is a broader ranging bill than Congress thought it passed,\" said Chad Hart, an associate professor of economics at Iowa State University. \"Once you begin to look at the agricultural production and transport systems here in the U.S. that's a mammoth task so it doesn't surprise me that it's taken quite a while.\"\n\nRep. Kristi Noem, a South Dakota Republican and a member of the House Agriculture Committee, was sympathetic to the complexity of the rule-making process required to implement the new regulations. A host of factors must be considered such as if the measures are needed, how much they will cost and the degree to which they will impact food delivery and safety. Still, she said: \"Two years \"¦ is too long not to come forward with rules and regulations especially when it is as important as food safety.\"\n\nThe FDA submitted them to the White House's Office of Management and Budget in late 2011 for approval, but the administration has yet to sign off on them. Once the OMB gives the okay, implementation of the food safety laws is likely still several years away. The public must first be given the chance to comment on the proposals before the FDA can incorporate their suggestions into the final rules. After that, larger companies are usually given a year to comply with the new measures with smaller businesses having three years.\n\nThe White House referred questions on the food safety rules to the OMB. Moira Mack, a spokeswoman with the OMB, said the Obama Administration remains committed to food safety, citing a rule enacted to crack down on salmonella in eggs and the expansion of E. coli testing for beef. \"We are working as expeditiously as possible to implement the food safety legislation we fought so hard for,\" said Mack. \"When it comes to rules with this degree of importance and complexity, it is critical that we get it right.\"\n\nEven if the rules went into effect on time it's unlikely they would have been able to prevent recent major recalls. David Acheson, the FDA's former food safety czar, said it takes time before companies can make the necessary changes that will have a noticeable effect on public health. \"The change does not move that quickly. They are going to take a long time before they have an impact,\" he said.\n\nAcheson, food safety groups and others said the administration should release the proposed rules so the public and businesses affected by them could comment. They put the blame directly on the White House, which they claim likely delayed releasing the proposed rules before the election amid fears that higher costs imposed on companies would be passed on to consumers. \"It's time to stop playing with them just get them out there, warts at all, and have at it,\" said Acheson, who is now a partner at Leavitt Partners and oversees the firm's food and import safety practice.\n\n\"There is a high level of frustration in the (FDA) about this and they genuinely believe these things are ready to go,\" said Acheson. \"I believe the holdup is political and thus by process of elimination sits at the White House door and ultimately with the president.\"\n\nThe FDA has not been the only consumer protection agency to have its regulatory arsenal strengthened by Congress in recent years.\n\nAfter a series of highly publicized recalls involving lead-painted toys from China, lawmakers passed a law in August 2008 to strengthen the Consumer Production Safety Commission. The new law increased its budget and staff, imposed stiffer testing and product labeling requirements on businesses and established thresholds for several substances such as lead and chemicals called phthalates that are found in plastics and have been linked to birth defects in lab animals. Businesses that violated the law were slapped with higher fines and in some cases jail time.\n\nIn the last four years, the CPSC, which is responsible for monitoring more than 15,000 types of products, has seen the number of recalls drop for items it oversees from 107 in the quarter when the law was passed by Congress to 70 in the third-quarter of 2012, according to data from Stericycle ExpertRECALL, an Indianapolis-based firm that has provided advice and helped major U.S. companies carry out recalls. Meanwhile, the FDA, without its full arsenal of funding and enforcement tools, has seen recalls rise from 113 recalls in the first quarter of 2011 when the Food Safety Modernization Act was signed to 169 in the second quarter of this year, a 50 percent increase.\n\nGale Prince, a consultant for Stericycle ExpertRECALL, said companies affected by the CPSC rules have had more time to adopt and implement the new regulations in their business operations. \"It's the difference in maturing of the legislation,\" said Prince. \"The awareness of the activity of the CPSC has had an effect, they have gotten the word out and I think that may be part of the downward trend.\"\n\nWhile some businesses are waiting until the food safety rules are published, many companies are already incorporating their own food safety handling and transportation measures into their operations. The threat of potential litigation, long-term damage to their brand and a surge in the use of social media tools by the public to communicate has put more pressure on businesses to meet or exceed existing food safety requirements, said Acheson.\n\nHy-Vee, the 234-store, West Des Moines-based grocery chain has hired an outside auditor to do inspections of its stores. It also has worked with its distribution centers to make sure they handle and transport food using the same standards, such as ensuring sanitary conditions and uniform temperatures are maintained.\n\n\"There is cost involved but it's a cost of doing business and certainly it's nothing compared to not doing it,\" said Ruth Comer, assistant vice president of media relations with Hy-Vee. \"If something isn't done and there is a food borne illness outbreak or another situation that one incident could be far more costly than any protective measures.\"\n\nContact Christopher Doering at cdoering@gannett.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/12/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/11/21/cwd-in-alabama-zombie-deer-disease-chronic-wasting-disease/4194613002/", "title": "'Zombie' disease 'inevitable' in Alabama and could cost billions", "text": "It’s inevitable that a disease that is always fatal to whitetail deer will spread to Alabama, a top state conservation official says. And the effects it will have economically, culturally and even medically is unfathomable.\n\nChronic Wasting Disease is likely “three to five years,” from showing up in the state, said Chuck Sykes, director of the Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division of the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. Hunting generates a $1.8 billion annual economic impact in Alabama, according to the Hunting Heritage Foundation.\n\nAnd whitetail deer are the most popular game animal in the state, according to the state conservation department. Firearms deer season opens Saturday and runs through Feb. 10.\n\nDEER HUNTING SEASON IN ALABAMA: Click here for the complete list\n\nAnd the doomsday scenario has an unlikely culprit: hunters themselves.\n\n“I am confident that the only way Chronic Wasting Disease will get to Alabama is it will be brought here,” Sykes said. “It will be that negligent, uncaring hunter who harvests a deer out of state and doesn’t take the time to properly handle the carcass. And once it gets here, we can never put that genie back in the bottle. It will have unforeseen impacts on a multibillion dollar industry, not only economically but culturally.\n\n“When we get that first positive, all our efforts of prevention will shift to mitigation. I’m not saying this to scare people. But the facts are the facts. We have to educate the public on just what we are facing. The steps to prevent the spread of CWD are effective. But all it takes is one person not to follow them.”\n\nSykes' position is “disturbing,” said Randy McGhee, a Prattville hunter.\n\n“Damn,” he muttered Wednesday night while shopping at the city’s Bass Pro Shops, getting ready for opening day. “That’s some of the the worst news you can hear.”\n\nThe Threat\n\nCWD is a 100% fatal, highly communicable neurological disease that effects cervids — deer, moose and elk. The pathogen that causes the disease, an abnormal prion — or protein — can be found concentrated in the brain, spinal cord and bone tissue well after the infected animal has died, according to the Centers Disease for Disease Control and Prevention. Animals spread the disease through physical contact with infected animals. It is spread through saliva, feces, urine and other fluids, as well as areas where contaminated animals have been.\n\nThere is no cure or vaccine for the disease, and there no known cases of humans getting it, according to the CDC. However, the CDC and conservation officials urge people not to consume venison from sick animals or animals showing symptoms of CWD.\n\nThe risk for humans getting the disease is there. In a February report on CWD published in USA TODAY, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, testified in a hearing before the state’s legislators.\n\n“It is probable that human cases of Chronic Wasting Disease associated with consumption with contaminated meat will be documented in the years ahead,” he said. “It’s possible the number of human cases will be substantial and will not be isolated events.”\n\nIn the news media CWD has been dubbed the “zombie deer disease.”\n\nIt’s an insidious malady, signs are not typically seen until the animal is 12 to 18 months old, and it may have an incubation period as long as four to five years, according to the United States Geological Survey. It stupefies its victims, attacking the brain, causing them to become emaciated, display abnormal behavior, lose balance and bodily functions, become weak and die.\n\nThe disease exists in 26 states and three Canadian provinces, according to the USGS’s National Wildlife Center in Madison, Wisc. The closest states to Alabama with confirmed cases of CWD are Mississippi and Tennessee, with those cases being in free ranging deer. The disease has been confirmed in Hardeman and Fayette counties in southwestern Tennessee and Pontotoc County in northeastern Mississippi. The counties are not contiguous to Alabama, but are within 50 miles of the state line.\n\n“CWD was first discovered in Colorado in 1967,” Sykes said. “And for 30 years it stayed within those 16 counties. Then all of a sudden it showed up in New York and Saskatchewan. It didn’t get there because deer were moving around. It got there because it was brought there. And now it’s exploded to 26 states.”\n\nIt has been illegal to import live deer to Alabama since 1973. Alabama has been testing deer for CWD since 2001, and since then more than 8,000 deer have been tested with no positive results. Northwestern Alabama counties, those closest to the CWD positive sites in Mississippi and Tennessee are being targeted for closer scrutiny and more testing. CWD symptoms can mimic other naturally occurring sicknesses in the deer herd. Tissue testing is the only way to determine of the CWD is present.\n\nLast year, Alabama banned the importation of carcasses of deer, elk and moose harvested outside of the state unless all the meat has been deboned. Only cleaned skull plates with bare antlers without visible brain or spinal tissue can be brought into the state. Likewise, raw capes with no visible brain or spinal tissue as well as upper canine teeth with no root structure or soft tissue attached can be brought in.\n\nFinished taxidermy products and tanned hides may be brought in. Antlers covered in velvet are prohibited unless that are part of a finished taxidermy project.\n\nWith the spread of CWD to Tennessee and Mississippi, Alabama game wardens have been working to check animals coming into the state.\n\n“We stopped six or seven trucks last season with carcasses in the back,” Sykes said.\n\n“They were not deboned and were coming from out of state. To a hunter, they said they knew they were supposed to debone the meat, they knew the reason they were supposed to debone the meat. But they just didn’t bother. One of those carcasses had been harvested in Kansas. So how many states were threatened on that trip?\n\n“Sure, deboning is inconvenient. It’ll take an extra hour or two. But when you consider what’s a stake, what’s an extra hour or two.”\n\nRules for bringing deer, elk or moose carcasses harvested out of state into Alabama\n\nAll meat must be deboned.\n\nSkull plates with clean antlers attached, with all spinal and brain tissue removed from the skull plates, are allowed.\n\nCleaned capes with all spinal and brain tissue removed are allowed.\n\nFinished taxidermy projects and tanned hides are allowed.\n\nAntlers in velvet are not allowed unless part of a finished taxidermy project.\n\nCanine teeth if the root structure and all soft tissue are removed are allowed.\n\nAlabama has also placed limits this year on urine-based deer scents and lures. Hunters often use the malodorous concoctions thinking it will attract mature bucks. Rumors have been circulating that use of any urine-based products has been banned, but that’s not the case. Scents produced in Alabama can be used. But products from outside the state must be certified as coming from CWD free herds, said Matt Weathers, the state conservation department’s law enforcement section chief.\n\nHunters should look for the Archery Trade Association’s check mark on the product packaging, or other statements that the product is CWD free, he said.\n\n“Ninety-eight percent of the scents on the market use the ATA’s check mark and are completely legal to use,” Weathers said. “And any synthetic scents, like Code Blue, can be used with no restrictions.”\n\nWeathers advised hunters to keep the original packaging or bottle of the scents available to show game wardens that they are approved for use.\n\nWhat other states have done\n\nMost of the 26 states in the nation that have CWD also have strong hunting traditions. And after two decades of more, the presence of the disease means a new normal for hunters. CWD was confirmed in Wisconsin for the first time in 2002. The state has issued regulations for processors and taxidermists to properly dispose of carcasses in landfills. Firearms season lasts nine days in Wisconsin, paling in comparison to the 10 weeks of Alabama gun season.\n\nThe state has increased the number of permits and uses game department sharpshooters to cull deer in the off season. Deer are also trapped in an effort, along with the culling, to decrease deer numbers and halt the spread of CWD. The state also has carcass transportation restrictions in place that are similar to those in Alabama.\n\nThere are 72 counties in the state, with 56 counties either being CWD positive, or contiguous to CWD positive areas and therefore tracked, said Tami Ryan, acting director of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources Bureau of Wildlife Management for the Division of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. When the disease first hit, the state saw about a 10 percent reduction in licensed hunters, she said.\n\nBut in 2018, those numbers had rebounded with more than 577,000 firearms hunters and 220,000 archery hunters.\n\n“We have dealt with CWD for an expansive length of time,” Ryan said. “We have put several programs in place to slow the spread of the disease. But you can’t get rid of it. In the southern part of the state, CWD is endemic.”\n\nWisconsin has banned the feeding and baiting of deer, with the logic being the supplemental feeding causes an unnatural concentration of animals and means the disease can spread more efficiently. Two years ago, Alabama changed regulations allowing for the supplemental feeding of deer during the hunting season.\n\nJust to the south of the Badger State, Illinois also saw CWD confirmed for the first time in 2002. The firearms season lasts seven days. High tech and more permits are the approach taken in Illinois. Increased permit numbers are used for carefully controlled localized population reductions, said Paul Shelton, a wildlife biologist with the state’s conservation department. Illinois also uses sharpshooters to cull deer during the season and in the offseason.\n\nOf the 102 counties in the state, 17 are considered CWD positive or in CWD areas of concern. All the CWD positive counties are in northern Illinois, near the Wisconsin border.\n\n“We have surveillance data down to the square mile,” he said. “Our prevalence rate of CWD has not gone up over several years, due to efforts to carefully control harvests and increase harvests in the affected areas. At this point in time the levels we have are considered quite good. We have seen a 1 to 2% increase in areas that are CWD positive.\n\n“It’s not gone away, but we haven’t seen large increases in the spread of the disease that other states have seen. We’re proud of that.”\n\nBack to Alabama, the threat of CWD has wide ranging impacts.\n\n“We don’t want people to stop hunting or stop eating deer meat,” he said. “That’s the worst thing that can happen. I tell people this isn’t a deer problem, or a hunting problem. It’s an Alabama problem. Many people in the state don’t realize what impact deer hunting has. Even if you don’t hunt, the economic benefits are huge. Hunting is very important to the culture of the state.\n\n“We need to do everything we can to protect that resource.”\n\nHunting facts According to economist Rob Southwick, Alabama hunters spend twice as much each year as the combined annual revenues of the 10 largest companies in the state. State and local taxes generated by hunting activities in Alabama amount to $104,412,563 each year. On the national level hunting is a huge economic force as well, amounting to a whopping $38.3 billion. “If hunting were a company, the amount spent by hunters to support their hunting activities would place it No. 73 on the Fortune 500 list,” Southwick said.

The descendants of the 110 people aboard the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to bring enslaved African people to the United States, held a ceremony to mark the anniversary of the vessel’s arrival. Dressed in white and walking slowly to the beat of an African drum, the descendants made their way to the banks of the Mobile River near Alabama’s coast. A wreath of white, yellow and red flowers was carried into the river by a kayaker and released into the waters. The event marked the anniversary of the ship arriving 162 years ago with 110 enslaved people brought to the country against their will from what is now the west African nation of Benin, said Darron Patterson, president of the Clotilda Descendants Association. The 1860 voyage, which happened decades after the law banning the importation of slaves had taken effect, began as a bet when a wealthy plantation owner wagered he could import a shipload of slaves without being caught. The 2019 discovery of the remnants of the Clotilda sparked renewed interest in its saga. But Patterson said the focus should be on the people it carried. “It’s not about the ship. It’s not about sails or nails or wood. It’s about the people who were in the cargo hold. And their stories were amazing stories,” he said. Patterson’s great-great-grandfather, Kupollee – a beekeeper, farmer and woodworker – was one of the 110 on the ship.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Masks are again required for people using federal buildings or riding buses inside Denali National Park and Preserve because of high COVID-19 levels in the broader community. The park is instituting the mandate per U.S. Interior Department guidelines, which require masks when COVID-19 community levels reach the high status in the surrounding area. Both the Denali Borough north of the park and the Matanuska-Susitna Borough south of Denali reported their status as high in data to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Masks covering the nose and mouth will be required for everyone over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status. They must be worn in all common and shared workspaces in buildings owned or controlled by the National Park Service, including visitor centers, lodges, gift shops and restaurants. Masks also are required to ride buses and courtesy shuttles inside the park.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A three-member U.S. appeals court panel has sided with state prison officials’ ban on sexually explicit material for inmates, denying a prison journal’s claims of First Amendment violations. The 9th Circuit panel in San Francisco issued an opinion Friday mostly supporting the Arizona Department of Corrections’ previous censorship of various issues of Prison Legal News. The state had challenged a district court’s permanent injunction of the ban and an order to deliver four issues unredacted. “We conclude that most of the Department’s redactions of the Prison Legal News issues … abide by the First Amendment,” Circuit Judge Eric Miller wrote. For example, it found the redaction of graphic passages from an October 2014 article were “rationally related” to discouraging sexual harassment of corrections officers. Representatives for the Arizona Department of Corrections and the Human Rights Defense Center, which publishes Prison Legal News, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Saturday. The department established an order in 2010 prohibiting prisoners from sending, receiving or possessing sexually explicit material or content seen as “detrimental” to the safety and operation of prison facilities. It was issued after mostly female staff complained inmates were harassing them with sexual images.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: Police have arrested a man on an attempted capital murder charge in a shooting that caused mass flight from a concert in the state’s northwest. Officers arrived at Parsons Stadium in Springdale soon before 11 p.m. Saturday to find a crowd fleeing and a man in his 20s with a gunshot wound in the “upper torso,” city police said in a statement. Capt. Jeff Taylor told the Associated Press he did not know who was performing or whether anyone else was injured in the evacuation. Paramedics took the wounded man to a local hospital, where witnesses told investigators that the suspected gunman was Erik Navareyes, according to the statement. About 1 a.m. Sunday, officers found Navareyes at a hospital in the neighboring community of Rogers. Police said hospital staff told them the 21-year-old had sought treatment there, saying he was in a fight and shot someone. Police arrested Navareyes and took him to the Washington County jail. He was not listed in jail records Sunday afternoon, and Taylor said he did not know whether the man had a lawyer. Taylor said that the gunshot victim survived but that he could not provide additional information on his health.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Two people were killed and three wounded in shootings before dawn Monday at four 7-Eleven stores in Southern California, and authorities said they were seeking a lone gunman in at least three of the shootings. The shootings appear to have occurred after robberies or attempted robberies at the four convenience stores on July 11, or 7/11 – a day when the national 7-Eleven brand was celebrating its 95th birthday by giving out free Slurpee drinks. “Our hearts are with the victims and their loved ones,” 7-Eleven Inc. said in a statement. “We are gathering information on this terrible tragedy and working with local law enforcement.” It wasn’t immediately clear to investigators what prompted the shootings in the cities of Riverside, Santa Ana, Brea and La Habra, nor why the violence occurred July 11. “I think the only person to answer that would be the suspect,” said Officer Ryan Railsback, a spokesperson for the Riverside Police Department, where the first shooting happened about 1:50 a.m. “There’s no way it can be a coincidence of it being 7-Eleven, July 11.”\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The state Department of Corrections has rescinded a new policy barring parole officers from seeking criminal charges for people escaping community-corrections halfway houses after criticism that it would jeopardize public safety. State corrections officials reversed course last week and reinstituted seeking arrest warrants for halfway house escapes, The Gazette reports. The move by the Corrections Department not to pursue arrest warrants for individuals transitioning from prison who had escaped from halfway houses had generated criticism from law enforcement officials, prosecutors and halfway house operators. “This is nothing short of a dereliction of DOC’s duty to keep local communities safe while transitioning offenders back into those same communities,” Jefferson County Sheriff Jeff Shrader wrote in a June 27 letter to Dean Williams, the executive director of the Department of Corrections. Because of the pushback, Williams and Stan Hilkey, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety, the state agency that oversees community-corrections halfway houses, planned to discuss the subject last week. Late Wednesday afternoon, Merideth McGrath, the Corrections Department’s director of parole, announced to her agency that she was reinstating seeking arrest warrants for such cases.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Years of attack by an invasive beetle species have decimated the state’s population of ash trees, endangering power lines and roadways and stretching towns’ budgets as they attempt to remove potential hazards. The iridescent green emerald ash borer beetle is believed to have come from Asia through Canada to the U.S. about 20 years ago and into Connecticut about 10 years ago. Experts say millions of the trees are now dead or dying. “It’s fair to say that all ash trees will succumb, in pockets more dramatically than others,” State Forester Chris Martin told The Republican-American. Removing a dead ash tree from private property can cost between $400 and $1,200, and decisions about who is responsible for tree removal are made in consultation with local tree wardens. Falling trees have killed two people in the state in recent years. “Some weeks we get bills for $12,000 or $8,000. It’s costing the town a lot of money,” Goshen First Selectman Todd Carusillo told the newspaper. Eversource has a $33 million budget for tree removal in 149 towns along 16,000 miles of roads. Sean Redding, the utility’s manager of vegetation, told the newspaper most trees in western Connecticut have already been affected and have been removed or fallen down on their own without risk to overhead lines or motorists.\n\nDelaware\n\nFenwick Island: Golf carts and other low-speed vehicles are once again allowed on some town streets after a Chancery Court official ordered the resort town to temporarily suspend enforcement of its ban. Resident Kim Espinosa sued Fenwick Island in late June in an attempt to overturn the town’s ordinance that prohibited most low-speed vehicles, including the yellow Moke – a specific type of electric golf cart – that Espinosa and her family have been using to get around Fenwick for the past year. Espinosa said she attempted to work with the town before going to the court system, to no avail. While Fenwick officials did not wish to comment on the pending litigation, the March ordinance says the ban was designed to “promote the public health, safety and general welfare of the property owners and residents of the Town of Fenwick Island.” In the June 21 lawsuit, Espinosa argued that the town’s ordinance interferes with her property rights and is in direct conflict with the state law regulating low-speed vehicles. The Delaware law allows LSVs – four-wheeled vehicles, excluding trucks, that can reach up to 20 mph but no more than 25 mph on paved surfaces – on any two-lane roads with speed limits of 35 mph or less. LSVs are not permitted on any dual highways unless to cross the highway to get to the other side.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Park Service has proposed closing the upper portion of Beach Drive in Rock Creek Park in an effort to protect natural resources and improve recreation, WUSA-TV reports. The upper portion would be closed to cars from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day every year, as the summer season often brings more people out to enjoy the park. It would remain open to drivers when many tourists and nature-lovers retreat in the chillier months. According to Chelsea Sullivan, a public affairs specialist with the National Park Service, the seasonal closure would include Bingham Drive, Sherrill Drive and Beach Drive in three sections. In late April 2020, the NPS temporarily expanded the closure of the upper portion of Beach Drive to increase socially distanced recreational opportunities for pedestrians and cyclists. The Park Service said the 2020 closure provided a “valuable opportunity for park visitors to recreate more freely and safely within Rock Creek Park.” The agency is inviting the public to review the environmental assessment and share comments through Aug. 11.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: After an arduous five-year process that involved a series of state and federal approvals, a fundraising effort that generated nearly $1 million, logistical challenges, and unimagined complications that included a global pandemic, the towering marble statue honoring Mary McLeod Bethune will be unveiled this week in the nation’s capital. At 11 a.m. Wednesday, the sculpture that was artfully chiseled out of a 13-foot-long block of precious marble will be dedicated in the U.S. Capitol Building’s National Statuary Hall. Civic leaders and elected officials in Daytona Beach see the milestone as an opportunity to introduce the world to the accomplishments of one of the city’s iconic figures, depicted in a statue conceived and created with meticulous attention to detail. The statue will be one of the two representing Florida in the Capitol, replacing a nearly 100-year-old bronze sculpture of Confederate Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith. And Bethune’s statue will be the first representing a Black person in the state collection inside Statuary Hall. Four other Black people are represented in other parts of the Capitol: Martin Luther King Jr., Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth and Rosa Parks. The Smith statue was removed this past fall and will be placed in temporary storage at the Museum of Florida History in Tallahassee.\n\nGeorgia\n\nElberton: Two days after the Georgia Guidestones were destroyed by a bomb, a group of Elbert County residents gathered at the crime scene with a backhoe to dig further into the mysterious 42-year-old landmark. When the Stonehenge-type monument north of Elberton was unveiled in 1980, it was noted that a time capsule was buried 6 feet below the gigantic stone monoliths. “We dug down about 7 feet until we hit compacted Georgia red clay that had never been disturbed – and we found nothing,” Chris Kubas, executive vice president of the Elberton Granite Association, said Friday. “We didn’t know what we were likely to find anyway.” The lack of the time capsule is yet another mystery clouding the Georgia Guidestones, a roadside attraction that had brought thousands of tourists a year to Elberton. The granite sculpture generated publicity over the years in numerous books, television documentaries and social media hype. Before dawn July 6, someone set off a bomb that shattered one of the 19-foot-high, 28-ton blocks of granite. Now that the county’s most widely discussed landmark is gone, there is some talk about rebuilding. “I’ve had several granite manufacturers tell me they would be interested in donating resources and materials to rebuild if ultimately that is decided,” Kubas said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige signed a law Monday authorizing $600 million toward housing for Native Hawaiians through the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gem State native and “Breaking Bad” star Aaron Paul is putting his midcentury modern home in the city on the market, the Idaho Press reports. Designed by renowned architect Art Troutner and taking after the style of Frank Lloyd Wright, the home – known as “The Klein House” – boasts more than 2,000 square feet and was listed last week for more than $1.3 million. Paul and his wife also own a large home in McCall, Idaho, according to the newspaper.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The head of the Illinois Department of Human Services has been ordered to return to Sangamon County Circuit Court on charges of ignoring another court order to transport a county jail inmate into state custody. The court ruled Friday that Grace Hou, secretary of IDHS, must appear in court July 15 to respond to charges of ignoring an order to place Christopher Hall, 38, of Beloit, Wisconsin, in the Andrew McFarland Mental Health Center for psychiatric treatment. Hall, who had been charged last year on four counts of first-degree murder, aggravated discharge of a firearm, being an armed habitual offender and unlawful possession of a weapon by a felon in the shooting death of Hason Willis, 43, of Springfield, was ruled unfit to stand trial in May and ordered to be placed at McFarland. However, the order said that as of Friday, he had not been placed there, remaining in custody at the Sangamon County Jail. IDHS had previously been held in contempt last month in a similar case in which a Springfield man had not been transported to state custody despite a court order. Judge Adam Giganti had ruled that DHS would have to pay $100 a day each day that he was not in state custody.\n\nIndiana\n\nLafayette: Back a Boiler, Purdue University’s controversial income share agreement program, has been suspended for the upcoming academic year, but previous participants are still on the hook for costly contracts many say they signed after falling for deceptive marketing tactics. The decision to suspend the program raised questions for Purdue students and alumni holding Back a Boiler agreements, which require participants to pay back a portion of their post-graduation monthly earnings for a set period of time or until they hit a maximum payment cap. The program has been under fire since an advocacy group asked the U.S. Department of Education to investigate it, alleging that some of the marketing tactics and agreement terms violate federal law. Purdue has “brazenly ignored” rules and laws that govern financial products such as the income share agreements it offers, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center. In its letter to the education department, the nonprofit alleges that the university has done so “as part of a scheme to drive its students to take on risky, high-rate private student loans.” The university has denied any wrongdoing. A spokesperson said that the program was suspended due to a change in the third party that services the agreements and that it had no bearing on the outstanding contracts.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A beach at Lake of Three Fires State Park is closed as a precaution after a swimmer was diagnosed with Naegleria fowleri, commonly called “brain-eating amoeba,” according to a news release from the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services. The closure is in response to the confirmed infection of the microscopic, single-celled, free-living amoeba in a Missouri resident with a potential exposure while swimming at the park in southern Iowa’s Taylor County. The swimmer, undergoing treatment in an intensive care unit for the infection, was likely exposed to the Iowa lake water over the last two weeks of June, though officials didn’t have specific dates. Iowa state health officials and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are testing to confirm the presence of the infection in the lake. Naegleria fowleri is typically found in warm bodies of fresh water such as lakes, rivers and ponds. It can “cause a rare, life-threatening infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis,” health officials said in the release. People are infected when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose, usually while swimming or diving in lakes and rivers. It cannot spread from one person to another, health officials said. Infections are rare, with 33 across the U.S. from 2011 to 2020, according to the CDC.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The city saw a 78% rise last year in the number of traffic crashes that occur at its intersections and is on pace to finish this year with a similar total. Meanwhile, a growing number of residents have told police Chief Bryan Wheeles they think Topeka’s intersections have become less safe – particularly due to drivers running red lights, police Capt. Colleen Stuart said. Officers are responding this month by cracking down on drivers who run red lights as part of an initiative to make Topeka intersections safer, the police department announced June 30 on its Facebook page. “You may see a concentration of officers at various intersections throughout our city reinforcing safe driving practices,” that post said. It drew an enthusiastic response from Facebook users, who made more than 200 comments in reply. “Thank you!” wrote local resident Susan Blanck-Harlan. “Innocent people are going to get killed, if this isn’t stopped.” Another person joked about how often he sees drivers run red lights. He wrote: “No cop, no stop.” Topeka Municipal Court assesses a $100 fine for a red light violation, plus court costs totaling $76, according to its website.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Another lawsuit has been filed over the historic Waverly Hills Sanatorium, touted by paranormal thrill-seekers as one of the most spirit-infested places in the world. The new filing last month by owner Charlie Mattingly and CEM Land Co., which Mattingly formed more than 20 years ago to buy the land, seeks to evict the historical society he created to maintain the facility and handle tours. The Waverly Hills Historical Society says it’s still on the premises, but Mattingly is pushing for the historical society to vacate the property within seven days of the court’s approval. The case filed in Jefferson District Court is set for a pretrial conference July 18. Mattingly and the Waverly Hills Historical Society already were engaged in a bitter legal dispute over its ownership. The historical society has argued Mattingly failed to maintain the grounds and damaged the property with its actions, prompting members to push to evict him. Mattingly counters that those claims are unfounded and that his ouster has sullied his reputation. Historical society President Renae Clark said in the 2021 lawsuit that Mattingly and his wife were “required” to leave the property nearly two years ago after his wife, Tina Mattingly, was fired as the historical society’s executive director over “internal complaints.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The superintendent of Louisiana State Police has acknowledged he was pulled over for speeding in an unmarked work vehicle but did not receive a ticket from one of his own officers. Col. Lamar Davis told WAFB-TV he accepts responsibility but does not remember how fast he was driving. A state trooper pulled Davis over June 28 on the Atchafalaya Basin Bridge along Interstate 10 west of Baton Rouge. “I was simply wrong in that situation,” Davis said in an interview Friday. “There is no excuse for it, other than I need to slow my butt down.” The head of Louisiana State Police public affairs, Capt. Nick Manale, said the trooper “utilized his discretion and did not issue a citation.” Manale said the trooper did not make notes about how fast Davis was driving in the area where the speed limit was 60 mph. WAFB obtained a copy of the trooper’s body camera footage through a public records request. On Thursday, Louisiana State Police released the trooper’s body camera footage and a snippet of video from the trooper’s dashboard camera. The body camera footage cuts off as soon as the trooper exits his vehicle and recognizes he has pulled over his boss. “Well, I’ll be,” the trooper says just before the video stops.\n\nMaine\n\nBrooksville: A superfund mining site is receiving $21 million in Environmental Protection Agency funding to expedite contamination cleanup efforts. The Callahan Mine superfund site in Brooksville originally received $9 million from the bipartisan federal infrastructure bill passed in November last year, but an additional $12 million has now been approved to address the contamination at the site, the EPA said in a statement. “It’s a priority for EPA to get this site off the Superfund backlog list. Cleaning up this site is key for the Brooksville community to develop alternatives for potential future uses in this area,” New England’s EPA director David Cash said in the statement. Brooksville site has been on a priority list for the EPA since 2002 and has been waiting for funding since the current cleanup phase in 2019. The funding is a part of a larger plan the agency has to help clean up superfund sites in communities across the country.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: After securing a new state permit, a Johns Hopkins University researcher will be allowed to continue medical experiments on barn owls that have been criticized by a leading animal rights group. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has campaigned for years to end the researcher’s experiments it calls “cruel” and “worthless,” The Baltimore Sun reports. The group has lodged complaints with state regulators about the legality of Hopkins’ testing practices. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources last month issued Hopkins a new permit that allows the experiments to continue. The university has defended the experiments, saying associate professor Shreesh Mysore’s work could yield critical insight into medical conditions, including ADHD, autism and schizophrenia. The experiments involve the placement of electrodes into the brains of the owls. The electrodes do not hurt or damage the birds, though the owls are ultimately euthanized, Eric Hutchinson, director of the university’s Research Animal Resources, told the newspaper.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Signs around a construction site for what’s been called the first LGBTQ-friendly senior affordable housing project in New England were vandalized with threatening graffiti over the weekend, drawing quick condemnation from civic leaders. The messages in black spray paint were left on signs on the security fence around the former school in Boston’s Hyde Park neighborhood, according to LGBTQ Senior Housing Inc., the nonprofit behind the 74-unit complex known as The Pryde. The project that broke ground last month is expected to welcome its first residents in late 2023. Gretchen Van Ness, executive director of LGBTQ Senior Housing Inc., doesn’t live far from the construction site and said she started getting emails about the vandalism from neighbors out walking their dogs about 8:30 a.m. Sunday. “We’ve received such widespread support in the neighborhood, and we’ve really been welcomed,” she said. “This is not how the majority of people in Hyde Park feel.” The vandalism was reported to Boston police just before 11 a.m. Sunday, a department spokesperson said Monday. The matter was referred to the department’s civil rights unit, Officer Andre Watson said. There had been no arrests as of Monday morning. At an afternoon rally, Mayor Michelle Wu called the vandalism “pathetic.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Abortion rights are poised to come before the state’s voters in November after an abortion rights campaign turned in a record-breaking number of signatures Monday for a ballot initiative to the secretary of state’s office. The effort will further increase attention on Michigan’s elections, where the battleground state’s Democratic governor and attorney general have made abortion rights a centerpiece of their reelection campaigns. The push to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution comes weeks after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and gave states the power to decide whether to ban the procedure. The ruling is expected to lead to abortion bans in roughly half the states. Michigan is among several states with a pre-Roe abortion law that was set to take effect if the federal judicial ruling was overturned. However, a judge issued an injunction that temporarily blocked the 1931 law, which would make abortion a felony in all cases, except when “necessary to preserve the life of such woman.” “The number of signatures showed that here in Michigan we trust women. We trust people. We trust doctors, not politicians, to make decisions about our body, our pregnancy and parenthood,” Reproductive Freedom for All spokesperson Shanay Watson-Whittaker said during a news conference in Lansing.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A judge declared many of the state’s restrictions on abortion unconstitutional Monday, including a mandatory 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that both parents be notified before a minor can get an abortion. Ramsey County District Judge Thomas Gilligan also struck down Minnesota’s requirements that only physicians can perform abortions and that abortions after the first trimester must be performed in hospitals. His order took effect immediately, meaning the limits can’t be enforced. Gilligan ruled in a lawsuit by Gender Justice and other abortion rights supporters that successfully argued the restrictions were unconstitutional under a landmark 1995 Minnesota Supreme Court ruling known as Doe v. Gomez, which held that the state constitution protects abortion rights. The judge called that case “significant and historic” and said it’s unaffected by the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. “These abortion laws violate the right to privacy because they infringe upon the fundamental right under the Minnesota Constitution to access abortion care and do not withstand strict scrutiny,” Gilligan wrote.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A judge has ruled that the mayor did not have the power to veto a contract that the City Council had not approved. Judge Larry Roberts issued his ruling Friday in a dispute among Jackson officials over who will be paid to collect garbage, news outlets report. The Jackson City Council sued after Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba issued an emergency order to award a garbage collection contract to Richard’s Disposal. The council had voted multiple times against giving the contract to the the New Orleans-based company. “There’s nothing there to veto. The council didn’t pass affirmatively the matter. It rejected it,” said Roberts, a retired Mississippi Court of Appeals judge who was appointed to hear the case in Hinds County Chancery Court. Jessica Ayers, an attorney for the mayor, argued that he has the power to veto the negative vote. “You can expect the possibility of us appealing this matter,” Lumumba said.\n\nMissouri\n\nCape Girardeau: A federal judge on Friday threw out a lawsuit by Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt that blamed China for the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh said in his 38-page ruling that in this case federal rules prohibit a sovereign foreign entity from being sued in American courts. “All in all, the court has no choice but to dismiss this novel complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,” Limbaugh stated in the final line of the dismissal order. The judge noted earlier in the opinion that the civil suit against China is one of many filed “amidst the wreckage of the COVID-19 pandemic.” Schmitt’s office said it would appeal the ruling. The complaint filed in April 2020 alleges that Chinese officials are “responsible for the enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians.” Schmitt said the Chinese government lied about the dangers of the virus and didn’t do enough to slow its spread. China criticized the lawsuit as “very absurd” and said it has no factual and legal basis. Schmitt called the lawsuit historic, but legal experts mostly panned it as a stunt aimed at shifting blame to China for the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Kris Hansen, who recently departed the No. 2 post at the Montana Attorney General’s Office, has died at age 52, according to state officials. A news release from the Montana Department of Justice said Hansen died early Thursday, the Independent Record reports. No information about her cause of death was released. Hansen was named chief deputy of the Montana Department of Justice in December 2020. Before that, she worked for the Montana state Auditor’s office and represented Havre as a Republican state lawmaker. In late May, Hansen confirmed she was leaving the office but declined to say why. The Attorney General’s Office said at the time that she was leaving to “attend to personal and family matters.” “Kris was a dear friend, a conservative leader, and an amazing woman who dedicated her life to others,” Attorney General Austin Knudsen said in a statement Friday. Hansen was a central figure during the state Republicans’ conflict with the judicial branch last year. Hansen, representing GOP lawmakers who’d subpoenaed judicial records, wrote a public letter accusing the Supreme Court of interfering with a legislative investigation by quashing a subpoena for judicial records. The court ultimately ruled state lawmakers had overstepped their authority with the subpoenas.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Republican state Sen. Mike Flood will officially join the U.S. House on Tuesday, when he’s sworn in to fill the seat of disgraced former U.S. Rep. Jeff Fortenberry. Flood will take his oath of office at the U.S. Capitol. Flood, a former speaker of the Nebraska Legislature, defeated Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks in a special election to represent the state’s 1st Congressional District, which includes Lincoln and dozens of smaller communities. Fortenberry, a Republican, resigned in March shortly after a California jury found him guilty of charges that he lied to federal investigators about $30,000 in illegal campaign contributions from a Nigerian billionaire. He was sentenced to probation and fined. Flood will hold the seat until at least January, for what would have been the rest of Fortenberry’s term. He’ll face Pansing Brooks again in the November general election to determine who serves the next full term.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Visitors to the Fremont Street Experience will be required to go through metal detectors and bag checks and will be subject to age requirements to enter the Las Vegas pedestrian mall in a new step to curb increased violence. Metal detectors, bag checks, a curfew for unaccompanied minors and 18- to 20-year-olds, and increased law enforcement presence will be used on weekends until further notice, according to Fremont Street Experience officials. The security measures come in response to increased aggravated assaults and a recent homicide at the downtown tourist spot. “The safety and security of our guests, employees and tenants has been and will always be our priority,” Andrew Simon, Fremont Street Experience’s president and CEO, said in a statement. “Everything else is secondary. The incidents from the past week cannot and will not be tolerated. Our tourism, jobs and safety will not be threatened by these actions.” Public safety officials said they have noticed an increase in violent crime on and around the five-block district, where visitors often gather to visit casinos, see concerts, drink and gawk at the canopied video screen.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nFranklin: Pots, pans, silverware and a foot warmer were among the nearly two dozen items stolen from the house where statesman Daniel Webster was born, a state parks official said. Webster, a lawyer and orator who served as secretary of state under three presidents and represented Massachusetts and New Hampshire in Congress, was born in the two-room cabin in Franklin in 1782. Randy Kovach of the New Hampshire State Parks told WMUR-TV that most of the items, which were taken sometime between July 3 and July 8, are replicas and don’t have much value. “They were all mostly either pewter, tin or iron,” Kovach said. “So if you wanted to melt them down, you’re going to weigh a lot, but you’re not going to get a lot of money.” Franklin police said they’ve reached out to pawn shops and are using K-9 dogs to try to track down the items. “It saddens me that we can’t give quite the educational show that we’d do if we had those items to explain to the children and the people about the way we lived in the 1700s,” Kovach said. “Whoever took them – I hope they can make a good home for them and needed them more than we did.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWall: A black bear and two cubs were spotted at Shark River Park on Thursday amid a spike of sightings near the Jersey Shore. Summer Hill Camp decided to keep kids off trails after a staff member reported seeing the bear family, camp Director Lauren Cheney said. The sighting was just one of about a dozen and a half this year in Monmouth County. Bears have been sighted in Freehold Township, Holmdel, Howell, Middletown and Atlantic Highlands. Another bear was spotted in Wall in May, said Caryn Shinske, spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Protection. In 2021, there were two bears seen in Monmouth County, according to the DEP. Ocean County has also seen a sharp uptick. A bear or bears have been spotted in Barnegat, Lakewood, Little Egg Harbor, Stafford and Toms River. So why the Jersey Shore? Brooke Maslo, an associate professor in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Natural Resources at Rutgers, said while the bear population is mostly concentrated in the northwest part of the state − hemmed in by Routes 80 and 287 because they’re so hard to cross − there are black bears in all 21 counties in New Jersey. It’s just that you don’t see them much. They steer clear of humans as a rule. “Bears are pretty secretive in general,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said the state is committing $1.7 million to repair a collapsed bridge and implement additional flood mitigation strategies in the area. Lujan Grisham made the announcement Saturday next to the damaged bridge in northeast Roswell. The city has received close to 3 inches of rain so far this year and began experiencing intense flooding following severe torrential rainfall last year. The $1.7 million is coming from the New Mexico Department of Transportation’s State Road Fund. The funding will go to repairing the bridge and implementing flood mitigation measures to be ahead of the curve before the next major storm hits, according to Lujan Grisham. “The more we put into communities, so that we have safe roads, safe bridges, safe flood mitigation, the better it is for these communities,” she said. The bridge previously collapsed due to flooding in 2013. Though it was replaced, additional changes to address the flooding vulnerabilities were not implemented, according to Albuquerque TV station KOB.\n\nNew York\n\nMelville: More sharks are being spotted in the waters off Long Island, a trend that is likely to continue – and experts say that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Cleaner oceans, warmer water temperatures and a resurgence of bunker fish that sharks feed on are seen as factors, according to experts. Detection, from drones to helicopters, also has improved, and reports are easily spread through social media. “There are a lot more sharks than 10 or 15 years ago,” Christopher Paparo, manager of Stony Brook University’s Marine Sciences Center, told Newsday. “In the 1960s, we did not have sharks, whales and dolphins.” Shark attacks in the area have been very rare until recently, with an average of about one reported per 10 years for the past century, Newsday reports. Within the past two weeks, two lifeguards suffered bites, and a third person was bitten in a possible shark attack, according to the newspaper. Experts say the increase in the number of sharks is a sign conservation efforts have succeeded in helping restore ecological balance to the oceans, after overfishing, pollution and a movement to kill sharks partly inspired by the 1975 movie “Jaws” reduced their numbers. Smaller sharks, seen closer to shore more often than larger ones, help keep prey species in check, and many shark types are scavengers that keep the ocean cleaner and healthier.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools will begin installing body-scanning equipment in its middle schools this summer to ensure students don’t have guns or other weapons. The district’s Interim Superintendent Hugh Hattabaugh told The Charlotte Observer of the plans Friday. The technology is already employed in all 21 of the district’s traditional high schools. “It may seem (like) an inconvenience, but I see it as a positive for our students,” Hattabaugh said. “This is another one of those important steps to keep our schools safe and orderly.” The technology will be rolled out in phases beginning in August, the newspaper reports. Its implementation comes after guns turned up in the district’s schools at a record rate during the previous school year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The U.S. Customs and Border Protection won’t restore hours of operation to pre-pandemic levels at some ports of entry in the state, despite pressure from Gov. Doug Burgum. In a letter to the agency and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security sent Friday, Burgum said the reduced hours at several North Dakota port crossings along the U.S.-Canadian border “causes significant hardship on the movement of citizens, goods and tourists between our two nations.” In a statement to the Associated Press on Friday, the federal agencies said longer opening hours cannot be justified because of the shrinking volume of traffic at the border crossings – a decline that began even before the pandemic. “For several years, pre-COVID, CBP documented a reduction in vehicles and pedestrian traffic along our northern border, and CBP’s obligation is to utilize all available resources responsibly to perform our mission of safeguarding the homeland,” the statement said. North Dakota has 17 border crossings, and the one at Pembina on Interstate 29 in the northeastern part of the state is the busiest. In April 2020, hours of operation were reduced by several hours in the evening at 10 of crossings. Hours also were shortened at some ports of entry in Montana, Minnesota, Idaho and Washington, and they will remain that way, agencies said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A Democratic proposal to force “deadbeat dads” to pay for unintended pregnancies just got a boost from an unexpected source: Christian lobbyists. Senate Bill 226 would allow those who are pregnant to sue those who caused the pregnancy, regardless of the circumstances. A judge could award at least $5,000. State Sen. Tina Maharath, D-Columbus, said the bill is particularly important after Roe v. Wade was overturned, forcing people either to leave Ohio for abortions or to deliver babies from unintended pregnancies. Ohio law now bans abortions after fetal cardiac activity is detected, which is about six weeks into a pregnancy. At that point, many don’t yet realize they are pregnant. There are no exceptions for rape or incest. The average cost of childbirth in Ohio is $15,000, Maharath said. “Too often, this cost is solely the mother’s to bear, especially in the case of an unintended pregnancy. However, the father shares equal responsibility for the pregnancy, and it is only right that he pays equally for it.” On Friday, Center for Christian Virtue President Aaron Baer announced that his organization agrees. “Senator Tina Maharath’s legislation is an innovative approach to combat the hook-up culture that has led to broken lives, hurting women, and abandoned children,” Baer said in a statement.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An influential political action committee that has helped elect Republicans to the state Senate has agreed to dissolve and pay a fine of more than $60,000 to the state after an investigation revealed multiple state campaign finance rule violations. The Republican Senatorial Committee entered into a settlement agreement Friday with the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. The PAC officials acknowledged accepting more than $35,000 of impermissible contributions from corporations or contributions earmarked for a specific candidate or candidate committee. Both contributions violate state ethics rules. Glenn Coffee, the former Republican leader of the Senate and now an attorney representing the PAC, declined to comment on the settlement. Under the agreement, the PAC agreed to pay $37,750 to the state’s general fund, an amount equal to the impermissible contributions it accepted, plus another $25,000 in civil penalties. PAC officials also agreed to dissolve the committee and dispose of any remaining assets.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The patience of Oregon Supreme Court Chief Justice Martha Walters seems to be growing thin as the state continues to violate the constitutional rights of criminal defendants charged with crimes who cannot afford an attorney. “Hundreds who are constitutionally entitled to counsel are being denied that right, and no end is in sight,” Walters wrote in a letter sent July 1 to the eight commissioners who oversee the state’s public defense agency. Four times in her six-page letter, Walters called on the board to “direct” the executive director of the Office of Public Defense Services “to prepare a plan for presentation” at a meeting later this month, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. She said she seeks a plan that proposes immediate steps that will enable the Public Defense Services Commission to fulfill its obligation to provide lawyers for those who have a constitutional right to representation. The person she asked commissioners to direct is Stephen Singer, who took over the Office of Public Defense Services in December. Many of the problems facing the public defense system in Oregon go back years. Since last fall, the state has continued to charge people with crimes and hold some of them in custody, despite a shortage of public defenders.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Nursing home trade associations in the state said Monday that they have agreed to boost staffing levels as part of a deal with Gov. Tom Wolf to increase aid to an industry struggling with high turnover. With Pennsylvania awash in surplus tax collections, Wolf on Monday signed legislation authorizing nearly $300 million a year – almost 20% more annually – in additional Medicaid payments to nursing homes, which were wracked by the COVID-19 pandemic. Trade associations had worked out a compromise on staffing levels with Wolf’s administration and SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania, a labor union that represents about 5,000 nursing home workers, prior to the legislation being signed. “This is a major step forward for Pennsylvania’s long-term care industry,” Wolf told a Capitol news conference after signing the measure. Officials say the money should boost worker salaries, staffing levels and retention while stabilizing the facilities’ finances and improving the quality of care. Matt Yarnell, president of SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania, said the ravages of the pandemic on nursing homes helped persuade state budgetmakers to grant an increase in the Medicaid reimbursement rate. Pennsylvania’s Medicaid reimbursement rate increase is the first in almost a decade, trade associations said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A woman hired to work for a house cleaning service was fired just days later after management found out she was pregnant, the woman said in a discrimination lawsuit filed Monday. The suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Rhode Island on behalf of Bristol resident Julia Schultz alleges the owners of Merry Maids of Rhode Island violated state civil rights law. Schultz applied for the house cleaner position in late April 2021, when she was about 16 weeks pregnant, according to the lawsuit. She attended an orientation program for new hires in early May 2021, during which the company’s co-owner asked if she was pregnant, according to the suit. When she confirmed she was, the co-owner said she could not offer her the job because of its “physical demands” and said she “should be at home taking care” of the baby. She then suggested Schultz reapply after the baby’s birth. “When I left the building that day, I felt so ashamed, like I was doing something wrong by trying to work while pregnant,” Schultz said. “Especially with Roe v. Wade getting overturned, it’s even more important now to fight for our rights, fight against the wealth gap between men and women, and empower women, not try to keep them down based on old, outdated traditions.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two trains collided Monday morning, causing one of them to derail and leaving two railway employees hospitalized, according to the Columbia-Richland Fire Department. No additional injuries were expected. A diesel fuel leak was contained and posed no danger to the public or environment, Columbia Fire Chief Aubrey D. Jenkins told the Associated Press. The incident occurred in a wooded area in southeast Columbia with no nearby homes. The derailment will not negatively affect traffic or the environment, Jenkins said. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control was working with the fire department, private contractors and rail officials to reopen the rail line. Fire crews arrived on the scene shortly after the incident occurred about 8:20 a.m.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The U.S. Forest Service has given preliminary approval to a company that wants to do some exploratory drilling for gold in the Black Hills. The land involved is near the Pactola Reservoir in the Black Hills National Forest and is owned by the federal government. Minneapolis-based F3 Gold has been seeking approval for its drilling project for several years. The Forest Service has now completed its final environmental assessment and issued a draft decision that would allow the drilling to move forward, but with numerous restrictions to protect cultural sites, water and other natural resources, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. The draft decision is subject to a 45-day objection period. The Forest Service would consider any objections before issuing a final decision. “After an exhaustive, multi-year process atypical for a small-scale exploration drilling project, we are pleased that we are finally getting our permit,” F3 Gold Vice President Brian Lentz said in a statement. The Forest Service draft decision allows for 47 drilling pads on more than 3 acres near Jenny Gulch. Lilias Jarding of the Black Hills Clean Water Alliance said exploratory drilling could eventually lead to a gold mine, which could pollute the Pactola Reservoir, which is a popular recreational destination and a storage reservoir for water systems including Rapid City’s.\n\nTennessee\n\nMartin: The University of Tennessee at Martin has committed to improving its landscape for pollinators and is now an affiliate of the Bee Campus USA program, officials said. Bee Campus USA is an initiative of the nonprofit Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation. The goal is to sustain pollinators by providing healthy habitats that include a variety of native plants without pesticides, the school said in a statement. “UT Martin serves a key agricultural region and protecting our bee population is necessary for our farms and communities,” UT Martin Chancellor Keith Carver said in a statement last week. UT Martin professor of wildlife biology Eric Pelren said the school has added more trees and plants that are beneficial to pollinators, is committed to minimizing the use of dangerous pesticides, and will work to raise awareness about pollinators.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A pregnant woman ticketed for driving in a high occupancy vehicle lane plans to fight the charge in court by arguing that her unborn daughter now counts as a person. When an officer pulled Brandy Bottone over for driving by herself in a HOV lane just days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, she pointed to her belly. “I said, ‘Well, not trying to throw a political mix here, but with everything going on, this counts as a baby,” said Bottone, who was eight months pregnant when she was pulled over June 29. Bottone, who lives in the Dallas suburb of Plano, said she’ll fight the ticket in court next week. Her story was first reported by The Dallas Morning News. “I was driving to pick up my son. I knew I couldn’t be a minute late, so I took the HOV lane,” she said. Bottone’s ticket came five days after the Supreme Court stripped away women’s constitutional protections for abortion. In Texas, that put in motion a trigger law that will ban virtually all abortions in the coming weeks and defines an unborn child as a living human from fertilization to birth. Bottone said the stand she’s taking on the ticket isn’t for or against abortion, but the law should be uniform. “If there’s a pro-women category, that’s my stance,” she said.\n\nUtah\n\nPark City: A member of “The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City” pleaded guilty Monday to a fraud conspiracy charge that could result in a prison sentence of over 11 years. Jennifer Shah, 48, of Park City, entered the plea to a single count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in Manhattan federal court after signing a plea agreement with New York prosecutors a day earlier that carries a recommended sentencing range of 11 to 14 years behind bars. She told a judge that beginning in 2012, she participated in a massive telemarketing fraud for nearly a decade that prosecutors say cheated thousands of people nationwide, including some over age 55. She said she knew that she was teaming up with others to market products to people “that had little or no value.” “I knew this was wrong and that many people were harmed, and I’m so sorry,” Shah told Judge Sidney H. Stein. Sentencing was set for Nov. 28. Shah remained free on bail but did not speak as she left the courthouse and walked a short distance to a waiting vehicle. In a statement afterward, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called Shah a “key participant in a nationwide scheme that targeted elderly, vulnerable victims.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Ten of the state’s immigrant farmworkers filed a joint petition June20 for Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop their deportations. The 10 farmworkers are all men from Mexico who have lived in Vermont for years. Some arrived to U.S. on the H-2A visa for temporary agricultural workers, but those visas have since expired, and the workers are now unable to obtain legal permission to live in the country. The 10 workers are also active members of Migrant Justice, a Burlington-based nonprofit that works for the human rights of Vermont’s immigrant communities. “I came to Vermont from Mexico when I was 16 years old and have been working on dairy farms ever since. I was pulled over by ICE in 2019 for no reason and detained,” Pedro Ubaldo, one of the ten workers, said through a translator. “Now they are trying to deport me to Mexico, but my life is here. I am fighting to stay in Vermont to provide for my family and organize with my community for a better future.” Migrant Justice said the men – who have been dubbed the “Migrant Justice 10” – were racially profiled by ICE and arrested for lacking immigration papers. They were each arrested separately over the past several years and incarcerated in immigration detention facilities until they were released on bond.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: New round-trip Amtrak routes began Monday between Washington, D.C., and two Virginia cities: Norfolk and Roanoke. The additions bring to eight the number of state-funded round trips from the nation’s capital, The Washington Post reports. “We’re adding more options for people at the right time,” said Michael McLaughlin, chief operating officer at the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority. “Capacity on the trains is getting full, and ridership is at record-high levels.” The extra train to Norfolk will be the third round trip to the area, according to the newspaper. It will depart Norfolk at 1 p.m. and arrive in Washington in a little over 4.5 hours. A new southbound train will depart Washington at 12:05 p.m. Amtrak already runs one morning trip from Roanoke to D.C. and an evening return trip. Starting Monday, a new train will leave Washington for Roanoke at 8:05 a.m., and a Washington-bound train will leave Roanoke at 4:30 p.m., arriving shortly before 9:30 p.m. Amtrak, which expanded service to Richmond last year, said the additions will give riders more options to travel in Virginia and boost connections to the Northeast. Virginia is among 17 states that have state-sponsored Amtrak service, the Post reports.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A new program in King County is tapping people who have experienced homelessness in the past to help currently unhoused people get off the street. The King County Regional Homelessness Authority hopes the program will get nearly every person living outside downtown into long-term, stable housing. Kirk Rodriguez does outreach work talking to people around Pioneer Square. Rodriguez used to be homeless when he moved to Seattle six years ago. After about two years on the street, he got into state-sanctioned housing. Rodriguez said that when he was figuring out where to live and finding other services he needed, he did it alone – he didn’t have anyone to help guide him through the process. “No, I did not; I wish that I had,” he told KUOW near City Hall Park recently. “It would have made a huge difference.” Rodriguez works on the City Hall Park Neighborhood Outreach Team, a group of about eight who go out multiple times a day to check with people in the area. The team gives out food, hand warmers, and toiletries like tampons and condoms. “If there’s somebody who’s looking like maybe they’re having a rough day or could use some snacks or whatever else, we’ll engage,” Rodriguez said. “We make sure to say hi no matter what.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRocket Center: Northrop Grumman Corp. plans to build a new missile integration facility in the state. The company announced plans last week to build the 113,000-square-foot facility to increase its capacity to deliver weapons to meet warfighter needs. “Our new missile integration facility is a factory of the future, designed to affordably produce high quantities of missiles to meet increasing customer demand,” said Mary Petryszyn, corporate vice president and president, Northrop Grumman Defense Systems. The facility won’t be limited to producing one type of missile but will be able to adapt manufacturing techniques to quickly pivot as demands change, the company said in a statement. Construction on the new facility is expected to be completed in 2024.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Local health officers can unilaterally issue orders to slow diseases, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday in a decision upholding contentious orders limiting indoor gatherings and mandating masks that Dane County officials handed down during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 4-3 decision affirms that state law grants local health officers the ability to do what they deem necessary to stop communicable diseases without oversight from governing bodies such as city councils and county boards. Liberal-leaning Justice Jill Karofsky wrote for the majority that Wisconsin law clearly authorizes public health officers to issue such orders and has since the state was a territory. She added that if local elected officials don’t like the orders, they can remove the health officer, creating a strong safeguard for the people. “Today’s ruling is a win for every resident of our community,” Dane County Executive Joe Parisi said. “This ruling ensures that our public health department will have the ability to keep our community safe – and that decision making will remain science-based.” The ruling marks the culmination of a lawsuit two parents filed in Dane County in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A 24-hour fundraising campaign Wednesday will allow people to donate to more than 250 different nonprofits around the state through one online portal. WyoGives, an annual event begun in 2019 by the Wyoming Nonprofit Network, aims to amplify fundraising efforts and centralize access to donations, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Donors can look up the mission and other information of various organizations through wyogives.org, where they can search by cause, location and other information.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/shopping/2022/01/25/free-masks-government-pharmacies/9209432002/", "title": "N95 mask: How to get free masks from government at CVS ...", "text": "CVS said free N95 masks are expected to arrive in its stores as early as Thursday including at CVS pharmacies inside Target stores.\n\nWalgreens started its free N95 mask program Friday, Jan. 28 at the first locations.\n\nWalmart expects to start its free N95 mask distribution by the second week of February at stores and Sam's Club locations.\n\nAs the government sends free COVID tests to households across the nation, 400 million free masks are also on their way.\n\nUnlike the free testing kits which are ordered through a government website or hotline and shipped by the United States Postal Service, the free N95 masks will be available to pick up at “tens of thousands” of pharmacies and community health centers that have partnered with the federal government's COVID-19 vaccination campaign.\n\nWhile the White House said the masks would be available for distribution starting this week, specific dates for all stores and locations are not yet available.\n\nWhite House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients said Friday it was the \"largest deployment of personal protective equipment in U.S. history.”\n\nDAILY MONEY NEWSLETTER: Money tips and advice delivered right to your inbox.

Now we know.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Yes, I think my record speaks to that, Wolf. In 2002, when the Congress was debating whether or not we go into a war in Iraq, invade Iraq, I got up on the floor of the House and I said that would be a disaster, it would lead to unprecedented levels of chaos in the region. And I not only voted against the war, I helped lead the effort against that war.\n\nJust last year, I helped, for the first time in the modern history of this country, pass a War Powers Act resolution, working with a conservative Republican, Mike Lee of Utah, which said that the war in Yemen, led by Saudi Arabia, was unconstitutional because Congress had not authorized it. We got a majority vote in the Senate. We got a majority vote in the House. Unfortunately, Bush vetoed that and that horrific war continues.\n\nI am able to work with Republicans. I am able to bring people together to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts.\n\nBLITZER: Vice President Biden, you talk a lot about your experience, but some of your competitors have taken issue with that experience, questioning your judgment in voting to authorize the Iraq war. Why are you the best prepared person on this stage to be commander-in-chief?\n\nJOE BIDEN: I said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if, in fact, he couldn't get inspectors into Iraq to stop what — thought to be the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. It was a mistake, and I acknowledged that.\n\nBut right — the man who also argued against that war, Barack Obama, picked me to be his vice president. And once we — once we were elected president, he turned — and vice president, he turned to me and asked me to end that war.\n\nI know what it's like to send a son or daughter, like our colleague has gone to war in Afghanistan, my son for a year in Iraq, and that's why I do it very, very reluctantly. That's why I led the effort, as you know, Wolf, against surging tens of thousands of troops into Afghanistan. We should not send anyone anywhere unless the overwhelming vital interests of the United States are at stake. They were not at stake there. They were not at stake in Iraq. And it was a mistaken vote.\n\nBut I think my record overall on everything we've done has been — I'm — I'm prepared to compare it to anybody on this stage.\n\nDebate guide:\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Sanders, you have been attacking Vice President Biden's vote on the Iraq war, but you recently acknowledged that your vote to authorize the war in Afghanistan was also a mistake. So you both acknowledged mistakes. Why should the American people trust your judgment more?\n\nSANDERS: Well, it's a little bit of a difference. On that particular vote, every single member of the House, including myself, voted for it. Only Barbara Lee voted against it.\n\nBut what I understood right away, in terms of the war in Iraq, the difference here is that the war in Iraq turned out to be the worst foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country. As Joe well knows, we lost 4,500 brave troops. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died. We have spent trillions of dollars on that endless war, money which should go into health care and education and infrastructure in this country.\n\nJoe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say. I thought they were lying. I didn't believe them for a moment. I took to the floor. I did everything I could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently.\n\nBLITZER: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: I was asked to bring 156,000 troops home from that war, which I did. I led that effort. It was a mistake to trust that they weren't going to go to war. They said they were not going to go to war. They said they were just going to get inspectors in.\n\nThe world, in fact, voted to send inspectors in and they still went to war. From that point on, I was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake. And from that point on, I've voted to — I moved to bring those troops home.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Klobuchar, you've publicly questioned Mayor Buttigieg's experience when it comes to being commander-in-chief. Why is your time as a U.S. senator more valuable than his time as a U.S. naval intelligence officer in Afghanistan and as mayor?\n\nSEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Wolf. And I have been very clear that I respect the mayor's experience very much in the military. I just have different experience.\n\nI've been in the U.S. Senate for over 12 years. And I think what you want in a president is someone who has dealt with these life-and-death issues and who has made decisions.\n\nI will look at my position on the Iraq war first. I wasn't in the Senate for that vote, but I opposed that war from the very beginning. In my first campaign for Senate, I ran against a Republican who ran ads against me on it, but I stood my ground. When I got to the Senate, I pushed to bring our troops home.\n\nThen I have dealt with every issue, from Afghanistan to keeping our troops with good health care after what we saw with Walter Reed and being part of an effort to improve the situation for our troops in a very big way with our education and with their jobs and also with their health care.\n\nI think right now what we should be talking about, though, Wolf, is what is happening right now with Donald Trump. Donald Trump is taking us pell-mell toward another war. We have a very important resolution. We just found out today that four Republicans are joining Democrats to go to him and say: You must have an authorization of military force if you're going to go to war with Iran.\n\nThat is so important, because we have a situation where he got us out of the Iranian nuclear agreement, something I worked on for a significant period of time. As president, I will get us back into that agreement. I will take an oath...\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... to protect and defend our Constitution.\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: And I will mean it.\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar. We're going to continue talking about who's best prepared to be commander-in-chief. Mayor Buttigieg?\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG: Well, I bring a different perspective. There are enlisted people that I served with barely old enough to remember those votes on the authorization after 9/11, on the war in Iraq. And there are people now old enough to enlist who were not alive for some of those debates.\n\nThe next president is going to be confronted with national security challenges different in scope and in kind from anything we've seen before, not just conventional military challenges, not just stateless terrorism, but cybersecurity challenges, climate security challenges, foreign interference in our elections. It's going to take a view to the future, as well as the readiness, to learn from the lessons of the past. And for me, those lessons of the past are personal.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Warren, in our new CNN/Des Moines Register poll, almost a third of your supporters say your ability to lead the military is more of a weakness than a strength of yours. Why are you best prepared to be commander-in-chief?\n\nMore from January's Iowa Poll:\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN: I believe the principal job of the commander-in-chief is to keep America safe. And I think that's about judgment. I think it starts with knowing our military. I sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I work with our generals, with our military leaders, with our intelligence, but I also visit our troops. I visit our troops around the world.\n\nI've been to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to Jordan, to South Korea. I've been to lots of places to talk with our troops. And I fight for our troops, to make sure that they get their pay, that they get the housing and medical benefits that they've been promised, that they don't get cheated by giant financial institutions.\n\nYou know, I have three brothers who were in the military, and I know how much our military families sacrifice. But I also know that we have to think about our defense in very different ways. We have to think about cyber. We have to think about climate. We also have to think about how we spend money.\n\nWe have a problem with a revolving door in Washington between the defense industry and the Department of Defense and the Pentagon. That is corruption, pure and simple. We need to block that revolving door, and we need to cut our defense budget. We need to depend on all of our tools — diplomatic, economic, working with our allies — and not let the defense industry call the shots.\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Steyer, you worked in finance for decades and have never held elected office. Why should voters believe you have the experience or judgment to serve as commander-in-chief?\n\nTOM STEYER: I worked internationally around the world for decades. I traveled, I met with governments, I met with businesses, and I understand how America interacts with other countries.\n\nAnd you asked what is the reason that the — the experience really counts, and to me, I believe that Sen. Warren made a great point. It isn't so much about experience, it's about judgment.\n\nIf you've been listening to this, what we are hearing is 20 years of mistakes by the American government in the Middle East, of failure, of mistakes. So the real question is judgment.\n\nAnd if you look who had the judgment, it was a state senator from Illinois with no experience named Barack Obama who opposed the war. It is a congresswoman, Barbara Lee from Oakland, California, who stood up against the original vote, who was the only person in Congress.\n\nSo I would say to you this: An outside perspective, looking at this and actually dealing with the problems as they are is what we're looking for now. I agree with Sen. Warren. We are spending dramatically too much money on defense. The money that we're spending there, we could spend in the other parts of the budget, and it's time for someone from the outside to have a strategic view about what we're trying to do and how to do it.\n\n►As Tom Steyer's Iowa bus tour ends, some like his outsider resume. Others want more experience.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Sanders, in the wake of the Iran crisis, Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei has again called for all U.S. troops to be pulled out of the Middle East, something you've called for, as well. Yet when American troops last left Iraq, ISIS emerged and spread terror across the Middle East and, indeed, around the world. How would you prevent that from happening again?\n\nSANDERS: O.K., I'm going to tell you, but before I tell you that, let me tell you something else.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd that is — and I don't know if my colleagues here will agree with me or not. Maybe they will. But what we have to face as a nation is that the two great foreign policy disasters of our lifetimes were the war in Vietnam and the war in Iraq. Both of those wars were based on lies. And right now, what I fear very much is we have a president who is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq.\n\nTo answer your question, what we need to do is have an international coalition. We cannot keep acting unilaterally. As you know, the nuclear deal with Iran was worked on with a number of our allies. We have got to undo what Trump did, bring that coalition together, and make sure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.\n\nBLITZER: Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: I was part of that deal to get the nuclear agreement with Iran, bringing together the rest of the world, including some of the folks who aren't friendly to us. And it was working. It was working. It was being held tightly. There was no movement on the part of the Iranian government to get closer to a nuclear weapon.\n\nAnd look what's happened. He went ahead — and it was predictable from the day he pulled out of the agreement, Trump, what exactly would happen. We're now isolated. We're in a situation where our allies in Europe are making a comparison between the United States and Iran, saying both ought to stand down, making a moral equivalence.\n\nWe have lost our standing in the region. We have lost the support of our allies. The next president has to be able to pull those folks back together, re-establish our alliances, and insist that Iran go back into the agreement, which I believe with the pressure applied as we put on before we can get done.\n\nBLITZER: So just to be clear, Vice President Biden, would you leave troops in the Middle East or would you pull them out?\n\nBIDEN: I would leave troops in the Middle East in terms of patrolling the Gulf, where we have — where we are now, small numbers of troops, and I think it's a mistake to pull out the small number of troops that are there now to deal with ISIS.\n\nWhat's happened is, now that he's gone ahead, the president, and started this whole process moving, what's happening? ISIS is going to reconstitute itself. We're in a position where we have to pull our forces out. Americans have to leave the entire region. And quite frankly, I think he's flat-out lied about saying the reason he went after — the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Klobuchar, what's your response?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I would leave some troops there, but not in the level that Donald Trump is taking us right now. Afghanistan, I have long wanted to bring our troops home. I would do that. Some would remain for counterterrorism and training.\n\nIn Syria, I would not have removed the 150 troops from the border with Turkey. I think that was a mistake. I think it made our allies and many others much more vulnerable to ISIS. And then when it comes to Iraq, right now, I would leave our troops there, despite the mess that has been created by Donald Trump.\n\nAt the briefing we had last week, I was the only person on this stage that asked a question of both the secretary of defense and the secretary of state. And I asked them about imminent threat, but I also asked them what their alternatives were. And they gave very vague, vague answers.\n\nI asked them, where is the surge of diplomacy that we would be seeing if I was president? And I asked them where they were going to leave the Iraqi people. Time and time again, you see that this president puts his own interests, his private interests, in front of our country's. I would put our country's interests first as commander-in-chief.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Warren, leave combat troops, at least some combat troops in the Middle East, or bring them home?\n\nWARREN: No, I think we need to get our combat troops out. You know, we have to stop this mindset that we can do everything with combat troops. Our military is the finest military on Earth and they will take any sacrifice we ask them to take. But we should stop asking our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily.\n\nOur keeping combat troops there is not helping. We need to work with our allies. We need to use our economic tools. We need to use our diplomatic tools.\n\nNow, look, I understand, there are people on this stage, when it comes to Afghanistan, for example, who talk about 5 more years, 10 more years. Shoot, Lindsey Graham talks about leaving troops there for a hundred more years. No one has a solution and an endpoint. We need to get our combat troops out. They are not helping create more safety for the United States or the region.\n\nBLITZER: Vice President Biden, is Sen. Warren right?\n\nBIDEN: Well, I tell you what, there's a difference between combat troops and leaving special forces in a position. I was part of the coalition to put together 68 countries to deal with stateless terror as well as failed states. Not us alone, 68 other countries.\n\nThat's how we were able to defeat and end the caliphate for ISIS. They'll come back if we do not deal with them and we do not have someone who can bring together the rest of the world to go with us, with small numbers of special forces we have, to organize the effort to take them down.\n\nBLITZER: Mayor Buttigieg, you served in Afghanistan. Who's right?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We can continue to remain engaged without having an endless commitment of ground troops. But what's going on right now is the president's actually sending more. The very president who said he was going to end endless war, who pretended to have been against the war in Iraq all along — although we know that's not true — now has more troops going to the Middle East.\n\n►In Iowa, Pete Buttigieg criticizes Joe Biden's 2002 Iraq War vote, calling it the 'worst foreign policy decision' of his lifetime\n\nAnd whenever I see that happen, I think about the day we shipped out and the time that was set aside for saying goodbye to family members. I remember walking with a friend of mine, another lieutenant I trained with, as we walked away, and his one-and-a-half-year-old boy was toddling after him, not understanding why his father wasn't turning back to scoop him up. And it took all the strength he had not to turn around and look at his boy one more time.\n\nThat is happening by the thousands right now, as we see so many more troops sent into harm's way. And my perspective is to ensure that that will never happen when there is an alternative as commander-in-chief.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Sanders?\n\nSANDERS: Wolf, in America today, our infrastructure is crumbling. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. Eighty-seven million people have no health care or are uninsured or underinsured. We got 500,000 people sleeping out on the streets tonight.\n\nThe American people are sick and tired of endless wars which have cost us trillions of dollars. Our job is to rebuild the United Nations, rebuild the State Department, make sure that we have the capability of bringing the world together to resolve international conflict diplomatically and stop the endless wars that we have experienced.\n\nBLITZER: We're going to get to everyone, but, Vice President Biden, you criticized President Trump's decision to kill the Iranian general, Soleimani, without first going to Congress. Are there any circumstances, other than a direct attack on the United States, where you would take military action without congressional approval?\n\nBIDEN: I ran the first time as a 29-year-old kid against the war in Vietnam on the grounds that the only way to take a nation to war is with the informed consent of the American people. The informed consent of the American people.\n\nAnd with regard to this idea that we can walk away and not have any troops anywhere, including special forces, we — there's no way you negotiate or have been able to negotiate with terrorists. You have to be able to form coalitions to be able to defeat them or contain them. If you don't, we end up being the world's policeman again.\n\nThey're going to come to us. They've come to us before. They'll come to us again. So it's a fundamental difference than negotiating with other countries. It's fundamentally the requirement that we use our special forces in small numbers to coordinate with other countries to bring together coalitions.\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Vice President, just to be clear, the Obama-Biden administration did not ask Congress for permission multiple times when it took military action. So would the Biden doctrine be different?\n\nBIDEN: No, there was the authorization for the use of military force that was passed by the United States Congress, House, and Senate, and signed by the president. That was the authority. It does not give authority to go into Iran. It gave authority to deal with these other issues.\n\nBLITZER: Mayor Buttigieg?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: That authorization needs to be replaced.\n\nBIDEN: Exactly. And we tried to.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: When we lost troops in Niger, there were members of Congress who admitted they didn't even know we had troops there. And it was all pursuant to an authorization that was passed to deal with Al Qaida and 9/11. And often, Congress has been all too happy to leave aside its role. Now, thanks to Democrats in Congress, that's changing. But the reality is, year after year, Congress didn't want to touch this, either, because it was so politically difficult.\n\nFundamental truth is, if our troops can summon the courage to go overseas into harm's way, often on deployment after deployment, then we've got to make sure that Congress has the courage to take tough up-or-down votes on whether they ought to be there. And when I am president, anytime — which I hope will never happen — but anytime I am compelled to use force and seek that authorization, we will have a three-year sunset, so that the American people are included ...\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... not only in the decision about whether to send troops, but whether to continue.\n\nBLITZER: Thank you. Sen. Warren — we're going to get to everyone — but, Sen. Warren, what about you? Are there any circumstances, other than a direct attack on the United States, where you would take military action without congressional approval?\n\nWARREN: Well, imminent threat. But we need an authorization for the use of military force before we take this nation into combat. That is what the Constitution provides and that is what as commander-in-chief I will do.\n\nBut I just want to be clear. Everyone on this stage talks about nobody wants endless war. But the question is, when and how do you plan to get out of it?\n\nYou know, on the Senate Armed Services Committee, we have one general after another in Afghanistan who comes in and says, you know, we've just turned the corner and now it's all going to be different. And then what happens? It's all the same for another year. Someone new comes in and we've just turned the corner.\n\nWe've turned the corner so many times, we're going in circles in these regions. This has got to stop. It's not enough to say some day we're going to get out. No one on the ground, none of our military can describe what the conditions are for getting out. It's time to get our combat troops home.\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Steyer, would a President Steyer use military force as a deterrent? And if not, under what circumstances would you take military action?\n\nSTEYER: I would take military action to protect the lives and safety of American citizens. But what we can see in the Middle East and what this conversation shows is that there is no real strategy that we're trying to accomplish in what we're doing in the Middle East.\n\nObviously, Mr. Trump has no strategy. He is going from crisis to crisis, from escalation to escalation. But if you look further over the last 20 years, including in the war in Afghanistan, we know from the Washington Post that, in fact, there was no strategy. There was just a series of tactical decisions that made no sense.\n\nSo we really have to ask ourselves in the Middle East, what are we trying to accomplish? I agree with Vice President Biden. To do it, we should definitely be doing it in coalition with other countries. And I want to point out that, as we do that, we're confronted by this issue which everyone is talking about.\n\nBut at the same time, there's a gigantic climate issue in Australia, which also requires the same kind of value-driven coalition-building that we actually should be using in the Middle East. We need to ask ourselves, how are we going to provide a world that is safer for Americans, where we can prosper more? And every single thing we should do should follow into that strategy. And it's just not happening in Washington, D.C.\n\nPHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg, another critical issue you'd face as president is the threat of nuclear weapons. Last week, President Trump said, quote, \"As long as I am president of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\" Would a President Buttigieg make that same promise?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Ensuring that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons will, of course, be a priority, because it's such an important part of keeping America safe. But unfortunately, President Trump has made it much harder for the next president to achieve that goal.\n\nBy gutting the Iran nuclear deal — one that, by the way, the Trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear Iran — by gutting that, they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we are now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war.\n\nNow — yes?\n\nPHILLIP: Continue.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: In order to get that done, we've got to work with our partners. The Iran nuclear deal, the technical term for it was the JCPOA. That first letter \"J\" stood for \"Joint.\" We can't do this alone, even less so now after everything that has happened.\n\nWhich is why it will be so critically important to engage leaders, including a lot of new leaders emerging around the world, and ensure that we have the alliances we need to meet what I believe is not just an American goal, but a widely shared goal around the world to ensure that Iran does not become a nuclear-armed country.\n\nPHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg, to be clear, would you allow Iran to become a nuclear power, yes or no?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: No. Our security depends on ensuring that Iran does not become nuclear. And by the way, we've got a lot of other challenges with nuclear proliferation around the world.\n\nDespite this president's coziness with Vladimir Putin, we actually seem to be further away from being able to work with Russia on things like the renewal of START. We've got to move toward less, not more nuclear danger, whether it is from states, from stateless potential terrorist actors, or anywhere else around the world.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nSen. Klobuchar, if you become president, it's very possible there won't be an Iran nuclear deal for the United States to rejoin. Given that, how would you prevent Iran from gaining a nuclear weapon?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I would start negotiations again. And I won't take that as a given, given that our European partners are still trying to hold the agreement together. My issue is that, because of the actions of Donald Trump, we are in a situation where they are now starting — Iran is starting to enrich uranium again in violation of the original agreement.\n\nSo what I would do is negotiate. I would bring people together, just as President Obama did years ago, and I think that we can get this done. But you have to have a president that sees this as a number-one goal.\n\nAnd in answer to the original question you asked the mayor, I would not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. And then you have to get an agreement in place. I think there are changes you can make to the agreement that are sunset, some changes to the inspections, but overall, that is what we should do.\n\nAnd I am the one person on this debate stage, on the first night of the very first debate, when we were asked what we saw as the biggest threat to our world, I said China on the economy, but I said Iran, because of Donald Trump. Because I feared that exactly what happened would happen: enrichment of uranium, escalation of tensions, leaving frayed relations with our allies. We can bring them back, understanding this is a terrorist regime that we cannot allow to have a nuclear weapon.\n\nPHILLIP: Vice President Biden, I want to ask you about North Korea. President Trump has met with Kim Jong-un three times. President Obama once said he would meet with North Korea without any preconditions. Would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?\n\nBIDEN: No, not now. I wouldn't meet with them without any preconditions. Look, what — we gave him everything he's looking for, legitimacy. The president showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against him.\n\nNeed to know ahead of the caucuses:\n\nI would be putting what I did as vice president — I met with Xi Jinping more than anyone else. I would be putting pressure on China to put pressure on Korea, to cease and desist from their nuclear power, make — their efforts to deal with nuclear weapons. I would move forward as we did before — and you reported it extensively, Wolf — about moving forward the whole notion of defense against nuclear weapons, that we would — and when China said to me, when Xi Jinping said to me, that's a threat to us, I said, we're going to move and protect our interests unless you get involved and protect it.\n\nI would reignite the relationship between Japan and South Korea, and I would put enormous pressure, enormous pressure on China, because that's also in their interests for them to put pressure on North Korea to cease and desist.\n\nBut I would not, I would not meet with — absent preconditions, I would not meet with the, quote, \"Supreme Leader,\" who said Joe Biden is a rabid dog, he should be beaten to death with a stick. I count that ...\n\nSANDERS: Other than that, you like him?\n\nBIDEN: Other than that, I like him, and he — he ...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd he got a love letter from Trump right after that.\n\nPHILLIP: Mr. Steyer, would you meet with North Korea without any preconditions?\n\nSTEYER: No. It's very clear that if we're going to do something with North Korea, we're going to have to do it in concert with our allies, that meeting with him without preconditions is not going anywhere, that the staff can meet to try and see how far we can get.\n\nBut this is a classic situation where the United States' idea of going it alone makes no sense. And when you are talking about Iran, let's face it. Iran is under great pressure economically. So every single discussion we've had about Iran has had to do with military power and America versus Iran, whereas, in fact, what worked with President Obama was an alliance of our allies and us putting economic pressure on them for them to give up their military tactic. That, to me, is called strategy. Having a goal to make America safer, by looking more broadly...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you.\n\nSTEYER: ... than just us, as the policeman of the world spending money.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Let's stay with the theme of America's role in the world and talk about trade. Tomorrow, President Trump is expected to sign phase one of a trade agreement with China. And the Senate will likely soon approve a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, Iowa's largest trading partners.\n\n►Iowans applaud deal that clears a path for U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement\n\n►Caught in prolonged trade war, Iowa farmers could finally see a big win with U.S.-China deal\n\nSen. Sanders, you have said that new deal, the USMCA, quote, \"makes some modest improvements,\" yet you are going to vote against it. Aren't modest improvements better than no improvements...\n\nSANDERS: No, we can do much ...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: ... for the farmers and manufacturers who have been devastated here in Iowa?\n\nSANDERS: The answer is we could do much better than a Trump-led trade deal. This deal — and I think the proponents of it acknowledge — will result in the continuation of the loss of hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs as a result of outsourcing.\n\nThe heart and soul of our disastrous trade agreements — and I'm the guy who voted against NAFTA and against permanent normal trade relations with China — is that we have forced American workers to compete against people in Mexico, in China, elsewhere, who earn starvation wages, $1 or $2 an hour.\n\nSecond of all, every major environmental organization has said no to this new trade agreement because it does not even have the phrase \"climate change\" in it. And given the fact that climate change is right now the greatest threat facing this planet, I will not vote for a trade agreement that does not incorporate very, very strong principles to significantly lower fossil fuel emissions in the world.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: But, Sen. Sanders, to be clear, the AFL-CIO supports this deal. Are you unwilling to compromise?\n\nSANDERS: The AFL-CIO does. The Machinists Union does not. And every environmental organization in this country, including the Sunrise Organization, who are supporting my candidacy, opposes it.\n\nSo I happen to believe — and I hope we will talk about climate change in a moment — if we do not get our act together in terms of climate change, the planet that we're going to be leaving our kids and our children — and our grandchildren will be increasingly unlivable and uninhabitable.\n\n►2020 candidates on agriculture: In Iowa, six Democratic presidential candidates vow to help farmers, battered by low prices, trade disputes\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: We're going to get to climate change, but I'd like to stay on trade. Sen. Warren ...\n\nSANDERS: Well, they are the same in this issue.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Warren, you support the USMCA. Why is Sen. Sanders wrong?\n\nWARREN: I do. I wasn't here. I haven't been in Congress long enough to have voted against NAFTA, but I led the fight against the trade deal with Asia and the trade deal with Europe, because I didn't think it was in the interests of the American people, the American workers, or environmental interests.\n\nBut we have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting. And they are hurting because of Donald Trump's initiated trade wars. We have workers who are hurting because the agreements that have already been cut really don't have enforcement on workers' rights.\n\nThis new trade deal is a modest improvement. Sen. Sanders himself has said so. It will give some relief to our farmers. It will give some relief to our workers. I believe we accept that relief, we try to help the people who need help, and we get up the next day and fight for a better trade deal.\n\nWe need a coherent trade policy. We need a policy that actually helps our workers, our farmers. We need them at the table, not just to trade policy written for big, international companies. I'm ready to have that fight, but let's help the people who need help right now.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you. Sen. Sanders, can you please respond to Sen. Warren?\n\nSANDERS: Well, I think that it is not so easy to put together new trade legislation. If this is passed, I think it will set us back a number of years.\n\nSen. Warren is right in saying we need to bring the stakeholders to the table, that — it is the family farmers here in Iowa and in Vermont and around the country. That is the environmental community. That is the workers. Bottom line here is, I am sick and tired of trade agreements negotiated by the CEOs of large corporations behind doors.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Klobuchar, I'd like to bring you in here.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Brianne, I want to hit reality here. I serve on the Agriculture Committee, and I will never forget going to Crawfordsville here in Iowa — and thank you for bringing up Iowa, Brianne, since that is where we are — and I went to this plant and there was one worker left in that plant. That plant had been shut down because of Donald Trump's trade policies and because of what he had done to those workers with giving secret waivers to oil companies and ruining the renewable fuel standard. That worker brought out a coat rack of uniforms and he said, these are my friends, they don't work anymore. And their names were embroidered on those uniforms, Derek, Mark, Salvador. And that guy started to cry.\n\nThese are real people hurt by Donald Trump's trade war. So what we should do, and I support the USMCA, I am glad that these improvements were made that are supported by people like Richard Trumka and Sherrod Brown on labor and environment and on pharma, the sweetheart deal...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... because I think we need a big trading block...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... with North America to take on China. And the way you are stronger...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Klobuchar, your time is up.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... China is with our allies.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mayor Buttigieg, do you support the USMCA, yes or no?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Yes, it has been improved, it is not perfect. But when you sit down with the people who are most impacted, they share just how much harm has been done to them by things like the trade war and just how much we can benefit, American consumers and workers and farmers, by making sure we have the right kind of labor and enforceability, as Democrats ensured we got in this USMCA.\n\nBut let's acknowledge why there is such fear and frustration. You know, my part of the country, in the industrial Midwest, I remember when they came around in the '90s, selling trade deals, telling us, don't worry about your slice of the pie, the pie will get so much bigger that everyone will be better off. And that promise was broken.\n\nThe part about the pie getting bigger happened. It's just that the part about it getting to most people where I live did not. That is why there is such frustration, the sense that these decisions in boardrooms...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... and in committee rooms in Washington are being made not based on what's best for us...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... but based on their own gain.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Vice President Biden, Sen. Sanders has said that Donald Trump will, quote, “eat your lunch” for voting yes on what he calls terrible trade agreements. When it comes to trade, why are you the best candidate to take on President Trump?\n\nBIDEN: There will be no trade agreements signed in my administration without environmentalists and labor at the table. And there will be no trade agreement until we invest more in American workers. We should be putting our money and our effort and our time in preparing American workers to compete in the 21st Century on the high-tech side, dealing with all artificial intelligence. We should be focusing on equipping American workers to do that.\n\nAnd by the way, the idea — I don't know that there's any trade agreement that the senator would ever think made any sense, but the problem is that 95 percent of the customers are out there. So we better figure out how we begin to write the rules of the road, not China.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Sanders?\n\nSANDERS: Joe and I have a fundamental disagreement here, in case you haven't noticed. And that is NAFTA, PNTR with China, other trade agreements were written for one reason alone. And that is to increase the profits of large multi-national corporations. And the end result of those two, just PNTR with China, Joe, and NAFTA, cost us some 4 million jobs, as part of the race to the bottom.\n\nI am sick and tired and will not tolerate, and we will use the power of the federal contracting system. If a corporation in America wants to shut down in Iowa or Vermont or any place else, and then they think they're going to get on line for our generous federal contract, they've got another thing going.\n\nWe need some corporate responsibility here and we need to protect good-paying jobs in America, not see them go to China, Mexico, Vietnam, and all these other countries.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mr. Vice president, what's your response?\n\nBIDEN: We need corporate responsibility and I agree with that completely. But we also need to have enforcement mechanisms in the agreements we make. Enforceable agreements. That's one of the things that has been improved with the trade agreement with Mexico. And that's what we should be doing in any agreement we have.\n\nBut let's get back to the basics here. If we don't set the rules of the road by going out to our partners, instead of poking our eye — excuse me, poking our finger in the eye of all of our friends and allies, we make up 25 percent of the world's economy. We've got to bring the other 25 percent of our allies along with us to set the rules of the road so China cannot continue to abuse their power by stealing our intellectual property and doing all the other things, using their corporate state system to our significant disadvantage.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Warren?\n\nWARREN: You know, our problem is not just that we need corporate responsibility. It has been the structure of how these trade deals have been negotiated. The United States has had this strategy for decades. And that strategy has been to have government trade negotiators, a small number, and then surround them with giant multi-national corporation lobbyists and corporate executives, who whisper in the ears of our negotiators and then get deals cut that are great for the giant multi-national corporations, not good for America, not good for American workers, not good for the environment.\n\nWe need a different approach to trade and it starts by calling out the corruption of these giant corporations that have cut our trade deals. Everybody wants to get to the American market. And we need to put some standards in place. You want to be able to sell your goods here, then you've got to meet some environmental standards. You've got to meet labor standards.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Warren.\n\nWARREN: We need a...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWARREN: ... approach.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: I would like to bring in Mr. Steyer here.\n\nMr. Steyer, even though farmers and manufacturers here in Iowa and around the country could see some relief from the China deal, they've been crushed by the current administration's trade war. What will you do as president to help them get back on their feet?\n\nSTEYER: Look, on the first day, I would undo Mr. Trump's tariffs. On the first day, I would get rid of his waivers that Sen. Klobuchar was referring to, to oil refiners, so that not having to use corn-based ethanol.\n\nIn fact, these trade deals have been exactly what Sen. Sanders and Warren have been saying, which is that they've been designed to grow the American GDP for the corporations of America, not for the working people of America, and not to protect the climate.\n\nSo let me say this. I'm the only person on this stage who says climate is my number one priority. I would not sign this deal, because if climate is your number one priority, you can't sign a deal, even if it's marginally better for working people until climate is also taken into consideration.\n\n►What a difference one degree makes: Iowa is getting hotter, bringing more frequent and intense storms\n\nLook, I've got four kids between the ages of 26 and 31. I cannot allow this country to go down the path of climate destruction. Everybody in their generation knows it. Frankly, Mayor Buttigieg, you're their generation. I think you would be standing up more — look, that's why I'm standing up for it.\n\nWe cannot put climate on the backseat all the time and say we're going to sign this one more deal, we're going to do one more thing without putting climate first. That's why it's my number one priority. We can do it in a way that makes us richer, but we have to do it.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mayor Buttigieg, your response?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, that's right. This issue is personal for me. It's why we're going to tackle climate from day one. It's why we've got to make sure that we have better answers than we do today. Now, what I've noticed is, pretty much all of us propose that we move on from fossil fuels by the middle of the century, starting with actions that we take right now.\n\nThe question is, how are we going to make sure any of this actually gets done? Because people have been saying the right things in these debates for literally decades. The other day in Winterset, there was a kid at one of my events, raised his hand and he pointed out that he expects to be here in his 90s in the year 2100.\n\nHe will sit in judgment over what we do, not just what we on this stage do, anyone old enough to vote right now, whether we actually put together the national project it will require to meet our climate goals, to act aggressively, not just re-joining the Paris Climate Accord, that's table stakes, but to actually move on from the fossil-dependent economy we live in today.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPHILLIP: Let's now turn to — let's now turn to an issue that's come up in the last 48 hours. Sen. Sanders, CNN reported yesterday that — and Sen. Sanders, Sen. Warren confirmed in a statement, that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Why did you say that?\n\nSANDERS: Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't say it. And I don't want to waste a whole lot of time on this, because this is what Donald Trump and maybe some of the media want. Anybody knows me knows that it's incomprehensible that I would think that a woman cannot be president of the United States.\n\nGo to YouTube today. There's a video of me 30 years ago talking about how a woman could become president of the United States. In 2015, I deferred, in fact, to Sen. Warren. There was a movement to draft Sen. Warren to run for president. And you know what, I said — stayed back. Sen. Warren decided not to run, and I then — I did run afterwards.\n\nHillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million votes. How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could become president of the United States? And let me be very clear. If any of the women on this stage or any of the men on this stage win the nomination, I hope that's not the case, I hope it's me.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut if they do, I will do everything in my power to make sure that they are elected in order to defeat the most dangerous president in the history of our country.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPHILLIP: So Sen. Sanders — Sen. Sanders, I do want to be clear here, you're saying that you never told Sen. Warren that a woman could not win the election?\n\nSANDERS: That is correct.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Warren, what did you think when Sen. Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nWARREN: I disagreed. Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But, look, this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised, and it's time for us to attack it head-on.\n\nAnd I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record. So, can a woman beat Donald Trump?\n\nLook at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nThe only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n... Amy and me.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: So true.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nSo true.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWARREN: And the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican any time in the past 30 years is me.\n\nAnd here's what I know. The real danger that we face as Democrats is picking a candidate who can't pull our party together or someone who takes for granted big parts of the Democratic constituency.\n\nWe need a candidate who will excite all parts of the Democratic Party, bring everyone in and give everyone a Democrat to believe in. That's my plan and that is why I'm going to win.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Thank you.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar, what do you say to people who don't...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Thank you, Elizabeth.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar, what do you say...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I would like to point out...\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar, let me finish my question.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Oh, OK.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPHILLIP: What do you say to people who...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I thought it was such an open-end — I wasn't at the meeting, so I can't comment, but I was going to say...\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPHILLIP: What do you say to people who say that a woman can't win this election?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I hear that. People have said it. That's why I've addressed it from this stage. I point out that you don't have to be the tallest person in the room. James Madison was 5'4\". You don't have to be the skinniest person in the room. You don't have to be the loudest person. You have to be competent.\n\nAnd when you look at the facts, Michigan has a woman governor right now and she beat a Republican, Gretchen Whitmer. Kansas has a woman governor right now and she beat Kris Kobach. And her name is — I'm very proud to know her, and her name is Governor Kelly. Thank you.\n\nThird, I would add to this, you have to be competent to win and you have to know what you're doing. And when you look at what I have done, I have won every race, every place, every time. I have won in the reddest of districts. I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas. I have brought people with me.\n\nThat is why I have the most endorsements of current Iowa legislators and former Iowa legislators in this race.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Because they know I bring people with me.\n\nAnd finally, every single person...\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... that I have beaten, my Republican opponents, have gotten out of politics for good.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd I think — I think that sounds pretty good. I think that sounds pretty good with the guy we have in the White House right now.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Sanders, you can respond.\n\nSANDERS: Well, just to set the record straight, I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress.\n\nWARREN: When?\n\nSANDERS: Nineteen-ninety.\n\nThat's how I won, beat a republican congressman.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nNumber two...\n\nWARREN: Thirty years ago.\n\nSANDERS: ... of course, I don't think there's any debate up here...\n\nWARREN: Wasn't it 30 years ago?\n\nSANDERS: I beat an incumbent Republican congressman.\n\nWARREN: And I said I was the only one who's beaten an incumbent Republican in 30 years.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nSANDERS: Well, 30 years ago is 1990, as a matter of fact.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut I don't know that that's the major issue of the day. I think what the major issue of the day is — let's — does anybody in their right mind think that a woman cannot be elected president?\n\nThat's — nobody believes that. Of — Hillary Clinton got 3 million votes, more votes than Trump. So who believes that a woman can't win? Of course, a woman can win.\n\nBut the real question is, how do we beat Trump?\n\n►Bernie Sanders says Donald Trump is 'smart fraud' who will be tough to beat, but Sanders claims he can do it\n\nAnd the only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has, by far, the largest voter turnout in the history of this country. And I believe that our campaign has the strongest grassroots movement...\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you.\n\nSANDERS: We have been endorsed by many grassroots organizations...\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Warren —\n\nSANDERS: That's why...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Warren, I want to give you the final word.\n\nWARREN: So I do think it's the right question, \"How do we beat Trump?\"\n\nAnd here's the thing. Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have out-performed men candidates in competitive races. And in 2018, we took back the House; we took back statehouses, because of women candidates and women voters.\n\nLook, don't deny that the question is there. Back in the 1960s, people asked, \"Could a Catholic win?\"\n\nBack in 2008, people asked if an African-American could win.\n\nIn both times the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate and we changed America. That's who we are.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPHILLIP: Vice President Biden?\n\nVice President Biden, go ahead.\n\nBIDEN: I agree women can win. And I have went in and campaigned for 27 of them this last — in 2018, the best group I've ever campaigned for, in terms of competence\n\nBut the real issue is who can bring the whole party together, represents all elements of the party, African-American, brown, black, women, men, gay, straight. The fact of the matter is that — I would argue that, in terms of endorsements around the country, endorsements wherever we go, I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race.\n\nPHILLIP: All right. We're going to take a short break now. The CNN Democratic presidential debate, live from Drake University, will be back right after this.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Welcome back to the CNN Democratic presidential debate, live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nPHILLIP: Let's turn to health care, the top issue for Iowa Democrats.\n\nDonald Trump is trying to repeal Obamacare, including the protections for pre-existing conditions. We all know that each of you vigorously opposes that. Still, there are some questions about what each of you would do.\n\nSen. Sanders, you have consistently refused to say exactly how much your Medicare For All plan is going to cost. Don't voters deserve to see the price tag before you send them a bill that could cost tens of trillions of dollars?\n\nSANDERS: Well, what I will tell you is Medicare For All, which will guarantee comprehensive health care to every man, woman and child, will cost substantially less than the status quo.\n\nMedicare For All will end the absurdity of the United States paying by far the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs and health care in general, while we have 87 million uninsured — uninsured and underinsured, and while 30,000 people die each year.\n\n►In Iowa, Bernie Sanders calls Pete Buttigieg's health care plan 'a failed idea'\n\nUnder Medicare For All, one of the provisions we have to pay for it is a 4 percent tax on income, exempting the first $29,000. So the average family in America that today makes $60,000 would pay $1,200 a year, compared to that family paying $12,000 a year.\n\nWe save money, comprehensive health care, because we take on the greed and the profiteering and the administrative nightmare that currently exists in our dysfunctional system.\n\nPHILLIP: Vice President Biden, does Sen. Sanders owe voters a price tag on his health care plan?\n\nBIDEN: I think we need to be candid with voters. I think we have to tell them what we're going to do and what it's going to cost. And a 4 percent tax on income over $24,000 doesn't even come close to paying for between $30 trillion, and some estimates as high as $40 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThat's doubling the entire federal budget per year. There's a way to do that. The way to do that is to take Obamacare, reinstate — rebuild it, provide a public option, allow Medicare for those folks who want it, and in fact make sure that we, in the process, reduce the cost of — of drug prices, reduce the cost of being able to buy into the — subsidize it further, and make it everybody — available to everyone.\n\nHere's the deal. That costs a lot of money. That costs $740 billion over 10 years. I lay out how I'd pay for that.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Sanders?\n\nSANDERS: Well, first of all, what Joe forgets to say is, when you leave the current system as it is, what you are talking about are workers paying on average 20 percent of their incomes for health care. That is insane.\n\nYou've got 500,000 people going bankrupt because they cannot pay their medical bills. We're spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country.\n\nLook, we have talked about health care for all — in this country — for over 100 years. Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the health care industry, of the drug companies, and finally provide health care to all through a Medicare For All single-payer program.\n\nIt won't be easy, but that is what we have to do.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: You can do it without that. You can do it without Medicare For All. You can get the same place.\n\nSANDERS: No, you can't.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar, your response?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Yeah. Sen. Sanders and I have worked together on pharmaceuticals for a long, long time. And we agree on this. But what I don't agree with is that we — his position on health care.\n\nThis debate isn't real. I was in Vegas the other day and someone said \"Don't put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn't even on the wheel.\"\n\nThat's the problem. Over two-thirds of the Democrats in the U.S. Senate are not on the bill that you and Sen. Warren on on. You have numerous governors that are Democratic that don't support this. You have numerous House members that put Nancy Pelosi in as speaker.\n\nThe answer is a non-profit public option. The answer is — the real debate we should be having is how do we make it easier for people to get coverage for addiction and mental health. I have a plan for that.\n\nAnd then, finally, what should we do about long-term care? The elephant that doesn't even fit in this room. We need to make it easier for people to get long-term care insurance. We need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums.\n\nMy own dad, I know when his long-term care insurance ends, and then we have some savings for him. He's in assisted living. He got married three times — whole other story — so there isn't much there.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut then we go to Medicaid, and I've already talked to Catholic Elder Care.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: They're willing to take him in. Our story is better than so many other families. We have to make it easier for long-term care.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: It's not just for seniors. It's also for the sandwich generation.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: People trying to help their parents.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Warren?\n\nWARREN: So we need to start with what's happening in America. People are suffering. I'll just pick one: 36 million people last year went to the doctor, got a prescription, this is what they needed to get well, and they couldn't afford to have the prescription filled. They looked at it and said it's either groceries or this prescription.\n\nMy approach to this is we've got to get as much as help to as many people as quickly as possible. I have worked out a plan where we can do that without raising taxes on middle-class families by one thin dime.\n\nWhat I can do are the things I can do as president on the first day. We can cut the cost of prescription drugs. I'll use the power that's already given to the president to reduce the cost of insulin and EpiPens and HIV-AIDS drugs. Let's get some relief to those families. And I will defend the Affordable Care Act.\n\nI've got a plan to expand health care, but let's keep in mind, when we come to a general election, we Democrats may argue among each other about the best way to do health care, but we're going to be up against a Republican incumbent who has cut health care for millions of people and is still trying to do that. I'll take our side of the argument any day. We're going to beat him on this.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Warren. Vice President Biden?\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBIDEN: The proposal I lay out does, in fact, limit drug cost. It sets up — it allows all the drug companies — excuse me, it allows you to — Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price. It sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation. And by the way, there's mental health parity that I call for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option.\n\nPHILLIP: Mr. Steyer?\n\nSTEYER: Look, we've had this conversation on this stage so many times. Everybody on this stage believes that affordable health care is a right for every single American. Everybody on this stage knows that Americans are paying twice as much for health care as any other advanced country in the world. And it makes no sense and the government has to step in.\n\nI do happen to agree with Vice President Biden that we should move and develop the Affordable Care Act with a public option. But the real question is this. This is not a new problem. Why do we keep having this conversation? We have a broken government. It has been bought by corporations that include the drug companies, the insurance companies, and the private hospitals.\n\nThat's what I'm talking about. How do we get back government of, by, and for the people? How do we actually break...\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you.\n\nSTEYER: ... the corporate stranglehold on our government so that we can get any of these things passed?\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSen. Sanders, your campaign proposals would double federal spending over the next decade, an unprecedented level of spending not seen since World War II. How would you keep your plans from bankrupting the country?\n\nSANDERS: No, our plan wouldn't bankrupt the country. And, in fact, it would much improve the well-being of working-class families and the middle class.\n\nLet us be clear what Medicare for all does. It ends all premiums. It ends all copayments. It ends the absurdity of deductibles. It ends out-of-pocket expenses. It takes on the pharmaceutical industry, which in some cases charges us 10 times more for the same prescription drugs sold abroad as sold here.\n\nWhat we will do through a Medicare for all single-payer program is substantially lower the cost of health care for employers and workers, because we end the $100 billion a year that the health care industry makes and the $500 billion a year we spend in administrative — the administrative nightmare of dealing with thousands of separate insurance plans.\n\nHealth care is a human right. Every other major country on Earth is guaranteeing health care for all. The time is long overdue for us to do the same.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Again, I think it is much better to build on the Affordable Care Act. And if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipedream, you have to show how you're going to pay for it.\n\nAnd I would also note practically that the Affordable Care Act right now is 10 points more popular than the president of the United States. So I think the answer is to build on it.\n\nAnd, yes, I think you should show how you're going to pay for things, Bernie. I do. This president is treating people out there like poker chips in one of his bankrupt casinos the way he is adding to our debt.\n\nI am the one person up here who has on her website in her plan a plan to actually start taking on the deficit, by taking part of that money from that corporate tax cut that they put in there and putting it in a fund to pay back the deficit.\n\n►From November's Iowa Poll: Majority of likely Democratic caucusgoers shy away from 'Medicare for All'\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: And I have shown how I'm going to pay for every single plan...\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... capital gains tax going to the personal level, getting rid of oil giveaways.\n\nPHILLIP: Let's move on.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Doing something about the hedge fund loophole. You can go through...\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar, your time is up. Let's move on to the next question.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... and we can get the money to pay for things.\n\nPHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg, you're selling your plan as Medicare for all who want it, yet your plan would automatically enroll uninsured Americans into a public option, even if they don't want it, and force them to pay for it. How is that truth in advertising?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, it's making sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American. Look, the individual mandate was an important part of the ACA because the system doesn't work if there are free riders.\n\nWhat I'm offering is a choice. You don't have to be in my plan if there's another plan that you would rather keep. And there's no need to kick Americans off the plans that they want in order to deliver health care for all.\n\nAnd my plan is paid for. Look, our party should no longer hesitate to talk about the issue of the debt and the deficit. Now, we've got a dramatically better track record on it than Republicans do. In my lifetime, it's almost invariably Republican presidents who have added to the deficit, a trillion dollars under this president. And it's why everything I've put forward — from Medicare for all who want it to the historic investments we're going to make in infrastructure to dealing with climate change — is fully paid for.\n\nWhen it comes to health care, you can do it in two moves. Of course, my plan costs $1.5 trillion over a decade. No small sum. But not the $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 trillion that we're hearing about from the others. All you've got to do is two things, both of them are commonsense. Allow Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices and roll back the Trump corporate tax cuts that went to corporations and the wealthy that didn't even need it.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Warren?\n\nWARREN: So I started this by talking about 36 million Americans, including Americans with insurance, who just can't even afford to have a prescription filled. We all talk about plans, health care plans that we have, and these plans are paid for.\n\nThe problem is that plans like the mayor's and like the vice president's is that they are an improvement. They are an improvement over where we are right now. But they're a small improvement. And that's why it is that they cost so much less, because by themselves, they're not going to be enough to cover prescriptions for 36 million people who can't afford to get them filled.\n\nWhat we need to do is make the commitment that we know where the money comes from. We can ask those at the very top, the top 1 percent, to pay a little more. Those giant corporations like Chevron and Amazon who paid nothing in taxes, we can have them pay. And we can go after the corporate tax cheats. And when we do that, we have enough money to provide health care for all our people.\n\nYes, we build on the Affordable Care Act, but where we end up is we offer health care to all of our people. And we can offer it at no cost or low cost to all of them.\n\nPHILLIP: Mayor Buttigieg?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: It's just not true that the plan I'm proposing is small. We've got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the Treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate.\n\nThis would be a game-changer. This would be the biggest thing we've done to American health care in a half-century. Let's measure the effects of our plans based on what they would do in our everyday lives.\n\nAnd, yes, we're taking on cost. On prescription drugs, we'll have an out-of-pocket cap, even if you don't get the subsidies that would make it free, a $250 monthly cap. And here's why it's got to be monthly. You ever been in that situation or known somebody who finds that they've got to defer a procedure or delay filling a prescription to try to have it happen in the right month because of when your out-of-pocket cap hits?\n\nIt makes no sense medically because most of us don't experience the economy on an annual basis. Our bills don't come in every year. They come in every month. Same with our paychecks, biweekly or monthly.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: That's why we set this up in a way to solve the problem without running up $20 trillion, $30 trillion, $40 trillion bills.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg. Sen. Warren, your response?\n\nWARREN: Look, the numbers that the mayor is offering just don't add up. The average family in America last year paid $12,000 in some combination of deductibles and co-pays and uncovered expenses and fees. You can't cover that with the kind of money that the mayor is talking about.\n\nThe way we have to approach this is we've got to build this and we've got to build the alliances to make this happen. I can bring down the cost of prescription drugs like insulin and take hundreds of millions of dollars out of the system immediately in costs. We can get help to families.\n\nBut we have to be willing to work together. We can let people experience what health care is like when it's you and your doctor, your mental health professional, your nurse practitioner, with no insurance company standing in the middle.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Sen. Warren.\n\nWARREN: When people try it and use it, then...\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Klobuchar?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Sen. Warren, you acknowledged that Medicare for all — that you couldn't get there right away. You got on the bill that said on page eight, which is why I didn't get on it, that you would kick 149 million Americans off their current health insurance. Then, a few months ago, you said, no, you're going to wait a while to get there.\n\nAnd I think that was some acknowledgment that maybe what we're talking about is true. And I don't buy that it's not enough. It is a big, big step to say to people making $100,000 that your premiums will be cut in half, which is what the nonprofit public option will do.\n\nAnd as you talk, Mayor Buttigieg, about Medicare and having negotiation, I actually have led that bill for years. I have 34 cosponsors. As president, I can get it done. That would allow Medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they can't negotiate for better prices for our seniors.\n\nPHILLIP: Senator...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I will get it done.\n\nPHILLIP: Sen. Sanders, coming to you now. CNN reached out to Iowa Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Edward from here in Des Moines writes, \"Des Moines is an insurance town. What happens to all the insurance industry — the health insurance industry here if there is Medicare for all? What happens to all the jobs and the livelihoods of the people that live in insurance towns like Des Moines?\"\n\nSANDERS: We build in to our Medicare for all program a transition fund of many, many billions of dollars that will provide for up to five years income and health care and job training for those people.\n\nBut here is the issue. Tom Steyer made the point a moment ago. We are now spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other country. That is insane. In some cases, 10 times more for prescription drugs. Why is that? Why is that? And the answer is: the greed and corruption of the drug companies and the insurance companies.\n\nAnd if we want to do what every other major country on Earth does and guarantee people health care is a human right, not a privilege, you know what we have to do? We are finally going to have to stand up to the health care industry...\n\nSTEYER: Can I respond to this?\n\nSANDERS: ... and end hundreds of billions of dollars of waste and profiteering.\n\nPHILLIP: Mr. Steyer?\n\nSTEYER: I just want to emphasize what Sen. Sanders said. This is not a complicated problem. Between what Sen. Warren and Sen. Sanders said, it's clear. There are two problems. We're spending way too much because corporations own the system and we're not negotiating against those corporations.\n\nAnd we've given tax cuts to the richest Americans and the biggest corporations for decades. That's all this is. We have corporations who are having their way with the American people and people are suffering.\n\nSen. Warren is right. This is cruelty for money. In order to break this, we're going to have to break the corporate stranglehold and solve both the tax and the negotiating problem. That's why I'm for term limits. We need to redo Washington, D.C., and...\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: ... actually take back the government from the corporations who've bought it.\n\nPHILLIP: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Vice President Biden?\n\nBIDEN: I would argue that the biggest breakthrough in recent time was us being able to do in our administration what five — five Democratic presidents couldn't get done, and that is pass Obamacare. It was a big deal.\n\nSecondly, I would argue that the way you control drug prices is you limit what they can charge for those prices. You don't have to pay the price. Limit what they can charge. If, in fact, they charge more than we set the price for, they can — they can, in fact — we can — people can import from abroad, assuming that it is — it is — it is safe.\n\nWe, in fact — it's only yellow, Wolf, OK? And we can, in fact, do all of this and still provide people the option to stay — the roughly 150 to 160 million Americans who like the negotiated plan they have with their employers. If they don't like it, or the employer gets rid of it, they can buy into a Medicare plan in the Biden plan.\n\nBLITZER: Let's talk a little bit more about prescription drugs right now. Prescription drug prices in 2018, Americans spent $335 billion on prescription drugs alone. That's about $60 billion more than they paid a decade ago.\n\nSen. Warren, you've called for the creation of a government-run drug manufacturer that would step in if there is a drug shortage or a price spike. Why does it make sense for the government — for the government to manufacture drugs, especially when public trust in government is near historic lows?\n\nWARREN: So, let's do this both ways. What I also have said is, I'm just going to use the power that is available and I will do what a president can do all by herself on the very first day, and that is lower the prices of certain prescription drugs. I will lower the price of insulin.\n\nWe already have the legal authority with the president to do that. The president just hasn't picked up and used it. I will lower the price of EpiPens, of HIV-AIDS drugs. That's going to bring a lot of relief to a lot of families immediately.\n\nBut, you know, there are a whole lot of drugs, about 90 percent of drugs, that are not under patent. They're generic drugs. But the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up.\n\nSo my view is, let's give them a little competition. The government lets contracts for all kind of things. They let contracts to build buildings. They let contracts to build military weapons. Let's let the contracts out. Put the contracts out so that we can put more generic drugs out there and drive down those prices.\n\nThis is a way to make markets work, not to try to move away from the market. You don't have to even use price controls. The whole idea behind it is get some competition out there so the price of these drugs that are no longer under patent drops where it should be.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Klobuchar, do you believe the government should be manufacturing drugs?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: I am open to looking at it, but I would try these things first. Number one, I mention the Medicare negotiation. Number two, I have a plan, 137 things I've found that a president can do herself in the first 100 days without Congress — that are legal.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nAnd one of those things is that you can start bringing in less expensive drugs from other countries. Bernie and I had an amendment on this. We got 14 Republican votes on it. It was at midnight. They might have not known what they were voting for. But we got that.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nI now have an actual bill with Sen. Grassley that does that. And I have a bill to get at what Elizabeth was talking about, which is to stop generics from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market.\n\nThe issue here is that there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of the Congress.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Senator.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: They think they own Washington. They don't own me.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: And as president, I will get this done.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: We're going to turn now to childcare, a huge expense for many new families and a problem that's especially acute in rural Iowa. We have another question for an Iowa Democratic voter.\n\nMayor Buttigieg, this is for you. Tiffany from Clive writes, as a young mom, I had to quit a job I love because childcare costs were taking up two-thirds of my income. Many families don't have the option of quitting a job because that little bit of income is needed. That leads to families using whatever care they can find, and sometimes the results are deadly, as we've seen in Iowa over the last few years. How will you prioritize accessing quality, affordable child care in your first 100 days in office?\n\nChild care in Iowa: Iowa's child care crisis worsens its workforce crisis, business leaders say, and they're digging in to help\n\nBUTTIGIEG: It makes no sense for childcare to cost two-thirds of somebody's income. We've to drive it to 7 percent or below, and zero for those families who are living in poverty.\n\nBut this is happening to folks at every level of the income spectrum. I meet professionals who sometimes say that they're working in order to be able to afford childcare in order to be able to be working. It makes no sense, and it must change, and we shouldn't be afraid to put federal dollars into making that a reality.\n\nSubsidizing childcare and making sure that we are building up a workforce of people who are paid at a decent level to offer early childhood education, as well as childcare writ large. We can do that.\n\nAnd until we do, this will be one of the biggest drivers of the gender pay gap. Because when somebody like the voter asking the question has to step out of the workforce because of that reason, she is at a disadvantage when she comes back in, and that can affect her pay for the rest of her career.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Warren, your education plan includes tuition-free public college for all, but you impose an income limit for free childcare. Why do your plans cover everyone for public college, but not childcare and early learning?\n\nWARREN: No, actually, my plan is universal childcare for everyone. It just has some people adding a small payment.\n\nBut understand this about the plan. I've been there. You know, I remember when I was a young mom. I had two little kids, and I had my first real university teaching job. It was hard work. I was excited. But it was childcare that nearly brought me down. We went through one childcare after another, and it just didn't work.\n\nIf I hadn't been saved by my Aunt Bee — I was ready to quit my job. And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on, how many of my daughter's generation get knocked off the track and don't get back on, how many mamas and daddies today are getting knocked off the track and never get back on.\n\nI have a two cent wealth tax so that we can cover childcare for all of our children, and provide universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America, and stop exploiting the people who do this valuable work, largely black and brown women. We can raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America. That's an investment in our babies. That's an investment in their mamas and their daddies. And it's an investment in our teachers and in our economy.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Sanders, will your...\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nWARREN: It's what we need to do.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: ... universal childcare program be free for everyone regardless of income?\n\nSANDERS: Yeah. Let me pick up on this childcare thing. Every psychologist in the world knows zero through 4 are the most important years of human life, intellectually and emotionally. And yet our current childcare system is an embarrassment, it is unaffordable. Childcare workers are making wages lower than McDonald's workers.\n\nWe need to fundamentally change priorities in America. We should not be one of a few countries that does not have universal high-quality affordable childcare. We should not be one of the only major countries not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right. We should not be spending more than the 10 next countries on the military, hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, tax breaks for billionaires, and then tell the moms and dads in this country we cannot have high-quality affordable childcare.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden, I'm coming to you now.\n\nSANDERS: That is wrong.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Vice President Biden, infant care is more expensive than in-state public college tuition in more than half the country. Do you support free universal infant care?\n\nBIDEN: There should be free universal infant care, but here's the deal. You know, I was a single parent, too. When my wife and daughter were killed, my two boys I had to raise. I was a senator, a young senator. I just hadn't been sworn in yet. And I was making $42,000 a year.\n\nI commuted every single solitary day to Wilmington, Delaware, over 500 miles a day — excuse me, 250 miles a day, because I could not afford but for my family childcare. It was beyond my reach to be able to do it.\n\nAnd that's why there are several things we do. When I triple the amount of money for Title I schools, every child, 3, 4, and 5 years old, will, in fact, have full schooling. They'll go to school and after-school programs, which will release some of the burden.\n\nSecondly, I think we should have an $8,000 tax credit which would put 7 million women back to work that could afford to go to work and still care for their children as an $8,000 tax credit. I also believe that we should, in fact, for people who, in fact, are not able to afford any of the infant care to be able to get that care.\n\nBut Bernie's right. We have to raise the salaries of the people who are doing the care. And I provide for that, as well. My time is up, I know, but I'm not going to go over like everybody.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mayor Buttigieg — Mayor Buttigieg, higher education is another huge expense for families. You oppose free public college for all because you don't want to make it, quote, \"free for the kids of millionaires.\" But lots of public services are available to the kids of rich people, like libraries and public schools. Why do you draw the line at public colleges and universities?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, it's simple. We expect and hope for everyone to get through 12th grade. It's not the same for college. Now, again, I don't want cost ever to be a barrier to somebody seeking to attend college. And under my plan, it won't be.\n\nAs a matter of fact, for the first 80 percent of Americans by income, it is free at public colleges. But if you're in that top income bracket, don't get me wrong, I still wish you well. I hope you succeed when you go to college. I just need you to go ahead and pay that tuition, because we could be using those dollars for something else.\n\nThere is a very real choice about what we do with every single taxpayer dollar that we raise, and we need to be using that to support everybody, whether you go to college or not, making sure that Americans can thrive, investing in infrastructure, and something that hasn't come up very much tonight but deserves a lot of attention, poverty.\n\nYou know, the Poor People's Campaign is marching on Iowa right now calling on us to talk about this issue more. They are driven by their faith. I think because even though in politics we're supposed to talk middle class, they know there's no scripture that says as you've done unto the middle class, so you've done unto me.\n\nWe've got to be making sure that we target our tax dollars where they will make the biggest difference. And I don't think subsidizing the children of millionaires and billionaires to pay absolutely zero in tuition at public colleges is the best use of those scarce taxpayer dollars.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Sen. Warren?\n\nWARREN: So, look, the way I think we need to do this is we need a wealth tax in America. We need to ask people with fortunes above $50 million to pay more. And that means that the lowliest millionaire that I would tax under this wealth tax would be paying about $19 million in the first year in taxes.\n\nIf he wants to send his kid to public university, then I'm OK with that, because what we really need to talk about is the bigger economic picture here. We need to be willing to put a wealth tax in place, to ask those giant corporations that are not paying to pay, because that's how we build an economy and, for those who want to talk about it, bring down the national debt.\n\nYou do universal childcare and you've got a lot of mamas who can go to work, a lot of mamas who can finish their education. We make that investment in universal college. We've got a lot of people who...\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Senator. Sen. Klobuchar?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Yeah, you know, I appreciate your thoughts, Elizabeth, but I want to step back. I actually think that some of our colleagues who want free college for all aren't actually thinking big enough.\n\nI think what we have to look at is how we connect our education system with our economy. Where are our job openings? And what do we need? We are going to have over a million openings for home health care workers that we don't know how to fill in the next 10 years. We are going to have open 100,000 jobs for nursing assistants. We— as my union friends know — we're going to have over 70,000 openings for electricians.\n\nWe're not going to have a shortage of MBAs. We're going to have a shortage of plumbers. So when we look at that, then we step back. Where should our money go? It should go into K through 12. It should go into free one- and two-year degrees, like my dad got, like my sister got.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: And then we should double the Pell grants, because we're going to need four-year degrees...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar. Mr. Steyer...\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... so the money goes where it should go, instead of to rich kids going to college.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mr. Steyer, as a billionaire, should your children have been entitled to free public college?\n\nSTEYER: No. And let me say this. I was one of the people who talked about a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago. I believe that the income inequality in this country is unbearable, unjust, and unsupportable, and the redistribution of wealth to the richest Americans from everyone else has to end. And I proposed a wealth tax almost a year-and-a-half ago to start to address it and to raise some of the money that we need.\n\nBut I want to go beyond this and go back to this question about education, because we're talking a lot about college. But, in fact, if you talk about the Poor People's Campaign, you have to realize that for the youngest kids, they are getting an education that's relative to the taxes in their neighborhoods. We need to redistribute money so every kid has a chance, so we're not legislating inequality for the next generation, and so we actually invest in every single kid, specifically poor kids, specifically black kids, specifically brown kids. We need to start using the money dramatically more for that.\n\nBLITZER: We'll be back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential debate, live from Des Moines, Iowa. Stay right here.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nBLITZER: Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential debate. We're live in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nTomorrow, the speaker, Nancy Pelosi, will send articles of impeachment against President Trump to the United States Senate, launching the third trial of a U.S. president. The Republican-led Senate has signaled that it is likely to acquit him.\n\nVice President Biden, if you're the nominee, is it going to be harder to run against President Trump if he's been acquitted and able to claim vindication, especially after what he's said about your family?\n\nBIDEN: It's irrelevant. There's no — there's no choice but to — for Nancy Pelosi and the House to move. He has, in fact, committed impeachable offenses. Whether the Senate makes that judgment or not, it's for them to decide.\n\n►Iowa Poll: Iowa voters are split on impeachment\n\nBut — and, by the way, I'm told that, you know, we — that I don't — I say we have to unite the country and it's going to be harder after this trial. It may be. But, look, you know, I understand how these guys are, this Republican Party. They've got gone after — savaged my surviving son, gone after me, told lies that your networks and others won't even carry on television because they're flat-out lies.\n\nAnd I did my job. The question is whether or not he did his job. And he hasn't done his job. And so it doesn't really matter whether or not he's gone after me. I've got to be in a position that I think of the American people. I can't hold a grudge. I have to be able to not only fight, but also heal.\n\nAnd as president of the United States, that's what I will attempt to do, notwithstanding that — we're going to be more division after he's defeated by me this next time.\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Klobuchar, you're going to be a juror in the trial in the Senate that's about to start. Do you worry President Trump will be emboldened by acquittal?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: No. We have a constitutional duty to do — to perform here. And when I look at what the issue is, it's whether or not we're going to be able to have witnesses. We've asked for only four people as witnesses. And if our Republican colleagues won't allow those witnesses, they may as well give the president a crown and a scepter. They may as well make him king. And last time I checked, our country was founded on this idea that we didn't want to be ruled by a king.\n\nAnd I think the best way to think about this is trial and what we're facing in this election is a story of a man from Primghar, Iowa. His name was Joseph Welch. He came from humble beginnings, a son of immigrants. He became the Army counsel. And he was the one that went to the Joseph McCarthy hearings. And when McCarthy was blacklisting people and going after people because of their political beliefs or supposed political beliefs, there was only one man.\n\nEveryone that was afraid, they were afraid of being blacklisted, Joseph Welch, he stood up and looked at McCarthy and said, have you no sense of decency, sir? Have you no sense of decency. This is a decency check on our government. This is a patriotism check. Not only is this trial that...\n\nBLITZER: Thank you.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... but also this election. And no matter if you agree with everyone here on the stage, I say this...\n\nBLITZER: Thank you, Sen. Klobuchar.\n\nKLOBUCHAR: ... to Americans, you know this is a decency check on this president.\n\nBLITZER: Mr. Steyer, you have spent millions and millions of dollars telling the American people that President Trump deserves to be impeached. Will it have been worth if it he has been impeached but not removed from office?\n\n►Who's spending the most on political ads in Iowa? Tom Steyer leads the pack.\n\nSTEYER: Well, Wolf, actually what I have done is to organize a petition drive of 8.5 million Americans to sign and say this president deserves to be impeached and removed from office. And those 8.5 million people have called their congresspeople, have emailed their congresspeople, and have actually dragged Washington, D.C., to see that in fact this is a question of right and wrong and not of political expediency.\n\nSo if you ask me whether standing up for what's right in America, standing up for the American people and our safety, standing up for the Constitution, whether doing that and trying to bring the truth in front of the American people in televised hearings so we can decide what the truth is for ourselves, if you think that that isn't worth it, then you don't share the idea that I do about what America is about.\n\nStanding up for what's right is always worth it, Wolf. And I will never back down from that.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nBLITZER: Sen. Warren, a Senate trial is expected to keep you in Washington in the weeks leading up to the Iowa Caucuses here. How big of a problem is that for you as you're making your closing pitch to voters here?\n\nWARREN: Look, some things are more important than politics. I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America. It says that no one is above the law. That includes the president of the United States. We have an impeachment trial. I will be there because it is my responsibility.\n\nBut understand this, what that impeachment trial is going to show once again to the American people, and something we should all be talking about, is the corruption of this administration. That is what lies at heart of it. It is about Donald Trump putting Donald Trump first. Not the American people. Not the interests of the United States of America. Not even helping Ukraine defend against Russia.\n\nIt is about him helping himself. That is what we need to do to win this election. We need to draw that distinction and show that as Democrats we're not going to be the people who are just out for the big corporations, people who want to help themselves, that we are going to be the party that is willing to fight on the side of the people. That's why we're here.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Let's turn now to the climate crisis. Here in Iowa parts of the state remain under water after record-breaking flooding began last spring, racking up an estimated $2 billion in damages. Today many Iowans are still displaced from their homes.\n\nMayor Buttigieg, you have talked about helping people move from areas at high risk of flooding. But what do you do about farms and factories that simply can't be moved?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: That's why we have to fight climate change with such urgency. Climate change has come to America from coast to coast. Seeing it in Iowa. We have seen it in historic floods in my community. I had to activate our emergency operation center for a once-in-a-millennium flood. Then two years later had to do the same thing.\n\nIn Australia there are literally tornadoes made of fire taking place. This is no longer theoretical and this is no longer off in the future. We have got to act, yes, to adapt, to make sure communities are more resilient, to make sure our economy is ready for the consequences that are going to happen one way or the other.\n\nBut we also have to ensure that we don't allow this to get any worse. And if we get right, farmers will be a huge part of the solution. We need to reach out to the very people who have sometimes been made to feel that accepting climate science would be a defeat for them, whether we're talking about farmers or industrial workers in my community, and make clear that we need to enlist them...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: But, Mayor Buttigieg...\n\nBUTTIGIEG: ... in the national project to do something about it.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: ... to clarify, what do you do about farms and factories that cannot be relocated?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: We are going to have to use federal funds to make sure that we are supporting those whose lives will inevitably be impacted further by the increased severity and the increased frequency. And by the way, that is happening to farms, that is happening to factories, and that disproportionately happens to black and brown Americans, which is why equity and environmental justice have to be at the core of our climate plan going forward.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nMr. Steyer, what's your response?\n\nSTEYER: Look, what you're talking about is what's called managed retreat. It's basically saying we're going to have to move things because this crisis is out of control. And it's unbelievably expensive. And of course we'll come to the rescue of Americans who are in trouble.\n\nBut this is why climate is my number one priority. And I'm still shocked that I'm the only person on this stage who will say this. I would declare a state of emergency on day one on climate.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nI would do it from the standpoint of environmental justice and make sure we go to the black and brown communities where you can't breathe the air or drink the water that comes out of the tap safely. But I also know this, we're going to create millions of good-paying union jobs across this country. It's going to be the biggest job program in American history.\n\nSo I know we have to do it. I know we can do it. And I know that we can do it in a way that makes us healthier, that makes us better paid, and is more just. But the truth of the matter is, we're going to have to do it and we're going to have to make the whole world come along with us. And it's going to have to be...\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mr. Steyer...\n\nSTEYER: ... priority one.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Mr. Steyer, to clarify, you say you're the climate change candidate, but you made your $1.6 billion in part by investing in coal, oil, and gas. So are you the right messenger on this topic?\n\nSTEYER: I absolutely am. Look, we invested in every part of the economy. And over 10 years ago I realized that there was something going on that had to do with fossil fuels, that we had to change. So I divested from fossil fuels. I took the Giving Pledge to give most of my money away while I'm alive. And for 12 years I have been fighting the climate crisis.\n\nI have beat oil companies in terms of clean air laws. I have stopped fossil fuel plants in Oxnard, California. I fought the Keystone pipeline. I have a history of over a decade of leading the climate fight successfully.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSTEYER: So actually, yes, I am the person here who has the chops and the history that says, I'll make it priority one, because I have been doing it for a long time.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.\n\nSen. Warren, President Trump is rolling back major environmental rules to allow pipeline and other major infrastructure projects to be built without strict environmental review. Will you restore those protections and in a way that the next president can't overturn?\n\nWARREN: Yes. Climate change threatens every living thing on this planet. And the urgency of the moment cannot be overstated. I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day. I will roll back the environmental changes that Donald Trump is putting in place. I will stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands, and offshore drilling. That will help us get in the right directions. I'll bring in the farmers. Farmers can be part of the climate solution.\n\nWe should see this for the problem it is. Mr. Steyer talks about it being problem number one. Understand this, we have known about this climate crisis for decades. Back in the 1990s we were calling it global warming, but we knew what it was. Democrats and Republicans back then were working together because no one wanted a problem.\n\nBut you know what happened? The industry came in and said, we can make big money if we keep them divided and make no change. Priority number one has to be taking back our government from the corruption. That is the only way we will make progress on climate, on gun safety, on health care, on all of the issues that matter to us.\n\nPFANNENSTIEL: Thank you, Sen. Warren.\n\nSen. Klobuchar, some of your competitors on this stage have called for an all-out ban on fracking. You haven't. Why not?\n\nKLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, I would note that I have 100 percent rating from the League of Conservation Voters. And that is because I have stood tall on every issue that we have talked about up here when it comes to this administration, this Trump administration, trying to reverse environmental protections. I think it is going to lead to so many problems.\n\nAnd one thing that hasn't been raised, by the way, is the rules on methane, which is actually one of the most environmentally dangerous hazards that they have recently embarked on. And I would bring those rules back as well as a number of other ones.\n\nWhen it comes to the issue of fracking,", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/01/12/why-fda-doesnt-always-catch-tainted-medicines/2538786002/", "title": "Why the FDA doesn't always catch tainted medicines", "text": "Sydney Lupkin\n\nSummary: The Food and Drug Administration is supposed to inspect all factories, foreign and domestic, that produce drugs for the U.S. market. But a Kaiser Health News review of thousands of FDA documents — inspection records, recalls, warning letters and lawsuits — reveals how drugs that are poorly manufactured or contaminated can still reach consumers. The story focuses on one Michigan family and one little boy, Anderson Moreno, who allegedly suffered “serious and dangerous life-threatening injuries,” according to a lawsuit his family has filed.\n\n***\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich. — Despite the jackhammer-like rhythm of a mechanical ventilator, Alicia Moreno had dozed off in a chair by her 1-year-old’s hospital bed, when a doctor woke her with some bad news: The common stool softener her son, Anderson, was given months earlier had been contaminated with the bacterium Burkholderia cepacia.\n\nSuddenly, Anderson’s rocky course made medical sense. B. cepacia was the same unusual bacterium mysteriously found in the boy’s respiratory tract, temporarily taking him off the list for a heart transplant. The same bacterium resurfaced after his transplant and combined with a flu-like illness to infect his lungs. He’s been on a ventilator ever since.\n\nThe tainted over-the-counter medicine, docusate sodium, routinely prescribed to nearly every hospitalized patient to avert constipation, caused Anderson to suffer “serious and dangerous life-threatening injuries,” a lawsuit filed by his family alleges. The drug was eventually recalled, but only after a Texas hospital staff noticed an uptick in B. cepacia infections, prompting a six-month investigation that led back to the tainted drug and its Florida manufacturing plant.\n\n“Something that was supposed to help him hurt him,” Alicia Moreno said.\n\nSince the start of 2013, pharmaceutical companies based in the U.S. or abroad have recalled about 8,000 medicines, comprising billions of tablets, bottles and vials that have entered the U.S. drug supply and made their way to patients’ medicine cabinets, hospital supply closets and IV drips, a Kaiser Health News investigation shows. The recalls represent a fraction of the medicines shipped each year. But the flawed products contained everything from dangerous bacteria or tiny glass particles to mold — or too much or too little of the drug’s active ingredient.\n\nOver the same period, 65 drug-making facilities recalled nearly 300 products within 12 months of passing a Food and Drug Administration inspection — as was the case with the stool softener, according to a KHN analysis of recall notices and inspection records kept by the FDA.\n\nThose recalls included more than 39,000 bottles of the HIV drug Atripla laced with “red silicone rubber particulates,” nearly 37,000 generic Abilify tablets that were “superpotent” and nearly 12,000 boxes of generic Aleve (naproxen) that were actually ibuprofen, according to the recall data KHN examined.\n\nThe medicine alleged to have sickened Anderson Moreno seriously infected at least 63 other people in 12 states, according to reports by the FDA and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The drug was made at a PharmaTech plant in Broward County, Florida. That same plant passed an FDA inspection even while it was making bacteria-laced products, according to a KHN review of the inspection records.\n\nPharmaTech did not respond to KHN’s requests for comment. A lawyer for the drugmaker filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in April, but it was not granted. In follow-up court records, PharmaTech has denied claims against it.\n\nLike other FDA commissioners before him, Scott Gottlieb has called his agency’s drug oversight program the “gold standard” for safety and effectiveness.\n\nBut veteran industry consultant John Avellanet, who has trained FDA inspectors, questions how effective the FDA’s drug plant inspections actually are. “It’s so easy” for FDA inspectors to miss things because they’re working with confusing regulatory terms and standards that are often decades out of date, Avellanet said.\n\nJust how often people are sickened or die from tainted drugs is next to impossible to determine. No government agency tracks cases unless they’re linked to a major outbreak among hospital patients. And sudden, seemingly random illnesses in disparate places are notoriously hard to link to a tainted drug. That’s in part because drugmakers don’t have to divulge which products are made in which manufacturing plants since that is regarded as proprietary information.\n\nThe result: Even someone who buys drugs for a major hospital can’t track down where a potentially dangerous product came from, said Erin Fox, who purchases medicines for University of Utah Health hospitals.\n\n“Patient safety should come first,” she said, adding that the KHN analysis indicates “our drug quality is probably not what we think it is,” and calling it a “scary” reality. “Something does need to change if this is happening this many times and we’re having patients receiving contaminated products.”\n\nThe FDA declined to be interviewed for this story but responded to written questions.\n\n“While the FDA would prefer that no drug be distributed that later is recalled, we do not think that a recall indicates a failure of FDA inspection and surveillance programs,” FDA spokesman Jeremy Kahn said in an email. He said inspectors “may not uncover all issues or practices that may eventually result in a problem leading to a recall” and that “not all recalls are the result of poor manufacturing practice.”\n\nThe PharmaTech story\n\n“Lucky fin, lucky fin, lucky fin,” Alicia Moreno, 30, cheered as she untangled her now 3-year-old son’s stroke-weakened arm from a sweater and his portable ventilator in the back seat of the car for yet another long drive from their home in Big Rapids, Mich., to see doctors in Ann Arbor. In the Disney movie “Finding Nemo,” Nemo’s father calls the young fry’s smaller fin his “lucky fin.”\n\nWhile her husband drives, Alicia pulls out a clear plastic case of syringes and watches the clock on the dashboard. Anderson needs about two dozen different medicines every 24 hours, and Alicia administers them via a port in his belly at designated times.\n\nIt wasn’t always like this. Anderson appeared healthy until his 6-month checkup in May 2016, his mother said. Partway through the exam, the Morenos rushed their baby to a nearby hospital and learned he was in heart failure and would need a transplant to survive. That’s where he received the tainted stool softener, his lawyers allege. The hospital where Anderson eventually received his transplant confirmed via email that Anderson tested positive for the same strain of B. cepacia involved in the outbreak traced back to PharmaTech’s contaminated drug.\n\nIn July, according to the family, Anderson started to have difficulty breathing and his temperature spiked to 106 degrees, which landed him in the ICU, where doctors and nurses packed him with ice and rushed to find the cause. Their tests turned up positive for B. cepacia, a bacterium found in untreated water that doesn’t typically make healthy people sick. Anderson’s status on the transplant list was put on hold, and his heart condition worsened. He was placed on a machine that transferred blood outside his body, oxygenated it and pumped it back in.\n\nAnderson finally got a heart transplant in November 2016, but four days after doctors closed his chest, his fever was back and his lungs kept getting worse, requiring more complicated machinery. Tests came back positive for a flu-like virus and B. cepacia, according to the hospital.\n\n“Where did he get it?” his parents pleaded. At the time, no one knew.\n\nHow tainted drugs slip through the cracks\n\nThe FDA is supposed to inspect all factories, foreign and domestic, that produce drugs for the U.S. market. But a KHN review of thousands of FDA documents — inspection records, recalls, warning letters and lawsuits — offers insight into the ways poorly manufactured or contaminated drugs reach consumers: Inspectors miss serious hazards. Drugmakers fail to meet standards even after the FDA has taken enforcement action. Hundreds of plants haven’t been inspected for years, if ever.\n\nLast July, for example, the FDA announced the first of many voluntary recalls of the blood pressure medicine valsartan because some tablets contain a cancer-causing impurity called N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). They would later find a similar carcinogen, N-Nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), in valsartan pills. Over the prior two years, investigators had detected worrisome problems in two overseas factories involved in the manufacturing of the drug.\n\nIn 2017, FDA investigators found rust, chipping paint and deteriorating equipment at a plant run by Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. in Zhejiang, China. Plant staffers weren’t properly testing and investigating “anomalies” in their drugs, dismissing problematic test results, the FDA said at that time. Inspectors also found “black metallic particles” and other problems in some unidentified drugs.\n\nThe FDA inspected the plant in July 2018 after complaints about NDMA from a facility further down the drug supply chain. The FDA put the facility on import alert in late September and issued a warning letter in November detailing deficiencies, including “Failure of your quality unit to ensure that quality-related complaints are investigated and resolved.”\n\nAt a facility of Hetero Labs in India, in 2016, FDA inspectors found colored and white residue in components, some of the factory’s tablets were twice as thick as others, and employees were shredding documents in the middle of the night. The FDA issued a warning letter to the company as a result of the inspection.\n\nPlants making drugs for U.S. consumers are supposed to be inspected every few years, according to a risk-based system. However, in the past decade more than 2,500 facilities, both foreign and domestic, have gone more than five years without an FDA drug-quality inspection, a KHN analysis found. The FDA has no drug-quality inspection records over the past decade for more than 1,200 domestic plants and nearly 400 foreign plants, excluding those that make animal drug products, according to the analysis. Gottlieb said in December that he hopes to clear the backlog of uninspected drug facilities by the end of September 2019.\n\nAt best, the inspections are a snapshot in time, and involve looking at processes rather than evaluating the drugs themselves, said drug-quality specialist Dinesh Thakur, who has worked for drugmakers. The inspections might take place while the facility is making only one of a dozen or so drugs that it usually manufactures.\n\n“The implicit assumption … is that if the (manufacturing) processes are sound, the product will be of good quality,” said Thakur, who raised the alarm about quality-control problems at generics drugmaker Ranbaxy, resulting in a 2013 guilty plea and a $500 million settlement. “Your data tells us this is not true.”\n\nMany inspections, he said, are “stage-managed,” so that factories pass on the appointed day, but “once the inspectors leave, it’s a completely different story.”\n\nDavid Gortler, a former FDA medical officer, said most drug plant inspections involve looking over paper records and trusting that they’re real, instead of randomly testing medicines.\n\n“Anybody can write down anything on a piece of paper,” said Gortler, who is now a consultant at FormerFDA.com. He added that FDA inspectors aren’t reprimanded — or even told — if they’ve passed a plant that issued a recall shortly thereafter.\n\nA lucky break solves a mystery\n\nThe contaminated stool softener alleged to have sickened Anderson Moreno was one of many drugs recalled by plants shortly after they passed an FDA inspection. The bacteria was detected only after an outbreak of disease — and after a good deal of medical sleuthing.\n\nMore than 1,000 miles away from Anderson’s ICU bed in Michigan, staff at Texas Children’s Hospital’s pediatric ICU in Houston had diagnosed three cases of B. cepacia in one week in February 2016, according to a 2017 medical journal article published in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology. It was odd because there had been no cases the previous year.\n\nHospital staff members embarked on a months-long investigation and by July had identified 24 victims, whose median age was under 2 years old. Patients had the same strain of the bacteria in their blood, their respiratory tracts, their urine or their stool, according to the article.\n\nSamples matched the bacteria found in liquid docusate, the stool softener, the researchers wrote.\n\nThe hospital alerted the CDC and other public health officials of its findings. The CDC would eventually identify 63 confirmed and 45 suspected serious B. cepacia infections in 12 states tied to the contaminated drug.\n\nA 36-day FDA inspection of PharmaTech in Davie, Fla., that ended Aug. 9, 2016, revealed that the bacteria was in water used to clean equipment and make liquid products. FDA inspectors concluded that the bacterium made it into the facility’s drugs starting in 2015 and was still present in the water.\n\nAnderson was treated with the stool softener in May 2016. His parents filed suit in September 2017 in PharmaTech’s home of Broward Country, Florida, against the drugmaker and others in the drug supply chain, alleging the drug was contaminated and caused him grievous damage. PharmaTech, which did not return KHN’s requests for comment, unsuccessfully filed a motion to dismiss and has denied all charges in a subsequent filing.\n\nA 9-month-old girl in Pittsburgh who had received the stool softener died on May 4, 2016, according to a lawsuit her family filed in July 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Her mother learned about the drug recall by chance and asked the hospital whether her deceased daughter received the tainted drug, her lawyer told KHN. The family filed charges against PharmaTech and others in the drug supply chain in a wrongful death lawsuit. The court rejected PharmaTech’s motions to dismiss and strike, and the drugmaker denied liability in a subsequent filing. In November 2017, a lawyer representing PharmaTech in that wrongful death case told the Orlando (Fla.) Sun Sentinel that it will defend itself against the allegations and couldn’t comment further “because of the ongoing nature of litigation.”\n\nAccording to federal records, FDA inspectors had a chance to catch the contamination during their March 2016 inspection, but the PharmaTech plant passed with no citations. PharmaTech CEO Ray Figueroa saluted the inspection results in a news release, calling it “a testimony to PharmaTech’s commitment to world-class quality.”\n\nHow things can go wrong\n\nThe FDA has issued thousands of enforcement actions against drug plants over the years, citing safety violations, issuing warning letters and blocking imports from certain foreign plants. In rare cases, the FDA can also seize drug products and has done so 23 times in the past decade. The last drug seizure was more than two years ago, according to FDA records.\n\nIn an emailed statement, FDA chief Gottlieb said the FDA is “taking new steps” to identify problems before they occur and it is “not shy” in using its powers to mitigate risks.\n\nBut the system can be stymied or gamed, and the FDA’s enforcement abilities are limited. For instance, it doesn’t have the power to issue a mandatory recall, and manufacturing citations don’t come with fines.\n\nMany cases come to light only when a whistleblower sounds an alarm.\n\n(Thakur, the Ranbaxy whistleblower, said officials in other countries sometimes tip off plants about “surprise” FDA inspections. And FDA inspectors often have to rely on translators hired by the drug companies, said Avellanet, who has been a drug facility inspection consultant for more than 20 years.\n\nAt Nippon Fine Chemical in Japan, employees stood “shoulder-to-shoulder” to keep an FDA official out in December 2015, according to an enforcement letter sent to the plant andpublished online.\n\nLess than a year later, Vikshara Trading & Investments Ltd. in India allegedly faked a worker strike to block the entrance to the plant, according to an FDA enforcement document that described the manufacturer’s “false statements.” When inspectors were eventually allowed in, the lights were kept off.\n\n“Our investigator had to perform parts of the walkthrough in the dark, using a flashlight,” the FDA warning letter reads, adding that an unidentified powder was “scattered” and “caked on the floor” in production areas and detected on finished drug products.\n\nTwo former employees have filed a whistleblower suit against Gilead Sciences, alleging it lied to the FDA about using a drug-manufacturing facility in South Korea, when it was actually using an unregistered facility in China. According to the civil complaint filed in September 2014 in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, the ingredient produced at Synthetics China and used in HIV drugs Truvada and Atripla contained “glass-like shards,” “black rubber-like particles,” “plastic-like particles,” “small stone or pebble-like particles” and “metal shards.”\n\nThe whistleblowers alleged Gilead’s Alberta, Canada, plant was tasked with sieving contaminants and helping to conceal where the ingredient was made.\n\nThey said one batch of the ingredient was contaminated with arsenic, chromium and nickel. Another had a dangerous bacterium called Bacillus cereus, according to the whistleblowers’ suit. Still, Gilead released the product and didn’t initiate a recall, the whistleblowers alleged.\n\nYears after the whistleblowers stopped working for Gilead, the drugmaker issued two voluntary recalls of HIV drugs in 2014, about seven months apart. Both recalls cited contamination with red silicone rubber particulates.\n\nGilead declined to comment. Gilead has fought the lawsuit, alleging that since the government knew of the allegations and did not penalize it by denying drug approvals or payments, the suit could not move forward. In 2015, a federal judge dismissed the case, but a panel from the 9th District Court of Appeals reversed that decision in 2017. Now the Supreme Court may hear it; in April 2018, it invited the solicitor general to file a brief, “expressing the views of the United States.” The Justice Department filed a brief in November, saying pursuing the lawsuit is “not in the public interest.”\n\nSince the FDA has little power to force a drugmaker to fix problems or issue recalls, FDA inspectors often flag the same violations again and again. A KHN analysis found that over the past decade 70 drug plants — most of them domestic — were penalized for the same violation at least four times. And more than a third of those plants has issued a recall at some point.\n\nAltaire Pharmaceuticals in New York was cited five times by FDA inspectors for inadequate “procedures for sterile drug products.” In 2013, it recalled 363,746 bottles of generic eye drops sold at CVS, Target and Walmart over sterility concerns — namely mold — because the preservative in the product “may not be effective” through the expiration date. Overall, Altaire was told to correct 15 violations at least twice.\n\nKHN attempted to contact Altaire Pharmaceuticals, but the company did not reply.\n\nKept in the dark\n\nAbout a year after the initial PharmaTech recall in 2016, the FDA announced another recall for the same drugs and the same bacterium: B. cepacia. When Erin Fox saw the second recall, she thought it was a mistake. The alert said to avoid drugs made by PharmaTech under several labels “and possibly (products from) other companies.” What other companies? Fox wondered. How could they not know which ones?\n\nDoctors at the hospital asked Fox to remove all PharmaTech-made products from the shelves, but because of lax labeling laws, she said, she couldn’t be sure which those were. Drug labels need to include only the manufacturer, the packer or the distributor — not all three — so the doctors suggested she call PharmaTech and ask what else it manufactures and for whom.\n\n“Of course,” Fox said, “they wouldn’t tell us.”\n\nSydney Lupkin, data correspondent, covers drug prices and specializes in data reporting for the Kaiser Health News enterprise team.

Kaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is an editorially independent program of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation which is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.\n\nHow Kaiser Health News reported this story\n\nTo analyze the inspections and recalls of plants that manufacture drugs, Kaiser Health News started with two Food and Drug Administration databases of drug recalls: one at OpenFDA, and one on the FDA’s recall data dashboard. The first provided details about drugs, dates and quantities recalled, and the second provided a recalling plant ID, called an FEI. We used them both to create a more complete recall database.\n\nThe FEIs served as a bridge between the recalls data and two inspection data tables. Both tables contained inspection dates and purposes, but one listed inspection grades and the other contained a list of citations. Combining inspection and recall databases allowed us to find the most recent inspection at each plant that preceded a recall and to determine its grade. It also allowed us to count repeat citations and determine whether plants that received them ever initiated a recall.\n\nTo determine whether plants had not been inspected in the past decade, we compared our inspections data to the Drug Establishments Current Registration Site database, which contains all registered operating plants. We excluded plants that made products for animals and those that didn’t explicitly “manufacture” drugs, according to the database. The FDA has said there may be a delay in adding inspections to its database after they are completed.\n\nOur data is current as of early October 2018. We included only inspections categorized as “drug quality assurance” inspections throughout the analysis.\n\nSydney Lupkin specializes in data reporting for Kaiser Health News.

That will inevitably lead to hospitals stretched beyond their limits and thousands of deaths.

They said the drug caused them to develop diarrhea, stomach cramps, bloody stools and vision problems.\n\n\"Without knowing and voluntary consent, plaintiffs ingested incredibly high doses of a drug that credible medical professionals, the FDA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, all agree is not an effective treatment against COVID-19, and that if given in large doses is dangerous for humans,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved ivermectin for use by people and animals for some parasitic worms, head lice and skin conditions but not for treatment or prevention of COVID-19.\n\n'Open question' whether omicron is final wave, Fauci says\n\nIt's too soon to know whether the omicron variant will be the final phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday.\n\n\"It is an open question as to whether or not omicron is going to be the live virus vaccination that everyone is hoping for,\" Fauci said, putting air quotes around the phrase \"live virus vaccination.\"\n\nThere are two ways for a pandemic to end: the infectious disease is eliminated, like measles, or it becomes endemic, which means it still exists without major disruption to society, much like the flu.\n\n\"If you look at the history of infectious diseases, we’d only eradicated one infectious disease in man and that’s smallpox,\" Fauci said at the World Economic Forum. \"That’s not going to happen with this virus.\"\n\nThat means COVID-19 must evolve into a less dangerous disease for the pandemic to officially end. Although the highly contagious omicron variant is spreading quickly — infecting about 782,000 Americans per day, according to the CDC — some point to its low mortality rate as a sign that the virus may be becoming less severe.\n\nIt's possible that omicron could signal that the pandemic is ending, “but that would only be the case if we don’t get another variant that eludes the immune response,” Fauci said.\n\nNYC schools 'exploring' remote learning option\n\nNew York City's public schools are \"exploring\" a remote learning option amid the omicron surge as roughly a quarter of students in the district weren't in school last Friday, Chancellor David C. Banks said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nLocal news outlets Gothamist and CBS New York reported the city had changed its attendance policy to allow more students to learn remotely during the surge. Banks said no change in remote learning policy was set to be announced, but said the city's schools were providing an \"on ramp\" to the classroom by allowing more students to be marked as present while receiving instruction online.\n\nMayor Eric Adams, who has vowed to keep schools open while other school systems face closures, said any remote learning option is intended for students who have tested positive and cannot attend school in person, \"not for the general population.\"\n\nAround 75% of the school district's more than 1 million students were in class Friday, according to Department of Education attendance data. Banks said meetings with the United Federation of Teachers, which represents most of the district's teachers, remain ongoing.\n\nAustralia sees record deaths with hospitals stressed\n\nA record-high 74 people died due to COVID-19 in Australia on Tuesday, the largest single-day tally in the country since the start of the pandemic, as hospitals are facing a surge of patients and staffing shortages.\n\n“We’ve reached a point in our healthcare system where it’s juggling extreme workforce shortages … alongside a vast number of patients with COVID-19 who require hospitalization, alongside that an extraordinary workforce that are absolutely exhausted,” said James Merlino, the acting health minister in Victoria, where the government last week declared an emergency for some of its hospitals.\n\nFederal Health Minister Greg Hunt said there were signs that New South Wales’ infection rate was peaking and Victoria was near a plateau. The New South Wales government has said it has ruled out a return to lockdown.\n\nStudy: Nearly half of US adults gained weight during pandemic's first year\n\nResearch from New Mexico State University found pandemic-fueled, stress-related unhealthy eating habits in Americans. Now, a study co-authored by a researcher from the NMSU Department of Public Health Sciences shows nearly half of all adults in the United States gained weight during the first year of the pandemic.\n\nThe new findings were part of a national assessment on weight gain in America conducted by a research team that included Jagdish Khubchandani, a public health professor at NMSU.\n\n“Obesity was an epidemic before the pandemic, and little was known on body weight changes in the past year for adult Americans,” Khubchandani said. “We wanted to estimate weight changes in the U.S. population and its determinants after the first year of the pandemic.\"\n\nThe study, published in “Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews,” included 3,473 adult participants. The results show 48% of the study group reported gaining weight during the first 12 months of the pandemic, from March 2020 to April 2021.\n\nParticipants who reported weight gain were more likely to be males, white or Hispanic, married, 45 years old or older, working full time, have less than a college education, or living in southern and western states or rural areas of the U.S., according to the study.\n\n— Carlos Andres López, Las Cruces Sun News\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/29/beggars-night-stranger-hotel-stays-haunted-history-news-around-states/49302057/", "title": "Beggars' Night, 'Stranger' hotel stays: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Special tours Friday at Old Alabama Town, an otherwise charming group of restored 19th- and 20th-century structures, aim to show the frightful side of history. “It’s interwoven with character stories, as well as the history of the buildings and the people,” said Ella Martin, special events coordinator for Landmarks Foundation of Montgomery, who will be one of the tour guides for the Haunting at Old Alabama Town. Tickets are $25 at landmarksfoundation.com. There is limited space, and no tickets will be sold at the door. Tours will go through 10 buildings in Old Alabama Town’s Living Block, starting in Lucas Tavern, where guests be greeted by the ghost of Eliza Lucas, who ran the establishment. From there, a guide will lead guests to the Yancey dogtrot home, where Southern secession leader William Lowndes Yancey – the man Abraham Lincoln held responsible for the Civil War – lived and died. One of the darker stops will be Dr. Duncan’s office. “People were dying. Death was prevalent,” Martin said. “It’ll be a little scary because he’ll have his amputation kit and tell what he had to do take care of people since there weren’t any antibiotics around.” There’s also a gruesome story of a teenage horse rider from the Martin-Barnes House, whose life ended after being impaled on a fence. “He didn’t come home for supper,” Martin said. “He’ll be around to give his story. We’ll have a real horse there with its ghostly rider.” The tours are family-friendly but rated PG-13.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: An impromptu fundraiser to allow a library to purchase books amid cries of censorship has twice surpassed its goal. The fund was established after the Kenai City Council delayed accepting a $1,500 grant until the library director provide a list of the books that would be purchased with the money. The grant was intended to buy library materials related to health and wellness, including mental health, suicide prevention, self-care, and reference books about Medicare and Medicaid, the Peninsula Clarion reports. The council asked Kenai Community Library Director Katja Wolfe to provide an inventory of proposed purchases to be funded by the Collection Equity Award grant, from Region 5 of the Network of the National Library of Medicine. Kenai Peninsula residents Sovala Kisena and Todd Smith said they organized the crowdsourcing page to raise funds for the library and act as a positive response to the council’s action. “It’s the definition of censorship … and it bothered me,” Smith said. Before the council voted to postpone action at its Oct. 20 meeting, one resident questioned whether any of the books would be about the coronavirus, the Clarion reports. Another said he took particular issue with the term “equity” in the name of the award and asked if the grant would be “enhancing some sort of a federal agenda … which would not necessarily represent the views of the people of Kenai.” “I think equity can create division,” Peck said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, which is facing a spike in COVID-19 cases, is prohibiting trick-or-treating and haunted houses on Halloween. COVID-19 cases are up 140% over this time last year, according to an emergency declaration signed by community President Martin Harvier and posted on the community’s Facebook page. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community has land adjacent to Scottsdale, Tempe, Fountain Hills and Mesa. The community was created in 1879 and represents two pre-American tribes: the Pima and Maricopa, according to the Inter Tribal Council of Arizona. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community appears to be the first jurisdiction in Arizona to publicly ban trick-or-treating. Arizona health experts are advising that people who do go out on Halloween to take precautions. Banner Health, the state’s largest health system, advises people who do choose to take part in the tradition this year to remain outside and avoid crowds, such as Halloween parties. Children should also use hand sanitizer or wash their hands with soap and water after they get home and before they eat any treats, Banner Health officials said. Also, they should try to keep 6 feet away from anyone who doesn’t live with them.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state filed a consumer protection lawsuit Wednesday against a medical supplier for nearly $11 million for failing to deliver supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic, Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said. Rutledge said Wednesday that Med-Care Healthlink LLC of Suffolk, Virginia, and its representatives failed to deliver gowns, ventilators and face shields ordered in March and April 2020 to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. “This had been a company the state had worked with previously, and so therefore there was no reason to believe at that point that we would have something this significant occur,” Rutledge said. A phone call to the company rang unanswered. Deputy Attorney General Shannon Halijan said state officials were told at various times that the supplies had been bought by another entity, were held in China or were in other states. UAMS attorney Sherri Robinson said the company initially responded to questions about the supplies, then stopped after four to six months. UAMS ordered 1.5 million medical gowns and 60 ventilators, while the state ordered 2.5 million gowns, 500 ventilators and 1 million medical face shields, Rutledge said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nTahoe City: Drought fueled by climate change has dropped Lake Tahoe below its natural rim and halted flows into the Truckee River, a historically cyclical event that’s occurring sooner and more often than in the past, raising fears about what might be in store for the famed alpine lake. Scientists are concerned that the growing frequency of low-water extremes may become the new normal. They point to seasonal shifts in weather patterns causing precipitation that historically falls as snow to arrive in the form of rain atop the Sierra along the California-Nevada state line. “Our summers are lasting longer. Springs are coming sooner,” said Gregory Schladow, a water resource and environmental engineering professor who is the founding director of the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center. Over the past century, the amount of precipitation falling as snow has declined from 52% in 1910 to 33% in 2020 and is projected to drop below 20% by the end of the century, according to experts at the research center. Rain runs off the mountains instead of piling up as snow on mountaintops for safe storage until it is most needed in late spring and summer – the high Sierra equivalent of leaving a freezer door open atop a refrigerator. Since summer, boat ramps have been closed. Docks sit precariously above the receding lake’s dry bottom. Boat and kayaking rentals have fallen, and river rafting operations on the Truckee River had to end early. “Our season was short, and we fear there may not be one next summer,” said Toni Rudnick of the Truckee River Raft Company.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A federal judge has issued a restraining order against a suburban Denver county’s policy allowing parents to opt their children out of a mask mandate at school, finding that the rule violates the rights of students with disabilities who are vulnerable to COVID-19. U.S. District Judge John L. Kane on Tuesday called the Douglas County Board of Health order that allowed parents to opt their children out of mask-wearing a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which guarantees equal access to education for all. Kane’s order came in a hearing about a lawsuit filed by the Douglas County School District challenging the county Board of Health order. The school district, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of nine children with disabilities, argued that the board’s action allowed a relaxation of universal masking that placed those students at high risk of severe disease, The Denver Post reports. The school district also challenged the Board of Health’s relaxation of quarantine rules affecting students suspected of having the coronavirus. Kane’s order is not the end of the legal challenge, even though it sets aside the opt-out rule for now, and he set a Nov. 8 hearing about the case.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: An early 18th-century painting depicting Yale University’s namesake with an enslaved Black child has been returned to public display at one of its museums even as art experts investigate its origins and amid campus discussions about the school’s ties to slavery. The nearly life-size, oil-on-canvas portrait shows Elihu Yale and family members sitting at a table with tobacco pipes and wine glasses, while an enslaved boy with a metal collar locked around his neck looks on. In the background are playing children, believed to be Yale’s grandchildren. The Yale Center for British Art removed the painting from display in October 2020 to conduct a technical analysis, which continues and includes efforts to identify the boy, as well as to confirm the identities of the others. Over the years, some patrons expressed concerns about the depiction of an enslaved child, but that was not a reason for removing it, said Courtney Martin, the center’s director. For several months, the painting was replaced by a 2016 work of art by Titus Kaphar that included a portrait of just the enslaved boy, without the metal collar, on top of what appears to be a crumpled version of the original painting. There is no evidence Elihu Yale owned slaves. His papers, including financial records, have not been found. But experts believe Yale oversaw slave trading and other commerce in India. There are other paintings showing Yale with slaves, and his relatives in New Haven were slave owners, researchers say.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The Delaware Art Museum is reprising an exhibition 50 years after its premiere, in the wake of a nearly yearlong occupation of the city by the National Guard. National Guardsmen focused primarily on West Center City, a mostly Black community, after rioting and unrest following Dr. Martin Luther King’s murder. The trauma of those nine months in 1968 left the community reeling, and Percy Ricks, an artist and longtime educator, had something he thought people needed to see: a momentous exhibition of drawings, paintings, prints and photographs created by 66 Black artists. Ricks, the first Black art instructor in Wilmington’s public schools, was a driving force behind the city’s art scene. He went on to found arts and humanities collective Aesthetic Dynamics Inc., which aimed to highlight Black artists and their contributions to the arts. Still, the organization’s inaugural exhibition struggled to find a home as Black artists were shut out of institutions and as segregation persisted across Delaware. It eventually premiered at the Wilmington Armory but has largely been forgotten and overlooked by historians and institutions. Now, the Delaware Art Museum – which at the time overlooked requests to stage the exhibition – is trying to reconcile its initial disregard and to illustrate the cultural legacy Ricks left behind.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Earlier this month, a federal judge held two top officials from the D.C. Department of Corrections in contempt over a delay in handing over medical records for a Jan. 6 Capitol riot defendant. Now, the Department of Justice says he appears to have “invented” the emergency that led to that decision, WUSA-TV reports. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth hauled D.C. Jail Warden Wanda Patten and D.C. Department of Corrections Director Quincy Booth into court Oct. 13 to explain why the jail hadn’t complied with his order the prior week to turn over an orthopedic specialist’s notes about a hand surgery for Christopher Worrell. The Florida man has been in D.C. Jail custody since his arrest in March on multiple felony charges in connection with the insurrection, accused of joining other members of the Proud Boys in storming the U.S. Capitol and assaulting federal officers with pepper gel spray. In May, Worrell fell in his cell and broke his pinky finger. In filings, he claimed officials didn’t get him the proper medical treatment, and he’d need surgery because of the delay. On Wednesday, the Justice Department said a Howard University Hospital doctor determined Worrell’s hand had already healed normally, and he was suffering no pain or loss of function. Prosecutors said his records show he was “primarily dissatisfied with the appearance of his pinky finger” and demanded surgery even after the doctor told him the risks could outweigh the benefits.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state has withheld funding from two school districts over their coronavirus mask mandates, flouting threats from White House officials who warned that such penalties would violate federal law. School officials in Alachua and Broward counties on Wednesday said the state docked school board salaries and overall funding in amounts equal to federal aid packages meant to blunt the state’s sanctions on mask requirements. This month, more than $164,000 was withheld from the Alachua school district, and more than $455,000 was withheld from Broward. The penalties are the latest development in an ongoing feud between the White House and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration over coronavirus regulations. The Florida State Board of Education earlier this month approved plans to withhold a month’s salary from school board members in districts with classroom mask requirements and reduce overall funding if those counties receive a federal grant intended to offset the state’s fines. The announcements come days after the U.S. Department of Education sent a letter to Florida warning that deducting money from districts that received the grant would violate federal law. The letter added that the federal government “is prepared to initiate enforcement action to stop these impermissible state actions.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A high school is marking its new name and a larger building after students said the old name was offensive and pushed to remove it. Midtown High School hosted a ceremony this week to highlight the new name of the former Henry W. Grady High School, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports. Students had complained for years that their school was named after Grady, a newspaper editor who advocated for white supremacy after the Civil War. While credited by many with helping in the rebirth of Atlanta after the war, Grady also wrote editorials and gave speeches that ignored the plight of Black people in the region. Grady was an editor and part-owner of The Atlanta Constitution.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Starting next week, the city will allow outdoor and indoor entertainment venues to operate at full capacity with vaccinated attendees, the mayor said Wednesday as he announced the latest measures easing coronavirus restrictions. Patrons will have to wear masks, Mayor Rick Blangiardi said at a news conference. No food will be allowed, only water, he said. The change will take effect Nov. 3, in time for the next University of Hawaii football home game a few days later, when the Warriors host San Jose State. Blangiardi said the city plans to allow the Honolulu Marathon to go ahead Dec. 12, though the race will be required to stagger runners’ starting times. Competitors will leave the starting line in groups of no more than 200 people at a time, he said. He expressed confidence that the city was ready to relax its rules, noting Honolulu has one of the highest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country. As of Wednesday, 95% of the population 12 and older had received at least one shot. The mayor said the city still has public safety and public health at top of mind, and it will be ready to tighten restrictions again if COVID-19 hospitalization metrics deteriorate. “This is about going forward and living with it,” the mayor said of the virus.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The company that successfully brought genetically modified potatoes to the market announced an agreement Thursday to help a plant breeding company grow strawberries they say will stay fresh longer and have a longer growing season. J.R. Simplot Co. and California-based Plant Sciences Inc., both privately held companies, said they expect to launch the first commercially available, gene-edited strawberries within a few years. U.S. growers produced $2.2 billion in strawberries in 2020, mostly in California, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But consumers discarded an estimated 35% of the crop due to spoilage. Simplot and Plant Sciences officials said genetically modified strawberries will help reduce waste and make them available to consumers much of the year. The strawberries will only contain genes from strawberries, selecting desirable traits that have been cultivated over decades. “It’s the same technology we’re working on with potatoes,” said Doug Cole, director of Marketing and Biotech Affairs at Simplot. There is no evidence that genetically modified organisms, known as GMOs, are unsafe to eat, but changing the genetic code of foods presents an ethical issue for some. Federal agencies approved a previous gene-modifying technique on Simplot potatoes. Now, more than 1.1 billion pounds of the potatoes are sold in some 40 states and 4,000 supermarkets and 9,000 restaurants.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state Senate on Thursday night approved a weakened and criticized plan to preserve ramifications for those who refuse to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Democrats who control both houses of the General Assembly struggled through caustic debate all week in pushing a COVID-19 carve-out of the Illinois Health Care Right of Conscience Act. The Senate endorsed the plan 31-24 on the last day of the Legislature’s fall session. Initially approved in the 1970s to protect physicians from repercussions for refusing, based on religious beliefs, to perform abortions, supporters argue the law was never intended to give similar protections to people who refuse to get a preventive shot in a worldwide pandemic. “Your right to exercise your religious belief is not always without consequence, and the Health Care Right of Conscience is not a defense in certain circumstances,” Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, said during floor debate. “You’ve asked where we draw the line. The line of my personal liberty ends at the beginning of your nose.” Lawsuits have sprung up – nine alone in which Gov. J.B. Pritzker or other public agencies are defendants – in which repercussions, such as losing a job, are being contested based on the right of conscience law. The proposal, which now goes to Pritzker, doesn’t require anyone to be vaccinated. It targets the law’s language prohibiting retribution, such as dismissal from a job, in the case of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: A hotel offers guests a chance to enter the “Upside Down” with themed accommodations based on the Netflix series “Stranger Things,” set in the fictional Indiana town of Hawkins. Entering Graduate Bloomington yields a few subtle hints. The hotel’s ground floor mixes framed Eggo waffle art and a photo of the faded Starcourt Mall facade with older references to famous Hoosiers and pop culture. Its restaurant, Poindexter, offers an Upside Down burger and Demogorgon smoothie on the menu. And on the third floor, spaces once occupied by rooms 318 and 320 now house the “Upside Down Experience,” a suite with detailed recreations of two key settings from the sci-fi hit. The suite’s showstopper is an alphabet and Christmas light wall, like the one Winona Ryder’s character, Joyce Byers, uses to communicate with her captured son, Will. The Wheelers’ basement serves as the suite’s bedroom, complete with a Dungeons and Dragons game. General Manager Corey Parton said the suite, which opened to the public Tuesday, is meant to be an immersive experience. Guests are loaned Polaroid cameras for an ’80s documentation of their visits, as well as Eleven’s Eggo Extravaganza – a recreation of the main character’s iconic meal of three waffles doused in whipped cream and candy. A stay also includes two passes to the nearby WonderLab Science Museum, as a nod to the main characters’ love for science. Graduate also donates 11% of the suite’s profits to WonderLab.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Beggars’ Night is nearly here. Trick-or-treaters in the city go out Oct. 30, not Oct. 31, in a quirky tradition started about 80 years ago to curb the violence and vandalism that had become an annual problem. In the 1930s, a long list of teenage miscreants who’d spent the night soaping windows, setting fires and tossing bricks at homes was published every year in the Nov. 1 newspaper. Kathryn Krieg, then the director of recreation for the Des Moines Playground Commission (now the Parks and Recreation Department), proposed naming Oct. 30 “Beggars’ Night” and sending children out to perform for homeowners after saying “tricks-for-eats.” Children were to receive a treat “only if such a ‘trick’ as a song, a poem, a stunt or a musical number, either solo or in group participation, is presented.” The event reversed the conventional tradition of asking homeowners to provide a treat to avoid being tricked or pranked. Beggars’ Night gained traction and in 1942 was promoted as a way for children to play a part in the war effort. The rallying headline “Kids! - Don’t help the Axis on Halloween” topped an Oct. 29, 1942, Des Moines Register article. It also chided teenagers for soaping windows, saying that “soap wasted … means waste of an ingredient used in manufacture of high explosives.”\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: Construction on a national laboratory to study diseases that can be spread from animals to humans has been delayed, federal officials said. Officials said earlier this year that the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility in Manhattan would be substantially completed by this October. Now, the construction is expected to finish next spring, with commission of the laboratory in the summer, The Manhattan Mercury reports. The Department of Homeland Security and the United States Department of Agriculture are collaborating on opening the facility. A Homeland Security official said technology upgrades and equipment installation are taking longer than expected. “The technology efficacy of the building is of the utmost importance and is a critical aspect of standing up this facility,” Tim Barr, NBAF program manager for Homeland Security, said in a statement. “We are testing individual systems and testing again as systems are integrated with other systems, so it is very difficult to predict how long it will take to ensure each system is working as intended given the complexities of the facility.” The U.S. Department of Agriculture began managing operations and maintenance in the facility earlier this month.\n\nKentucky\n\nHazard: The superintendent of Hazard Independent Schools said that “appropriate disciplinary action has been taken” after photos surfaced showing students giving lap dances to staff and wearing scant clothing as part of Hazard High School’s homecoming week festivities. Students and staff took part in a “Man Pageant” and “Costume Day” on Tuesday, according to Hazard High School’s Facebook page. Photos that were subsequently taken down from the athletics department’s Facebook page showed students in underclothing giving lap dances to faculty and staff, including Principal Donald “Happy” Mobelini, who is also mayor of the Perry County city. Other photos on the athletics page that also were later taken down showed female students dressed up in “Hooters” outfits and students and staff appearing to paddle one another. Mobelini, the principal and mayor, did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday. “Um. Exactly what is going on here, y’all? C’mon Hazard,” Nema Brewer, cofounder of education advocacy group KY 120 United, wrote Tuesday night in a tweet that showed the lap dance photos. “Get it together.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: Violence at a high school has stopped since a group of fathers started patrolling the campus, and the dads are aiming to expand their initiative into a movement across the parish. “Dads on Duty” started in response to a series of fights at Southwood High School in September that led to the arrests of about two dozen students. Michael LaFitte gathered other parents after a Sept. 17 incident to form a strategy for combating violence at the school. Expected to meet for 45 minutes that weekend, the group solidified a plan four hours later. “At the end of the meeting, there was a group of fathers who decided to just go to the school and patrol and walk around and show a strong male presence on the campus,” LaFitte said. “I don’t care how old you are or what size you are – it’s something about seeing a man, a positive male figure, a father, your daddy or whatever you want to call them, at the school. It will make you straighten up and fly right.” On the Monday after the meeting, a group of fathers showed up before the 7:30 a.m. bell to usher students inside. Dads have been there every morning since, with about 40 now taking shifts to patrol during lunch and after school, too. They’ve tried to assume the roles of “cool uncles” to the students, according to LaFitte. He said there have not been any fights on campus since they started.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Forestry officials are asking residents who want to decorate for the fall and winter to be on the lookout for common invasive plants. The plants are sometimes used in wreaths and garlands and other decorations, according to the Maine Department of Agricultural, Conservation and Forestry. State law prohibits the import or sale of invasive plants in any form. The forestry department said the most common invasive plants in the decorations are Asiatic bittersweet and multiflora rose. The plants can cause environmental damage and overtake forests, wetlands and backyards. The state said the plants are also difficult to control and can re-sprout after being cut. It’s asking decorators to use native species, such as winterberry holly, red twig dogwood and American mountain ash.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: The city will move forward with its plans for a multimillion-dollar indoor sports facility, despite calls to slow down the project. The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to enter into an agreement with Eastern Sports Management to develop the structure, along with authorizing city staff members to prepare a demolition contract for Municipal Stadium, which sits on the property where the structure will be built. The money will come from the city’s fiscal year 2021 general fund surplus. Early estimates for the new indoor turf facility were around $7 million, but it is now estimated to cost between $10 million and $20 million, according to city officials. The city will be responsible for tearing down Municipal Stadium, which will cost about $100,000.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A hospital says someone hacked into its employee email system, potentially exposing the personal information of thousands of patients. UMass Memorial Health notified patients earlier this month if their information was involved in the breach, which occurred between June 2020 and January. The personal data included Social Security numbers, insurance information and medical information. More than 200,000 patients and health plan participants could have been affected by the breach, according to a federal database of cybersecurity incidents at medical facilities. The hospital said it had investigated the incident but couldn’t determine how much of the personal information might have been stolen. Affected patients will receive free credit monitoring and data protection assistance.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The state Supreme Court has agreed to take another look at a law that allows communities to collect millions of dollars from poor criminal defendants to pay salaries, keep lights on, and wax floors in courthouses up and down the state. The issue is whether it’s unconstitutional, especially when a judge knows a conviction will bring in cash and please local officials who count on the money to ease budget pressures. The Supreme Court issued an order Wednesday saying it would hear arguments in a case from Alpena County. Travis Johnson was ordered to pay $1,200 in local court costs for a pair of convictions. The court especially wants to hear whether the law “deprives criminal defendants of their right to appear before an impartial judge.” A judge can order people convicted of crimes to pay a portion of a court’s operating costs, such as salaries, utilities and other services. Someone who is acquitted doesn’t get a bill for overhead, nor do parties in a civil lawsuit. If prosecutors lose a case, money isn’t deducted from their budget. From 2016 through 2019, courts collected $172 million, nearly 75% of it in district courts, which handle traffic tickets, drunken driving cases and other misdemeanors mostly committed by people who can least afford it.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A judge has denied a defense request to dismiss the most serious charge against a former suburban police officer who said she meant to use a Taser instead of a handgun when she fatally shot Black motorist Daunte Wright. Former Brooklyn Center police Officer Kim Potter will stand trial in Hennepin County on first- and second-degree manslaughter charges in the death of Wright, who was shot after being stopped April 11 for a traffic violation. Potter, who is white, was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter, which requires a finding that she acted with “culpable negligence” in Wright’s death. Prosecutors later added a first-degree manslaughter count against Potter, alleging she recklessly handled a firearm and endangered Wright’s safety when death or great bodily harm was reasonably foreseeable. In allowing the first-degree manslaughter charge, Hennepin County Judge Regina Chu said Wednesday that she only had to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and make a finding of “probable cause,” meaning it was more probable than not that a crime was committed. She noted the state will have a much higher burden of proving the crime beyond a reasonable doubt during a trial, the Star Tribune reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Two new lawsuits claim hundreds of children have been exposed to dangerous lead levels through the drinking water in the capital city, which has been facing water system problems for years. One lawsuit represents one child, while the other has hundreds of children as plaintiffs. The suits, filed last week in federal court in Jackson, say the city and the state Health Department have made “conscience-shocking decisions and have shown deliberate indifference that have led to Plaintiffs’ exposure to toxic lead in Jackson’s drinking water.” One of the attorneys who filed the lawsuits, Corey M. Stern, has represented people who sued over tainted water in Flint, Michigan. Attorneys for Jackson are reviewing the lawsuits, and “the city will eventually have a response,” city spokesman Justin Vicory said. The lawsuits seek unspecified amounts of money for punitive damages and compensatory damages, plus attorneys’ fees and “other relief the Court deems appropriate.” Jackson has about 160,000 residents, and the city has long-standing problems with water quality and distribution. Since July 1, Jackson has been under a safe drinking water consent order with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which sets a schedule for work on water treatment facilities and delivery systems.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mark McCloskey said he does not support allowing abortions for young girls who become pregnant through rape or incest. McCloskey, a St. Louis personal injury lawyer who gained national attention after he and his wife waved guns at racial injustice protesters last summer, made the remarks last week at a forum in Osage Beach. “I’ve got a client who was raped by an uncle when she was 13 years old, had the child; she finished high school, finished college and got a master’s degree,” McCloskey said. “That child she would have aborted finished high school, finished college and now has a master’s degree. … I don’t believe in any exceptions.” McCloskey did not specifically address whether he would support an abortion to save the life of the mother, The Kansas City Star reports. He said it has always bothered him that people who oppose the death penalty often support abortion rights. “The justices of the Supreme Court in the most heinous crimes don’t have the right to decide who should live and die,” he said. “But every 13-year-old girl on the street should be able to decide the fate of the life of their child?” The subject of abortion exceptions famously sank the U.S. Senate campaign of another Missouri candidate in 2012. Asked if he supported abortions for women who were raped, Republican nominee Todd Akin, who died this month, responded: “If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A commission created to allocate federal COVID-19 relief funding to help stabilize the state’s economy recommended Wednesday that the governor allocate $4 million to help recruit new medical workers to Montana. But members rejected a proposal to spend $13 million on retention bonuses for existing hospital workers. The health care worker recruitment program would allow health care providers to cover up to $12,500 in moving expenses for new hires, along with another up to $4,300 to cover the taxes on that payment, said Scott Mendenhall, the state’s new American Rescue Plan Act program director. The program could recruit another 238 medical employees to the state, which has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases since mid-July. New workers would have to remain in their jobs in Montana for at least a year, or they would have to repay the money, Mendenhall said. Democratic House Minority Leader Kim Abbott, a member of the committee, argued the proposal overlooked members of the existing health care workforce, who are stressed and frustrated by seeing traveling workers receiving more pay than they receive. Abbott proposed recommending that the state set aside $13 million in federal relief funding for retention bonuses for employees of inpatient hospitals who stuck with their jobs during the pandemic.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s largest and oldest prison lost running water because of a plumbing issue, forcing inmates and staffers to use bottled water and portable toilets and raising concerns about conditions at the facility. Officials at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln said they had to shut off the water Tuesday when they discovered numerous leaks in the facility’s old, brittle pipes. Laura Strimple, a spokeswoman for the state corrections department, said in an email Thursday that crews had restored water service to the prison. State Sen. Terrell McKinney visited the prison Wednesday and said he saw toilets filled with human waste. He said he was told prisoners were getting two water bottles a day, but some complained that they had only received one, and a few prisoners were using mop buckets to shower. “From what I saw, it was horrible,” McKinney said. “You could smell it when you walked in.” Prison officials said the problem demonstrates the need for a new, $230 million facility proposed by Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts. But some state lawmakers, including McKinney, an Omaha Democrat, argue that a new prison isn’t necessary, especially when other states are closing prisons to save money.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Tourists are returning, events are expanding, and a wave of wagering is washing over the state, where a September casino winnings report showed gambling at pre-pandemic levels. Casinos statewide took in almost $1.2 billion in house winnings in September, the Nevada Gaming Control Board reported Wednesday. The figure marked seven straight months of $1 billion or more – one short of a record eight-month streak set in late 2006 and early 2007, before the Great Recession. Tourism officials in Las Vegas reported separately that hotel occupancy increased to 73% last month and that more than 2.9 million people visited the region, down 15% from the same month in 2019 but up 72% from 1.7 million in September 2020. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority characterized the month as a “stabilization” and noted that nightly hotel room rates have climbed to the highest during the “pandemic era,” to an average of $155. Increased vehicle traffic on Interstate 15 at the California-Nevada border reflected a return of domestic tourists, but regular international air travel has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. Federal authorities have set vaccination requirements for foreign, non-immigrant adults flying to the U.S. beginning Nov. 8.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Executive Council on Wednesday approved using federal funds to boost COVID-19 vaccination efforts in a vote that involved much less drama – and money – than previous requests. Two weeks ago, the Republican-led council that approves state contracts turned down $27 million from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over concerns that language in the grants would have bound the state to follow federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. More than 100 vaccine-mandate opponents packed the room, and nine were arrested for interrupting the meeting. But protestors were absent Wednesday when the the council unanimously voted to use $4.7 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funding to help community health centers and regional public health networks set up school-based and community vaccination clinics. “This will be an additional resource that is needed,” Republican Councilor Joe Kenney said. But Cinde Warmington, the lone Democrat on the council, noted that using the ARPA funds instead of the CDC money diverts money that could have been used for other programs. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette agreed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOceanport: Netflix has confirmed it will enter the bidding for a 289-acre tract of Fort Monmouth, where it hopes to create a mix of soundstages, post-production buildings and backlot sets. Gov. Phil Murphy supports Netflix’s bid, according to an account in The New York Times, the first to report on the development. In a statement to the Asbury Park Press on Tuesday, Netflix said: “America’s first movie studio was in New Jersey, and today it’s home to many talented people working in entertainment.” The world’s first film studio was part of Thomas Edison’s laboratories in West Orange – now part of the U.S. National Park Service. Years later, but before the motion picture industry moved to the warmer and stable climate of Los Angeles, the capital of American filmmaking was Fort Lee. Fort Monmouth was formerly the base for the U.S. Signal Corps and over its long, nearly 100-year history contributed to many technological advances. Radar was developed at the fort, and it was the first place to bounce an electronic signal off the moon. The fort closed in 2011 and has been undergoing redevelopment and a return to private hands. Prospective purchasers have until Jan. 12 to submit a proposal to buy what is called the Mega Parcel, which sits in parts of Eatontown and Oceanport.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: School bus drivers in the city have gone on strike, shutting down much of the public school transportation system that serves 3,500 students. Current drivers picketed the office of southern New Mexico district school bus contractor STS New Mexico on Thursday, demanding better pay and working conditions. Bus driver shortages have strained schools across the state as education officials struggle to hire and train more workers. Some offer free training, signing bonuses and other perks for new employees. The shortage has led the company to push mechanics into driving service, meaning there aren’t mechanics to fix buses when they break down, a bus driver union representative said. “We’re just going to do the best that we can do,” STS General Manager Van Wamel said. “This shift in focus is unfortunate, but we are confident that it is temporary,” Las Cruces Public Schools Superintendent Ralph Ramos said in a statement. District officials told parents by text message Thursday to “please make alternative transportation arrangements if possible.” District spokeswoman Kelly Jameson said special education students with transportation specified in their individualized learning plans won’t be affected by the strike.\n\nNew York\n\nMechanicville: A furry, four-legged scourge is wreaking havoc on a Hudson Valley town’s water supply, forcing local officials to scramble to keep up. The culprits are a family of beavers that has been building dams near Mechanicville, impeding the flow of water from the primary stream that empties into the small reservoir on which the town depends for drinking water. “I wouldn’t call it a fight. I call it a very challenging opponent, and we play a game of chess,” Mechanicville Public Works Commissioner Anthony Gotti told the Albany Times-Union. “I take his dam down. I’ve got to figure out where he goes next.” Towns like Mechanicville, about 20 miles up the Hudson River from Albany, don’t have the luxury of relying on large reservoirs fed by numerous tributaries. That has made the problem more pressing, as beavers are capable of building a dam in as little as two nights that can slow water flow and create algae in the reservoir. The challenge is complicated by the fact that the dams, which consist of tightly wound branches secured by mud and leaves, usually must be removed by hand, as work crews can’t bring heavy equipment into the forest without building a road, the Times-Union reports. The beaver, a protected species, became New York state’s official mammal in the 1970s and was once nearly extinct.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: U.S. Sen. Richard Burr and his brother-in-law are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for potential insider trading – a case that stems from their abrupt sales of financial holdings during the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, according to recent federal court filings. Burr, a Republican, is among several lawmakers from both parties who faced outrage over their aggressive trading in early 2020, before the economic threat from the virus was widely known. That fueled accusations that the members of Congress were acting on inside information gained through their official duties to benefit financially, which is illegal under a law known as the STOCK Act. Burr was previously investigated by the Trump administration’s Justice Department for offloading $1.6 million from his portfolio in January and February 2020. The department cleared him of wrongdoing almost a year later – on Jan. 19, Donald Trump’s last full day in office. But the SEC continued to investigate Burr, according to court documents filed in the Southern District of New York that were first made public last week. The agency enforces federal securities law. Attorneys for Burr as well as for Gerald Fauth, the brother of Burr’s wife, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Burr has previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A lawmaker was barred from boarding a flight at Minot International Airport this week after a run-in with a security agent during a pat-down. Republican state Rep. Jeff Hoverson said he and his wife were planning to travel Monday for their anniversary. He said a Transportation Security Administration agent said he was going to give him a pat-down but did not ask permission. Hoverson said he moved the agent’s hand away. TSA said in a statement that the pat-down was initiated when Hoverson set off the alarm in the screening machine. The agency said Hoverson objected during the pat-down and called the police. He eventually complied, but the airline made the decision to deny boarding, TSA said. Hoverson said everyone overreacted, including himself. A pastor who’s among the most far-right legislators in the GOP-controlled Legislature, he introduced legislation last session to repeal mask mandates in the state. He also unsuccessfully sponsored legislation that would make it a felony to help women get abortions, including by giving them rides to abortion clinics. And as a freshman legislator two years ago, Hoverson protested a prayer by a Hindu cleric, saying he didn’t “want to be compelled to pray for a false god.”\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A roller derby team that has called itself the Cleveland Guardians since 2013 sued the city’s Major League Baseball team in federal court Wednesday, alleging that the switch from Indians to Guardians infringes on its trademark. “A Major League club cannot simply take a smaller team’s name and use it for itself,” the lawsuit said. “There cannot be two ‘Cleveland Guardians’ teams in Cleveland, and, to be blunt, Plaintiff was here first.” The Cleveland Indians announced in July that the team would assume the name Guardians for the 2022 season after years of criticism that the Indians name and Chief Wahoo logo were racist. The new name, the team has said, was influenced in part by the two large art deco statues that appear to stand guard on a bridge spanning the Cuyahoga River. The all-gender roller derby team is based in the Cleveland suburb of Parma. It formally registered the name Cleveland Guardians in 2017 with the Ohio secretary of state and has been selling team merchandise since 2014, the lawsuit said. The baseball team filed a trademark application for the Guardians name in the East African island nation of Mauritius, “effectively hiding the application unless one knew where to look,” it said. In a statement Wednesday, the Indians said officials “believe there is no conflict between the parties and their ability to operate in their respective business areas.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A federal judge has temporarily blocked parts of a new state law that makes it a misdemeanor for people to unlawfully obstruct a public street or highway during a protest. U.S. District Judge Robin Cauthron also put on hold Wednesday a provision that could result in fines of up $50,000 for groups or organizations “found to be a conspirator” with someone who violates any one of a number of state laws pertaining to riots and unlawful assemblies. The injunction temporarily prevents the enforcement of these parts of the law as the court weighs its constitutionality. A key provision of the new law that grants immunity to drivers who run people over is not being put on hold. The Oklahoma chapter of the NAACP sued Attorney General John O’Connor and Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, alleging parts of the law are unconstitutional because it will limit protests and have a chilling effect on free speech. The law was passed this year by the Republican-controlled state Legislature and signed by GOP Gov. Kevin Stitt shortly after an incident in July in which a pickup truck pulling a horse trailer drove through Black Lives Matter protesters on Interstate 244 in Tulsa. Three people were seriously injured, including a 33-year-old man who fell from an overpass and was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A lawsuit has been filed saying the residency requirements for the state’s assisted suicide law violate the U.S. Constitution. Oregon was the first state to legalize medical aid in dying in 1997, when it allowed adult residents with a terminal diagnosis and prognosis of no more than six months to live to end their lives by taking a lethal dose of prescribed medication. The national advocacy organization Compassion & Choices and an Oregon Health & Science University professor of family medicine filed the new lawsuit. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports experts believe the legal action could have broad implications as the first challenge in the nation to raise the question of whether such residency requirements are constitutional. Oregon’s law was the basis of the laws that have since been adopted in eight other states and Washington, D.C. California, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, and Vermont and Washington state allow aid in dying for residents of their states only. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Portland on Thursday asks the court to prohibit Oregon officials from enforcing the residency provision of the law. It says the residency requirement violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the Constitution and the Commerce Clause in Article I.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Senate on Wednesday approved legislation that would bar municipalities in the nation’s No. 2 natural gas state from adopting building codes that prohibit gas hookups or otherwise restricting utility service based on the energy source. The Republican-penned bill passed 35-15 and heads to the state House of Representatives for consideration there. The chamber approved it without debate, with six Democrats joining all 29 Republicans in favor of it. The bill defends a homegrown energy source in Pennsylvania as some states, cities and counties elsewhere begin looking at all-electric building codes that exclude gas infrastructure as a way to fight climate change and accelerate progress toward a carbon-free electricity grid. The vast Marcellus Shale reservoir beneath Pennsylvania is the nation’s most prolific natural gas reservoir, and the state has helped subsidize the build-out of gas infrastructure to help the industry find new customers. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Gene Yaw, R-Lycoming, said the legislation ensures the state controls any decision to restrict the use of an energy source in housing and commercial buildings. Combustion of natural gas emits carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, while natural gas contains methane, which is far more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, according to researchers.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The thousands of drivers who use the Route 37 highway on their way to work every day probably have no idea they are passing over the graves of some people who died in the late 1800s and early 1900s at state institutions. Route 37 was built between 1963 and 1969 over part of the institution cemetery called State Farm Cemetery #1, which has about 1,200 gravesites containing 3,000 people, WPRI-TV reports. A thousand of those graves should have been moved, said Charles St. Martin, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Transportation. “It was during a time when regulations were far more lax than they are now,” he wrote in an email. “This would never happen now.” There were no grave markers when the highway was built because the original grave markers were wooden stakes that had rotted away, St. Martin said. Some of the grave markers had been destroyed by fire too. The cemetery was near railroad tracks, and sparks from the steam engines set fires that consumed the markers, according to a description of the cemetery by the Rhode Island Historical Cemetery Commission. The cemetery deteriorated and became overgrown. In 2006, when dozens of coffins were exposed due to rain, the transportation department realized the graves were there, St. Martin said. The agency does not plan to move the graves that are under Route 37.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The governor wants to put $500 million of federal COVID-19 relief money toward fixing and improving water systems across the state, with priority given to rural and smaller systems. Gov. Henry McMaster announced his idea Thursday, saying a modern clean drinking water and sewer system is vital to citizens and to bring in businesses. “In rural South Carolina, water and sewer is the key to life,” McMaster said at a news conference in Great Falls. The $500 million is part of about $2.4 billion in pandemic relief money that the state can spend. The General Assembly will make the final decision on where the money goes. Senate and House committees discussing the relief money have brought up the idea of water system building and repair, but with a big difference: requiring local systems to also put up money for the effort. The state has more than 260 water systems and 200 wastewater systems, and their average age is approaching 50 years old, officials said. McMaster said a local match wasn’t in his plan. “Some of these communities just don’t have the money,” the governor said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem issued an executive order Wednesday aimed at ensuring that state employees can easily obtain medical and religious exemptions from federal vaccine mandates. Noem said the move was necessary to ensure employees aren’t forced to get COVID-19 vaccinations under President Joe Biden’s initiative, which covers not only people directly paid by federal contracts but also anyone who works to support them. State lawmakers have said South Dakotans are being denied medical and religious exemptions from feds and have called for a special session to stop the order. Noem spokesman Jordan Overturf said Noem’s exemptions are “explicit and offer a clear path” for state workers to opt out of the shots. For medical exemptions, state employees need a note from a doctor stating that the vaccination is too risky because of health reasons. For religious exemptions, workers need to fill out and sign a form stating they object to the COVID-19 vaccine based “on religious grounds, which includes moral, ethical, and philosophical beliefs or principles.” Once either forms are submitted, the exemptions are automatic, Overturf said. Noem said she is talking to lawmakers about extending those protections to private employees.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A new piece of legislation aims to grow and preserve the city’s beleaguered tree canopy by creating a dedicated stream of revenue to help fund the effort. Nashville’s continued growth and development has come at an environmental cost. Between 2008 and 2016, the city lost 918 acres of tree canopy to development – about 13% of its urban canopy, according to a 2018 report. More than 30,000 metric tons of carbon were released into Davidson County’s atmosphere as a result. The bill, drafted by Mayor John Cooper’s administration, would create a dedicated revenue stream for tree restoration by allocating 1% of annual revenue from each of three funding sources: building permits, grading permits and general obligation bond-funded construction projects. The tree restoration and maintenance fund would be capped at $2.5 million annually, and the legislation would “sunset” June 30, 2023, allowing an opportunity for future review and potential renewal if deemed necessary. The bill will go before the Metro Council for its first of three readings Tuesday. The majority of tree loss in Davidson County occurs on private property, according to the bill.\n\nTexas\n\nFort Worth: A museum dedicated to telling the history of Juneteenth with a national scope is set to be built in the city. The National Juneteenth Museum will be built as part of a mixed-use development, the city of Fort Worth said in a news release Tuesday. When President Joe Biden signed a bill into law over the summer making June 19 a federal holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the U.S., those by his side included Opal Lee, a 95-year-old Fort Worth woman who spent years rallying people to join her push to see the day get that recognition. The city said Lee has been leading the charge for the new museum, which will be built on land that currently houses her Fort Worth Juneteenth Museum. “To have lived long enough to see my walking and talking make an impact is one thing, but to know that a state-of-the-art museum that will house the actual pen that President Biden used to sign the bill, and many other exhibits, is coming to pass as well – I could do my holy dance again,” Lee said. The city said the museum will be led by a collaboration that includes activists, researchers and historians.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: The Southwest Symphony opens its 41st season Friday with the annual Halloween Spooktacular, featuring the music of John Williams. Maestro Lucas Darger returns for his sixth season as music director and conductor. Over the years, Darger and his predecessor Gary Caldwell have offered audiences an smorgasbord of Williams’ works. The composer best known for his film scores has received Academy Awards, Grammys, Golden Globes and Emmys. “Our ‘haunted’ orchestra will feature Williams’ music with selections from ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Jurassic Park,’ ‘Superman,’ ‘E.T.,’ ‘Saving Private Ryan’ and many more,” said Scott Raine, marketing director of the Southwest Symphony. The traditional Handel’s “Messiah” will be returning in early December. Prokofiev’s “Peter and the Wolf” is slated to be presented in early February, followed by award-winning international flutist Demarre McGill in March.\n\nVermont\n\nRockingham: The town is planning to spend up to $20,000 to save the steeple and a stained glass window from an old church in the village of Bellows Falls that is slated for demolition. The Brattleboro Reformer reports the Rockingham Select Board voted unanimously to spend up to $15,000 to remove the steeple from the Methodist Meeting House and up to $5,000 to remove and crate the stained glass window of “The Parable of the Sower.” Town Manager Scott Pickup said what will happen to the historic items after they are removed has not been decided. The demolition date has been pushed back to December to allow more time to salvage the historic items, Pickup said. The board voted last month to demolish the 1835 building. It was extensively renovated in 1880. But while it was home to the local YMCA, the building fell into a state of serious disrepair. Efforts to save the building failed. The town took ownership of the dilapidated building this summer. Select Board member Elijah Zimmer, a member of the town’s Historic Preservation Commission, said the steeple is in excellent condition, unlike the rest of the building. “I’m sad to lose the building, but glad to see a commitment to historic preservation,” Zimmer said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Police are warning that an unlicensed tow truck is being used to quickly steal vehicles throughout the city. On Sunday, the tow truck was captured on surveillance video backing up toward a vehicle, lifting it with tow gear and towing it away seconds later, Richmond Police said in a news release. Police said the truck is black with no logo or lettering on it, as is required for tow trucks for hire. Detectives asked the public to call 911 if they see this tow truck or any tow truck without a company name, lettering or logo.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A federal jury has determined that The GEO Group must pay minimum wage – rather than $1 a day – to immigration detainees who perform tasks like cooking and cleaning at its for-profit detention center in the state. The verdict came Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Tacoma in a second trial over the issue. The first trial ended in June with a deadlocked jury. “This multi-billion dollar corporation illegally exploited the people it detains to line its own pockets,” Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a statement. “Today’s victory sends a clear message: Washington will not tolerate corporations that get rich violating the rights of the people.” The jury will now consider how much the immigrant detainees who worked at the facility are owed, and U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan on his own will determine what The GEO Group must pay the state for its claim that the company unjustly enriched itself. Ferguson, a Democrat, sued the Florida-based GEO Group in 2017, saying the company had unjustly profited by running the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma – now known as the Northwest ICE Processing Center – on the backs of captive workers. A separate lawsuit filed on behalf of detainees was also filed that year, seeking back pay. The judge, who rejected several attempts by GEO to dismiss the lawsuits, consolidated the cases for trial.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A new program enables owners of small forestlands to prosper from improving forest health while slowing climate change. The Family Forest Carbon Program, which pays family and individual small-forest owners to implement practices that increase the amount of carbon sequestered and stored on the land, is opening enrollment to West Virginia landowners. The program could pay significant financial and environmental dividends in the Mountain State, given that West Virginia is the third-most-forested state in the nation, with more than 12 million acres of forestland. The program, a product of the American Forest Foundation and the Nature Conservancy, enables the carbon sequestered by enrolled landowners to become part of a carbon market in the form of carbon credits to be verified by a third party. The program provides expert consultation from foresters to landowners and a forest management plan customized for the landowner’s property. “We built into (the program) a management plan, not to tell them what to do but to help them reach the goals and visions they have for their land, put it into a management plan so that their woods are producing timber, wildlife, carbon for the years to come,” American Forest Foundation CEO Tom Martin said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A sheriff who supports former President Donald Trump accused the bipartisan state Elections Commission of breaking the law during last year’s election, taking the unusual step Thursday of detailing the allegations publicly even though no charges have been filed. Racine County Sheriff Charles Schamling called on the Wisconsin Department of Justice to investigate the commission’s decision last year to tell local elections officials not to send poll workers into nursing homes to assist residents with voting during the pandemic. The move is the latest example of Trump supporters seeking to undermine confidence in the election in a critical battleground state that President Joe Biden carried last year. The state Department of Justice has already said it has no plans to pursue the case, the sheriff said. In a 75-minute presentation streamed on his Facebook page, Schmaling detailed what he said was evidence collected from the Ridgewood Care Center in Racine County. Trump issued a statement encouraging his supporters to watch the presentation. Schmaling said the families of eight residents told investigators they believed that their loved ones did not have the capacity to vote but that ballots were cast for them. “I don’t know how or who they voted for,” the sheriff said. “I didn’t ask because it doesn’t matter.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Central High School’s theater program returned in full capacity with an intimate production of “Typhoid Mary.” The play tells the story of Mary Mallon, an Irish cook who immigrated to America in the early 1900s while unknowingly serving as a carrier of the disease typhoid. The story begins after Mary has already infected and killed several people with her cooking, but still she refuses to be vaccinated or studied by scientists who offer to help her. Choosing a play with such a relevant premise was entirely intentional, but director Jeremiah Kolkman wasn’t looking to take sides, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. “If the audience walks out of here thinking that they were able to relate to this because of current events as they are, that’s great,” he said. “If audience members are walking out of here disgusted because they don’t like the differences of religion and science, that’s great. I just want them walking out of here thinking about it.” While the director chose the play for its relevance, the production remains bipartisan. It presents the situation from a variety of different perspectives. Mary and her husband struggle through religious reconciliation, while the two scientists throughout the production face conflict in their field. Prior to last weekend’s shows, the last time Cheyenne Central held a full production was fall 2019, before the contagious, deadly coronavirus reared its head.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/dining/2021/11/17/find-columbus-central-ohio-restaurants-food-near-you-2021-map-directory-guide/6245251001/", "title": "Columbus restaurant guide: Find food near you by cuisine", "text": "Compiled and edited by Erin Edwards, Tom Hanks, David Rees, Lily Roby and Eiliana Wright\n\nColumbus Monthly\n\nLove local restaurants?

They warn that we live in a dangerous world filled with villainous strangers who could harm us if we aren’t careful.\n\nThis year, reporters began reaching out earlier than usual, in late September, and they wanted to talk about a new alleged threat: “rainbow fentanyl.”\n\nKids are next\n\nFentanyl is a very powerful synthetic opioid that has caused thousands of overdoses and deaths over the past two decades. In August 2022, drug enforcement authorities noted that pills containing fentanyl were being manufactured in various colors.\n\nDEA Administrator Anne Milgram said, “Rainbow fentanyl – fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes and sizes – is a deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults.”\n\nMany news outlets covered this story, including the notion that the colors might be some sort of marketing ploy to attract younger drug users. But then some people started connecting rainbow fentanyl to Halloween.\n\nREAD MORE: Vampire myths originated with a real blood disorder\n\nInterviewed on Fox News on Sept. 20, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel declared, “Every mom in the country is worried, what if this gets into my kid’s Halloween basket?” Other Fox commentators suggested that parents might want to protect their children by not letting them go trick-or-treating this year. And, to prove the bipartisan appeal of protecting children, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, repeated the warnings.\n\nIt’s worth considering what’s familiar and what’s new about these warnings.\n\nOne fairly standard element is commentators’ readiness to link September crime news to the possibility that it might presage what could happen on Halloween.\n\nIn 1982 there was a spate of Tylenol poisonings – seven people died after purchasing and consuming tampered packages of pills. Many commentators then warned that parents needed to be extra vigilant when examining Halloween treats. Those deaths also led to a dramatic increase in protective packaging for all sorts of products to discourage tampering.\n\nSimilarly, the 9/11 terrorist attacks led to rumors about Halloween 2001 threats – that there were plans to attack a mall where some parents let their children go trick-or-treating, or that terrorists had purchased massive amounts of candy, presumably so they could poison the treats before distributing them.\n\nREAD MORE: From Black Death to Covid-19, pandemics have always pushed people to honor death and celebrate life\n\nTrends in recreational or illicit drug use often make the jump to Halloween warnings. In 2014, the year that Colorado first allowed state-licensed retail sales of recreational marijuana, the Denver Police Department posted online warnings that parents ought to keep an eye out for THC-laced edible candies in Halloween treats. Yet after Halloween had passed, a department spokesperson admitted, “We are not aware of any cases of children ingesting marijuana candy during Halloween season.”\n\nSimilarly, in 2019, September reports of deaths caused by vaping black-market THC-infused cartridges were coupled with news that Pennsylvania authorities had confiscated commercial THC candies – supposedly smuggled from a state where they could be purchased legally – to generate another round of Halloween warnings.\n\nThe irrationality of it all\n\nOne obvious hole in these concerns is that drugs tend to cost more than candy – marijuana edibles, for example, run somewhere in the neighborhood of a dollar or two per dose or more.\n\nFentanyl is considerably more expensive. It is not unreasonable to wonder just what a fentanyl dealer’s overarching goal might be if in passing the drug off as candy. The suggestion that a school-age kid would go from accidental user of fentanyl to a paying addict is far-fetched.\n\nOf course, the villains in contemporary legends aren’t expected to behave rationally. Ask why gang members would attempt to kill motorists who blink their headlights at them – an urban legend from the 1980s – and the response is likely to be, “That’s just the sort of thing those sadistic people do.”\n\nIt might not make any sense for someone to give a brightly colored opioid pill or THC-infused candy to a small child, but it isn’t impossible, is it? Such reasoning is thought to justify ringing the alarm bells.\n\nREAD MORE: How the ancient world’s scented sorceresses influence ideas about magic today\n\nOften there is a kernel of truth to these fears. Certainly fentanyl is a dangerous drug. But American history can be read as a long line of fears about witches, immigrants, drugs, conspirators and so on. These fears emerge as reflections of current social changes. Yes, things are always changing, and this can always frighten some people. But it is also true that, in retrospect, these fears are usually exaggerated.\n\nWhat seems new about describing rainbow fentanyl as a Halloween danger is the willingness of important political figures and news media outlets to spread the warnings. Most past claims about Halloween sadism lack such prominent spokespeople.\n\nBut in a time when many news outlets seem intent on maintaining their audiences by frightening them, and increased political polarization seems to stall efforts to devise workable social policies, calls for protecting our children from the threats of boogeyman drug dealers return us to the spirit of Halloween: offering up fresh ways to keep people scared.", "authors": ["Joel Best"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/health/abbott-infant-formula-recall-cap-problem/index.html", "title": "Baby formula: Abbott announces another recall but claims it affects ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAbbott Labs said Friday that it is recalling certain lots of 2 fluid ounce/59 milliliter bottles of Ready-to-Feed liquid formula for infants and children due to a problem with the bottle caps on some bottles that may not have sealed completely and could result in spoilage.\n\nIf a child were to consume spoiled formula, the company said, it could cause stomach problems such as vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nA company spokesperson told CNN that the recall involves “less than a day’s worth” of the total infant formula used in the US and should not affect the overall supply.\n\nThis formula was manufactured in Columbus, Ohio, not at Abbott’s plant in Sturgis, Michigan, that was the focus of a large recall in February that exacerbated a shortage of baby formula, leading to ongoing problems.\n\nThe recalled brands include Similac, Pro-Total Comfort, Similac 360 Total Care, Similac 360 Total Care Sensitive, Similac Special Care 24, Similac Stage 1, Similac NeoSure, Similac Water (Sterilized) and Pedialyte Electrolyte Solution.\n\nMost of these products are distributed primarily to hospitals and doctors’ offices.\n\nThe recall does not include any other liquid or powder formula brands or other nutrition products produced at Abbott’s Ohio facility or any other manufacturing location.\n\nAffected lot numbers are listed on the website similacrecall.com. If a consumer has one of the recalled products, they should not feed it to their child, the company said.\n\n“We take our responsibility to deliver high-quality products very seriously,” Joe Manning, Abbott’s executive vice president of nutritional products, said in a news release. “We internally identified the issue, are addressing it, and will work with our customers to minimize inconvenience and get them the products they need.”\n\nAbbott’s Sturgis plant was shuttered for months after an FDA inspection found Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria, which can be deadly to infants, in several areas. Similac, Alimentum and EleCare powdered infant formulas made at the plant were recalled, and the closure exacerbated shortages caused by supply chain disruptions. Families across the United States have struggled for months to find formula for infants and for people with specific nutrition needs.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nProduction had been underway for less than two weeks before a storm and flooding in July prompted officials to close the plant again.

Sauter, Evan Comen, Thomas C. Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nSome product launches can be spectacular failures, and Google Glass, an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted device with smartphone capabilities, failed in such a manner several years ago. It was meant to be the first piece of technology to connect the typical consumer to augmented reality.\n\nGoogle continues to attempt to find a place for the product, but its original launch was a definitive failure. In 2017, the internet giant announced the relaunch of the device to target to businesses rather than the general public, but whatever happens, it will be adopted by a meaningfully narrower audience.\n\nJust like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take big risks, hoping for success but not always achieving it.\n\nThese failures take many different forms. When a product doesn’t sell, when it is recalled or discontinued, or when it otherwise does not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, it can be marked as a failure. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nSometimes, it can take years, or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax a video format which Sony introduced, expecting it to replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\n24/7 Wall Street reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\nMore: Population migration patterns: US cities Americans are abandoning\n\n1. Google Glass\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass -- an eyeglasses shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities -- to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you -- to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1993\n\n1993 What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\nMore: Budweiser, Coors Light, Bud Light top list of best-selling beers in America\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\nCompany: Atari\n\nAtari Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The video game was created/developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development -- games typically take months, if not years, to program -- the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\nCompany: Burger King\n\nBurger King Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\nCompany: RJ Reynolds\n\nRJ Reynolds Year introduced: 1988\n\n1988 What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes -- the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 2005\n\n2005 What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\nCompany: Fox\n\nFox Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\nCompany: Clairol\n\nClairol Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol -- at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb -- thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\nMore: Jeep, Disney, Coca-Cola top survey list of America’s most patriotic brands\n\n9. New Coke\n\nCompany: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Year introduced: 1985\n\n1985 What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years -- but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2007\n\n2007 What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not -- in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\nCompany: Colgate\n\nColgate Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\nCompany: Coors\n\nCoors Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley Davidson perfume\n\nCompany: Harley Davidson\n\nHarley Davidson Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the most masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this manly personality, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\nHolding company: Unilever\n\nUnilever Year released: 1994\n\n1994 What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\nCompany: Cosmopolitan\n\nCosmopolitan Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\nCompany: De Havilland\n\nDe Havilland Year introduced: 1949\n\n1949 What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\nMore: Which manufacturers are bringing the most jobs back to America?\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\nCompany: Delorean Motor Company\n\nDelorean Motor Company Year introduced: 1981\n\n1981 What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\nCompany: Heinz\n\nHeinz Year released: 2000\n\n2000 Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were -- and still are -- among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\nCompany: USFL\n\nUSFL Year introduced: 1982\n\n1982 What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\nCompany: Facebook\n\nFacebook Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\nCompany: Ford\n\nFord Year introduced: 1957\n\n1957 What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel -- named after Henry Ford’s son -- ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\nCompany: Friendster\n\nFriendster Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop -- as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\nCompany: Frito-Lay\n\nFrito-Lay Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year -- the most of any new product in 1998 -- sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\nMore: Per capita government spending: How much does your state spend on you?\n\n24. Zune\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment -- a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\nCompany: GlaxoSmithKline\n\nGlaxoSmithKline Year introduced: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic -- Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\nCompany: Google\n\nGoogle Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such is the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. Today, Google+ has some active user groups and is often used to share photos.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\nCompany: Hewlett-Packard\n\nHewlett-Packard Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\nCompany: Kellogg's\n\nKellogg's Year introduced: 1998\n\n1998 What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\nCompany: Maxwell House\n\nMaxwell House Year introduced: 1990\n\n1990 What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\nCompany: McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's Year introduced: 1996\n\n1996 What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\nMore: Wage potential: Highest paying jobs you can get without a college degree\n\n31. HD DVD\n\nCompany: Toshiba\n\nToshiba Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nBlu-ray’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\nCompany: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\nCompany: Universal Pictures\n\nUniversal Pictures Year introduced: 2013\n\n2013 What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\nCompany: Netflix\n\nNetflix Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill conceived of strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\nCompany: Nintendo\n\nNintendo Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\nCompany: Nokia/Intel\n\nNokia/Intel Year introduced: 2010\n\n2010 What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\nCompany: Pepsi\n\nPepsi Year introduced: 1992\n\n1992 What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\nCompany: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\nMattel / Patriot Computers Year released: 1999\n\n1999 What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\nMore: How much did a personal computer cost the year you were born?\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\nCompany: Phillips\n\nPhillips Year introduced: 1978\n\n1978 What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows -- an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\nCompany: Sega\n\nSega Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n1999 (North America) What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time -- it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility -- but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\nCompany: Smith & Wesson\n\nSmith & Wesson Year introduced: 2002\n\n2002 What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\nCompany: Apple\n\nApple Year introduced: 1983\n\n1983 What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\nCompany: Sony\n\nSony Year introduced: 1975\n\n1975 What it was: Video cassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard video cassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\nCompany: Silicon Knights\n\nSilicon Knights Year introduced: 2008\n\n2008 What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectation and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\nMore: Are these the worst cities to live in?

Mobile ESPN\n\nCompany: ESPN\n\nESPN Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\nCompany: Life Savers\n\nLife Savers Year introduced: 1995\n\n1995 What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\nCompany: Walt Disney Motion\n\nWalt Disney Motion Year introduced: 2011\n\n2011 What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\nCompany: Eons.com\n\nEons.com Year introduced: 2006\n\n2006 What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com -- a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\nCompany: NBC\n\nNBC Year introduced: 1979\n\n1979 What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\nCompany: Samsung\n\nSamsung Year introduced: 2016\n\n2016 What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of (the larger and--optional) more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a SouthWest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nMore: Can you afford that new vehicle? 25 most expensive car models to insure\n\nDetailed findings and methodology\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another -- rightly so or not -- they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty -- at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary. Its content is produced independently of USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/08/06/fact-check-red-bull-doesnt-contain-drugs-may-spur-false-positive/5557820002/", "title": "Fact check: Red Bull doesn't contain drugs, may spur false positive", "text": "The claim: Red Bull causes a false positive result on drug tests\n\nA 2019 Facebook post shows a picture of a urine drug test and claims that the energy drink Red Bull tests positive for the stimulant methamphetamine and opioids oxycodone and Suboxone, while the energy drink Bang tests positive for recreational drug ecstasy. The post alludes to the instance of a false positive, which occurs when a test shows the presence of a substance that a person has not actually used.\n\nThere are several anecdotal reports of Red Bull producing a false positive result on drug tests, including the story of a musician in Switzerland who tested positive for amphetamine in 2017, allegedly due to excessive consumption of the energy drink.\n\n\"Red Bull products are NSF Certified for Sport, meaning our products are tested for 270 athletic banned substances from the WADA, NFL and MLB prohibited substances list,\" said Erin Mand, Red Bull's director of corporate communications, in an email.\n\nUSA TODAY has also reached out to Bang for comment on the Facebook post.\n\nWhile Red Bull does not contain any of the substances that drug tests screen for, the nature of certain urine drug tests is why a false positive result may occur.\n\nFact check:Low body fat, healthy lifestyle do not prevent COVID-19\n\nHow drug tests work\n\nDrug testing gained national attention during President Richard Nixon's campaign against drugs in the late 1960s, inspiring creation of the Drug Enforcement Administration's precursor, the Office for Drug Abuse and Law Enforcement. Drug policy would continue to take shape under subsequent administrations, leading to the drug laws and efforts at criminal justice reform that exist today.\n\nDrug tests can vary widely depending on the drugs being tested and specimen types collected, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The Facebook post pictures a urine drug test, a tool commonly used to monitor medication compliance, detect drug abuse or for employment screening purposes. Aside from urine, other biological samples such as hair, saliva or sweat may also be collected. Urine drug tests, however, are considered the gold standard given ease in collection, low testing cost and ability to detect recent drug use.\n\nDespite the pros, the underlying methodology of the urine drug test — which uses immune system molecules called antibodies (also known as an immunoassay) — can be why a test returns a false positive for energy drinks, said Dr. Peter Chai, an emergency medicine physician specializing in toxicology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.\n\nFact check:Whiskey dispensers existed, but never became office staples in the 1950s\n\n“A lot of these energy drinks have some sort of caffeine in it, and then they have essential amino acids,” he said. “You’re not testing for the actual drug, you’re testing for a structure within the molecular composition of the drug. That’s how these tests commonly get fooled. There’s not amphetamine in the energy drink, but one of these amino acids may mimic the structure and so (the test) is just going to become positive if it detects a similar structure.”\n\nChai said that because there are a lot of potential things that can go wrong with an immunoassay that would lead to a positive result, laboratories could then conduct a follow-up confirmatory test to determine the identity of the actual drug.\n\nThere may be another culprit behind the false positive. There have been reports of riboflavin being mistaken for marijuana according to an article in Missouri Medicine, the journal of the Missouri State Medical Association. Riboflavin is a form of vitamin B naturally present in some foods and exists as an additive in Red Bull, which contains 1.47 mg per serving.\n\nFact check:Fact check: Costco's Kirkland Signature vodka is not made by Grey Goose\n\nThe post depicts an invalid test\n\nWhile Red Bull may cause a false positive, the post shows the results of pure Red Bull poured into the container, rather than a urine sample of someone who has consumed the energy drink.\n\n“Pure Red Bull is going to have a different pH and a different acidity than actual urine,” Chai said. “When you drink it, your body metabolizes and breaks down its compounds, and then when you urinate, you have a different compound. You’re looking at fundamentally different things. So, I don’t think that’s a valid test.”\n\nOur ruling: Partly false\n\nWe rate this claim PARTLY FALSE, based on our research. It is true there is a possibility that the urine of a person who consumed Red Bull or another energy drink can falsely test positive on an immunoassay drug test if the amino acids found in the drink mimic the structure of a certain drug. However, the post is misleading because it shows test results of the energy drink poured into the container rather than a urine sample of a person who has consumed and metabolized the drink. Therefore, the results are not valid.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Frohlich and Samuel Stebbins\n\n24/7 Wall Street\n\nGoogle+ finally ceased operations in April after eight years of efforts to boost interest in the struggling social network. The long-anticipated shutdown represents just the latest major Google product to fail to live up to its promise.\n\nGoogle has gained notoriety for scuttling dozens of projects, but just like success, failure is part of doing business. Entrepreneurs and large companies often take on big risks, hoping for success but not always finding it.\n\nThese failures can take many different forms. Often, a product simply does not connect with consumers and does not sell. In other cases, it may not come close to meeting a company’s expectations or plans, or it is recalled or discontinued for some flaws. These can all be marked as failures. While failures are expected, some can be so catastrophic they can lead to permanent damage to a company’s reputation, layoffs, and even complete financial ruin.\n\nThe real cost of cutting the cord:What streaming companies don’t want you to know\n\nDollar store games:Bargain shopping for video games, gaming accessories can pay off at dollar stores\n\nSometimes, it can take years or even decades for a product flop to disappear from the market. This was the case with Betamax, a video format that Sony introduced with the expectation it would replace VHS. Despite being technologically superior to VHS, Betamax lost market share until it eventually vanished.\n\nSome of the products on this list were among the most highly anticipated products of the year, and when released, they were the biggest product launches of the year – that is, before failing.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed some of the greatest product launch blunders throughout history. Today, these product flops exist as case studies companies use to avoid future failure. They range from Ford’s Edsel in 1958 to 2016’s Galaxy Note 7. Many of these products led to losses in the hundreds of millions, and sometimes billions, of dollars. In tech, film, the internet, the pharmaceutical industry, and more, these are the biggest product flops of all time.\n\n1. Google Glass\n\n• Company: Google\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: Wearable technology\n\nGoogle first announced Google Glass – an eyeglasses-shaped head-mounted display with smartphone capabilities – to the public in 2012. The announcement began with a statement of principle: “We think technology should work for you – to be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don’t.” After two years of disappointing sales, it was clear consumers did not need Google Glass. Google stuck to its principle, and in 2015 discontinued the product’s development. Privacy concerns, reported bugs, low battery life, bans from public spaces, and an inability to live up to the hype all stymied public adoption of the technology.\n\n2. The Newton\n\n• Company: Apple\n\n• Year introduced: 1993\n\n• What it was: Personal digital assistant\n\nWhile the personal digital assistant would become a popular consumer electronics product in the late 1990s, the first PDA was one of the biggest product flops of all time. One year after Apple CEO John Sculley coined the term “PDA” in 1992, the company released the Newton MessagePad. While the device incorporated innovative technology such as a pen-based touch screen and the ability to sync with software on a personal computer, Apple sold only 50,000 units of the product in its first four months on the market. The Newton product line was discontinued in 1998.\n\n3. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\n\n• Company: Atari\n\n• Year introduced: 1982\n\n• What it was: Video game\n\nSeveral video games have failed over the years, but arguably none as spectacularly as \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.\" The video game was developed shortly after the release of Steven Spielberg’s classic film. With only five weeks spent in development – games typically take months, if not years, to program – the game was notoriously difficult and sold miserably. Atari spent $21 million to purchase the rights to the franchise and $5 million on promotion of the game. The company made 4 million copies of the game, but sold only 1.5 million. Atari buried the leftover copies in a landfill.\n\n4. Satisfries\n\n• Company: Burger King\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: French fries\n\nIn 2013, Burger King introduced a new menu item advertised as a healthy alternative to their traditional french fries. Satisfries used a less porous batter, which caused the fry to absorb less oil than regular fries during cooking. While Satisfries were made with a healthier recipe, Burger King failed to convey the difference to customers. The fries were also more expensive than Burger King’s regular french fries, and failed to gain traction with consumers. The company discontinued the fries in 2014, less than a year after they were introduced.\n\n5. Premier smokeless cigarettes\n\n• Company: RJ Reynolds\n\n• Year introduced: 1988\n\n• What it was: Cigarette\n\nR.J. Reynolds, the second largest U.S. tobacco company, began marketing in 1988 a smokeless tobacco product that was intended to be a safer way to use a cigarette. In addition to concerns over the product's actual safety, smokers missed the familiar elements of traditional cigarettes – the smoke, the burn, and the flick. Another issue was the widely-reported unpleasant chemical taste, which one user described as resembling “burning plastic.” Reynolds sunk close to $1 billion into the product before pulling it off the market within a year.\n\n6. Cheetos Lip Balm\n\n• Company: Frito-Lay\n\n• Year introduced: 2005\n\n• What it was: Lip balm\n\nPopular lip balm brands such as Chapstick, Blistex, and Burt’s Bees, have successfully sold their products to Americans for decades. Many prefer such flavored varieties as cherry, mint, and vanilla bean. Not every popular flavor can be successfully turned into a lip balm, however, a lesson PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay learned the hard way in 2005. While Cheetos has been a popular snack for more than six decades, Cheetos-flavored lip balm failed to catch on with consumers.\n\n7. Terra Nova\n\n• Company: Fox\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: TV show\n\nEvery year, TV shows are cancelled before the end of their first season. While Terra Nova, which aired for one 13-episode season, is not unusual in this regard, it may go down as the most costly cancelled television show of all time. Documenting the time-traveling adventures of a 22nd century family fleeing a dystopian society for a prehistoric past, the pilot of the show alone cost Fox between $16 and $20 million to make. Terra Nova encountered numerous production mishaps while filming in Australia, including a flood that nearly killed a crew member. Ratings failed to meet expectations, and the show was not renewed for a second season. Fox is estimated to have spent more than $50 million on the failed show, not including marketing costs.\n\n8. Touch of Yogurt shampoo\n\n• Company: Clairol\n\n• Year introduced: 1979\n\n• What it was: Shampoo\n\nIn keeping with the 1970s trend of incorporating natural food ingredients like lemon, herbs, and honey into beauty and hygiene products, Clairol – at the time a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb – thought a yogurt shampoo was just what the American consumer wanted. It turned out the company had grossly miscalculated. Many consumers were apparently confused as to what they had bought, as there were reported cases of people eating the shampoo.\n\n9. New Coke\n\n• Company: Coca-Cola\n\n• Year introduced: 1985\n\n• What it was: Soft drink\n\nOver the 15 years leading up to 1985, Coca-Cola’s flagship cola drink had been losing market share to Pepsi Cola. To compete, the company changed the drink’s formula for the first time in 99 years – but the move today is considered one of the greatest flops of all time. New Coke was met with public outrage and lasted only a few months. The company reintroduced its older formula, rebranded as Coca-Cola Classic.\n\n10. Windows Vista\n\n• Company: Microsoft\n\n• Year introduced: 2007\n\n• What it was: Operating system\n\nIntroduced in 2007 as a follow-up to Windows XP, the Windows Vista operating system was everything its popular predecessor was not – in all the wrong ways. Panned by customers and IT professionals alike, Vista reduced PC performance and caused a number of internet problems for users. As a result, Dell began offering Windows XP again on new laptops a few short months after Vista was introduced. Windows announced this month that it would no longer provide support for Vista, driving the final nail into the operating system’s coffin.\n\n11. Kitchen Entrees\n\n• Company: Colgate\n\n• Year introduced: 1982\n\n• What it was: Frozen meal\n\nMany of the worst product flops in recent memory were caused by otherwise popular brands wandering too far outside of their area of expertise. Colgate Kitchen Entrees may be the best example of such a product failure. When it came to pre-prepared frozen meals, Americans had plenty of options in the 1980s. Perhaps because consumers naturally associated the Colgate name with toothpaste, there was never much of an appetite for pre-made meals bearing the Colgate logo.\n\n12. Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water\n\n• Company: Coors\n\n• Year introduced: 1990\n\n• What it was: Sparkling water\n\nCoors and Coors Light are two of the most popular beers in the United States. Introducing Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water to the public in 1990, the Coors Brewing Company also sought to capitalize on the fast-growing bottled water segment in the United States. The water was Coors' first non-alcoholic product since Prohibition. The Coors brand name did not help to sell the product, however, as the beer-name branding may have confused or even frightened consumers. Coors let its trademark of Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water expire in 1997.\n\n13. Harley-Davidson perfume\n\n• Company: Harley-Davidson\n\n• Year released: 1994\n\n• What it was: Perfume\n\nHarley-Davidson is one of the most iconic and valuable brands in the world. It is also one of the more masculine brands. The company has not deviated considerably from this fact, although it has tried. The company released Legendary Harley-Davidson, a cologne for men, among several other varieties, starting in 1994. Another perfume, Black Fire, hit the market as recently as 2005. All are now discontinued. In the 1990s, the company released a number of other products, including wine coolers and aftershave, which after failing miserably have also become classic cases of brand overextension.\n\n14. Persil Power\n\n• Holding company: Unilever\n\n• Year released: 1994\n\n• What it was: Stain remover\n\nUnilever introduced Persil Power detergent to the market in 1994. The product utilized a newly patented stain removal formula called Accelerator. The company was so confident in the Accelerator catalyst that it carried out its $300 million introduction of Persil Power without any formal test marketing. Over time, it became clear the detergent was damaging clothes at high temperatures. After nine months on the shelves, the company replaced Persil Power with Persil New Generation, a detergent without the Accelerator compound.\n\n15. Cosmopolitan yogurt\n\n• Company: Cosmopolitan\n\n• Year introduced: 1999\n\n• What it was: Yogurt\n\nCosmopolitan is a popular women’s magazine, full of fashion advice, dating tips, celebrity gossip, and horoscopes. What the magazine’s leadership was thinking when they expanded the brand’s reach from the magazine aisle to the dairy aisle remains a mystery. Few will likely remember the 1999 debut of Cosmopolitan’s yogurt line, as the short-lived product was only available for 18 months. Like many other products on this list, Cosmopolitan yogurt was a case of a brand reaching too far beyond its area of expertise.\n\n16. DH 106 Comet\n\n• Company: De Havilland\n\n• Year introduced: 1949\n\n• What it was: Airplane\n\nWe now take jet travel for granted, but the development of a commercially viable jetliner involved a great deal of trial, error, and some utter failures. De Havilland, a British aircraft manufacturer, developed the Comet, the first commercial jet airliner. Unfortunately, within a few years of its 1949 debut, the Comet encountered several unexplained fatal crashes, including planes overrunning the runway and one exploding in midair. The Comet's reputation plummeted, and while De Havilland scrambled to redesign the plane, American companies Douglas and Boeing took over the industry.\n\n17. DeLorean DMC-12\n\n• Company: Delorean Motor Company\n\n• Year introduced: 1981\n\n• What it was: Sports car\n\nIn 1973, auto executive John DeLorean left General Motors to form the DeLorean Motor Company. After years of production delays, the DeLorean DMC-12 was released in January 1981. The car’s unique design was poorly received, however, and by 1982 less than half of the 7,000 DeLorean units produced had been sold. The DeLorean is widely recognized due to its use as a converted time machine in the “Back to the Future” series. However, the first of these films was released in 1985, far too late to save the ill-fated brand. DeLorean filed for bankruptcy in 1982.\n\n18. EZ Squirt\n\n• Company: Heinz\n\n• Year released: 2000\n\n• Company revenue when released: Ketchup\n\nBefore EZ Squirt, ketchup was always varying shades of red. To cater to kids, who were – and still are – among ketchup’s largest groups of consumers, Heinz began producing purple, green, and blue EZ Squirt ketchup in matching, vibrantly colored squeeze bottles. At first, the colorful ketchup was a huge success. The novelty wore off quickly, however, and not long after its introduction, sales of EZ Squirt began to decline. In January 2006, less than six years after its debut, Heinz halted production of the product.\n\n19. United States Football League\n\n• Company: USFL\n\n• Year introduced: 1982\n\n• What it was: Sports league\n\nConceived as a way to satiate America's appetite for football in the spring and summer months, the United States Football League was introduced in 1982. The league originally consisted of 12 teams, one of which, the New Jersey Generals, was owned by President Donald Trump. The league was beset with problems, not the least of which was finding stadiums to play in. Ultimately, over half a dozen teams folded when the league’s brain trust decided to compete directly with the NFL by scheduling games in the fall. By 1985, the league was finished.\n\n20. Home\n\n• Company: Facebook\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: Mobile phone app\n\nWith rising mobile phone use and social media engagement, Facebook in 2013 decided to launch a family of apps that combine these trends. Facebook Home converts the home screen of a smartphone into the Facebook news feed. While most of Facebook’s over 1 billion users log in to their accounts on a smartphone, the social media giant’s new product never caught on. Early users cited clunky operation, the inability to toggle between Facebook Home and the original phone interface, and lack of options for customization, among other snags.\n\n21. Edsel\n\n• Company: Ford\n\n• Year introduced: 1957\n\n• What it was: Car\n\nFord spent a year aggressively marketing the Edsel – named after Henry Ford’s son – ahead of its 1957 release. It was to be the “car of the future,” made available on dealership lots on what Ford dubbed “E-Day.\" Despite the hype, the car was a commercial disaster. It was considerably overpriced, disappointingly not futuristic, and generally ugly. Ford ceased the car's production after only two years, losing an estimated $350 million.\n\n22. Friendster\n\n• Company: Friendster\n\n• Year introduced: 2002\n\n• What it was: Social media site\n\nSocial media site Facebook is one of the biggest corporate success stories in recent memory. Unfortunately, when it comes to social media, for every success story there is at least one flop – as in the case of Friendster. The site’s users suffered through slow page loading times and the company’s developers failed to scale up when the number of subscribers spiked. Ultimately, competitors such as Facebook provided a much better user experience. Introduced in 2002, Friendster discontinued its services in mid-2015.\n\n23. WOW! Chips\n\n• Company: Frito-Lay\n\n• Year introduced: 1998\n\n• What it was: Snack\n\nPepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay introduced its line of WOW! Chips in 1998. The chips, which were made with the fat substitute olestra, were marketed as a healthy snacking alternative. While WOW! Chips were an initial success with $347 million in sales in their first year – the most of any new product in 1998 – sales slowed when the unpleasant side effects of olestra, such as diarrhea and cramps, became better known. To add to the product’s problems, the Food and Drug Administration instituted labeling requirements for all products containing olestra to carry warnings of “abdominal cramping and loose stools,\" and by 2000, sales of WOW! Chips were roughly 60% of what they were in the year of their release.\n\n24. Zune\n\n• Company: Microsoft\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: MP3 player\n\nIn an attempt to compete with Apple's dominant iPod MP3 player, Microsoft released the Zune in 2006. As of November 15, 2015, Microsoft discontinued all streaming, downloading, and other music services for the Zune. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Microsoft recorded a 42% decline in revenue in its non-gaming devices segment – a decline largely attributable to the Zune’s poor performance. While the device might have been a reasonable choice for consumers, a number of reported bugs did not help sales. On December 31, 2008, most if not all 30GB Zunes stopped functioning simply because the underlying code had failed to account for the extra day in leap years.\n\n25. Relenza\n\n• Company: GlaxoSmithKline\n\n• Year introduced: 1999\n\n• What it was: Influenza pandemic drug\n\nIn 1999, a flu pandemic fear caused by the spread of avian flu created demand for antiviral medications. The FDA approved two flu drugs during the pandemic – Tamiflu and Relenza. The former went on to report massive sales, while the latter became one of the worst product flops in the pharmaceutical industry. The powder form of the drug caused respiratory problems in some patients and was only approved as a treatment for influenza rather than a preventative measure. GlaxoSmithKline sold just $13 million worth of the drug in the first quarter of 2006. By comparison, Roche reported $770 million in Tamiflu sales in the first half of the year.\n\n26. Google+\n\n• Company: Google\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: Social media site\n\nNo all product flops are necessarily discontinued. Sometimes, despite failing to live up to company expectations, they linger. Such was the case with Google+, the social media platform the Silicon Valley giant launched in 2011 to compete with Facebook. However, even with a monumental marketing campaign, Google+ failed to distinguish itself from Facebook and never took off in the same manner. While the site experienced an initial surge in subscribers, by April 2015, Google+ had experienced a 98% decline in user engagement. In April 2019 Google+ was shut down for good.\n\n27. HP Touchpad\n\n• Company: Hewlett-Packard\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: Tablet computer\n\nThe TouchPad was Hewlett Packard’s attempt to compete with Apple’s wildly successful iPad. Hewlett Packard unveiled the device in the middle of 2011 with an extremely costly advertising campaign. The rollout incorporated numerous celebrity contracts. By late summer, however, box stores such as Best Buy were sitting on excess inventory, and HP began offering steep discounts. Many discounted TouchPads were sold at a loss, and it is estimated the company lost hundreds of millions on the product in all.\n\n28. Kellogg's Breakfast Mates\n\n• Company: Kellogg's\n\n• Year introduced: 1998\n\n• What it was: Breakfast food\n\nIn 1998, Kellogg’s introduced Breakfast Mates, an all-in-one package containing a serving of cereal, a small carton of milk, and a plastic spoon. The product was designed as a time saver that would appeal to busy families with two working parents. The stated convenience of the all-in-one packaging did little to save time, largely because traditional cereal is already relatively convenient to consume. In a controlled test reported by The New York Times, preparing a bowl of cereal the traditional way took only one second longer than preparing a bowl of Breakfast Mates. To make matters worse, the product’s $30 million ad campaign sent a mixed message, depicting a family eating the supposedly portable cereal around the kitchen table. In August 1999, Kellogg’s announced Breakfast Mates would be discontinued due to low sales.\n\n29. Maxwell House Brewed Coffee\n\n• Company: Maxwell House\n\n• Year introduced: 1990\n\n• What it was: Coffee\n\nMaxwell House Brewed Coffee was pre-brewed coffee sold in a carton with a picture of a hot mug of coffee on the packaging, a misleading visual cue for a product meant to be stored in the refrigerator. Adding to the product’s issues, the carton was lined with foil and could not be microwaved. For a product marketed for its convenience, this was an especially problematic feature for consumers. The product was discontinued shortly after it was released.\n\n30. Arch Deluxe\n\n• Company: McDonald's\n\n• Year introduced: 1996\n\n• What it was: Hamburger\n\nMcDonald’s introduced several failed products throughout its 60-year history, but none so monumental as the Arch Deluxe. Introduced in 1996, the Arch Deluxe was marketed as a more gastronomic hamburger with “a grown-up taste.\" One commercial featured a child unable to enjoy the sophisticated burger, stripping its toppings to satisfy his unrefined palate. The Arch Deluxe’s advertising budget was an estimated $200 million, the most of any fast food product at the time. However, the approach failed and sales of the Arch Deluxe missed the $1 billion expectation set for its first year. The Arch Deluxe was eventually discontinued.\n\n31. HD DVD\n\n• Company: Toshiba\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc’s succession of the DVD was not preordained. Before Blu-ray was the dominant medium for video playback, it was competing with Toshiba’s HD DVD. Essentially the same product, HD DVD was effectively taken out to pasture when in January 2008, Warner Bros. announced it would only support Sony’s Blu-ray format. Toshiba was not the only loser in the battle against Blu-ray. Millions of Americans found themselves stuck with HD DVD players and laptops after the dust settled.\n\n32. Microsoft Bob\n\n• Company: Microsoft\n\n• Year introduced: 1995\n\n• What it was: User interface\n\nMicrosoft released Microsoft Bob in March 1995. Intended as a simple, easy-to-use OS interface at the time, Bob presented the desktop as a house, with familiar objects corresponding with different computer applications. Clicking on the stationary lying on a desk, for example, opened the word processor. Despite its simple appearance, Bob required more processing power than most home computers had in 1995. Bob was also considered too expensive and poorly designed, and was overshadowed by the release of Windows 95 later that year. Bob was discontinued roughly a year after its release.\n\n33. 47 Ronin\n\n• Company: Universal Pictures\n\n• Year introduced: 2013\n\n• What it was: Movie\n\nThe 2013 fantasy action film “47 Ronin”, starring Keanu Reeves, is now notorious as one of the biggest box office flops of all time. The movie lost nearly $150 million on a $225 million budget and left Universal Pictures in the red for the fiscal year. Insiders point to multiple rewrites of the screenplay as well as several post-production changes that were made as filmmakers and studio executives attempted to find creative balance while appeasing moviegoers. In the end, the film failed to strike a chord with audiences and critics alike.\n\n34. Qwikster\n\n• Company: Netflix\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: DVD rental service\n\nBefore Netflix became the media streaming giant we know today, it was exclusively a deliver-by-mail DVD rental service. In an ill-conceived strategy, CEO Reed Hastings announced in September 2011 the company's plan to spin off its DVD rental service into a separate company, known as Qwikster. The move, which was meant to allow Netflix to focus more on its streaming services, would have cost consumers about 60% more if they wished to continue to have access to both services. Unpopular with customers and widely criticized, Hastings scrapped the plan less than a month after it was announced.\n\n35. Virtual Boy\n\n• Company: Nintendo\n\n• Year introduced: 1995\n\n• What it was: Portable game console\n\nVirtual Boy was game console maker Nintendo’s early foray into virtual reality technology. However, the company discontinued the portable console less than a year after its 1995 release, selling just 770,000 units globally. It is known as one of the company’s worst failures. To cut costs and reduce battery drain, Nintendo used only black and red shades in Virtual Boy games, which bothered some users. Using the Virtual Boy also caused eye strain in some users, which led Nintendo to include an automatic shutoff mechanism.\n\n36. MeeGo\n\n• Company: Nokia/Intel\n\n• Year introduced: 2010\n\n• What it was: Operating system\n\nUnlike Windows Vista, another operating system on this list, smartphone OS MeeGo was not necessarily a flawed product. By most accounts, the MeeGo operating system just came at the wrong time. Not long after its introduction, the operating system was dropped by then Nokia CEO Stephen Elop in favor of Windows Phone 7 operating system. Though it has not been used in years, MeeGo may find a second life as a tablet operating system.\n\n37. Crystal Pepsi\n\n• Company: Pepsi\n\n• Year introduced: 1992\n\n• What it was: Soda\n\nCrystal Pepsi was introduced to soda lovers across the United States in 1992. The product tasted like regular cola but was clear and caffeine free in an attempt to convey purity and heath. Crystal Pepsi was heavily promoted, with the company even buying an ad slot during Super Bowl XXVII. Despite strong initial sales, the public’s interest quickly waned and the soda was discontinued less than two years after its release.\n\n38. Hot Wheels and Barbie computers\n\n• Company: Mattel / Patriot Computers\n\n• Year released: 1999\n\n• What it was: Toy computer\n\nIn 1999, Mattel announced that it had entered a licensing agreement to sell Barbie and Hot Wheels computers. The computers would be manufactured and sold by the Patriot Computer Corporation, a privately held company based in Toronto. The move was part of an attempt to reconcile the declining sales of Barbie dolls and growing sales of software and CD-ROMs.\n\nThe computers, however, had many manufacturing flaws, and the resources Patriot devoted to fixing and replacing broken computers drove it out of business. By December the following year, the company had fired its 200 employees and filed for bankruptcy.\n\n39. LaserDisc\n\n• Company: Phillips\n\n• Year introduced: 1978\n\n• What it was: Media storage/playback device\n\nLaserDisc was effectively a precursor to the DVD, offering consumers a higher quality picture and sound than VHS tapes. The product’s numerous drawbacks, however, outweighed any benefits. Unlike VHS players, LaserDisc players could not record television shows – an important feature before the days of TiVo. LaserDisc players, as well as LaserDiscs themselves, were also relatively expensive. Introduced in the 1970s, LaserDisc made a brief comeback in the 90s, but ultimately failed to gain traction.\n\n40. Dreamcast\n\n• Company: Sega\n\n• Year introduced: 1999 (North America)\n\n• What it was: Game console\n\nIn the 1990s, Sega was a dominant player in the consoles and games business. Sega had such success with its Sonic the Hedgehog games and Genesis console, that at one point the company held 60% of the North American market. The Dreamcast launched in 1999 in North America, within a few years of successful predecessors like the Nintendo 64 and Sony Playstation. Many consider the Dreamcast to have been ahead of its time – it was the first console to introduce worldwide network compatibility – but the system just never caught on. Dreamcast sold miserably and was discontinued after just over two years, in part due to the success of the PS2, which launched in 2000. While it was not Sega’s only failure, it may have been its most colossal, marking the end of the company’s attempts at game consoles.\n\n41. S&W Mountain Bikes\n\n• Company: Smith & Wesson\n\n• Year introduced: 2002\n\n• What it was: Mountain bike\n\nGun manufacturer Smith & Wesson has been making police bicycles for about 20 years. The company also attempted to sell mountain bikes to the general public in 2002. Like many other products on this list, the company’s consumer bike segment likely failed because bicycles were too far beyond the scope of the Smith & Wesson brand and what most Americans associate with it.\n\n42. Lisa\n\n• Company: Apple\n\n• Year introduced: 1983\n\n• What it was: Personal computer\n\nBefore Apple hit its stride in the 2000s and became the most profitable corporation in history, the company was responsible for some of the worst product flops of all time. Designed as a high-end personal computer with a graphical user interface for business customers, the Apple Lisa took three years and $50 million to develop before its release in 1983. However, the computer’s $9,995 price tag, which is equivalent to roughly $25,000 today, was too high for many consumers. After selling just 100,000 units in two years Apple discontinued the Lisa in 1985.\n\n43. Betamax\n\n• Company: Sony\n\n• Year introduced: 1975\n\n• What it was: Videocassette format\n\nIn the early 1970s, videotapes were still a novel technology, and the VHS tape had yet to become the standard videocassette format. Sony introduced the Betamax format in 1975, one year before JVC introduced the VHS tape. While Betamax tapes had superior resolution and sound quality, Sony refrained from licensing its technology to other manufacturers, in turn limiting the variety of movies available on the format. Meanwhile, JVC licensed its VHS technology to any interested manufacturer. The Betamax’s share of the VCR market fell from 100% in 1975 to 10% in 1988, and continued to dwindle in the following years.\n\n44. Too Human\n\n• Company: Silicon Knights\n\n• Year introduced: 2008\n\n• What it was: Video game\n\nReleased in 2008 after years of costly development delays, “Too Human” failed to live up to expectations and became one of the worst flops in video game history. A legal ruling eventually removed the game from the marketplace and pushed Silicon Knights, the game’s developer, into bankruptcy. The game’s production budget skyrocketed to an estimated $100 million after the game engine developer, Epic Games, failed to deliver the engine on time, forcing Silicon Knights to build it own game engine. When Silicon Knights sued Epic Games for missing the deadline, the latter counter-sued, which resulted in a court order forcing the developer to destroy all unsold copies of the game.\n\n45. Mobile ESPN\n\n• Company: ESPN\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: Mobile phone service\n\nIn 2006, ESPN attempted to capitalize on the desire of sports fan to have access to sports stats, scores, and video on the go. Mobile ESPN required users to buy a specific phone, which would include access to ESPN content as part of the subscription. However, the only phone Mobile ESPN offered, a Sanyo, cost $400, and the service was $40 per month, too rich for many sports fans. The service shut down within a year. Disney, ESPN’s parent company, spent $150 million on the failed venture.\n\n46. Life Savers soda\n\n• Company: Life Savers\n\n• Year introduced: 1995\n\n• What it was: Soft drink\n\nThough Life Savers soda tested well in focus groups, it failed to gain traction with the broader consumer market. Many attribute the soft drink’s failure to the prevailing perception that it was liquid candy. The soda was available in some of the candy’s popular fruit flavors, including pineapple, orange punch, grape punch, and lime punch. Life Savers did not release a mint-flavored soda, however.\n\n47. Mars Needs Moms\n\n• Company: Walt Disney Motion\n\n• Year introduced: 2011\n\n• What it was: Studio film\n\nReleased in March 2011, Disney’s “Mars Needs Moms” grossed just $6.9 million in its opening weekend. Produced with a $150 million budget, “Mars Needs Moms” was one of the worst flops in cinema history. Film critics partially blame animation studio ImageMovers Digital for the film’s box office failure. The movie was animated using an expensive motion-capture process, a technology still in its infancy. According to one viewer, “The movie looked downright creepy.” ImageMovers Digital was closed after the studio wrapped production on the film.\n\n48. EONS\n\n• Company: Eons.com\n\n• Year introduced: 2006\n\n• What it was: Social media site\n\nIn July 2006, Monster.com founder Jeff Taylor launched Eons.com – a social network for baby boomers and other internet users over the age of 50. According to surveys conducted by Pew Research Center, an estimated 32% of seniors over the age of 65 used the internet at the time of the website’s launch compared to 86% of young adults aged 18 to 29. While the share of seniors on the internet has doubled over the past decade, Eons failed to gain traction and was sold to Crew Media in 2011.\n\n49. Supertrain\n\n• Company: NBC\n\n• Year introduced: 1979\n\n• What it was: TV show\n\nWhen NBC’s “Supertrain” premiered in 1979, it was the most expensive TV series ever aired. Set aboard a nuclear-powered train that travels between New York City and Los Angeles at speeds nearing 200 miles an hour, the show’s production required a model train set that cost around $3 million in today’s dollars. The model crashed during its first demonstration, and the show as a whole soon followed. Debuting to poor ratings and negative reviews, “Supertrain” was cancelled after just nine episodes.\n\n50. Galaxy Note 7\n\n• Company: Samsung\n\n• Year introduced: 2016\n\n• What it was: Tablet phone\n\nSamsung, which has overtaken Apple in the smartphone market last year, also had one of more recent product flops. The Note S7, a phablet that launched in August 2016, was initially well-received. However, it had a serious flaw. A problem with the battery software resulted in the phones catching fire on several occasions, including once on a Southwest Airlines flight, which had to be evacuated. Soon, the Department of Transportation made it illegal to bring a Note 7 on a commercial flight. By October, after an extremely expensive recall, Samsung suspended worldwide production of the Note 7. The company lost what is estimated to be over $3 billion due to the debacle, and Apple once again took the lead in the global smartphone market earlier this year.\n\nPrice, timing can cause product failings\n\nHindsight is 20/20, and while many of these gaffes might not have been predictable at the time, the reasons for their failure are often much clearer today. The reasons for the failures often fall into one of a several categories: overpricing, timing, bad advertising, product flaws, and reaching beyond what consumers of a brand are willing to accept.\n\nSometimes products are sold at a premium because they offer features competitors do not, either perceived or actual. When customers do not feel a product is superior to another – rightly so or not – they will not pay the premium price. While Apple is able to sell computers at a premium today because of its brand perception, the Lisa, introduced in 1983, failed largely as a result of its nearly $10,000 price tag.\n\nMany of the products on this list could have been perfectly viable, possibly even a hit, if they had been introduced at a different time. Sega’s Dreamcast was the first major console to introduce global network connectivity, but this was before every home had a stable connection fast enough to make the Dreamcast viable at the time.\n\nFor some flops on this list, it appears poor market research doomed these products. McDonald’s Arch Deluxe was marketed as a burger for those with refined palates, turning away kids, as well as many adults, from the ill-fated item. Coca-Cola completely misjudged the desire of its customers when it changed its classic flavor and introduced New Coke.\n\nSometimes, brands overextend their reach, introducing products that clash with their image and target demographics. One does not need to dig too deep to understand why Colgate, a brand associated with toothpaste, failed to make its line of frozen dinner products a success. The same can be said for Cosmopolitan’s brand of yogurt, Smith & Wesson’s mountain bike line, or Harley Davidson’s perfume.\n\nOf course, many of the products on this list were simply poorly designed or faulty – at times downright dangerous. Such was the case with Mattel’s line of seriously flawed Hot Wheels and Barbie computers, or the Galaxy Note 7, plagued by battery fires that caused the phone to be banned on airplanes, recalled, and eventually discontinued.\n\nDespite their disappointing launches, some of these products still exist today. Google’s Glass and Google+ each became the butt of jokes after failing to live up to lofty promises. One day, we may see one of these flops become the product it was meant to be.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}]}

Visitors, homeless people and commuters clutching cups of iced coffee crammed the street. Nearby, pedestrians dodged yellow cabs, double-decker tour buses and electric bicycles.\n\n“Where did all these people come from?” Flores, a 27-year-old undocumented immigrant from Venezuela, remembered thinking last month upon seeing New York up close for the first time. “It was different from everything we saw on the way here.”\n\nIndeed, a wave of undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers arriving in New York in recent months – fleeing economic insecurity and political upheaval in Central and South America – have seen much during their months-long journey across more than a half dozen countries. They have traversed a remote, lawless jungle and rugged mountains, at times passing the corpses of others who perished along the way. They described roadblocks manned by rogue police officials or members of criminal and paramilitary groups who extorted money from them.\n\nAsylum seekers arrived to New York City's Port Authority station by the busload last month. NYC Immigrant Affairs\n\nHungry and tired, they reached the southern border and crossed into the United States, in Texas and other states on the Mexican frontier. After processing and receiving dates for asylum hearings, they were released by immigration officials to local charities and, in some cases, offered free trips to New York.\n\nThousands have chosen the Texas-chartered buses to New York City and the nation’s capital – where they have no connections or know where to turn for help. Many, like Flores and her family, ended up in New York’s overburdened shelter system, embarking on yet another uncertain odyssey as the newest members of the ever burgeoning homeless population.\n\n“A social worker at a Texas shelter told us there were free buses to New York,” Flores said on the phone from a city-run shelter for families in the Bronx. “We got on the next one and here we are.”\n\nNYC makes new arrivals ‘our priority’\n\nBy the last week in August, Texas had bused nearly 9,000 migrants to New York City and Washington, DC, as Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has sought to highlight what he said is the Biden administration’s failure to secure the border.\n\nTexas reported on August 26 that more than 7,400 migrants had been transported by the state to DC since April, and more than 1,500 to New York City since August 5, providing what Abbott’s office termed “much-needed relief to our overwhelmed border communities.”\n\nAbbott’s office did not immediately reply to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nOn Friday morning, three buses from Texas delivered another 110 migrants to New York, city officials said.\n\nTexas has spent more than $12 million busing migrants to Washington and New York as of August 9, according to figures from the Texas Division of Emergency Management. Abbott’s office has said migrants are transported out of state only with their written permission but it’s unclear whether they’re given other options.\n\nAbbott and others who favor increasing immigration restrictions argue that Biden administration policies have provided an incentive for more people to cross the border illegally. Some Republican candidates have pushed the narrative of a migrant invasion as midterm elections approach, pledging they’ll do more to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nOn Wednesday, Abbott added Chicago to the list of cities where his administration is busing migrants.\n\n“President Biden’s inaction at our southern border continues putting the lives of Texans — and Americans — at risk and is overwhelming our communities,” Abbott said in a statement.\n\nChicago received 75 Venezuelan migrants from Texas – who were dropped off at Union Station Wednesday night, according to Mayor Lori Lightfoot. She called Abbott “a man without any morals, humanity or shame.”\n\n“This is not something that we budgeted for, but it’s something that we must do. So we will figure out the finances,” Lightfoot said Thursday, adding that more buses were expected.\n\nManuel Castro greets migrants exiting a bus from Texas at the Port Authority on August 30. Castro himself crossed the US-Mexico border with his mother when he was 5. Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nNew York City has processed about 8,800 migrants in its shelter system since April, with about 6,700 still in shelters, a city official told CNN Thursday. City officials had said the figure included more than 1,000 children. Many migrants come to New York on their own with the financial assistance of nonprofits.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Abbott’s actions are throwing the federal system for processing migrants “out of whack” and criticized the governor for not coordinating with federal authorities.\n\nGenerally, migrants are processed by authorities, released and allowed to move throughout the US while they await immigration court proceedings. They are often released in Texas and other border states, and make their way to other parts of the country.\n\nThe busing campaign has led to sparring between Abbott and New York Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat whose administration has accused the governor of using human beings as political pawns and whose city has been long considered a sanctuary for migrants. The mayor has asked the federal government for more resources, including housing assistance. The White House said it is in touch with Adams and committed to FEMA funding and other support.\n\n“These individuals and families arrive hungry, thirsty and some need medical attention,” Manuel Castro, Commissioner of the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, told CNN Tuesday. “So that is our priority – to make sure that these people are being supported and in comfort because what they’ve been through is just so devastating.”\n\nCastro himself crossed the US-Mexico border with his mother when he was 5. He has been greeting migrants at the much maligned Port Authority terminal, a notorious commuter gateway once called “a hall of unfathomable nightmares” by the website Failed Architecture.\n\nA quest to give them their ‘humanity back’\n\nWhile city officials say they were initially caught off guard with the almost daily, unannounced arrival of charters, they mobilized – with the help of nonprofits – to set up a sectioned-off receiving area at the terminal. The migrants receive medical attention and rapid Covid-19 tests, food, clothing, prepaid phones, toiletries, legal assistance and transportation to temporary shelter. Many arrive without money, with just the clothes on their backs.\n\n“We know the trauma these families are going through but this is extra what’s happening here,” said Jose Lopez, co-executive director of the immigrant advocacy group Make the Road New York.\n\nThe nonprofit has volunteers at the terminal, distributing phones and cash assistance at tables set up in the receiving area.\n\n“Many of these families from Venezuela have traveled months on their feet and across the Rio Grande to get here. That is a treacherous trip. And imagine doing that with a three-year-old,” Lopez said.\n\n“I have a two-year-old and a five-year-old at home and the first family I met had a three-year-old girl who just looked around and had no understanding of what was happening. I needed to step away from the table for a minute. Her family was asking for resources. I asked the little girl what she had picked up from the tables. She said, ‘I just have Mami and Papi.’ ”\n\nLast week, at 6:45 a.m. on Thursday, the first two buses of the day pulled up alongside the terminal, one block west of Times Square, the so-called “Crossroads of the World.” Castro and community activists greeted passengers outside the buses with handshakes and applause – a procession of children covered in blankets, mothers clutching toddlers, and young men carrying backpacks and wearing flip flops. One man needed a wheelchair to get inside. Another migrant was taken away in an ambulance.\n\n“Dozens of volunteers … show up early in the morning and try to give those asylum seekers their humanity back,” said Alexander Rapaport, a founder of Masbia, a Jewish nonprofit that provides meals for the new arrivals.\n\nMost migrants end up in the city’s overcrowded homeless shelter system, which housed more than 50,000 people as of Thursday night, according to the nonprofit Coalition for the Homeless, which monitors shelter census reports. Some wait hours to be reunited with relatives who live in the area. Others, looking confused and disappointed, tell volunteers they believed they were headed to another city or state. New York is using 17 hotels as emergency shelters, a city official told CNN.\n\nFor now, the migrants will have to rely on a vast, longstanding social safety net created by nonprofits and city agencies, easing access to government resources and benefits for housing, healthcare and food.\n\n‘We could not stay there’\n\nA bus carrying migrants who crossed the border from Mexico into Texas arrives at the Port Authority bus station in Manhattan on August 25. Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nFlores and her family have been staying at a crowded family shelter in the Bronx, where, she said, the language barrier makes it difficult to communicate with staff and residents.\n\nWhen they arrived in Texas last month, she said, they were released without money and no place to go. A social worker at a church-run shelter offered them free bus tickets to New York.\n\nThe family left Maracaibo, on Venezuela’s northwest coast, on May 18.\n\n“We were going hungry,” she said. “We could not stay there. There is nothing. If you get sick, you die… There is no future there. The future is here.”\n\nFlores and other migrants described the days it took to cross the Darién Gap, the more than 60 miles of dense rain forest, steep mountains and swamps along the Colombia-Panama border. It is one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world.\n\n“We spent seven days in the jungle with another family,” Flores said. “A guide abandoned us but we were fortunate to make our way out.”\n\nBy the time Flores’ family reached the northern Mexican city of Piedras Negras, across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas, she said they were exhausted, hungry and penniless – having paid hundreds of dollars at roadblocks from Guatemala to Mexico.\n\nLast Thursday, Venezuelan asylum seekers Manaure Fernandez, 25, and Wilber Salvatierra, 23, emerged from the bus terminal with plastic bags after stepping off a Greyhound bus from San Antonio. A charity had paid for the $270 bus fare, they said.\n\nMigrants wait in line last month outside the Port Authority after arriving from Texas. Yuki Iwamura/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFernandez said he left Venezuela in late May. He was robbed of all his money in the Darién Gap – about $800 – by three masked armed with rifles. The men told the migrants said they were part of a paramilitary group. Fernandez said he walked most of the way to the US border – a journey of roughly 2,500 miles over Central America alone.\n\n“On foot I crossed Costa Rica, Nicaragua, parts of Guatemala and parts of México,” he said. “Sometimes people helped with food and cash.”\n\n“There were many good people along the way,” said Salvatierra. “In Panama, people stopped on the road and gave us food and water. They said they could not take us because they could be jailed for transporting migrants.”\n\nSalvatierra said he had migrated to Chile in 2018, supporting himself as well as his parents back home by working construction jobs. He raised about $1,400 and decided to head north in late June.\n\n“The money ran out by the time I got to Guatemala,” said Salvatierra, who clutched a miniature copy of the New Testament.\n\n“It was always in my hand,” he said the small book. “I’m not religious but I have faith. I carried it from Chile to Peru, from Ecuador to Colombia, across the Darien and Panama, from Costa Rica to Nicaragua, from Honduras to Guatemala and Mexico.”\n\nThe two migrants, who met in Texas, and others said they encountered bodies along desolate stretches of the Darién Gap. Those who were injured or ill were usually left behind to die, they said.\n\n“We embarked across the Darién with a total 339 people,” Salvatierra said. “About 230 reached Panama. Many died. We saw bodies … on the side of rivers. A friend traveling with his young son said he could not stop thinking of a dead child he saw.”\n\nFernandez and Salvatierra, standing under the glittering billboards near Times Square, asked a stranger if he knew of available jobs in the city. They’re staying at the intake shelter for single adult men in Manhattan until beds can be found in a longer-term facility.\n\n“We’re fortunate to have made it this far,” said Salvatierra, clutching his New Testament and court papers for his first immigration hearing next month, “even if we don’t have anyone here.”", "authors": ["Ray Sanchez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/01/13/homelessness-us-more-tent-cities-banned/11024116002/", "title": "More cities and states make homeless encampments a crime ...", "text": "As the number of people experiencing homelessness increases across the country, more cities and states have passed laws making it illegal to live out of tents and cars or sleep in public spaces.\n\nMore than 100 jurisdictions have had such bans on the books for years, according to the National Homelessness Law Center. In recent months, high-profile measures have been approved targeting homelessness in many western U.S. cities and across entire states.\n\nFederal data shows 582,462 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2022. Experts warn more people will enter homelessness as housing costs increase, as has been the case for decades in cities such as New York and in much of California.\n\nIf visible, unsheltered homelessness continues to grow, city leaders will have an easier time passing measures advocates say criminalize basic needs such as sleep and sheltering oneself, Eric Tars, legal director for the National Homelessness Law Center, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"The danger is that the worse the housing situation gets, the more people we see on the streets, the more will be the push for these punitive policies,\" Tars said.\n\nThese states and cities have passed laws making it illegal to live in tents or sleep on public property:\n\nMissouri bans sleeping in parks\n\nOn Jan. 1, a statewide ban on sleeping on state-owned land took effect in Missouri, making it a misdemeanor to sleep in public spaces such as parks or under bridges.\n\nExperts say Missouri's law is concerning because it covers the state and adds pressure on top of municipal bans.\n\nIt's wrong to assume people experiencing homelessness can just leave and go to another state, Tars said.\n\nPeople have an \"assumption\" that \"homeless people are infinitely mobile and they’ll go somewhere else,\" Tars said. \"But most people, contrary to this notion of vagrancy and transience, are homeless in the community where they were once housed.\"\n\nMissouri's law also restricts state funding for permanent housing, a model taken from template legislation created by the conservative Cicero Institute, according to Stateline, the Pew Charitable Trusts news service.\n\n\"To take funding away from housing that has the appropriate resources attached to it is devastating, problematic and perpetuates the issue of homelessness,\" said Kathy Connors, executive director of Gateway180 shelter in St. Louis. She added that people experiencing homelessness who are displaced from rural areas are forced to seek temporary services available only in cities, which is straining the system.\n\nTennessee makes it a felony to live in a tent\n\nIn July, Tennessee became the first state to make it a felony to live in a tent or sleep on state land.\n\nStatewide bans have been introduced in recent years by legislators in five other states, Pew says.\n\n\"Policies like this are making homelessness worse,\" Tars said, because arrest, jail time and a criminal record put up steep barriers to employment, securing an apartment and accessing social services.\n\nPortland, Oregon, bans tent living\n\nThe City Council in Portland, Oregon, voted in November to approve a plan to ban living in tents and will shift people living in encampments into six city-sanctioned mass encampment sites capped at 250 people.\n\nThe measure includes plans to build 20,000 additional affordable housing units and eventually would require everyone living on the streets to move into shelters, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon sent the Portland City Council a letter warning the new measure could be unlawful. Last month, the civil rights group sued the city of Phoenix over a similar ban, resulting in a temporary block from a federal judge.\n\nOregon's recently elected Gov. Tina Kotek started her term this week by declaring a state of emergency for parts of the state that have seen huge increases in unsheltered homelessness, including Portland.\n\nWashoe County, Nevada, considers bans\n\nIn December, Washoe County Commissioners in Nevada voted 3-2 to consider an ordinance to ban camping in tents or vehicles and storing personal items in public when it poses \"significant harm to any person, or public area.\" Violators could be charged with a misdemeanor or a $500 fine. Within the county, Reno and Sparks already had similar ordinances in place.\n\nIn 2021, 25% of young people experiencing homelessness served by the Eddy House shelter in Reno lived on the streets, CEO Trevor Macaluso told USA TODAY. He added that people displaced by sweeps in Reno and Sparks usually relocate their encampment somewhere else in the city, which makes the bans ineffective.\n\nLos Angeles bans some homeless tent cities\n\nA City Council-approved ban on tent living in certain areas was expanded in August 2022 to prohibit encampments within 500 feet of schools and day care centers after teachers and parents complained students couldn't access nearby sidewalks.\n\nSchool administrators have said the ban isn't always enforced by the city and police, according to EdSource, an outlet covering education in California.\n\nMore recently, the mayors of Los Angeles and Long Beach and Los Angeles County declared states of emergency over the homeless crisis aimed at speeding up services to reduce and prevent homelessness.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/07/20/florida-elections-what-you-need-know-how-vote-under-new-desantis-election-law/10086583002/", "title": "Florida new election law: Drop boxes, absentee rules, here's how to ...", "text": "We're heading into Florida's 2022 election season and you might be forgiven if you're not quite sure how to go about it.\n\nLast year, after Gov. Ron DeSantis previously declared the 2020 election was the “smoothest and most successful election of any state,” he nonetheless called for a new bill adding numerous restrictions to the voting process with the stated goal of making state and local elections more secure.\n\nThe first bill (SB 90) requires more information to update existing voter registrations, doubles how often vote-by-mail (absentee) ballots must be requested, limits who can collect and drop off ballots, limits where and when drop boxes may be used, adds required language for non-government groups running voter registration drives and drastically increases potential fines for deadline violations, and expands the no-solicitation zone for polling places. It also prohibits local and state officials from using outside funding for election-related expenses, even during emergencies. The first bill passed along partisan lines and DeSantis signed it live on FOX News.\n\nThe law was immediately challenged in court by the Florida League of Women Voters, NAACP and other plaintiffs. A federal judge struck down parts of the law in March as being unconstitutional and discriminatory against Black voters.\n\nBut an appeals court issued a stay of the judge's ruling in May, keeping the law in place for the upcoming elections. Arguments in the case are scheduled to take place in September, before a panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nWalker's ruling:Federal judge rules Florida lawmakers intentionally discriminated against Black voters\n\nA 'grotesque history':Key excerpts in judge's scathing ruling on new Florida voting law\n\nIn April, DeSantis signed SB 524 to create a new security office to investigate claims of voter fraud, and to increase penalties for anyone violating state election laws. The new law also took aim at so-called \"ballot harvesting,\" making it a felony, and required election officials to update (and potentially purge) voter rolls annually\n\nSo what has changed?\n\nFor many Floridians, not much. For some, quite a lot. Here's what you need to know to cast a vote in the Sunshine State.\n\n'Integrity and transparency':DeSantis signs controversial Florida election law with 2022 looming\n\nWho can vote in Florida?\n\nAny Florida resident who is a citizen of the United States, 18 and older, who has not been adjudicated mentally incapacitated with respect to voting in any state without having the right restored and has not been convicted of a felony without civil rights being restored.\n\nDoes Florida require an ID to vote?\n\nYes, you must provide a current and valid ID with a photo and signature. Any one of the following is acceptable:\n\nFlorida driver’s license\n\nFlorida identification card issued by the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles\n\nUnited States passport\n\nDebit or credit card\n\nMilitary identification\n\nStudent identification\n\nRetirement center identification\n\nNeighborhood association identification\n\nPublic assistance identification\n\nVeteran health identification card issued by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs\n\nLicense to carry a concealed weapon or firearm issued pursuant to s. 790.06\n\nEmployee identification card issued by any branch, department, agency, or entity of the Federal Government, the state, a county, or a municipality.\n\nIf you don't have valid ID you still will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot, which will be counted provided you are eligible to vote, you voted in the correct precinct, and your signature matches the one on file.\n\nWhat time are the polls open in Florida?\n\nThe polls are open on Election Day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. in whatever time zone you live in. Any voters still in line at 7 p.m. will be permitted to cast a ballot however long it takes.\n\nHow do I find my polling place?\n\nIt's listed on your voter registration card, or you can look it up at your county's Supervisor of Elections website. Here's how to find yours.\n\nCan I vote by mail in Florida?\n\nYes. You do not have to provide a reason and there are no eligibility requirements. Vote-by-mail (or absentee) ballots must be completed and received by election officials by 7 p.m. on Election Day. Be sure to follow the instructions on the envelope; missing signatures can get your ballot delayed or thrown out.\n\nWHAT'S CHANGED: You'll have to request them twice as often. Before, you could request mail ballots through the next two general elections (the next four years). Now you must request them every time.\n\nAlso, when you request a mail ballot you must provide your driver's license number, a state-issued ID or the last four digits of your Social Security number, whatever matches what's in your records, as opposed to simply providing your birthday or signature. This may cause problems for older people who registered long enough ago that such documents are not on file. There is also no alternative given if you don't have either number.\n\nIn Duval County about 33,000 voters were notified by mail they had to update their records to get a mail-in ballot. This information is also necessary if they wish to switch party registration or change an address by going online or over the phone.\n\nElections officials in Florida are now prohibited from sending out unrequested vote-by-mail ballots. No Florida officials actually did this, but officials in other states have. During the height of the pandemic, some election officials sent out ballots to help voters who wanted to stay distanced. California sends mail ballots to all registered voters in all elections.\n\nElection security:As GOP looks to restrict Florida mail ballots, advocates unveil report that process worked\n\nCan I vote by drop box in Florida?\n\nYes.\n\nWHAT'S CHANGED: The convenience and, in some cases, the possibility.\n\nDrop boxes are secure metal boxes where you can slip your sealed ballot like mailing a letter. Previously these were placed at various places around the state for 24/7 use and monitored by elections workers, video surveillance or law enforcement personnel.\n\nNow drop boxes may only be at the Supervisor of Election's office or outside early voting sites, open only during early voting hours, and monitored at all times, in person, by an election worker. Apart from the Supervisor of Election's dropbox, all the others will be limited to 8-12 hours a day.\n\nWithout the option of video surveillance or other monitoring besides an elections worker, a supervisor may face a fine of $25,000 if that person takes a bathroom break during official hours so extra manpower will be required for each one.\n\nDrop boxes will now likely be fewer in number, in fewer locations, only open for a limited time during the day, and will close the third day before an election.\n\nIt's estimated that about 1.5 million Floridians used drop boxes during the 2020 general election.\n\nNo more 'drop boxes':Voting drop boxes are now called 'secure ballot intake stations:' New language will cost taxpayers\n\nDoes Florida allow early voting?\n\nYes. Early voting, when you can go to a designated place before Election Day and vote just as you would on Election Day, is required for any election that includes a state or federal office race. The same requirements and eligibility apply.\n\nWhen are the 2022 elections in Florida?\n\nFlorida's next State Primary Election will be held Tuesday, August 23, 2022. The deadline to register to vote in the primary is Monday, July 25. The deadline to request a vote-by-mail ballot is Saturday, August 13.\n\nThe State General Election will be Tuesday, November 8, 2022. The deadline to register to vote in the general election is Tuesday, October 11. The deadline to request a vote-by-mail ballot is Saturday, October 29.\n\nWhen is early voting in Florida?\n\nThe early voting period must start on at least the 10th day before the election and end on the third day before the election for a minimum of eight days of early voting, although Supervisors of Elections may expand that if desired. Early voting hours may run from eight to 12 hours per day for each site.\n\nEarly voting may be provided for elections without state or federal races, at the supervisor's discretion.\n\nCan someone drop off my ballot for me in Florida?\n\nYes.\n\nWHAT'S CHANGED: They can't drop off very many. The new law restricts the number of signed, sealed ballots one person may possess to two besides their own, except immediate family members, and makes violation of this a felony.\n\nBallot collection, criticized as ballot harvesting, is where a voter fills out an absentee ballot, seals it with all the required security checks, and hands it to another person to mail it in or drop it off at an authorized location on their behalf.\n\nCriminalizing the practice largely affects third-party, get-out-the-vote types of programs from political groups, community organizations and churches, or even just friendly neighbors, that helped voters for whom transportation was a problem. Proponents of this change say it strikes against bad actors who might throw away ballots from people of opposing parties, although experts say this is extremely rare and most claims of it have been disproven.\n\nCritics say this change will disproportionately affect minorities and the elderly, and voters who need assistance voting but do not have family available to help.\n\nBallot harvesting, open primaries, double voting:Explaining the vexing vernacular of elections\n\nCan I organize voter registrations?\n\nYes. But you must register with the state, you'll need to carefully document each person you help to sign up, and you can incur harsh penalties for failing to comply with all regulations.\n\nWHAT'S CHANGED: Community organizations must now warn applicants that the organization \"might not\" get their registration in on time. Organizations that fail to submit voter applications within 14 days already incurred a $50 fine for each one, but the annual cap on fines has been raised from $1,000 to $50,000.\n\nCritics worry that may have a chilling effect on churches, nonprofits and other third-party organizations that have traditionally set up registration drives but now fear financial ruin for mistakes or targeted accusations.\n\nThird parties are the fourth-leading registrars in the state, behind the DHSMV, elections offices and RegisterToVoteFlorida.gov.\n\n‘It’s too important’:Fight to overcome barriers to voter registration in Florida endures\n\nCan I vote in Florida if I'm homeless?\n\nYes, if you are otherwise eligible. Check the voter information page on the Florida Coalition to End Homelessness website for more details.\n\nCan I vote in Florida if I am a convicted felon?\n\nMaybe, if your voting rights have been restored (check here) and you are fully paid up for any fines or fees incurred or restitution owed. You can get help at the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition.\n\nBe aware that this can be extremely confusing to work out and ignorance of your status may not save you from prosecution if you're not actually eligible yet.\n\nPay up to vote:Federal appeals court blocks Florida's felons from voting until fees and fines are paid\n\nMore:Florida election officials offered inmates a chance to vote; it got them prosecuted\n\nCan I register to vote online in Florida?\n\nYes. Just go to RegistertoVoteFlorida.gov .\n\nHow do I check my voter registration in Florida?\n\nYou can make sure you're still registered and all the information is correct by going here. Since voter rolls may now be purged annually, you should do this every year well in time to address it before any voting deadlines.\n\nWhat is 'voter solicitation' in Florida?\n\nGood question. Florida already banned anyone from asking for votes, seeking signatures, taking polls or handing out material within 100 feet of a polling place. That has been expanded to 150 feet and drop box locations have been added, and solicitation now includes \"engaging in any activity with the intent to influence or effect of influencing a voter.\" There is no indication of what activities that might include, or who decides.\n\nThe new law doesn't specifically say that anyone besides poll workers are prohibited from handing out food or water to people waiting in line to vote (unlike Georgia's voting law, which does) but by remaining vague it could serve as a deterrent for anyone hoping to help people weather the wait. That's a problem for a state that has previously been nationally infamous for voting lines lasting long hours.\n\nWill the new law reduce voter fraud in Florida?\n\nIt's hard to see how, since there wasn't much to begin with. An Associated Press investigation of the 2020 presidential election found fewer than 475 potential cases of voter fraud out of 25.5 million ballots cast in the six states where President Donald Trump and his allies disputed his loss to President Joe Biden, and none of the lawsuits filed by Trump's people proved the existence of fraud in any meaningful amount.\n\nMore:DeSantis signs bill to create new elections security force to investigate potential ballot fraud\n\nContributors: John Kennedy, USA TODAY NETWORK-FLORIDA; Mike Diamond and Jeff Burlew, Tallahassee Democrat\n\nC.

Put another way, 1 in 7 jobs created in the United States in the past year was created in Texas.\n\nTexas is home to 39 companies in the Standard and Poor's 500 index, including AT&T, ExxonMobil and Texas Instruments. And it boasts some of the nation's largest privately-held companies, including supermarket operator H-E-B, Neiman Marcus Group and Hunt Oil.\n\nWith solid economic growth last year — including a torrid 5.2 percent state GDP increase in the fourth quarter — Texas finishes first in our Economy category this year. That is up from No. 25 lastyear, when oil was priced in the mid-$40s per barrel.\n\nAnd rising energy prices have a ripple effect, according to Roger Guenther, executive director of the Port of Houston, which is seeing booming traffic in related products, like imported steel pipe. So far, at least, Guenther said tariffs have done little to stem the flow.\n\n“As the price of oil goes up and more drilling occurs, it’s up from 3 million tons a couple of years ago to, we expect, 5 or 6 million tons of steel this year,” he said.\n\nMore from CNBC's Top States for Business report:\n\nAmerica's Top States for Business 2018: The full list\n\nThese 10 states are the worst places to call home\n\nThese 10 states are the best places to live in America\n\nTop states for the best chance at your dream job\n\nBut Texas is no one-trick pony, notching top 10 finishes not just in Economy but in five of our 10 categories of competitiveness, including Workforce (No. 7), Infrastructure (No. 1), Technology and Innovation (No. 9) and Access to Capital (No. 3). The state finishes with 1,651 out of 2,500 possible points.\n\nAs always, we rank all 50 states on more than 60 metrics across our 10 categories. Using our tried-and-true methodology, we assign a weight to each category based on how frequently the states cite it in their sales pitches to business. That way, we rate the states based on their own standards. This year’s categories and point totals are:\n\nWorkforce: 425 points\n\nInfrastructure: 400 points\n\nCost of Doing Business: 350 points\n\nEconomy: 300 points\n\nQuality of Life: 300 points\n\nTechnology & Innovation: 225 points\n\nEducation: 200\n\nBusiness Friendliness: 150 points\n\nAccess to Capital: 100 points\n\nCost of Living: 50 points\n\nThe Texas formula\n\nSince CNBC introduced our rankings in 2007, Texas has never finished outside the top five overall, always following the same basic formula. It started under former Gov. Rick Perry, who is now U.S. Secretary of Energy, and has continued under his fellow Republican successor, Gov. Greg Abbott. The state prides itself on business-friendly regulations, smart spending and low taxes. Texas levies no individual income tax and no corporate tax.\n\n“As far as I’m concerned, the only good tax is a dead tax,” said Abbott in his 2017 State of the State address. The state does not always meet those priorities. This year, for example, it finishes No. 18 for Cost of Doing Business, due in part to property taxes averaging around 1.9 percent — among the highest in the nation — and No. 21 for Business Friendliness because of a sometimes difficult legal climate.\n\nFollowing the formula also means that Texas has some of the same weaknesses it had the last time it finished on top.\n\nTexas finishes No. 37 for Education, with some of the lowest high school test scores in the nation. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, only about 82 percent of people over age 25 have a high school diploma — the second-lowest percentage in the nation.\n\nAnd the state finishes No. 31 for Quality of Life. It is not that Texas is necessarily a bad place to live, but the violent-crime rate is high, with nearly 1,500 murders in 2016 — or more than 400 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, according to the FBI. And Texas also has the largest percentage of people without health insurance — nearly 17 percent, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nThe state also gets poor marks for inclusiveness. It is one of only five states with no public-accommodation law protecting its citizens against discrimination.\n\nThe Texas legislature, which meets every other year and is next scheduled to convene in January, has shown little wariness about venturing into social territory, despite warnings from business leaders about scaring away top talent.\n\nIn 2017 lawmakers considered a so-called “bathroom bill” that would have regulated transgender people’s use of public facilities. The bill died amid staunch opposition from business groups, but backers are promising to reintroduce it next year.\n\nAnother measure, which critics call the “Show me your papers” law, bans local sanctuary policies on immigration. The law went into effect earlier this year after surviving a federal court challenge.\n\nFormer Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez, the Democratic nominee to unseat Gov. Abbott in November, said such measures are bad for business in Texas.\n\n“This is the Texas brand that’s going out — the bathroom bill, the show-me-your-papers bill. I call them the job-killing bills,” she told CNBC. “We used to be called the friendly state. Let’s get back to who we really are.”\n\nPolls show Gov. Abbott with a comfortable lead in his bid for a second term.\n\nAlso looming on the Texas horizon: potential budget woes.\n\nWhile the state’s finances are pristine on paper, balancing the massive Texas budget creates more accounting challenges every year. Already, the state budget director and the Legislative Budget Board have instructed agency heads to not only hold the line in their funding requests for the next biennium but also submit alternative budgets that include a 10 percent cut.\n\nFor now, Texas’ many attributes — especially that booming economy — are overshadowing those issues. But if the price of oil declines, hurting a key source of state revenue, or if the United States finds itself in an all-out trade war that curtails imports and exports, Texas’ status as Top State could be vulnerable.\n\nMore:Grocery shopping?

The Evergreen State’s economy was the fastest growing in the nation last year, at 4.4 percent, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. But our Economy category also considers other areas where Washington stumbles a bit, like the state’s $13.8 billion in unfunded pension obligations. Factor in recurring weaknesses, such as poor infrastructure and high costs, and Washington is ultimately no match for a resurgent Texas.\n\nUtah vaults back into the upper echelon at No. 3. Our 2016 Top State had slipped to No. 8 last year. Job growth in the Beehive State, at about 3.4 percent in the past year, actually beats Texas on a percentage basis. Utah’s Silicon Slopes tech region is thriving, with more than 6,500 start-ups and tech companies now based there. Along with that comes growing demand for housing, and that is fueling a construction boom. Utah has added some 50,000 jobs in the past year — a 3.4 percent increase, which is the biggest in the nation.\n\nLongtime followers of this study recall that in the early years, Virginia and Texas regularly battled it out for the top spot. But as the Great Recession took hold and the size of the federal government’s presence in Virginia shrunk, the Old Dominion slipped away in our rankings. In 2018 Virginia is back with a solid fourth-place finish. Not only does the state have the educated, available workforce that employers demand, it also has become a leader in business friendliness with the passage earlier this year of a bipartisan regulatory reform bill aimed at reducing regulations by 25 percent in the next three years.\n\nColorado eases back into the top five after last year’s No. 6 finish. The one thing lacking in the Centennial State’s otherwise stellar workforce is enough workers. Unemployment is low, just 2.8 percent, forcing Colorado employers to recruit talent from elsewhere. Job growth in the state remains strong, but the premium wages resulting from the labor shortage are adding to the state’s already high costs.\n\nBiggest movers on the list\n\nThis year’s most improved state is New York. While still in the bottom half, at No. 27, the Empire State jumps 11 spots from last year’s No. 38 finish, thanks to solid improvement in its economy. State finances are in good shape, the housing market is strong, and only California is home to more Standard and Poor’s 500 companies. New York is also a leader in incentives and tax breaks for businesses, to the consternation of some watchdog groups. According to government figures compiled by the nonpartisan group Good Jobs First, New York spent more than $4 billion in state and local revenues on business subsidies last year, more than any other state.\n\nNot to get carried away, however; the state is still loaded with problems. It is one of America’s most expensive places to live and do business. Taxes, wages, utility costs — even rent for office space — are among the highest in the country. Economic growth is tepid at best. Several high-profile public works projects championed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo are under way, such as the complete rebuilding of New York’s LaGuardia Airport and the new Mario Cuomo Bridge north of New York City. But for now, the state’s infrastructure is among the worst in the nation.\n\nOther big improvements include Idaho, rising nine spots to tie with Michigan for No. 11, thanks in part to a boom in manufacturing as the state seeks to position itself as home to what some are calling the Silicon Valley of the food business. Chobani is in the midst of a $20 million expansion at what it says is the world’s largest yogurt plant in Twin Falls.\n\nArizona (No. 20) and Nevada (No. 33) each move up six spots with the help of a surge in construction as the states tackle housing shortages, though both states get failing grades in education.\n\nThe biggest decline this year belongs to North Dakota, plunging 10 spots to No. 31. Once considered the great American success story — the state finished third in our rankings back in 2013 — the shale oil boom that powered the state cooled considerably when the price of oil began falling the following year. Production is rebounding now as prices rise, but not before an exodus of college-educated workers hit the state. Nearly 5 percent of North Dakotans with a bachelor’s degree or higher moved out of state in 2016, according to the Census Bureau, knocking the Peace Garden State down to No. 30 from No. 12 last year in our all-important Workforce category.\n\nOther notable declines include Kentucky, which falls seven spots to No. 42. The Bluegrass State is facing a $40 billion pension shortfall, prompting Standard and Poor’s to lower the state’s credit rating in May.\n\nIn No. 7 Georgia the economy is not the problem — it remains among the strongest in the country. But the Peach State falls five places due to a slight rise in utility costs and a rising crime rate.\n\nStates with economic woes\n\nWe rank all 50 states, so if there are top states, there must also be bottom states.\n\nMaine and Rhode Island tie for No. 45 this year. In Maine the issue is its workforce, one of the least productive workforces in the country, based on economic output per job. Rhode Island has been working on its infrastructure, financed by its first-ever tolls on trucks, launched in June. But it still finishes last in the category.\n\nAt No. 47 is Hawaii. Not only are costs prohibitive in the Aloha State, but it slips to a rare second-place finish in our Quality of Life category (behind Vermont) due to an uptick in crime.\n\nNo. 48 West Virginia — last year’s bottom state — avoids an embarrassing repeat at No. 50, thanks to a relative rebound in its economy. Coal production has rebounded from depressed levels. West Virginia University researchers say output jumped 24 percent in the first half of last year, from 75 million short tons to 93 million. But the same report warns that growth is likely to level off soon.\n\nMississippi slips one spot to No. 49 this year. While the Magnolia State offers America’s lowest cost of living, that likely has less to do with thrift than the fact that the state’s economy is the second worst in the nation.\n\nWhich brings us to state No. 50, which has the nation’s worst economy.\n\nAlaska’s economic woes are epic, with a budget shortfall this year of $700 million. It could have been worse. The state was looking at a shortfall $2.4 billion, until Gov. Bill Walker and the state legislature agreed for the first time to use earnings from the Alaska Permanent Fund — the state’s oil wealth — to partially close the gap.\n\nAlaska’s problems go beyond the budget. The state also does poorly on costs, technology and innovation, education and access to capital.\n\nOne might think that the rising oil prices that powered Texas to the top of our rankings this year would also help Alaska. After all, North Slope crude oil tends to command a higher price than the Texas variety, and Alaska officials say production is up in response to the higher prices. But everything is relative. Alaska oil is also more expensive to produce, and the Department of Revenue is forecasting output to level off.\n\nAnd then there is that budget deficit. It will take much more than a brief increase in oil prices to tackle that, leaving Alaska stuck at the bottom — for 2018, at least.\n\nWe want to know what you think about our 2018 rankings.

Drug users were hard to find and vaccinate. Thinly staffed county health departments had seen their budgets shrink. And federal vaccine money for Kentucky had run out.\n\n\"Need to move faster,\" urged Dr. Robert Brawley in an April 2018 email to state health department colleagues obtained by the Courier Journal. \"The virus is moving faster than we and (local health departments) are … immunizing persons (at) risk.”\n\nBrawley argued that a powerful state response was needed: $10 million, including $6 million for a fusillade of 150,000 vaccines and $4 million for temporary health workers to help administer them. In an email, he also lobbied for a public health emergency declaration to bolster the case for more federal money.\n\nBut a Courier Journal investigation found his urgent pleas went nowhere. And in the months that followed, Kentucky’s outbreak metastasized into the nation's largest and deadliest.\n\nThe Courier Journal found that Brawley's boss, 31-year-old acting public health Commissioner Dr. Jeffrey Howard, rejected his aggressive recommendations. Amid limited state budgets, county staffing constraints and the availability of more than $220 million in local health department reserve funds — he stuck instead to a $3 million state response.\n\nThe state ultimately sent $2.2 million to local departments and declined to declare an emergency. In addition, county health departments added little to no staff to increase efforts to find and vaccinate drug users and homeless people.\n\nRead more:What we learned from other states' responses to hep A outbreaks\n\nMoreover, Kentucky officials never tried strategies used successfully by some of the other 16 states who fought outbreaks with limited budgets.\n\nKentucky didn't seek money from the state legislature, like Michigan. It didn’t deploy \"strike teams\" of state health workers to counties, like Indiana.\n\nAnd it waited much longer to deploy state funds than Tennessee, which earmarked $3 million after just 25 cases.\n\nThe contagious liver disease has taken a heavy toll in Kentucky, sickening 4,162 people, far more than in any other state. It has sent 2,015 Kentuckians to the hospital for costly treatment.\n\nAnd it has claimed 43 lives, the highest death toll in the U.S. — including people such as former Eastern Kentucky coal miner James Ramey.\n\nLast fall, Ramey's organs failed, one by one, until he struggled so hard to breathe that the blood vessels burst in his neck.\n\nIn his last hours, his father raced over two hours from Martin County to his bedside in a Lexington hospital, leaning over his tubes and wires to beg him to hold on.\n\nRamey's heart gave out as soon as he heard his father's voice and felt his touch. He died Nov. 28, 2018, just over a year after the state declared an outbreak of hepatitis A.\n\n\"There's a very good chance James would be alive\" had the state done more earlier to educate and vaccinate people in Appalachia, said his sister, Brandy Stafford. \"We are desperate for help in these counties. People are crying out.\n\n\"Does the state not think these people's lives are worth something?\"\n\nA controversial decision debated\n\nHoward defended his decisions, telling the Courier Journal the state used limited money to bolster vaccines in numbers that could actually be administered by small staffs in county health departments — and he was willing to seek more funding if needed.\n\nNurses were expensive, he said. And even with more vaccines, drug users would remain difficult to find.\n\nNone of the counties requested additional staff, he said, and some were slow to spend the state money they did get. Also, counties could pay for vaccines with local tax revenue or Medicaid reimbursements or order vaccine provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMoreover, state officials consulted with the CDC, which provided more than $600,000 in cash and $1.4 million worth of vaccines, he said. And they targeted people where they could efficiently find them: jails, emergency rooms, syringe services programs and drug rehabilitation centers — efforts that public health experts praised.\n\nBut he acknowledged that in retrospect he could have done some things differently.\n\n\"I would've liked to be more robust in our early response in Eastern Kentucky for sure. I wish I would've been more bold and said, 'Let's move into Eastern Kentucky,' as opposed to waiting, as we did, with the outbreak,\" said Howard, who grew up in Appalachia.\n\n\"As an Eastern Kentucky guy, it's heartbreaking to see this disease spread out in rural Kentucky. And I knew the struggles that they'd have once it started.\"\n\nAdam Meier, secretary of Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said he stands behind Howard's choices. He said in a statement that the \"challenges Kentucky faced were less financial and more logistical in nature as it related to identifying and engaging the at-risk populations.\n\n\"While hindsight might provide more context for some things now, in retrospect there’s not a single decision that I’m aware of that was made in real time, with the information available at the time, that I would change.\"\n\nMore:How hep A spread across Kentucky and grew into the nation's largest outbreak\n\nBut Brawley told the Courier Journal that much greater resources were needed to battle Kentucky's spread of hepatitis A, pointing out that San Diego County in California spent more than $12 million fighting its 2017 outbreak.\n\nAfter an early response that an audit deemed too weak, San Diego brought the virus under control by nearly quadrupling the vaccines administered seven months into its outbreak.\n\nBy comparison, the state general funds Kentucky spent on its outbreak amounted to less than a quarter as much, Brawley said, even as the virus ultimately infected nearly seven times as many people.\n\n\"In comparison, the Kentucky hepatitis A outbreak response has been too low and too slow …\" Brawley, who resigned in June, told the Courier Journal.\n\n\"Had the state hastened its vaccination efforts, it may have more quickly reduced the risk of the disease's spread and prevented acute cases, hospitalizations for about 50 percent of those cases, deaths and avoided millions of dollars in healthcare expenses for emergency department visits and hospitalizations.\"\n\nNow, he said, \"Kentucky has the worst hepatitis A outbreak in the United States in the 21st century.\"\n\n'His advice should have been heeded'\n\nOthers inside the health department, including nurse Margaret Jones, manager of the state's immunization program, agreed that Brawley's recommendations could have curbed the outbreak faster.\n\n\"We should have done more sooner,\" said Jones, who retired last summer. \"If we had been able to get the vaccines out early, we may not have near as many cases or near as many hospitalizations. … He knew what to do. I think his advice should have been heeded.\"\n\nJones said others were surprised Howard didn't follow the guidance from Brawley, a public health veteran who has been a doctor since 1975, holds specialized degrees in epidemiology and infection control, and retired from the U.S. Navy Medical Corps before joining the department in 2006. Brawley eventually left his job as chief of the state health department's infectious disease branch and now lives in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nHoward graduated medical school in 2014, was named acting commissioner just as the outbreak was declared in November 2017 and received his Kentucky medical license last year.\n\nAs recently as 2018, he was working on a public health master's degree at Harvard University and was officially appointed public health commissioner in June.\n\nHep A explained:Here's what you need to know about hepatitis A in Kentucky\n\nLike Jones, others who work in rural Kentucky were dismayed that Brawley's recommendations were ignored.\n\n\"It's shocking that decision was made. I'm flabbergasted,\" said Stacy Usher, manager of a drug prevention program in Wolfe County, which has one of the state's highest rates of hepatitis A.\n\nBut Meier emphasized that the state's response, led by the state epidemiologist, was guided by a public health team including epidemiologists, physicians, nurses and scientists. He pointed to county health department reserves and other sources of funding available to help address the outbreak.\n\nOfficials at the CDC and in other states haven't criticized Kentucky's spending decisions. For most states, they said, resources dictate public health responses.\n\nHoward echoed that sentiment, saying that while he never had an issue with the amount of money Brawley wanted to send out, the state \"had to limit our response based on the capabilities that exist.\"\n\nHit hepatitis A hard and fast\n\nGiven the challenges and the unpredictability of viral infections, experts said, it's impossible to know the extent to which Kentucky's outbreak would have been minimized with more resources.\n\nBut experts say the unprecedented hepatitis A outbreaks that have sickened more than 13,000 Americans are a reminder that states must devote more resources to preventing and controlling disease, despite a national erosion of public health budgets.\n\nIf rural health departments nationally were \"properly resourced,\" they might have been able to stop the vaccine-preventable disease before it sickened so many, said Dr. Michael Brumage, an assistant dean at the West Virginia University School of Public Health.\n\n\"This is something that happens in Third World nations,\" Brumage said. \"This should not be happening in the First World.\"\n\nExperts agreed that the way to bring hepatitis A under control is to hit it hard and fast. That saves money in the end, they said, because prevention always is less expensive than treatment.\n\n\"As soon as there's a few cases, that's the time to throw everything but the kitchen sink at it,\" said Dr. Nate Smith, president-elect of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials and director of the Arkansas Department of Health. \"Once you've got thousands of cases across the state, it's hard to get the genie back in the bottle.\"\n\nRelated:For Eastern Kentucky woman, hepatitis A was 'a really big wake-up call'\n\nHoward: Hepatitis A is usually a 'mild disease'\n\nHoward said he appreciates the severity of the outbreak, which has spread to 103 of Kentucky’s 120 counties.\n\nBut it would be wrong, he said, to compare hepatitis A to other diseases affecting drug users, such as hepatitis C, which afflicts Kentucky at one of the nation's highest rates.\n\nHoward said hepatitis A is different because \"for most people that get it, is a fairly mild disease. Your liver enzymes will go up. You’ll feel bad for a few days. And it will go away. … I think it would be a mistake to equate it with HIV, hepatitis C and diseases that cause severe morbidity and mortality.”\n\nOfficials are hopeful the hepatitis A outbreak has crested. The number of new cases each week is down from 150 in early November 2018, averaging 87 a week this year.\n\nState health officials said their plans in 2019 include working to help local departments vaccinate more regularly at jails, increase vaccinations generally, enlist more federally qualified health centers to administer vaccines, and continue to push out federally funded vaccine to counties.\n\nRead more:'I am going to die': Appalachian drug user battled hep A and addiction\n\nBut even now, too many at-risk drug users and homeless still aren't being reached, said Dr. Martin Gnoni, an infectious disease specialist at Our Lady of Bellefonte Hospital near Ashland, one of the first areas outside of Louisville to be hit last year.\n\nGnoni said his area could use more epidemiologists and health department staff, as well as outreach teams in vans. To get the virus under control, Louisville's 220-person health department blanketed vulnerable residents, administering 25,000 vaccines.\n\nAnd it paid off. By May, Louisville's cases declined steadily. The city's all-out response led to nearly 100,000 vaccinations and was called a \"gold standard\" by the CDC.\n\nBut Appalachian counties have fewer resources and fewer places drug users and homeless people concentrate, which has helped the virus race through the mountains.\n\nIn January, Martin County, where Ramey lived and died, recorded some of Kentucky’s highest rates of hepatitis A.\n\n\"I guess you could have seen it coming,\" said Stephen Ward, the health department director in Martin County, where more than a third of the 11,000 residents live in poverty and addiction touches nearly every family.\n\nThe county gave out around 800 vaccines last year, but never got any of the state money targeted for vaccinations. Howard said he wasn't sure why, although it did receive some federally funded shots.\n\nRegardless, Ward said Martin County didn't get enough resources from the state to combat the outbreak.\n\n\"I do understand the budget constraints that the state is under,\" said Ward, who at times picked up rural residents so they could get vaccinated. \"We are easy to ignore. … But these people bring so much. They deserve to be rescued.\"\n\nHe aches for the Ramey family, who he knows well.\n\nOn a cold February morning, Stafford, Ramey's sister, visited the family cemetery in a wooded mountain valley. She stuck cloth flowers into the fresh earth and placed a garden gnome near her brother's grave.\n\nThe 40-year-old followed his father into coal mining and struggled with pills, heroin and meth for much of his life. Years of intravenous drug use had given him hepatitis C.\n\nBut his family remembers him as a generous prankster, a 6-foot-2 \"brute\" who loved car racing, riding his four-wheeler and hanging out with his two teen sons.\n\nNo one in his family had heard of hepatitis A until his girlfriend got it. Then Ramey contracted the virus, and within weeks he was dead.\n\nHis family is still angry Kentucky isn't doing more to save others from the same fate.\n\n\"This is very serious, and it needs to be taken more seriously,\" Stafford said. \"Our people are dying.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to reflect newly released state numbers on hepatitis A infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nLaura Ungar: 502-582-7190; lungar@gannett.com; Twitter: @laura_ungar; Support strong local journalism by subscribing today: courier-journal.com/laurau.\n\nReporter Chris Kenning can be reached at ckenning@gannett.com or 502-582-4307.

He’s gregarious, funny, sometimes brutally blunt and also a bit awkward. When the 18-year-old struggles to find words, he gazes toward his shoes and visibly retreats inside a chocolate brown hoodie.\n\nBut Javier has suffered unspeakable damage. Fearing ridicule from his peers and scorn from his caseworker (she says he has ignored her), he only agreed to talk for this story if key details of his life, including his name, were changed.\n\nThe Santa Fe youth has been in and out of New Mexico’s state systems for most of his life, due to a family history that he describes as “chaotic and violent.” He’s not enrolled in school and he says he has no plans to go back anytime soon to earn his high school diploma or even his general education degree.\n\nCOVID-19 IMPACT:Year-old Las Cruces shelter for homeless youth challenged by coronavirus pandemic\n\nJavier is also homeless, though he doesn’t match the profile of how people think of the homeless. He also doesn’t fit into the federal definition of homelessness, one that often drives policy at the local level. Child welfare experts say that housing instability is the number one destabilizer for an at-risk youth, especially for someone like Javier, who has run away from foster care and been in and out of the juvenile justice system.\n\nA 2018 U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness report shows that volatile housing is a driver for some of the poorest outcomes for kids, ranging from mental health and substance abuse issues to depression and suicidal behaviors. (New Mexico leads the country in teen suicide.) Child welfare experts say that homeless youth, who sometimes would rather live on the street or in a motel instead of an adult shelter, are often on a fast track to adult homelessness.\n\nVulnerable youth are also susceptible to falling into predatory human and sex trafficking rings or landing in prison. According to the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, a staggering 78% of runaway or homeless youth in 11 U.S. cities — predominantly people of color and LGBTQ individuals — had experienced police interaction.\n\nMore often than not, solutions for a particular city’s homeless crisis are targeted at adult and veteran populations. While that’s a positive, critics say that youth in care and other at-risk teens, who have found themselves particularly defenseless against the COVID-19 pandemic, are often snubbed.\n\nCOVID-19 IMPACT:Coronavirus changes in Eddy County mean fewer referrals, more donations for at-risk youth\n\nDuring a March 19 virtual town hall for older foster youth, which functioned as an online welfare check for youth in state systems in the wake of the coronavirus, Jerry Milner, associate commissioner of the U.S. Children’s Bureau, said that many of the 20,000 youth who annually age out of foster care aren’t transitioning to permanent housing or supportive family situations.\n\n“That’s an unacceptable injustice,” Milner said. “Frankly, it should not take a pandemic for us to reach out and ask how everything is going.”\n\nYouth homeless statistics aren’t thorough\n\nInaccurate or incomplete counts of homeless youth are also hurting vulnerable kids, critics say.\n\n“We have all of these different ways of counting homelessness and none of them are all that great,” said Hank Hughes, executive director of the Santa Fe-based New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness.\n\nOthers are reading:Oil and gas companies donate to Carlsbad charities as COVID-19 pandemic increases needs\n\nEric Wright, chair of the department of sociology and a professor of sociology and public health at Georgia State University in Atlanta, adds that there aren’t any states that specifically track youth in care who are experiencing homelessness.\n\n“Some foster care systems will try to track them after they leave foster care, but they’re so under-resourced that they don’t do a good job,” Wright said. “It’s hard enough to manage the kids that they do have in their care.”\n\nThe two federal departments charged with compiling youth homelessness statistics — the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the U.S. Department of Education (ED) — aren’t always on the same page.\n\nA December 2019 HUD release concluded that nationwide youth homelessness is on the decline. However, a January report by the University of North Carolina at Greensboro’s National Center for Homeless Education Program, which compiled ED statistics, showed a 15% jump in public school students who are housing insecure.\n\nRead more:As coronavirus hits New Mexico, here's what to know in Eddy County\n\nThe longstanding definition of homelessness is determined by HUD, which asks municipalities to count all the homeless people they can find living on the streets on a certain day every other January. But the 24-hour Point in Time Count is flawed “because people use different methodologies,” Hughes said, “and you can’t find all of the homeless people in one night,” resulting in a massive under-count.\n\nDue to its stringent classification, HUD-funded services are nearly inaccessible to transition-aged foster youth between 17 and 24 years old because they don’t normally qualify under HUD’s definition, said Steve Johnson, executive director at New Day Youth and Family Services, an Albuquerque service agency for at-risk youth and families.\n\nMeanwhile, ED has its own set of rules that determine homelessness, one that’s under the auspices of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, which gives homeless children the right to attend school. It includes youth in precarious housing situations, such as temporarily living on a friend’s couch, sleeping in a car or bouncing from place to place every few weeks.\n\nIn New Mexico, the Department of Health and the Public Education Department collect data on homeless youth via the Youth Risk and Resiliency Survey. When teens enroll in public middle school or high school, they’re handed a survey that includes a housing status question that aligns with the McKinney-Vento Act.\n\nThe federal and state numbers end up as a data blob that isn’t shared or integrated across agencies and for stakeholders, said Jennifer Ramo, executive director of the Santa Fe-based New Mexico Appleseed.\n\nKeep reading:Oil and gas companies donate to Carlsbad charities as COVID-19 pandemic increases needs\n\n“Because there’s no accurate data, we’re trying to see how big the size of the problem is,” she said. “A lot of people are doubled up and bouncing from house to house and under the radar and don’t think of themselves as homeless. Yet, they are.”\n\nUnreliable data can lead to uninformed or incomplete policy decisions at the local level that ultimately impact at-risk youth, especially those in state systems, Ramo says. She adds that Washington state has successfully integrated its homeless statistics, which has allowed officials to craft targeted interventions for young people.\n\nNew Mexico Appleseed recently partnered with the state Department of Health on a Family Success Lab pilot project that would have gathered data sets to try to start an un-duplicated count. However, Ramo says the project has been put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, Ramo spearheaded a data compilation effort via the Child and Family Databank Act during the 2019 New Mexico Legislature but it ultimately failed.\n\nWright of Georgia State University led his own independent surveys in 2015 and 2018. The Atlanta Youth Count and Needs Assessment contradicted both the recent HUD and ED reports.\n\nWright said the 2015 count estimated 3,374 homeless youth in metro Atlanta. The 2018 survey yielded a tally of approximately 3,372 homeless youth. Wright was amazed by the nearly identical numbers.\n\n“The reason it was a surprise is because nationally, the (HUD Point in Time) data suggests that the issue of youth homelessness seems to be on the decline,” Wright said.\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus\n\nNew Mexico’s bigger picture youth homelessness initiatives have been put on hold due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham declared a public health emergency on March 11 and instituted a stay-at-home order effective March 24.\n\nPrior to the pandemic, the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department had been pushing to expand transitional living programs and wraparound services for housing unstable youth. Although New Mexico has some of the best shelters in the country, according to Hilari Lipton, director of Transition Aged Youth for CYFD, there’s a shortage of affordable housing and transitional living options across the state, especially for traumatized youth aged 18 to 24.\n\n“If we are able to provide shelters with more money and support, they would be able to create transitional living programs,” she said.\n\nThe state’s child protective services organization is also laser-focused on foiling human and sex trafficking, and plans on establishing more safe houses that are specific to young victims of trafficking.\n\nKeep reading:Data dashboard breaks down COVID-19 numbers in Eddy County\n\nCYFD’s transition-aged youth game plan includes a partnership with New Day on a pilot project to help support youth 18 and up in resource families, caregivers who give out-of-home support to youth in care.\n\nThe pilot project was planned to start, pre-pandemic, with up to 10 Albuquerque families who would train alongside New Day staff, Johnson said. An update was not immediately available.\n\nIn 2019, New Mexico extended foster care from age 18 to 21. Lipton, who is leading the three-year implementation process, says she hired young people with lived experience to craft a services and support menu that can help prevent homelessness for older foster youth.\n\nAdditionally, the New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness recently received a $3.4 million Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program grant from HUD to assist homeless youth up to age 24, particularly in rural areas, with transitional and rapid rehousing as well as support services in 14 northern New Mexico counties.\n\nIn the state’s largest city, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller has continued to put on the front burner the Gateway Center, a 300-bed voter-approved homeless shelter that has yet to be constructed, coronavirus outbreak notwithstanding. But even when the shelter comes to fruition, Johnson says that some youth, especially the kids that New Day serves, won’t be going.\n\n“They won’t use it. They’re scared,” he said. “I advocated for more scattered shelters that are population specific, such as a small shelter for young people who are 18 to 24. The city and the county didn’t disagree, but they said that’s not what they’re going to do now.”\n\nEven in states where population-specific crisis housing is more available, young people might stay away.\n\n“We had a couple of kids who had an apartment under the rapid rehousing program, but they preferred to sleep on the streets with their friends,” said Wright of Georgia State University.\n\n“Homeless youth tend to move around in small groups, and that allows them to have better survival skills,” Wright added. “They collaborate a little more while they’re working on the streets. They might be able to pool money together to pitch in for a hotel or motel room instead of going to a shelter.”\n\nEmergency decisions and potential long-term solutions\n\nNew Mexico’s foster care and child welfare officials have made several emergency decisions due to the coronavirus. On March 20, CYFD, in an effort to prevent community spread, announced video conferencing between its caseworkers and foster youth, which includes youth in shelters and residential treatment centers, in lieu of in-person visits.\n\nAt the federal level, Sen. Tom Udall, the Democrat from New Mexico, revealed that the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act stimulus package includes $250 million in Medicaid funding for the state.\n\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, Reps. Steve Stivers, an Ohio Republican, and Dave Loebsack, an Iowa Democrat, proposed the Homeless Children and Youth Act in April 2019. The law would open up HUD’s definition of homelessness to encompass youth who have been identified by schools and social services as housing unstable.\n\nMore:New Mexico lawmakers fight for federal relief for rural cities amid coronavirus pandemic\n\n“That would be a game changer,” Johnson of New Day said. “It would mean so many more young people could come into a world where there’s more funding and housing options.”\n\nWith or without a pandemic, Johnson, who has worked in child and family welfare since 1983, says youth service providers need to recast their thinking and approaches when working with homeless youth.\n\n“One of the things I’ve learned more than anything is that people aren’t healed through programs and institutions. They’re healed through meaningful relationships. That’s what they hunger for,” he said. “We’re often not that compelling to young people … so we need to meet their needs through relationships. We have to be more attractive than the sex traffickers and the gang members.”\n\nIt’s too soon to tell if any of the state’s improvement efforts will help Javier find a stable sanctuary in the future. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, he said he wasn’t too worried — he still had a few years to figure out how to get a job, even with a limited work history, in order to procure his own apartment and avoid adult homelessness.\n\nDuring the weeks when coronavirus first reached the United States, repeated calls to Javier went straight to voicemail and text messages weren’t returned. At press time, his whereabouts were unknown.\n\nThis story is part of a Youth Today project on foster care in New Mexico. It’s made possible in part by the May and Stanley Smith Charitable Trust.

That’s nearly a third of the more than 13,000 Americans infected nationwide.\n\nA Courier-Journal investigation into Kentucky’s deadly outbreak found that as it was beginning to sweep through Appalachia, a top state public health official rejected a recommendation for a more aggressive response of $10 million for vaccines and employing a wave of temporary staff in small counties to administer them.\n\nKentucky wasn’t the only state caught off-guard by the spread of a disease that was being transferred from person to person, rather than from contaminated food as in the past.\n\nMany other states also \"under-responded,\" failing to put sufficient resources toward stemming the virus’ spread, said Dr. Robert Gish, a board member of the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable.\n\nVigorously vaccinating those most at-risk, including drug abusers and the homeless, is the best way to curb it quickly, said Dr. Paul Biddinger, director of the Harvard School of Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Exercise Program.\n\nBut officials concede there's no precise blueprint for what constitutes a sufficient response. And state and local actions often are dictated by how much local, state and federal funding is available. Those funds have been declining in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia.\n\nMoreover, the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable contends that the CDC's hepatitis division has been poorly funded for years. The group was among about 100 asking Congress to increase funding by $100 million in fiscal year 2018, compared with its 2017 budget of $34 million.\n\n\"Had local health departments across the nation been properly resourced, particularly in rural areas, outbreaks like this might have been dealt with more expeditiously,\" said Michael Brumage, assistant dean for public health at the West Virginia University School of Public Health.\n\nMost states most took a similar approach: Vaccinating particularly hard to find at-risk populations by working in homeless shelters, jails, needle exchanges, drug rehabilitation centers and emergency rooms.\n\nSome employed other strategies, too.\n\nWith the likelihood that hepatitis A will continue its spread, the Courier Journal spoke with health officials in cities and states outside Kentucky about what worked.\n\n\"Viruses don't respect state lines,\" Indiana State Epidemiologist Pam Pontones said. \"We can learn from each other.”\n\nInvestigation:Kentucky's 'too low and too slow' response to the nation's worst hepatitis A outbreak\n\nHere’s what the Courier Journal found:\n\nSan Diego County: Accelerated vaccination\n\nIn California’s San Diego County, hep A sickened 592 and killed 20 between March 2017 and January 2018. That county's response showed that a huge influx of vaccine can go a long way toward bringing hep A under control.\n\nThe county spent more than $12 million on its response, including searching for vulnerable residents in a van, handing out hygiene kits, opening bridge shelters and handwashing stations, and washing down streets.\n\nA state audit of the response showed that in September, officials vastly increased the number of vaccines given out through county programs, public health centers and community clinics — administering 19,816 vaccines that month and 17,217 in October to those most likely to be at risk.\n\nThat compares with 5,173 vaccines in August. The county also declared a local health emergency on Sept. 1, 2017.\n\nThe number of new cases per week was down drastically by January 2018.\n\nKey to that vaccination push was estimating how many people should get shots and how much vaccine to give out. There were no guidelines so officials worked with researchers at the University of California, San Diego to create some.\n\nResearcher Natasha Martin was brought in during the summer of 2017 to do \"infectious disease modeling,\" and built her model on what she learned about hep A passed among men engaging in sex with other men. She estimated at least 70 percent of the vulnerable population needed to be vaccinated to create \"herd immunity,\" a level of immunity that protects the community against spreading disease.\n\n\"To do that,\" Martin said, \"they needed to intensify the vaccination effort.\"\n\nCalifornia's audit of the county's response criticized officials for the same thing some fault Kentucky for — not taking strong action soon enough. It said they failed to calculate what resources they might need early on or ramp up vaccinations early enough in the outbreak.\n\n\"Had the county accelerated its vaccination efforts sooner,\" the audit said, \"it might have more quickly reduced the risk of the disease spreading.\"\n\nQ&A:Here's what you need to know about hepatitis A in Kentucky\n\nTennessee: Hit it early\n\nTennessee's public health commissioner, who had seen hep A's spread in nearby states, earmarked $3 million for the outbreak, enough for 90,000 doses, in early June of 2018, when the state only had 25 cases.\n\n\"It’s super hard to ask for money for something that hasn’t happened yet. But when that’s possible, that’s a great thing,\" said Dr. Tim Jones, Tennessee's state epidemiologist. \"I really think we did it early enough, (preventing what) could have been a lot worse.\"\n\nThe outbreak has since grown to 865 cases, with three deaths as of mid-February. Yet by that time, only a portion of the vaccine had been administered to at-risk residents, partly because smaller county health departments lacked enough staff. Jones said the state is now making more funds available for added temporary staff.\n\nRead more:Despite popular opinion, restaurants aren't culprit in spreading hep A\n\nIndiana: Deployed strike teams\n\nIndiana's outbreak was declared in November 2017, the same month Kentucky's outbreak went statewide. It began in Southern Indiana, across the river from Louisville, and cases reached 1,023 by mid-February.\n\nMany of Indiana's strategies match Kentucky's. Pontones, the state epidemiologist, said Indiana officials work with local health departments and hospitals to target at-risk populations in places they're likely to be.\n\nBut they also do something Kentucky doesn't: deploy state \"strike teams,\" which include two nurses and a coordinator, to assist local health departments that ask for help. Indiana has spent more than $300,000 for these teams.\n\nPontones said cases are starting to slow, but \"we’re not out of the woods yet. We still have work to do.\"\n\nMichigan: Asked legislature for money\n\nOne year after Michigan's outbreak began to smolder in August 2016, state officials saw it spike and decided they needed more money.\n\nMichigan's state legislature approved $7.1 million in late 2017 for educational and vaccination outreach efforts and added staffing to combat the outbreak. The state's largest person-to-person hepatitis A outbreak had produced about 400 cases at the time, which has since climbed to 910 cases and 28 deaths.\n\nMichigan health officials set up an emergency operations center to coordinate their efforts, said Jim Collins, director of the state health department's Division of Communicable Diseases.\n\nOne effective tactic \"was the boots-on-the-ground work of getting out to reach the high-risk population\" at places such as soup kitchens, jails and homeless shelters, as well as recruiting people to act as advocates to encourage people to get vaccines, Collins said.\n\n\"It really meant going into the field.

Almost 90% reported that the cost of housing was the main reason they could not escape homelessness.\n\n\"The results of the study confirm that far too many Californians experience homelessness because they cannot afford housing,\" wrote Margot Kushel, a principal investigator of the study and director at the University of California, San Francisco's Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative.\n\nThe study encompasses findings from nearly 3,200 surveys and 365 in depth interviews with adults experiencing homelessness across the state between October 2021 and November 2022. It is the \"largest representative study of homelessness in the United States since the mid-1990s,\" according to the study, which was requested by California Governor Gavin Newsom's administration, Fortune reported.\n\nMore than one million people experience homelessness in the United States in a given year and many more are at risk of losing their homes, according to the Biden administration. Florida, New York and Washington also had high rates of homelessness last year, the Annual Homeless Assessment Report shows. The report provides data and analysis for funding decisions by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nWhat does the study reveal?\n\nThe study found that many people cannot afford homes in the state. Nearly all people surveyed said they \"face barriers,\" like poor credit history, discrimination, health challenges or prior evictions, when trying to rent or buy a home. California is experiencing a housing shortage crisis, and the states is home to some of the most unaffordable places to live in the country.\n\nThe research shows \"the incalculable personal costs of homelessness,\" Kushel wrote in the release.\n\nCalifornia's homeless population is growing older in age with the median age of participants being 47-years-old, the new research shows, with nearly half of the state's homeless population being 50-years-old or older. An overrepresented majority are Latino (35%), Black (26%) and Native American (12%).\n\nA vast majority of people surveyed were from or last housed in California. And about 20% of the unhoused people surveyed came straight from institutions.\n\nTwo-thirds of all participants surveyed reported struggling with mental health issues at the time they were surveyed. And 72% had experienced some type of physical violence in their lifetime, the findings show.\n\nMany of the unhoused people the institute surveyed are looking for jobs. \"Participants were disconnected from the job market and services, but almost half were looking for work,\" a news release attached to the study reads.\n\nBiden administration:Unveils initiative to combat homelessness in 5 US cities, California\n\nTo combat the growing housing needs, the group is recommending six policy changes, including:\n\nIncreasing \"access to housing affordable to extremely low-income households;\"\n\nExpanding \"targeted homelessness prevention, such as financial supports and legal assistance;\"\n\nProviding \"robust supports to match the behavioral health needs of the population;\"\n\nUpping \"household incomes through evidence-based employment supports;\"\n\nGrowing \"outreach and service delivery to people experiencing unsheltered homelessness;\" and\n\nEmbedding \"a racial equity approach in all aspects of homeless system service delivery.\"\n\nIn an attempt to reduce homelessness nationwide by 25% by January 2025, the Biden administration last month unveiled an initiative called \"ALL INside\" to help unhoused people in cities with high homeless populations access federal services.

The sports betting market, particularly for online betting, isprojected to continue growing throughout the next decade.\n\nEnter California: The nation’s most populous state has yet to legalize any form of sports betting, but that could change in November, when at least two initiatives — and potentially more — are poised to be on the ballot.\n\nGaming officials across the U.S. have their sights on California, given its outsized potential to add to the burgeoning market: If both online and in-person sports gambling are legalized, the state's voters could open up an in-state market worth more than $3 billion in annual revenue, according to Chris Grove, an industry analyst and partner with Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.\n\n“California would be, by any measure, the crown jewel of the legal sports betting market in the United States,” Grove said.\n\nA pair of competing ballot initiatives — one sponsored by a coalition of California tribes, and another receiving support from many big-city mayors, along with several out-of-state companies — have emerged as the likeliest to get on the ballot in November.\n\nThe first, which has already gained enough signatures to be on the ballot, comes from a coalition of more than 40 California tribes, and would legalize in-person sports betting on tribal lands, as well as four authorized racetracks.\n\nThe coalition's members, such as the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians and the Barona Band of Mission Indians, have poured in $22.5 million since early February to support the measure, which does not address the question of online sports betting.\n\nAgua Caliente tribal chairman Reid Milanovich, who just began his first term as chairman, told The Desert Sun that the in-person tribal measure is \"the most responsible approach to authorizing sports betting in California.\"\n\n\"All bets must be placed in-person at well-regulated establishments where safeguards are in place to prevent underage and illegal gambling,\" Milanovich said. \"Our measure also will help create more jobs and economic opportunities that support local communities and Indian self-reliance by generating tens of millions of dollars each year in new revenues for public schools, wildfire prevention and other state priorities.\"\n\nThe tribal coalition is fiercely opposed to a competing ballot measure, which would legalize online sports betting across California.\n\nThe online proposal, which already has $100 million in support from companies such as DraftKings, FanDuel and BetMGM, has been pitched by its backers as a way to address homelessness in California: 85% of the tax revenue from the measure would go to a state budget fund devoted to housing and mental health programs.\n\n“Ours is the only sports betting ballot measure that will fund hundreds of millions of dollars in solutions to homelessness and mental health every year,” said Nathan Click, a spokesperson for the initiative.\n\n“Obviously, it's really hard in a state like California to raise taxes, and all of that ongoing money is already accounted for,” he added. “This creates a new revenue source for the state, one that 21 other states are using, to help solve our biggest challenge.”\n\nGrove, the gaming analyst, noted while the online initiative's approach is \"relatively unique\" for sports betting, many states have taken similar approaches with their state lotteries, including in California.\n\n\"Many state lotteries were founded with the explicit goal of funding a specific thing, typically education,\" Grove said.\n\nUnlike the tribal initiative, the online sports betting measure has yet to qualify for the November ballot, though it’s on track to do so by its May deadline. Click said its backers are “very confident” it will be on the ballot.\n\nCurrent estimates on how much state tax revenue could come from the measures are broad, with the in-person tribal initiative potentially creating \"tens of millions of dollars annually,\" while the online sports betting proposal could generate \"the mid-hundreds of millions of dollars annually,\" according to legislative analyst projections.\n\nTwo other ballot measures to legalize some form of sports betting face uncertain futures. One measure backed by licensed gambling establishments, such as card rooms, does not appear on track to qualify. The other, which would legalize in-person sports betting on tribal lands and online sports betting with tribal oversight, faces a June deadline to qualify for the ballot.\n\nTribes ramp up campaign against online measure\n\nWhile more than six months remain until California voters will head to the polls in the general election, tribal officials have already come out strongly opposed to the online gambling proposal, launching a series of TV ads urging voters to opposed\n\n“California voters beware: A ballot measure is being promoted by out-of-state gambling corporations that would authorize a massive expansion of online sports gambling in California, turning every cellphone, laptop, tablet, and even video game console into a gambling device,” a voiceover in the ad says, warning the measure could lead to “more addiction, financial ruin, and homelessness.”\n\nThe ad is not the only one hitting the airwaves in opposition to the online proposal. In mid-March, a group of tribes, including the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, the Rincon Band of Luisueño Indians and the Wilton Rancheria tribe, launched TV advertisements arguing the online measure would “break the promise” between California and tribes set in place by compacts in the late 1990s. The group has indicated it will to commit $100 million to defeat the online sports betting proposal.\n\nThe reason for the tribes' mobilization against the online measure is clear. Online sports betting accounts for between 85% and 90% of the total market in states where it’s legal, according to John Holden, an assistant business professor at Oklahoma State University who has done extensive research on sports gambling.\n\n“If those are the two options that pass, and there isn’t some way for the tribes to get access to mobile, that's not going to be the desirable situation for them,” Holden said. “As more and more states legalize online casinos, which only a handful have done so far, I think we're going to see decreases in people going to the physical casinos, and I think that's the big concern for the tribes here.”\n\nWhile the tribes have already rolled out a public campaign opposing the measure, the public messaging will likely increase come fall. Kathy Fairbanks, a spokesperson for the tribal in-person initiative, said the group’s voter education efforts should “really start to ramp up” then.\n\n“We will be communicating with voters in every way possible — TV, radio, direct mail, digital ads, all of it,” Fairbanks said,\n\nBoth measures could theoretically pass, and it’s unlikely Californians will see many ads from promoters of the online betting initiative criticizing the tribal initiative.\n\n“We're just focused on our (online sports betting) measure,” Click said. “We think it provides the best solution for the state.”\n\nHowever, the tribal measure is facing opposition from another group, called Taxpayers Against Special Interest Monopolies, which includes a lengthy list of cities and local officials, as well as cardrooms. The California Contract Cities Association, which includes 74 municipalities, among them Beverly Hills, Coachella and Malibu, is a part of the opposition group.\n\nThe group argues the tribal measure would force the state's 86 cardrooms out of business, placing thousands of jobs at risks and putting a dent in local governments' revenue streams. The opposition group has accrued a substantial war chest to launch attacks again the tribal measure, with roughly $23.5 million in cash on hand at the end of 2021.\n\n\"During the pandemic, California cities that depend on the revenues generated through legal gaming at cardrooms have seen the devastating impacts cardroom closures have had on municipal budgets and the vital services they fund,\" said Commerce Mayor Leonard Mendoza. \"Hundreds of millions of dollars in local revenues are on the line, money needed to invest in the safety and well-being of our residents.\"\n\nThe campaigns in opposition and in support of the varying measure underscore the complex dynamics of gambling in California, according to Grove, the gaming analyst.\n\n\"Optimal for the tribes is very different from optimal for the card clubs,\" Grove said. \"There are more competing stakeholder visions for sports betting in California than in any other state in the U.S., and it's not even close.\"\n\nVoters have mixed feelings on sports betting proposals\n\nAs the campaigns prepare to ramp up outreach to voters in the coming months, it’s unclear whether Californians will be willing to legalizing sports betting in the state, though initial polling shows an openness to the proposals.\n\nA recent poll found voters had mixed opinions on legalizing sports betting, with 45% inclined to vote for expansion, 33% inclined to vote against it and nearly a quarter of voters undecided.\n\nThe poll, conducted by the UC-Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, also found opinions on sports betting were directly tied to the respondents’ interest in pro sports: Voters with high interest in pro sports were supportive by a nearly three-to-one margin, while just a third of those with no interest in pro sports supported legalization.\n\nThe opinions didn’t vary much when looking at party registration, with about four in 10 of both Republicans and Democrats in support of legalized sports betting.\n\n“It is rare these days for a political issue to not be seen as partisan. But legalized sports betting in California appears to be one of them, at least for the time being,” said Eric Schickler, the institute’s co-director.\n\nAt the Agua Caliente Resort Casino and Spa Rancho Mirage, some potential voters were still making their minds up. Local resident Jeff Land, who recently heard about the initiatives through a radio ad, questioned whether the revenue raised for homelessness by the online betting measure would “go to the right place.”\n\n“I could be in favor of both, but if they can show exactly where that money (for homelessness project) goes to and prove it, I would probably favor the online one, because the homeless problem is really big,” Land said, speaking just outside the 360 Sports bar in the casino’s back corner.\n\n“Then, you get to the problem of the people who are taking the money and doing something with it — Are they doing the right thing?” he added.\n\nOthers were also open to legalizing sports betting, though the proposals' details could determine their support. Lisset Fernandez, who was visiting the casino from Santa Monica, said she was fine with people placing bets on sports — “It’s their money,” she said — but she was hesitant to pass an initiative with the revenue already earmarked.\n\n“I would go (for the tribal initiative) – they can do whatever they want,” Fernandez said. “The online one, I would be against it, because nobody gets to decide where my money goes. But I would like overall for people to be able to sports bet online, just not under those circumstances.”\n\n“Why should they decide that it’s just for homelessness? It’s a serious problem, but we have other problems also,” she added. “It’s about them telling me where the money goes.”\n\nWhile both could pass, the competing initiatives could also cancel each other out, with voters torn on which to support and ultimately backing none of them, said Holden, the gambling expert from OSU.\n\n“I think it’s a very possible that effectively these campaigns, they just cannibalize each other, and nothing ends up passing,” Holden said. “I think that's a very real possibility, in which case we could be back doing this in 2024.”\n\nCalifornia’s general election is Nov. 8.\n\nTom Coulter covers politics and can be reached at thomas.coulter@desertsun.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/16/politics/minnesota-homeless-affordable-housing/index.html", "title": "How this Minnesota County is moving thousands of homeless off the ...", "text": "Minneapolis CNN —\n\nOn a breezy morning in July, Fabian Jones rode his new bike to the homeless shelter where he lived earlier this year.\n\n“Here’s one of our success stories,” said Michael Goze, head of the nonprofit that runs the emergency shelter, known as Homeward Bound, located in the heart of Minneapolis’ large Native American community.\n\nJones, 52, was spending the day moving his things from a storage unit and into a new apartment he found earlier in the summer, with some help provided by case workers at Homeward Bound.\n\n“My bike is like a U-Haul,” Jones said with a laugh, while showing off the key fob to his new place.\n\nJones said that he’s spent time at every shelter in Minneapolis over the years. But things turned around for him at Homeward Bound, where a person is treated “like a human being,” according to Jones. As a culturally specific shelter, it holds American Indian rituals like smudging, a ceremony meant to drive away negative energy. A variety of support services for physical and mental health are offered, and there are lockers so individuals can store their possessions safely.\n\n“It’s hard being homeless every day. You can’t take a day off, or rest for a bit. You gotta eat, you gotta figure out where you’re going to sleep and shower. It’s a constant thing you’re doing in survival mode,” he added.\n\nHomeward Bound, a temporary living facility in Minneapolis, was opened in 2020 thanks in part to federal pandemic aid. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nJones is one of hundreds of people that Hennepin County – the largest in Minnesota and the place where George Floyd was murdered by police – has moved off the street and into permanent housing since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nThe Homeward Bound shelter, which opened at the end of 2020, is located not far from where a large tent encampment, known as the Wall of Forgotten Natives, once stood, drawing attention to the homelessness problem and kick-starting Hennepin County’s efforts to address the affordable housing crisis.\n\nWith financial help from the federal pandemic aid packages passed by Congress, Hennepin County has been able to move at lightning-fast speed to implement a multilayer plan addressing housing and homelessness – work that usually moves at a snail’s pace.\n\nOver the past two years, the county has opened three new emergency shelters, including Homeward Bound, and upgraded several others. It has purchased five properties that are being converted into affordable housing and is helping finance 16 other new projects driven by private developers. Twenty-six new social workers were hired to help those experiencing homelessness move into their own housing.\n\nPandemic emergency leads to a housing opportunity\n\nSoon after Minnesota’s pandemic-related stay-at-home order took effect in March 2020, metro transit buses were rolling up to emergency shelters to pick up people who were over 60 years old and may have been more at risk of contracting Covid-19.\n\nThey were moved into one of several hotels that Hennepin County – like other places across the country – decided to lease so that some of the most at-risk people in the community could move out of congregant shelters, reducing their chances of contracting Covid-19.\n\nHennepin County is converting the former Metro Inn Motel into affordable housing. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nBut Hennepin County quickly pivoted to a longer-term strategy. Instead of leasing the properties, it bought them with the intent of eventually converting them into housing for very low-income, single adults – or what’s known as single-room occupancy housing. It’s the kind of housing that is sorely missing in not just Minneapolis but across the country.\n\nBy the end of 2020, Hennepin County owned four properties: Three were smaller, older motels long past their prime, and one was a treatment facility. The latter is already filled with residents, and the former motels are currently being renovated. The county recently purchased an additional motel and is eyeing another.\n\nFrom homeless to hotels to housing\n\nDuring the height of the pandemic, some of Hennepin County’s chronically homeless individuals stayed for more than a year at the former Metro Inn Motel, one of the properties purchased in 2020, before the county began construction to convert it into permanent housing. It was here that the county’s newly expanded social work team had the time and flexibility to help many of them find permanent housing.\n\n“These are guys who probably would not have worked with the traditional route of getting housed in the shelter systems,” said Jamie Wolff, one of Hennepin County’s social workers, whose position was made possible by the federal pandemic funds.\n\nMost of the clients were older men who had been homeless for years, and some needed extra services, like assisted living. For the first time in a long while, many of the residents had a place to stay where they could come and go as they wished without packing up all their belongings.\n\n“Without the Metro, I don’t think a lot of these guys that I eventually did get housed would have found housing. This was a great steppingstone for them,” Wolff added.\n\nJamie Wolff, a Hennepin County social worker, points to a mural in which each flower represents a person who found permanent housing. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nSocial workers like Wolff help people navigate the numerous hurdles there may be to finding housing, including addressing their mental and physical health needs. Sometimes she helps people fill out paperwork for rental subsidies or vouchers for which they may be eligible. For others, Wolff may talk to landlords about taking on a tenant with a criminal record.\n\n“We made sure everyone staying in a hotel had a social worker responsible for working alongside them to get them into permanent housing. It’s something we didn’t have in that really focused way in our system before the pandemic,” said David Hewitt, Hennepin County’s director of housing stability.\n\nFor some, the process went quickly, but for others it took a lot of time and effort.\n\n“We had one man who sacked eight different social workers, I think, including me. But we got him into housing in the end,” Hewitt said.\n\nThe numbers show that the strategy was effective.\n\nBy March 2022, Hennepin County had found permanent housing for 464 of the 540 people who had been moved into a hotel during the pandemic, and 97% of those housed have remained in their homes.\n\nWhat sets Hennepin County apart\n\nThe lack of affordable housing is a challenge that communities across the country have been facing for decades. In many places, rent increases have far outpaced wages. In Minnesota, for example, a minimum wage worker would have to work 70 hours a week to be able to afford the rent of a one-bedroom home.\n\nEncampments – which were largely permitted during the pandemic, per guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – have gained attention in cities across the country. Earlier this year, homelessness and crime were hot-button election issues in liberal cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles.\n\nThe women's wing at Homeward Bound, a culturally specific temporary living facility in Minneapolis. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nMore and more states and localities are passing laws that criminalize homelessness or sleeping outside, said Eric Tars, legal director at the National Homelessness Law Center.\n\n“The political incentives are kind of off,” Tars added, noting that passing those laws is sometimes easier, faster and cheaper than building more affordable housing.\n\nPrior to the 1980s, homelessness was not as widespread across the US. But in 1998, Congress – through what’s known as the Faircloth Amendment – capped the number of public housing units that can receive federal funding from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, essentially halting new construction of public housing.\n\nWhat Hennepin County is doing gets around that cap because the county owns the properties that are being converted to affordable housing.\n\nOne reason the county has been able to move so fast is that officials decided to allocate more than $90 million – representing roughly 40% of the pandemic funding it received from the federal government since March 2020 – to address homelessness and affordable housing. It also already had an extensive plan in place.\n\nNot all of those dollars being spent are directly from the aid packages passed by Congress, due to restrictions on how the money can be used. But county officials say having that influx of dollars to fill in budget gaps elsewhere freed up the money for tackling homelessness and housing.\n\nA volunteer organizes groceries at a pantry in the basement of Calvary Lutheran Church, which is set to be converted into affordable housing. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\n“We would have never bought four buildings at one time without the federal funding,” said Julia Welle Ayres, Hennepin County’s director of housing development and finance.\n\nThe county has already allocated well over half of the $90 million. The funds allocated to date will support the development of 2,523 affordable housing units.\n\nWhile early indicators show success – Hennepin County’s January point-in-time homeless count was the lowest since it started to keep track in 2005 – it remains to be seen how effective the county’s approach to addressing homelessness will be in the long term and if it can work elsewhere. There were still more than 2,600 people experiencing homelessness, 487 of whom were unsheltered, at the time of the count.\n\nWithout new affordable housing, ‘we probably would be back on the street’\n\nIn January 2021, after years of being homeless, Beverly Jean Lazaro-Glenn got a call from a social worker who had found her a rental apartment. It was in Stevens Square Residence, one of the properties recently purchased by Hennepin County and converted from a treatment facility into deeply affordable housing.\n\nEven though Lazaro-Glenn, 53, can afford to pay rent, previous landlords had rejected her application. She lacked a recent rental history and had faced a previous eviction action – and she wanted to live with her fiance, who has a criminal record.\n\n“It was very hard for us to find a place. If we hadn’t gotten in here, we probably would be back on the street in our tent,” Lazaro-Glenn said.\n\nBeverly Jean Lazaro-Glenn rents an apartment at the Stevens Square Residence, an affordable housing apartment complex in Minneapolis. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nThe couple was accepted by Alliance Housing, a nonprofit that leases the Stevens Square Residence building from the county, and moved in just in time for Lazaro-Glenn to recover from back surgery.\n\nA key feature of Hennepin County’s plan is to focus on creating a variety of housing rather than solely increasing the number of units created. Some affordable housing developments are for singles and others are for families. Some offer extensive support services.\n\nThere are also people experiencing homelessness who benefit from a place like Stevens Square Residence, because it charges a low rent without the tenant needing an income-based subsidy, like a voucher, which can be hard to receive continually for people whose wages fluctuate.\n\nLazaro-Glenn and her fiance have their own room and share a laundry room and kitchen with the other tenants, paying $510 a month in rent.\n\nAlliance also provides a property manager, Tiffany Simmons, who not only tends to maintenance issues but helps support tenants in a variety of ways – from helping them sign up for benefits from the county to setting up a rent payment plan if their income temporarily takes a hit.\n\nTiffany Simmons, the property manager at Stevens Square Residence, holds keys to the many properties she manages. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nBeverly Jean Lazaro-Glenn (right) has a close relationship with her property manager, Tiffany Simmons. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nSimmons calls it “hands on” property management, but that might undersell the significance of her role in the lives of some residents like Lazaro-Glenn – who often calls her with questions as well as ideas about bringing the tenants together, like a Fourth of July barbecue or decorating a Christmas tree in the shared living space.\n\n“If you weren’t the manager, and you and me didn’t click and become friends like we did, I don’t think I would have made it,” Lazaro-Glenn told her.\n\n“You would have been fine,” Simmons replied.\n\n“Even if we got on a list for another apartment, I don’t want to move. I want to stay right here,” Lazaro-Glenn said.\n\nRebuilding a shaken community\n\nIn a neighborhood reeling from not only the pandemic but from the civil unrest following the murder of George Floyd, a new affordable housing development with 41 apartments for very low-income families is expected to open next year at the site of the current Calvary Lutheran Church.\n\nIt’s exactly what Hennepin County Commissioner Angela Conley believes the community needs to help rebuild.\n\n“We’re still healing, especially in this immediate area,” Conley said, sitting inside the Calvary Lutheran Church, located just one block from George Floyd Square.\n\nA memorial for people killed by police is seen near the site where George Floyd was killed by Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nThe corner outside the Cup Foods convenient store where Floyd was murdered by police in 2020 continues to serve as a memorial and gathering place for people to remember him and other victims of police brutality.\n\nBut even before the pandemic and civil unrest swept through the city, affordable housing was becoming out of reach for generations of people living in the historically Black neighborhoods in southern Minneapolis. Earlier this year, the community helped raise $275,000 so that a 70-year-old woman could stay in the home where she’s lived for nearly 20 years.\n\n“When you don’t have secure access to housing, it triggers all these other disruptions in people’s lives,” said Conley, who struggled to find her own housing years ago as a young single mom.\n\n“When I was able to secure housing, I wasn’t worried about keeping my job and day care and all these other things,” she added.\n\nTrellis, a private company that specializes in developing affordable housing, is set to buy the Calvary Lutheran Church, whose congregation was looking to sell the property. The facility will also offer support services to the families that move in through the help of a nonprofit called Simpson Housing Services.\n\nA poster with an image of George Floyd hangs inside Calvary Lutheran Church, a space set to be converted into affordable housing. Sarah Silbiger for CNN\n\nCalvary Lutheran Church is located one block from George Floyd Square in Minneapolis.

But all of the units are reserved for people who earn less than 30% of the average median income in the area – an in-demand sweet spot that’s incredibly hard to meet with the amount of funding that’s typically available. That income threshold amounts to about $22,000 a year for a single person.\n\nHennepin County has allocated more than $23 million of the $90 million available for addressing housing and homelessness for an accelerator fund that helps private companies create affordable housing – with an emphasis on projects impacted by areas of civil unrest after Floyd’s murder and projects being developed by people of color. Most of that money is expected to be allocated this year, and the influx allows Trellis to finish converting the church months, if not years, faster than usual, opening within the next 12 months.\n\n“It typically takes round after funding round, taking maybe five years for such a complex project,” said Elizabeth Flannery, CEO of Trellis.\n\n“I get goosebumps when I think about it,” she added.", "authors": ["Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe unexpected discovery of “ghost” fossils belonging to tiny, ancient organisms could provide insights about how life reacts to climate change in Earth’s oceans.\n\nLooking through a powerful microscope, researchers were stunned to see the impressions left by single-celled plankton, or fossilized nannoplankton, that lived millions of years ago – especially since they were analyzing something else.\n\nA study detailing the findings published Thursday in the journal Science.\n\n“The discovery of the ghost fossils was a complete surprise,” said study author Sam Slater, researcher at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm.\n\n“We were actually studying fossil pollen from the same rocks. I had never seen this style of fossil preservation before, and the discovery was doubly surprising because the imprints were found in abundance from rocks where normal nannofossils are rare or missing entirely.”\n\nAs the researchers examined the pollen under a scanning electron microscope, they spied “tiny potholes” on the surface of the pollen, Slater said. When they zoomed in to see the potholes using magnifications of thousands of times, they observed complex structures.\n\nModern (left) and Jurassic (right) coccolithophore exoskeletons (coccospheres) can be seen side by side. Nannotax/London Natural History Museum\n\nThose structures were the impressions left by the exoskeletons of nannoplanktons called coccolithophores.\n\nThis microscopic plankton still exists today, and it supports marine food webs, provides oxygen and stores carbon within seafloor sediments. A coccolithophore surrounds its cell using a coccolith, or hard calcareous plate, which can fossilize in rocks.\n\nAlthough tiny as individuals, coccolithophores can produce cloudlike blooms in the ocean that can be seen from space. And once they die, their exoskeletons drift down to rest on the seafloor. As they accumulate, the exoskeletons can turn into rocks like chalk.\n\nThe ghost fossils were created as seafloor sediment turned into rock. Layers of mud accumulating on the seafloor pressed the hard coccolith plates together with other organic matter, such as pollen and spores. As time passed, acidic water trapped within the rock spaces dissolved the coccoliths. All that was left was the impression in the stone they once made.\n\nThis diagram shows how tiny the ghost fossils were compared with fossilized pollen. S.M. Slater, P. Bown et al/Science Journal/London Natural History Museum\n\n“The preservation of these ghost nannofossils is truly remarkable,” said study coauthor Paul Bown, a professor of micropaleontology at the University College London, in a statement.\n\n“The ghost fossils are extremely small – their length is approximately five thousandths of a millimetre, 15 times narrower than the width of a human hair! – but the detail of the original plates is still perfectly visible, pressed into the surfaces of ancient organic matter, even though the plates themselves have dissolved away,” Bown said.\n\nFilling a gap\n\nPrevious research noted a decline in these fossils during past global warming events that impacted the oceans, leading scientists to believe that the plankton were negatively affected by acidification in the ocean and climate change overall.\n\nThe ghost fossils tell a different story entirely, providing a record that shows coccolithophores were abundant in the ocean during three ocean warming events 94 million, 120 million and 183 million years ago, across the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.\n\n“Normally, palaeontologists only search for the fossil coccoliths themselves, and if they don’t find any then they often assume that these ancient plankton communities collapsed,” said study coauthor Vivi Vajda, professor at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, in a statement.\n\n“These ghost fossils show us that sometimes the fossil record plays tricks on us and there are other ways that these calcareous nannoplankton may be preserved, which need to be taken into account when trying to understand responses to past climate change.”\n\nThe researchers were initially focused on the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event, when volcanoes released increased carbon dioxide in the Southern Hemisphere and caused rapid global warming 183 million years ago during the Early Jurassic period.\n\nSome of the ghost nannofossils were recovered from the Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire in the UK. S.M Slater et al./London Natural History Museum\n\nScientists have unearthed ghost fossils in the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany and New Zealand associated with this event, as well as specimens found in Sweden and Italy linked to warming ocean events 120 million years ago and 94 million years ago, respectively.\n\nUnderstanding these ghost fossils can help researchers search for them in other fossil record gaps and better understand warming periods across Earth’s history.\n\nDead zones\n\nThe plankton were not only resilient in the face of rising temperatures – they actually diversified and thrived, and that may not have been a good thing for other species.\n\nBig blooms of plankton aren’t a sign that an ecosystem is in trouble, but when a bloom dies and sinks to the seafloor, its decomposition uses oxygen and depletes it from the water, which can create areas where most species can’t survive.\n\n“Rather than them being victims of these past warming events, our records indicate that the proliferation of plankton contributed to the expansion of marine dead zones – regions where seafloor oxygen levels were too low for most species to survive,” Slater said.\n\n“These conditions, with expanding dead zones and plankton blooms, may become more widespread across our globally warming oceans,” he added.\n\nCurrent global warming is occurring more quickly than these historical events, and Slater believes this study shows that scientists need a more nuanced approach to predicting how different species will respond as the global climate shifts, because not all of them will respond in the same way.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/07/world/pacific-ocean-supercontinent-scn/index.html", "title": "Next supercontinent may form when the Pacific Ocean disappears", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

This means that the current continents are due to come together again in a couple of hundred of million years’ time,” said lead author Dr. Chuan Huang, a research fellow in Curtin’s Earth Dynamics Research Group and the School of Earth and Planetary Sciences, in a statement.\n\nThe formation of supercontinents has occurred in widely varying ways, scientists believe.\n\nThe team’s simulation showed that due to the fact that Earth has been cooling for billions of years since its formation, the thickness and strength of the tectonic plates beneath the oceans have reduced over time.\n\nThis natural process would hinder the next supercontinent from forming as a result of the shrinking of the Atlantic or Indian oceans, which scientists consider to be relatively young oceans. These oceans likely formed when the most recent supercontinent on Earth broke apart and the various pieces slowly drifted from one another.\n\nCalled Pangaea, the land mass formed around 320 million years ago, according to the study authors. It broke apart between 170 million and 180 million years ago, when dinosaurs walked the Earth.\n\nIn contrast, the Pacific Ocean is the oldest ocean on Earth. This vast body of water is actually the remnant of the Panthalassa superocean that started to form 700 million years ago as a supercontinent even more ancient than Pangaea began to break apart.\n\nThe study team found that when the tectonic plates diminish in strength and thickness, the formation of a new supercontinent is more likely to happen by the closing up of a former superocean that had surrounded a past colossal land mass. Reducing by a few centimeters per year, the Pacific Ocean began shrinking during the age of the dinosaurs. Based on the new simulation, the Pacific Ocean’s current reach of 10,000 kilometers (6,213.7 miles) will close up in less than 300 million years.\n\n“The resulting new supercontinent has already been named Amasia because some believe that the Pacific Ocean will close (as opposed to the Atlantic and Indian oceans) when America collides with Asia. Australia is also expected to play a role in this important Earth event, first colliding with Asia and then connecting America and Asia once the Pacific Ocean closes,” Huang said.\n\nAustralia is currently drifting toward Asia at a rate of about 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) per year, while Eurasia and the Americas move at slower rates toward the Pacific Ocean, said study coauthor Zheng-Xiang Li, distinguished professor in Curtin’s School of Earth and Planetary Sciences.\n\nWhat will this world be like?\n\nChanges in the distribution of continents and oceans will cause changes in climates, “particularly when ocean currents are stopped by continental collision, or new ocean currents are formed when continents break apart,” Li said.\n\nAn example of this phenomenon is when Australia broke away from Antarctica 45 million years ago, triggering the formation of the Antarctic polar ice cap.\n\nResearchers also expect more earthquakes as the continental plates collide. Seismic activity has periodically occurred where India and Eurasia’s plates have been colliding for the past 55 million years, Li said. The initial impact formed the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas.\n\nSurrounded by a new superocean, the newly formed supercontinent will also have decreased biodiversity.\n\n“Earth as we know it will be drastically different when Amasia forms. The sea level is expected to be lower, and the vast interior of the supercontinent will be very arid with high daily temperature ranges,” Li said. “Currently, Earth consists of seven continents with widely different ecosystems and human cultures, so it would be fascinating to think what the world might look like in 200 million to 300 million years’ time.”\n\nScientists are still trying to understand Earth’s supercontinent cycle, which is driven by heat and gravity. The research team wants to establish how Earth’s plate tectonics started and when the first continents formed, as well as what kicked off the supercontinent cycle.\n\n“We are only starting to look at the entire Earth system, from its core to its atmosphere, as a closely linked system that evolved together,” Li said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/10/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/world/lichen-algae-climate-change-scn/index.html", "title": "Earth is warming too quickly for these tiny organisms to adapt | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAs global temperatures steadily rise, our planet may be changing too quickly for some of nature’s most wide-ranging organisms to adapt.\n\nThousands of species of tiny plantlike organisms may evolve too slowly to keep up with Earth’s changes as the climate crisis continues, according to new research.\n\nThese tiny organisms are algae, something you likely picture floating as a green film on top of a pond or lake.\n\nBut when algae team up with fungus, they form colonies of lichen – those light-colored, curly patches growing on rocks and trees in your backyard. And with lichen as their vehicle, algae have the versatility to inhabit a vast range of ecosystems around the globe, living anywhere from the Arctic tundra to the most arid desert. Lichen is the dominant vegetation, covering 7% of the planet’s surface.\n\nLichen housing Trebouxia algae can be seen growing on rocks in the Czech Republic. Matthew Nelsen/Field Museum\n\nLichen grow on the order of millimeters per year and can be thousands of years old. Even if the middle of the lichen begins to break down and decompose, the outer edge will keep spreading out like a ring.\n\nBut these slow-growing lichens also move at a snail’s pace when it comes to evolutionary change: They don’t adapt quickly enough to match the pace with which our planet is shifting, especially as it heats up.\n\nAlgae enjoys a symbiotic relationship with a fungus, living inside this lichen on a rock in the Atacama Desert. Matthew Nelsen/Field Museum\n\nTracking evolutionary change\n\nResearchers studied Trebouxia, single-celled algae that live inside lichen. There are more than 7,000 kinds of these lichen with algal partners, making them common across the globe. The study published Tuesday in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology.\n\nIn order to understand how lichen may adapt, the researchers looked at the genetic relationships of different algae species for comparison, as well as their varied environments.\n\nBy creating family trees of algae, researchers could track its evolutionary changes. The scientists realized how long it takes for algae to get used to an environment and its temperatures, precipitation amount and seasonal changes. The algae within lichen can take hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years to adapt to their preferred climates, according to the new study.\n\n“I was shocked,” said lead study author Matthew Nelsen, a research scientist at Chicago’s Field Museum. “I should have known better from the other papers I’ve read, but I was disturbed to see it. It’s so close to home, on a group of organisms near and dear to my heart.”\n\nA symbiotic relationship\n\nWhen it comes to lichen, the algae supply food in the form of sugars while the fungus serves as a habitat, creating a symbiotic relationship. And over time, lichen have evolved to appear in the most extreme environments, including around volcanoes.\n\nTheir purpose varies depending on where they live, but lichen create oxygen, prevent erosion, provide nesting material, retain moisture and contribute to water cycling in ecosystems. They also serve as a food source for many species including some mammals, like reindeer.\n\n“When you see a lichen, you’re basically looking at all fungal tissue, with some algal cells hidden away and protected inside,” Nelsen said. “Loosely speaking, it’s like a greenhouse – the fungus creates a more hospitable environment for the algae.”\n\nThe level of diversity is just part of what makes lichen so charismatic to Nelsen. There are about 20,000 species of fungi that help form lichens – more than all of the species of mammals and birds combined.\n\n“They may be a bit more subtle and not as cute, but it’s still a substantial amount of diversity out there,” Nelsen said. However, he noted that lichen can appear stunning and almost otherworldly in nature.\n\nA changing world\n\nIf the planet continues to warm at its current rate, that will outpace what many Trebouxia can adapt to, which could cause ripple effects.\n\n“In this study, we set out to learn how rapidly the climate preferences of these algae have evolved over time, and relate them to predictions about future rates of climate change,” Nelsen said.\n\n“We found that the predicted rate of modern climate change vastly exceeds the rate at which these algae have evolved in the past. This means that certain parts of their range are likely to become inhospitable to them.”\n\nAlgae and lichen have been able to survive previous shifts in Earth’s global temperatures, but climate change is causing those to occur much more quickly.\n\n“Closely related algal species tend to have similar climatic preferences, as predicted by their evolutionary relationships,” Nelsen said. “The most closely related ones might live in really similar climates, whereas distantly related species might differ more in their climatic tolerance.”\n\nLichen takes many forms all over the world, like this spaghetti lichen growing in the Alaskan tundra. Matthew Nelsen/Field Museum\n\nFuture impacts\n\nWhen a climate changes, it’s not uncommon to see plants or animals appear in new environments, where they compete with existing species. While it doesn’t mean that the 7,000 Trebouxia algae will simply disappear, it indicates that changes are on the horizon. If the algae partner of lichen begins to die out, the fungus might be taken out as well, or the algae may have to slowly move to another area.\n\n“I think we’re going to see the ranges of these things shift, and that could lead to some shuffling of the relationships with fungi– we might get partnerships that weren’t there previously,” Nelsen said.\n\n“Since algae are the food source for the fungus, they’re the ones photosynthesizing and making sugars to give to the fungus. If they’re forced to move, then the fungal partner would either have to move too, or develop a new partnership.”\n\nGoing forward, Nelsen wants to determine how these lichen survive and even thrive in extreme and diverse environments, test the temperature range limits of algae they can withstand, and understand more about the fungus component of lichen and how it reacts to change.\n\nAs the climate changes, algae may have to disperse to new environments and may not be able to thrive in extreme habitats, like the Alaskan tundra. Matthew Nelsen/Field Museum\n\nNelsen believes lichen research could be applied to other aspects of understanding how climate change will unfold.\n\n“They have interesting stories behind them, and it’s just kind of up to us to try to figure out what exactly they’re doing out there in nature,” Nelsen said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/09/uk/nuclear-fusion-climate-energy-scn-intl/index.html", "title": "Climate change: A giant donut-shaped machine just proved a near ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThere’s no silver bullet to the climate crisis, but nuclear fusion may be the closest thing to it. In the quest for a near-limitless, zero-carbon source of reliable power, scientists have generated fusion energy before, but they have struggled for decades to sustain it for very long.\n\nOn Wednesday, however, scientists working in the United Kingdom announced that they more than doubled the previous record for generating and sustaining nuclear fusion, which is the same process that allows the sun and stars to shine so brightly.\n\nNuclear fusion is, as its name suggests, the fusing of two or more atoms into one larger one, a process that unleashes a tremendous amount of energy as heat.\n\nThe core of the JET tokamak machine in Culham, England. Christopher Roux (CEA-IRFM)/EUROfusion\n\nNuclear power used today is created by a different process, called fission, which relies on splitting, rather than fusing, atoms. But that process creates waste that can remain radioactive for tens of thousands of years. It’s also potentially hazardous in the event of an accident, such as Japan’s 2011 Fukushima disaster, triggered by an earthquake and tsunami.\n\nFusion, on the other hand, is much safer, can produce little waste and requires only small amounts of abundant, naturally-sourced fuel, including elements extracted from seawater. This makes it an attractive option as the world transitions away from the fossil fuels driving climate change.\n\nIn a giant donut-shaped machine known as a tokamak, scientists working in the English village of Culham, near Oxford, were able to generate a record-breaking 59 megajoules of sustained fusion energy over five seconds on December 21 last year. Five seconds is the limit the machine can sustain the power before its magnets overheat.\n\nA magnetic field is required to contain the high temperatures needed to carry out the fusion process, which can be as high as 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the center of the sun.\n\n“Our experiment showed for the first time that it’s possible to have a sustained fusion process using exactly the same fuel mix planned for future fusion power plants,” Tony Donné, CEO of EUROfusion, said at a press conference.\n\nEUROfusion, a consortium that includes 4,800 experts, students and staff from across Europe, carried out the project in partnership with the UK Atomic Energy Authority. The European Commission also contributed funding.\n\nThe potential for fusion energy is enormous. The experiment used the elements deuterium and tritium – which are isotopes of hydrogen – to fuel the fusion. Those elements are likely to be used in commercial-scale fusion, and can be found in seawater.\n\n“The energy you can get out of the fuel deuterium and tritium is massive. For example, powering the whole of current UK electrical demand for a day would require 0.5 tonnes of deuterium, which could be extracted from seawater – where its concentration is low but plentiful,” Tony Roulstone from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Engineering told CNN.\n\nHe said the fusion generated by the tokamak – called the Joint European Torus (JET) – was around the same as a wind turbine, and could power one house’s energy for a day.\n\nA view of Torus Hall, where the JET tokamak machine lies. UKAEA\n\n“But if generated repeatedly, it could power thousands of houses.”\n\nExperts say the results prove that nuclear fusion is possible, and no longer a pipedream solution for the climate crisis.\n\n“These landmark results have taken us a huge step closer to conquering one of the biggest scientific and engineering challenges of them all,” said Ian Chapman, CEO of the UK Atomic Energy Authority.\n\nMark Wenman, a nuclear materials researcher at Imperial College London, said in a statement that the experiment’s results are “exciting,” and that they show “fusion energy really is no longer just a dream of the far future – the engineering to make it a useful, clean power source is achievable and happening now.”\n\nJET has been subject to such extreme heat and pressure that this experiment is likely the last it will cope with.\n\nBut its results are seen as a huge boon for ITER, a fusion megaproject in the south of France supported by the US, China, the European Union, India, Japan, Korea and Russia. The ITER project is 80% built and aims to begin nuclear fusion sometime in 2025-26.\n\nWhile JET’s goal was to prove that nuclear fusion could be generated and sustained, ITER’s aim is to produce a tenfold return on energy, or 500 MW of fusion power from 50 MW of energy put in.\n\nThe results are promising, but mastering nuclear fusion as an everyday energy source is still likely a long way off.\n\n“The JET results are impressive and probably will get better as they proceed through their experiments. They are producing high power 12 MW, but right now just for five seconds. Much longer fusion burn is what is required,” Roulstone said.\n\nThe most recent report from Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the latest science shows that the world must nearly halve its greenhouse gas emissions this decade and reach zero net emissions by 2050 to keep global warming in check. That means making a rapid transition away from fossil fuels, like coal, oil and gas.\n\nThose actions are required to have any hope of containing warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, seen as a threshold to substantially worsening climate impacts, according to the IPCC.", "authors": ["Danya Gainor Angela Dewan", "Danya Gainor", "Angela Dewan"], "publish_date": "2022/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/world/europa-ridges-greenland-study-scn/index.html", "title": "Jupiter's moon Europa may have a habitable ice shell | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOn Jupiter’s moon Europa, a saltwater ocean exists deep beneath a thick ice shell. Now, a surprising connection between the ice shell and the Greenland ice sheet on Earth has provided new insight: Europa’s ocean may be habitable, according to a new study.\n\nScientists have been intrigued for more than 20 years by dramatic gashes on Europa’s icy surface. These double ridges have crests that can reach almost 1,000 feet (305 meters) high, with wide valleys between them. These features were first imaged by the NASA Galileo spacecraft in the 1990s, but researchers haven’t been able to determine how they formed.\n\nWhile studying the Greenland ice sheet using ice-penetrating radar observations, a team of researchers observed a similar double-ridge feature shaped like the letter M that’s like a miniversion of the one on Europa.\n\nA study detailing the findings published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nWater’s impact on ice sheet topography\n\nAirborne instruments help researchers study Earth’s polar regions to watch changes in ice sheets that could have an effect on the global sea level. These eyes in the sky also look for ponds of surface meltwater, conduits that carry seasonal drainage and subglacial lakes.\n\n“We were working on something totally different related to climate change and its impact on the surface of Greenland when we saw these tiny double ridges – and we were able to see the ridges go from ‘not formed’ to ‘formed,’ ” said study senior author Dustin Schroeder, an associate professor of geophysics at Stanford University’s School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences, in a statement.\n\nOperation IceBridge – a NASA mission that collected surface elevation and radar data of the ice sheet between 2015 and 2017 – revealed that Greenland’s double ridge formed after the ice fractured around water that was refreezing inside the ice sheet. The pressure of the water pocket caused the distinct peaks to rise.\n\nThis led researchers to question if the same thing would be possible on Europa, where pockets of water could exist beneath the ice shell – and create potentially habitable environments on the otherwise inhospitable shell of the moon.\n\n“In Greenland, this double ridge formed in a place where water from surface lakes and streams frequently drains into the near-surface and refreezes,” said lead study author Riley Culberg, a doctoral student in electrical engineering at Stanford, in a statement.\n\n“One way that similar shallow water pockets could form on Europa might be through water from the subsurface ocean being forced up into the ice shell through fractures – and that would suggest there could be a reasonable amount of exchange happening inside of the ice shell.”\n\nAn ever-changing lunar surface\n\nEuropa appears to be a dynamic place, where plumes of water rise up through cracks in the ice shell, which is tens of miles thick. And this ice shell could be a place where the subsurface ocean and nutrients mix together.\n\n“Because it’s closer to the surface, where you get interesting chemicals from space, other moons and the volcanoes of Io (another moon that orbits Jupiter), there’s a possibility that life has a shot if there are pockets of water in the shell,” Schroeder said. “If the mechanism we see in Greenland is how these things happen on Europa, it suggests there’s water everywhere.”\n\nThis was the first time that scientists were able to watch something similar happen on Earth and actually observe the subsurface processes that led to the formation of the ridges, Culberg said.\n\n“The mechanism we put forward in this paper would have been almost too audacious and complicated to propose without seeing it happen in Greenland,” Schroeder said.\n\nThe broad data the team has already collected on Greenland’s ice sheet may allow them to use it as an analog for the dynamic processes occurring on Europa in the future as well.\n\nThe temperature, chemistry and pressure are different on Europa when compared to Greenland, so the team want to investigate how these water pockets work on Europa.\n\nEuropa is a target of two upcoming missions, the European Space Agency’s JUICE (short for the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) and NASA’s Europa Clipper. Clipper will carry ice-penetrating radar, similar to how the researchers studied Greenland, to collect subsurface imaging of Europa’s ice shell.\n\nEuropa stands out as one of the best candidates for hosting extraterrestrial life in our solar system due to the liquid water in the subsurface ocean and what scientists understand about its chemistry, Culberg said.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/world/twilight-zone-luiz-rocha-c2e-scn-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "In the ocean's twilight zone, this diver is discovering vibrant new ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN initiative in partnership with Rolex. Luiz Rocha is a Rolex Laureate.\n\nCNN —\n\nHundreds of feet below the ocean’s surface, somewhere between the dark ocean floor and the bright blue shallows, lies the twilight zone.\n\nIt’s a world of the unknown, but in some tropical and subtropical waters coral reefs thrive. Very few scientists have ventured to these deep reefs, known technically as mesophotic coral ecosystems, meaning “middle light,” and many assumed that the lack of light and chilly temperatures meant few species could exist there.\n\nBut one scientist has been diving into the inky depths to show there’s much more to life there than was first thought.\n\n“When you get up close, it’s a very colorful ecosystem,” says Luiz Rocha, Brazilian ichthyologist (a person who studies fish) and co-director of the Hope for Reefs initiative at the California Academy of Sciences. “There’s many different kinds of fish and many of them are unknown.”\n\nDespite its dimness, the twilight zone is home to fish of a stunning variety of colors, such as the Cirrhilabrus wakanda. Luiz Rocha / 2018 California Academy of Sciences\n\nRocha, whose studies focus on ocean life between 200 and 500 feet deep, was attracted to twilight zone reefs because of their mystery. “Every dive we do to those depths (leads to) a new discovery,” he says.\n\nTo date, he has identified around 30 new species – from a purple fairy wrasse named after the mythical nation of Wakanda, to the Tosanoides aphrodite, a pink and yellow reef fish named after the Greek goddess of love. But his deep-sea explorations have also proven that these reefs and the rainbow-hued species that roam them are under threat. His mission is to protect them.\n\nDiving in\n\nEntering the twilight zone is no easy feat. While it could be reached by submarine, this would be a clumsy way to study fish that flit in and out the shadows, says Rocha, comparing it to studying birds in a rainforest with a helicopter.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Scuba diving scientist shines a light on the world's deep sea reefs 04:07 - Source: CNN\n\nInstead he scuba dives, but the deeper he descends the more dangerous it becomes. Recreational diving is capped at 130 feet for safety reasons, but Rocha dives as far as 500 feet. To do this requires deep concentration, intense technical training and a strong dose of bravery.\n\n“What really makes this research special is that there’s only a handful of scientists in the world doing this,” he says.\n\nRocha usually dives in a group with two scientists and one safety officer. They spend hours preparing the kit, ensuring every piece of equipment is functioning well and that they are equipped to deal with underwater emergencies. The divers must use rebreathers, which recycle the gas exhaled by the diver, and a special breathing gas containing helium that is safe for deep dives.\n\nRocha and a team of divers prepare to explore the twilight zone reefs of the Maldives during a recent expedition. Claudia Rocha © California Academy of Sciences\n\nGetting down takes just 10 to 15 minutes depending on how steep the reef is, says Rocha, but the ascent can take five to six hours to allow the body to decompress.\n\nAll that effort gives him just seven to 10 minutes at maximum depth, where he and his team look for fish, collect DNA samples and record the number of organisms in an area. If they think they have found a new species, they usually catch it and carry it up to the surface in a decompression chamber so they can study the specimen back in the lab.\n\nRelated: Ocean photographer Shawn Heinrichs wants to save the seas\n\nDespite having done it dozens of times, Rocha still feels the pangs of anxiety before each dive. The deeper you go, the darker and colder the water gets, he says. “But when we get there, we know why we’re there. When you see something that nobody has ever seen before … it’s absolutely amazing.”\n\nPlunge into the ocean twilight zone and you'll encounter an array of weird and wonderful species like nothing else found on earth.

Their large eyes make up for a lack of bioluminescence when hunting for prey. Paul Caiger/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Fangtooth -- According to the WHOI the fangtooth has the highest tooth to body ratio of any fish in the ocean. In fact, it's able to catch fish bigger than itself. Sockets in the roof of its mouth prevent the fish's teeth from puncturing its own brain in the process.

But Rocha proved this wrong: “One of our first discoveries is that those deeper reefs are really not a refuge for shallow reef organisms. They are almost as impacted as the shallow reefs are,” he says.\n\nHe has found plastic trash and fishing gear in some of the deepest reefs and has observed the impact of overfishing and climate change. While there is not yet enough data to determine the scale of the damage compared to shallow reefs, he says it is clear that water temperatures are warming in the deeper zones too and causing reefs to bleach.\n\nThis year, Luiz Rocha identified the Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa or rose-veiled fairy wrasse. Yi-Kai Tea\n\nRocha hopes that his research can help to educate people about the twilight zone and inspire action to protect it. He works with policymakers, making the case for marine protected areas where these deep reefs lie. In 2019, the Hope for Reefs initiative was involved in the protection of a coral reef habitat on Maricaban Island in the Philippines, and the year before their research informed the establishment of two protected areas in Brazil.\n\nRelated: A shark ‘superhighway’ is being protected by fishermen\n\nRocha also works closely with local communities, collaborating with local researchers and giving local names to newly discovered species. For instance, earlier this year he and Maldivian biologist Ahmed Najeeb discovered a rainbow-colored fish which they named Cirrhilabrus finifenmaa or rose-veiled fairy wrasse, after the national flower of the Maldives, a pink rose called Finifenmaa.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nIf you feel like there’s less time in the day, you’re correct.\n\nScientists recorded the shortest day on Earth since the invention of the atomic clock.\n\nOur planet’s rotation measured in at 1.59 milliseconds short of the normal 24-hour day on June 29, according to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service, an organization in charge of global timekeeping.\n\nA rotation is the length of time the Earth takes to spin once on its axis, which is roughly 86,400 seconds.\n\nThe previous record was documented on July 19, 2020, when the day measured 1.47 milliseconds shorter than normal.\n\nThe atomic clock is a standardized unit of measurement that has been used since the 1950s to tell time and measure the Earth’s rotation, said Dennis McCarthy, retired director of time at the US Naval Observatory.\n\nDespite June 29 breaking a record for the shortest day in modern history, there have been much shorter days on Earth, he said.\n\nWhen dinosaurs still roamed the planet 70 million years ago, a single day on Earth lasted about 23 1/2 hours, according to a 2020 study published in Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology.\n\nSince 1820, scientists documented Earth’s rotation slowing down, according to NASA. In the past few years, it began speeding up, McCarthy said.\n\nWhy is the speed increasing?\n\nResearchers do not have a definitive answer on how or why Earth is turning slightly faster, but it may be due to glacial isostatic adjustment, or the movement of land due to melting glaciers, McCarthy said.\n\nEarth is slightly wider than it is tall, which makes it an oblate spheroid, he said. The glaciers at the poles weigh down on the Earth’s crust at the North and South poles, McCarthy said.\n\nSince the poles are melting due to the climate crisis, there is less pressure on the top and bottom of the planet, which moves the crust up and makes the Earth rounder, he said. The circular shape helps the planet spin faster, McCarthy said.\n\nIt’s the same phenomenon that figure skaters use to increase and decrease their speed, he said.\n\nWhen skaters stretch their arms away from their body as they spin, it takes more force for them to rotate, he said. When they tuck their arms close to their body, their speed increases because their body mass is closer to their center of gravity, McCarthy said.\n\nAs Earth becomes rounder, its mass becomes closer to its center, which increases its rotational speed, he said.\n\nSome have suggested a correlation with the Chandler wobble, McCarthy said. The axis our planet rotates on is not lined up with its axis of symmetry, an invisible vertical line that divides the Earth into two equal halves.\n\nThis creates a slight wobble as the Earth rotates, similar to how a football wobbles when it is thrown, he said.\n\nWhen a player tosses a football, it wobbles slightly as it rotates since it often doesn’t spin around the axis of symmetry, he said.\n\n“If you’re a really good passer in football, you line up the axis of rotation with the axis of symmetry of the football, and it doesn’t wobble,” McCarthy said.\n\nHowever, McCarthy said the Chandler wobble likely does not affect the rotational speed of Earth because the wobble is due to the planet’s shape. If the planet’s shape changes, it changes the frequency of the wobble, not its rotation frequency, he said.\n\nRemoving a leap second\n\nSince researchers began measuring the Earth’s rotational speed using atomic clocks, Earth had been slowing down its rotational speed, McCarthy said.\n\n“Our day-to-day existence doesn’t even recognize that millisecond,” McCarthy said. “But if these things add up, then it could change the rate at which we insert a leap second.”\n\nIn the instances when the milliseconds build up over time, the scientific community has added a leap second to the clock to slow down our time to match Earth’s, he said. There have been 27 leap seconds added since 1972, according to EarthSky.\n\nBecause Earth is now rotating faster, a leap second would need to be taken away to catch our timekeeping up with Earth’s increasing rotational speed, McCarthy said.\n\nIf the planet continues this rotational trend, the removal of a leap second likely wouldn’t need to happen for another three to four years, he said.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/world/doomsday-clock-2022-climate-scn/index.html", "title": "The Doomsday Clock reveals how close we are to...doom | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Doomsday Clock has been ticking for exactly 75 years. But it’s no ordinary clock.\n\nIt attempts to gauge how close humanity is to destroying the world.\n\nOn Thursday, the clock was set at 100 seconds until midnight – the same time it has been since 2020.\n\nThe clock isn’t designed to definitively measure existential threats, but rather to spark conversations about difficult scientific topics such as climate change, according to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, which created the clock in 1947.\n\n“One hundred seconds to midnight reflects the Board’s judgment that we are stuck in a perilous moment – one that brings neither stability nor security. Positive developments in 2021 failed to counteract negative, long-term trends,” said Sharon Squassoni, co-chair of the Bulletin’s Science and Security Board, which sets the clock. Squasson is also a research professor at the Institute for International Science and Technology Policy at The George Washington University.\n\nWhat is the Doomsday Clock?\n\nThe Bulletin of Atomic Scientists was a group of atomic scientists who worked on the Manhattan Project, the code name for the development of the atomic bomb during World War II.\n\nOriginally, it was conceived to measure nuclear threats, but in 2007 the Bulletin made the decision to include climate change in its calculations.\n\nOver the last three-quarters of a century, the clock’s time has changed, according to how close the scientists believe the human race is to total destruction. Some years the time changes, and some years it doesn’t.\n\nThe Doomsday Clock is set every year by the experts on the Bulletin’s Science and Security Board in consultation with its Board of Sponsors, which includes 11 Nobel laureates.\n\nAlthough the clock has been an effective wake-up call when it comes to reminding people about the cascading crises the planet is facing, some have questioned the 75-year-old clock’s usefulness.\n\n“It’s an imperfect metaphor,” Michael E. Mann, climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, told CNN, highlighting that the clock’s framing combines different types of risk that have different characteristics and occur in different timescales. Still, he adds it “remains an important rhetorical device that reminds us, year after year, of the tenuousness of our current existence on this planet.”\n\nTheoretical physicist and former member of the Bulletin’s Board of Sponsors Lawrence Krauss said it can be difficult to take the clock’s results seriously since it’s been ticking dangerously close to the end of civilization in the last few decades. Each year, he said, as the clock nears midnight, scientists would have to gauge how much available “real estate” is left before deciding on how much farther to move the clock.\n\n“Now, it ticks in seconds; it used to be minutes,” Krauss told CNN. “It is clearly not a quantifiable scientific assessment, more of a qualitative one. What has always been important is the movement of the clock, not its absolute value.”\n\nEvery model has constraints, said Eryn MacDonald, analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Global Security Program, adding that the Bulletin has made thoughtful decisions each year on how to get the people’s attention about existential threats and the required action.\n\n“While I wish we could go back to talking about minutes to midnight instead of seconds, unfortunately that no longer reflects reality,” she told CNN.\n\nWhat happens if the clock reaches midnight?\n\nThe clock has never reached midnight, and Rachel Bronson, Bulletin president and CEO, hopes it never will.\n\n“When the clock is at midnight, that means there’s been some sort of nuclear exchange or catastrophic climate change that’s wiped out humanity,” she said. “So we never really want to get there and we won’t know it when we do.”\n\nHow accurate is the clock?\n\nThe clock’s time isn’t meant to measure threats, but rather to spark conversation and encourage public engagement in scientific topics like climate change and nuclear disarmament.\n\nIf the clock is able to do that, then Bronson views it as a success.\n\nWhen a new time is set on the clock, people listen, she said. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson cited the Doomsday Clock when talking about the climate crisis the world is facing, Bronson noted.\n\nBronson said she hopes people will discuss whether they agree with their decision and have fruitful talks about what the driving forces of the change are.\n\nIt’s still possible to move the clock back with bold, concrete actions. In fact, the hand has moved farthest away from midnight with a whopping 17 minutes before midnight in 1991, when President George H.W. Bush’s administration signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with the Soviet Union. In 2016, the clock was at three minutes before midnight as a result of the Iran nuclear agreement and the Paris climate accord.\n\nWhat can an individual do to turn back time on the clock?\n\nDon’t underestimate the power of talking about these important issues with your peers, Bronson said.\n\n“You might not feel it because you’re not doing anything, but we know that public engagement moves (a) leader to do things,” she said.\n\nFor climate change, look at your daily habits and see if there are small changes you can make in your life such as how often you walk versus drive and how your home is heated, Bronson explained.", "authors": ["Megan Marples Rachel Ramirez", "Megan Marples", "Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/04/us/elkhorn-coral-spawn-florida-aquarium-climate/index.html", "title": "Scientists at Florida Aquarium make major breakthrough in race to ...", "text": "Florida Keys CNN —\n\nScientists at the Florida Aquarium have made a breakthrough in the race to save Caribbean coral: For the first time, marine biologists have successfully reproduced elkhorn coral, a critical species, using aquarium technology.\n\nIt’s a historic step forward, and one they hope could help revitalize Caribbean ecosystems and could pay humans back by offering extra protection from the fury of hurricanes.\n\nElkhorn coral once dominated the Caribbean. But, just as other vital coral ecosystems are degrading around the world, elkhorn are now rarely seen alive in the wild. This species — so important because it provides the building blocks for reefs to flourish — has been until now notoriously difficult to grow in aquariums.\n\nWhich is why scientists were thrilled when they saw their reproductive experiment was a success.\n\n“When it finally happened, the first sense is just sheer relief.” said Keri O’Neil, the senior scientist that oversees the Tampa aquarium’s spawning lab. “This is a critical step to preventing elkhorn coral from going extinct in the state of Florida.”\n\nO’Neil’s colleagues call her the “coral whisperer” because she has managed to spawn so many varieties of coral. Elkhorn marks the aquarium’s 14th species spawned inside the Apollo Beach lab, but the team ranks it as its most important yet.\n\nO’Neil estimates there are only about 300 elkhorn coral left in the Florida Keys Reef Tract — but the spawning experiment produced thousands of baby coral. She expects up to 100 of them could survive into adulthood.\n\nNamed for its resemblance to elk antlers, the coral thrives at the top of reefs, typically growing in water depths of less than 20 feet. This makes their colonies crucial for breaking up large waves. During peak hurricane season, reefs are a silent but powerful ally that protects Florida’s coastlines from storm surges, which are growing larger as sea levels rise.\n\n“As these reefs die, they begin to erode away and we lose that coastal protection as well as all of the habitat that these reefs provide for fish and other species,” O’Neil said. “Now there are so few left, there’s just a few scattered colonies. But we’re really focusing on restoring the elkhorn coral population for coastal protection.”\n\nJust as other vital coral ecosystems are degrading around the world, elkhorn are now rarely seen alive in the wild. Ead72/Adobe Stock\n\nThe Florida Aquarium’s news comes after scientists reported in early August that the Great Barrier Reef was showing the largest extent of coral cover in 36 years. But the outlook for coral around the world is grim — studies have shown that the climate crisis could kill all of Earth’s coral reefs by the end of the century.\n\nElkhorn coral was listed as federally threatened under the US Endangered Species Act in 2006 after scientists found that disease cut the population by 97% since the 1980s. And ocean warming is its largest threat. As ocean temperature rises, coral expels the symbiotic algae that lives inside it and produces nutrients. This is the process of coral bleaching, and it typically ends in death for the coral.\n\n“They’re dying around the world,” O’Neil told CNN. “We are at a point now where they may never be the same. You can’t have the ocean running a fever every summer and not expect there to be impacts.”\n\n‘You know that’s impossible’\n\nElkhorn coral seem to have something analogous to a fertility problem. Its reproduction is sporadic in the wild, making it difficult to sustain a much-needed increase in population. Because of its low reproductive rate, genetic diversity can also be very low, making them more susceptible to disease.\n\n“You could say they’re successfully having sex, but they’re not successfully making babies [in the wild],” O’Neil said. “Terrestrial animals do this all the time. When you have an endangered panda or chimpanzee, the first thing you do is start a breeding program, but coral reproduction is super weird.”\n\nThe most challenging part for O’Neil’s team was doing the unprecedented — getting the coral to spawn in a lab. O’Neil said other researchers doubted they could pull it off.\n\n“We faced a lot of criticism from people,” she said. They would say “‘you can’t keep those in an aquarium. You know that’s impossible!’”\n\nThey were right. At first.\n\nElkhorn coral only spawn once a year. In the lab’s 2021 experiment, the environment was strictly controlled to imitate natural conditions. Using LED lights, they accurately mimicked sunrise, sunset and moon cycles. But the coral didn’t spawn.\n\nWe “realized that the timing of moonrise was off by about three hours,” O’Neil said.\n\nAfter that frustrating failure, the aquarium’s scientists knew they had a much better shot this year. And, with support from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Restoration Center and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Florida Aquarium did in August what was thought impossible by some peers.\n\nA microscope image of the baby coral that spawned at the Florida Aquarium. Courtesy of The Florida Aquarium\n\nThe spawning could be a game-changer, according to Thomas Frazer, the dean of the College of Marine Science at the University of South Florida, and it could lead to a future where coral is more resilient to the dramatic changes brought by the climate crisis.\n\n“This type of work really matters,” Frazer told CNN. “Corals selected for restoration might, for example, be more resistant to warmer ocean temperatures and bleaching, exhibit skeletal properties that are able to withstand more intense wave energy, or traits that might make them more resistant to disease or other environmental stressors.”\n\nMargeret W. Miller is a coral ecologist who has focused on restoration research for more than two decades. Miller co-authored a study in 2020 that found the elkhorn rate of reproduction in the Upper Florida Keys was so low, it would indicate the species was already “functionally extinct” and could be wiped out in six to 12 years.\n\nMiller said the Florida Aquarium’s breakthrough will open new doors to tackle the larger restoration effort.\n\n“Because this species is an important restoration target, the capacity for spawning under human care opens lots of research opportunities to develop interventions that might make restoration efforts more resilient to climate change and other environmental threats,” Miller told CNN.\n\nA researcher works with the newly spawned coral in an aquarium. Courtesy of The Florida Aquarium\n\nMiller said more research needs to be done to make sure lab-spawning elkhorn coral is reasonably safe and effective, to be used in species conservation.\n\n“This sort of captive spawning is not a tool that directly addresses widespread coral restoration at the global scale that would match the scale of the need. Indeed, no current coral restoration efforts meet that scale, and none will truly succeed unless we can take serious action to ensure that coral reef habitats can remain in a viable condition where corals can thrive,” Miller told CNN.\n\nThe climate crisis is the ultimate problem that needs to be solved, Miller said. The rapid increase in ocean temperature needs to be addressed, along with threats to water quality. Still, she said, the ability to grow elkhorn in a lab is an important tool in the restoration effort.\n\n“The research on coral propagation and interventions that can be enabled by captive spawning efforts can, however, buy time for us to make such changes effectively before corals disappear from our reefs completely,” Miller said.\n\nBuying time\n\nElkhorn branches can grow as much as five inches per year, making it one of the fastest-growing coral species, according to NOAA. And based on observations from the Florida Aquarium scientists, their new elkhorn coral babies will take three to five years to become sexually mature.\n\nWithin a year or two, scientists intend to replant these lab-grown corals in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.\n\nIn the race to restore the reefs, scientists agree this breakthrough is only a first step.\n\n“We are really buying time,” O’Neil said. “We’re buying time for the reef. We’re buying time for the corals.”\n\nThe ultimate goal is a breeding program where scientists could select for genetic diversity and breed more resilient coral capable of withstanding threats like pollution, warming ocean waters and disease.\n\nThen nature can take the wheel.\n\n“There is hope for coral reefs,” O’Neil said. “Don’t give up hope. It’s all not lost. However, we need to make serious changes in our behavior to save this planet.”", "authors": ["Isabel Rosales"], "publish_date": "2022/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/world/ants-twenty-quadrillion-earth-intl-scli-scn/index.html", "title": "Scientists estimated how many ants there are on Earth | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAnts are tiny in size but not in number. There are about 20 quadrillion ants on the Earth at any given time, a new study has estimated. That’s 20,000 trillion individuals.\n\nThe estimate is two to 20 times higher than previous ones, according to the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday.\n\n“We were very surprised about the large number of ants we found,” Sabine S. Nooten, an insect ecologist and temporary principal investigator at the University of Würzburg in Germany, told CNN Tuesday. Nooten was a co-lead author of the study.\n\n“We virtually didn’t have any expectations because the numbers which floated around beforehand in scientific literatures were basically educated guesses, and they had very little empirical data to work from,” she added. “And, so, this is the novelty of our study because we synthesized the data from a lot of empirical studies.”\n\nThe previous global estimate of between 1 quadrillion and 10 quadrillion ants by renowned biologists Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson assumed that they made up approximately 1% of the world’s estimated insect population of 1 quintillion individuals, according to the study.\n\nHowever, the research team of this latest study based the new estimate on observational evidence from an extensive data set of globally distributed ant samples. The authors identified and assessed 465 suitable studies, encompassing 1,306 sampling locations, covering all continents and major biomes where ants live.\n\nScientists could use the study’s comprehensive data set, which spans 80 years, to predict what future communities or environments might look like, according to Nooten. For example, the team estimated the number of ground-dwelling ants, which densely populate tropical and subtropical regions, such as South American forests, to be around 3 quadrillion.\n\n“We might be able to already see change over time in our data set,” co-lead author Patrick Schultheiss, a temporary principal investigator at the University of Würzburg, told CNN. Schultheiss highlighted that changes in agriculture or the way that forests have been logged could have an impact on the number of ants.\n\nThere are an estimated 3 quadrillion ground-dwelling ants. Rundstedt B. Rovillos/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\n“No one has ever assembled a data set on ants on a global scale,” Schultheiss said. He added that while they knew from studies that ant numbers were very high in the tropical forests of West Africa compared with regions in the Arctic, “we didn’t know what the picture is – how many numbers there were.”\n\nThe estimated abundance of ants exceeds the combined biomass – that is, the total mass – of wild birds and mammals and is equivalent to about 20% of human biomass, according to the study.\n\n“A surprisingly common question I get asked is ‘How many ants are there on Earth?’ and although there are some estimates, none of the numbers being used have felt robust,” Adam Hart, professor of science communication at the University of Gloucestershire, England, told CNN. Hart, who is also vice president of UK’s Royal Entomological Society, was not involved in the study.\n\n“This new study, based on nearly 500 studies across the world, gives us the best answer yet to this tricky question. The astounding thing is not just the overall number, but the proportion of biomass that ants represent – a fifth of the biomass of all humans. It really underlines just how important ants really are,” he added.\n\nA ‘conservative’ figure\n\nThe global data set could help track environmental changes by looking at changes in ant numbers. Karunakaran Parameswaran Pillai/500px/Getty Images\n\nThe estimated overall number is almost unimaginably huge, but the study authors said it is “conservative.” This is because they could not gather all the data they wanted to include.\n\nFor example, many ants live underground, but there were no studies available that could provide the numbers on how many, Schultheiss said. There are ants in the very far north and the very far south, like the subantarctic region, but there were not enough studies of ants in those areas to make a mathematical estimate.\n\nCitizen scientists could fill these gaps, according to Schultheiss, who said non-scientists, even school students, could contribute to the data set in an impactful way by simply collecting leaf litter, getting all the ants out and counting how many there are.\n\n“We hope to inspire people, first of all to respect nature, to enjoy nature, because it’s just amazing what ants can do and on what scale. But, also, if they’re willing to contribute to science with a very simple method, even very simple data can have enormous value,” he added.", "authors": ["Amarachi Orie"], "publish_date": "2022/09/20"}]}

And, man, to get all of those things to line up – it’s immense.”\n\nThe Pops’ 2016-17 season will be performed at Downtown’s Taft Theatre, the orchestra’s “home away from home” while Music Hall undergoes a major renovation. In anticipation of the temporary move, the Taft received a $3.2 million renovation in 2011.\n\nBeing at the Taft, says Russell, “harkens back to the time when I was there for Home for the Holidays, and it’s a little rough around the edges, but we gussied it up and did our show for seven years. What I loved was that we had a smaller stage space and the orchestra’s ensemble was so tight.”\n\nAnd the orchestra is offering a big incentive to entice the interested Downtown. Subscribers of five concerts at the Taft will receive a free ticket to one of the summer performances, including the one by the legendary Franklin. The summer season’s 2016 concerts will take place both at the Taft Theatre and outdoors at Riverbend Music Center.\n\nFranklin, named No. 1 on Rolling Stone’s list of “The Greatest Singers of All Time,” will visit the Pops at Riverbend on July 24. She has earned 18 Grammy Awards – that includes a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and Grammy Living Legend Award – as well as the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Although her program is not yet announced, you might hear hits such as \"Respect\" and \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\" and \"Think.\"\n\nAnother highlight will be the bubbly Broadway personality Kristin Chenoweth, who will make her debut at the Pops’ outdoor home at Riverbend on June 25. The Tony- and Emmy-winning actress is perhaps best known as the original Glinda in “Wicked,” for her role on TV’s “Pushing Daisies” and for many films. The petite star with the powerhouse voice will perform her hits from Broadway and the silver screen.\n\nThe Pops’ will kick off its four-concert summer season on June 10-11 indoors at the Taft Theatre with two screenings of the 1982 Steven Spielberg film “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.” The orchestra will perform the film score – it won John Williams an Academy Award – live as the film is projected on the big screen.\n\n“It’s an emotional and moving score,” Russell says, “and you’ll experience it with air conditioning, popcorn and the orchestra right in your lap.”\n\nSummertime will also include the Pops’ annual Independence Day concert, this year on July 2. The patriotic salute at Riverbend Music Center celebrates the 75th anniversary of the USO and will include singers and dancers and the annual Rozzi fireworks display after the concert.\n\n“Of course, the USO began with entertainment, with folks like Bob Hope, Bette Midler, Connie Stevens, Bruce Springsteen and the list goes on and on,” Russell says. “We’ll pay tribute to what they are doing now in supporting wounded warriors and families. It’s appropriate for the Fourth of July, as we celebrate independence, that we also are recognizing the enormous contribution of our men and women in uniform.”\n\nThe Pops’ fall season opens Sept. 16-18 with all-orchestral evening of music from action and adventure movies, including sci-fi, crime dramas and adventure fantasy films. Academy Award-nominated actor Edward James Olmos (of the television shows \"Battlestar Galactica\" and “Miami Vice\") will serve as narrator.\n\nOlmos, who was propelled to prominence in “Blade Runner,” will provide behind-the-scenes stories and anecdotes, similar to the way “Star Trek” star George Takei took audiences “backstage” in his past Pops appearance, says Russell who will conduct music from blockbusters such as “Jurassic Park,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and “Mission Impossible.”\n\nBroadway, television and film star Vanessa Williams will visit the Pops for “One Night Only” on Oct. 9. She’ll revisit some of her songs that have soared on the Billboard charts, such as “Dreamin’,” “Save the Best for Last,” “Running Back to You” and \"Colors of the Wind.\"\n\n“She’had 16 Grammy nominations, she’s the star of ‘Ugly Betty,’ and she also is a Tony-nominated Broadway star. She’s a triple threat,” says Russell.\n\nIn November, the orchestra goes country with Sara Evans, a multi-platinum country music singer with one foot in contemporary, another in traditional country. The program will include some of the great American songbook that Russell and the orchestra presented in “American Originals,” the concert and live album in January of 2015.\n\nDecember is the orchestra’s busiest time. Early in the month, the Pops presents its annual “Holiday Pops,” this time headlined by Melinda Doolittle, star of American Idol,” accompanied by the traditional cast of singers and dancers and a visit from Santa.\n\nOn Dec. 20, the Pops will collaborate with the popular Cincinnati folk rock duo Over the Rhine, for a single-night Christmas concert at the Taft, featuring music from the duo’s own holiday-winter solstice program. The Pops is creating new orchestral arrangements for this collaboration that grew out of Over the Rhine’s participation in “American Originals” last year.\n\nAnd on Dec. 23, the orchestra will perform the film score live, in synch to the animated family movie, “The Snowman.” The illustrated children’s book was made into a film by Howard Blake. The hit tune is “I’m Walking in the Air,” which the Pops has recorded on a holiday CD.\n\n“It’s hauntingly beautiful,” Russell says. “In the film, a 9-year-old boy makes a snowman that comes to life, they fly to the North Pole, meet Santa Claus, the snowman flies home and tucks him in, and he wakes up the next day and finds that the snowman has melted. Was it a dream? All I can say, it is the most charming, sentimental, lyrical film for kids from 1 to 92.”\n\nIn January, Melissa Etheridge will visit the Taft for a single date, Jan. 8, with her own conductor.

Billboard declared the song “Hard Times” to be “an addictive, Talking Heads-inspired jam that sounds like it could follow ‘Ain’t It Fun’ as a Hot 100 smash,” while Rolling Stone praising “Told You So” as “polyrhythmic funk-pop.” And Variety raved about the album: “Paramore has never sounded — or looked — more defiantly joyous... ‘After Laughter’ sounds like it’s about when life kicks you in the gonads.

In an interview with Pitchfork, Robin Pecknold talked about the inspiration for the single – his relatoinship with Skyler Skjelset, the childhood friend with whom he formed Fleet Foxes in 2006. The date in the title refers to May 3, 2011, the release date of “Helplessness Blues,” their previous effort, after which they embarked on a lengthy hiatus. It’s also Skjelset’s birthday. “It addresses our distance in the years after touring that album, the feeling of having an unresolved, unrequited relationship that is lingering psychologically,\" Pecknold said. \"Even if some time apart was necessary and progressive for both of us as individuals, I missed our connection, especially the one we had when we were teenagers, and the lyrics for the song grew out of that feeling.”\n\n9/26: Imagine Dragons\n\nImagine Dragons are launching their tour in support of “Evolve” at Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sept. 26 with special guests Grouplove and K.Flay.\n\n“Evolve” is set to be released June 23.

All ages welcome.\n\nNow celebrating more than 50 years of touring, Rush's impact on the American music scene has been profound. He helped shape the folk revival in the '60s and the renaissance of the '80s and '90s, his music having left its stamp on generations of artists. Rush’s early recordings introduced the world to the work of Joni Mitchell, Jackson Browne and James Taylor, and in more recent years his Club 47 concerts have brought artists such as Nanci Griffith and Shawn Colvin to wider audiences when they were just beginning to build their own reputations.\n\nRush began his musical career in the early '60s playing the Boston-area clubs while a Harvard student. The Club 47 was the flagship of the coffee house fleet, and he was soon holding down a weekly spot there, learning from the legendary artists who came to play, honing his skills and growing into his talent. He had released two albums by the time he graduated. Rush displayed then, as he does today, an uncanny knack for finding wonderful songs, and writing his own - many of which have become classics re-interpreted by new generations. Signed by Elektra in 1965, Rush made three albums for them, culminating in “The Circle Game,” which, according to Rolling Stone, ushered in the singer-songwriter era.\n\nPepsi Amphitheater season\n\nLooking to beat the Phoenix heat while taking in an outdoor concert?

And that means more seats have been added for the show.\n\nThe additional tickets go on sale at 11 a.m. Monday, May 8 at the Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., in Phoenix, or online at celebritytheatre.com. To charge by phone, call 602-267-1600 ext. 1. All tickets are subject to facility and ticketing surcharges. All ages welcome.\n\nWilson launched the “Pet Sounds” tour last year to honor the 50th anniversary of the Beach Boys’ finest hour with two fellow Beach Boys – Al Jardine and Blondie Chaplin – joining in the celebration (although Matthew Jardine, Al’s son, would go on to be the MVP with those amazing high notes when the tour played Phoenix last year).\n\nReleased on May 16, 1966, “Pet Sounds” is among the most acclaimed recordings in the history of rock and roll, with NME, Uncut and Mojo all declaring it the greatest album of all time. And with good reason.\n\nWilson started working on the \"Pet Sounds\" sessions while the other Beach Boys were off touring on the hits. Inspired by the Beatles’ “Rubber Soul,” he set out to create a masterpiece that marked a huge departure from the classic Beach Boys sound, although he’d hinted at the new direction in the more ambitious moments of “Today.”\n\n“It’s really been a trip to sit here and think about releasing Pet Sounds 50 years ago,” Wilson says. “I love performing this album with my band and look forward to playing it for fans all across the world.”\n\nIn addition to a full performance of the classic album, Wilson will be treating fans to highlights of his 54-year career with the Beach Boys as well as solo cuts.\n\nIn my review of last year’s show, I wrote:\n\nIt’s a magical — at times transcendent — night, an opportunity to witness Wilson reconnect as best he can with “Pet Sounds” in a 50th anniversary celebration of an undisputed masterpiece whose legacy hasn’t endured so much as blossomed with each passing year.\n\nIt’s a beautiful album whose bittersweet charms are heightened, in a way — made more cathartic and more poignant — by those obvious reminders that the man who poured his heart and soul into the making of that masterpiece has never been the same. Could never be the same. Will never be the same.\n\nAnd here he was revisiting “You Still Believe in Me,” “I’m Waiting For the Day,” “God Only Knows,” “I Know There’s an Answer,” “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times,” the heartache, the longing, the vulnerability he brought to those recordings duly underscored by the realities of Wilson’s life.\n\nThis was especially true of his vocal on “Caroline, No,” the album’s final song, on which a girlfriend’s haircut is the catalyst for a heartbreaking ballad about wishing he could go back to the way things used to be.\n\nHe’s assembled a stellar assortment of backing musicians for the tour, including fellow Beach Boy Al Jardine, who actually appears on “Pet Sounds,” and another former Beach Boy, Blondie Chaplin, who joined in the ‘70s.\n\nThere were 10 or 11 musicians on stage, including several multi-instrumentalists, allowing him to capture every richly textured nuance of the album — French horn, xylophone, saxophone, bass harmonica, electrotheremin, several keyboards, flute and a wide assortment of percussion instruments.\n\nThat also meant a wealth of vocalists on hand to reconstruct those awe-inspiring harmonies, with Matt Jardine emerging as the evening's MVP on that front, nailing every key falsetto part.\n\n7/19: Chris Isaak\n\nChris Isaak returns to the Celebrity Theatre on Wednesday, July 19th, for an 8 p.m. show.\n\nTickets ($60 and $90) go on sale at 10 a.m. this Friday, May 5 at the Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., Phoenix, celebritytheatre.com and 602-267-1600 ext. 1.\n\nThe star has worn his share of hats since \"Wicked Game\" turned up in David Lynch's \"Wild at Heart.” He’s been a talk-show host, a sitcom star, a SWAT commander in \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" No. 68 on of VH1's list of sexiest artists and a singer whose music continues to embody the qualities that made his early records so evocative.\n\n\"First Comes the Night,\" his latest effort, finds Isaak channeling the sound and spirit of the Sun recording artists he saluted on \"Beyond the Sun,\" especially Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, while sounding more timeless than retro.\n\n“My last release was ‘Beyond The Sun’ — my tribute to Sun Records with a lot of covers,” Isaak says. “So this time around I had a lot of new material that I was thrilled to record.”\n\nThis is the first time album Isaak has written and recorded so much in Nashville, a change in location he explored partly upon the suggestion of his friend Stevie Nicks. For all the firsts, there’s a strong through-line that continues from Isaak’s earlier triumphs like “Silvertone” (1985) and “Heart Shaped World” (1989).\n\n“I guess you can make a drink with many ingredients, but if one is very strong, that’s what you taste,” says Isaak with a laugh. “For better or worse, I have a tendency to dominate because I have a big voice and some twisted ideas.”\n\nAs for the show, expect the usual mixture of pathos and humor from Isaak and his band.\n\nDoors open at 6 p.m All tickets are subject to a surcharge.\n\n10/31: Halsey\n\nSpend Halloween with Halsey when the singer brings her U.S. tour to Talking Stick Resort Arena on Oct. 31 with PartyNextDoor and Charli XCX.\n\nThe eight-week tour is in support of Halsey’s second album, “hopeless fountain kingdom,” out June 2.\n\nPre-sales run May 8 through May 11 at hfktour.com, with general on-sale scheduled for May 12. For every pair of online tickets purchased, fans will have access to redeem one physical copy of the new release.\n\nAT&T is sending customers to the front of the line with AT&T priority pre-sale ticket access beginning at 10 a.m. Tuesday, May 9, through the AT&T THANKS program.

Fans can visit findmeinthekingdom.com for all available pre-order offers, including exclusive bundles, merch, vinyl and more.\n\nNow 22, the singer broke through with a platinum debut titled “Badlands” in 2015. She’s best known for the singles “New Americana” and this year’s “Now or Never” – unless, of course, you count her featured vocal on the Chainsmokers’ seven-times-platinum chart-topper “Closer.” And really, why would you not count that?\n\n8/30: Linkin Park\n\nLinkin Park will bring their One More Light World Tour to Talking Stick Resort Arena on Aug. 30 with Machine Gun Kelly. And fans will get first access to those tickets through a special presale aimed at circumventing bots and other scalpers.\n\nThe Linkin Park Presale – powered by Ticketmaster Verified Fan, will utilize fan-first technology to level the playing field and ensure fans compete against other fans – not software – for tickets. The more you participate, the higher your spot in line and the better your access to tickets. Linkin Park Fan Club (LPU) members will get priority, but anyone can work their way to the top.\n\nPre-sale begins May 9. Fans and LPU members can register for the tour pre-sale right now at presale.linkinpark.com.\n\nGeneral tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. May 12, at ticketmaster.com and livenation.com. Every full-priced ticket purchased for the tour includes a choice of a standard CD or standard digital copy of “One More Light,” their much-anticipated seventh album, which arrives on May 19 on Warner Bros. Records. Their most personal album to date, it’s built on the stories of six voices coming clean about their lives and struggles, as if it were the first time. As the press release says, “OML isn’t bigger, louder, or more avant-garde, it’s more human.”\n\nThe set list will combine their biggest hits and songs from the new album.\n\n“Our fans know how much love we put into our live show,” says guitarist Brad Delson. “They know how much we enjoy the connection when we play a fan favorite on stage. The emotional and sonic content of this new batch of songs is going to bring a whole new dimension to the show.”\n\nOne dollar from every full-priced ticket sold will benefit Music For Relief, the charity foundation Linkin Park founded in 2005 to aid survivors of natural disaster. For further info go to www.musicforrelief.org\n\n9/21: Janet Jackson\n\nJanet Jackson is bringing the State of the World Tour to Talking Stick Resort Arena Thursday, Sept. 21.\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, May 5, at ticketmaster.com.\n\nProduced by Live Nation, the State of the World Tour is set for a 56-city run beginning September 7, in Lafayette. Tickets for the newly scheduled dates will go on sale on May 5. Tickets held for previous “Unbreakable” tour events that are now re-scheduled will be honored at the new dates. For more information please visit livenation.com.\n\nThe legendary entertainer began her sold out “Unbreakable” tour in August 2015, but just one year ago reached out directly to fans via Twitter with news of her focusing on starting a family, confirmed months later with the arrival of her first child. Jackson has taken the past year to enjoy pregnancy and motherhood, and is now ready to return to the live stage to give the fans everything they could hope for in one epic concert event. The State of the World Tour is a continuation of the “Unbreakable” tour and will include fan favorites from her chart-topping “Unbreakable” album, an array of the socially conscious music she’s released throughout her career, and other smash hits and soon-to-be released new tracks with a state of the art live production.\n\nJackson has won six Grammys, two Emmys, a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for an Academy Award along with dozens of American Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards and Billboard Music Awards. She has received accolades as an actress as well, including the NAACP Best Supporting Actor award. With sales of more than 160 million records worldwide, Jackson stands as one of the best-selling artists of all time with a string of hits that have left an indelible impression on pop culture.\n\n7/14: Anthony Hamilton\n\nGrammy-winning neo-soul singer Anthony Hamilton will play the Celebrity Theatre at 8:30 p.m. Friday, July 14.\n\nTickets ($41, $51 and $61) are on sale now at Celebrity Theatre or online at www.celebritytheatre.com. To charge by phone, call 602-267-1600 ext.1.\n\nIt's been 13 years since a slow-burning ballad called \"Charlene” hit the pop charts, positioning North Carolina-born Hamilton as a major player in the soul revival a year after singing the hook on the Nappy Roots' rap track \"Po' Folks\" earned the singer his first Grammy nomination. And although he hasn't had much luck crossing over to the pop charts since that debut single, Hamilton's still making good on the artistic promise of those early records on his latest album, last year’s “What I’m Feelin’.”\n\nOther song of note include “Can’t Let Go,” which topped the Adult R&B charts, and “You Got the Love I Need,” a collaboration with Al Green for which he won a Grammy.\n\n10/14: Harry Styles\n\nHarry Styles of One Direction is playing Comerica Theatre on Oct. 14.\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, May 5 at ticketmaster.com and the Comerica box office. Fan registration for all North American dates has already begun through Ticketmaster’s Verified Fan program. Supplies are limited, further information here.\n\nStyles’ self-titled debut album will be released globally on Friday, May 12. The 10-track album features the lead single “Sign of the Times,” which topped the charts in more than 84 countries the day it was released. The album was executive produced by Jeff Bhasker, with additional production from Alex Salibian, Tyler Johnson and Kid Harpoon.\n\nStyles began to showcase the live show with his debut performance on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” where he premiered the album track “Ever Since New York” and the single “Sign of the Times,” with an additional performance of the single on BBC talk show “The Graham Norton Show.” He is set for upcoming appearances on NBC’s “Today Show Summer Concert Series” May 9, followed by a week-long residency on CBS’ “The Late Late Show with James Corden” May 15-18.\n\n11/18: Fall Out Boy\n\nTalking Stick Resort Arena in downtown Phoenix is the final stop on the “M A N I A” tour for Fall Out Boy on Saturday, Nov. 18.\n\nPre-sale tickets will be available beginning Monday, May 1. General tickets will be available at 10 a.m. Friday, May 5, at ticketmaster.com.\n\nOne dollar of every ticket sold will benefit a number of Chicago-area charities via the newly launched Fall Out Boy Fund.\n\nThe news of the tour was accompanied by the release of “Young and Menace,” the first taste of their seventh album, “M A N I A,” which is set to arrive Sept. 15.\n\nPete Wentz says, “There’s a lyric in the song, ‘trying to send the world a message, I was young and a menace,’ that reminded me of growing up in the suburbs of Chicago. I didn't look like anyone there or feel like anyone – I felt like an outsider in my own town. It wasn't until I discovered punk rock and that community that I realized I did fit in somewhere in this world – with the other people who didn't fit in. It’s hard to rationalize rage – it’s hard to quantify anxiety ... this song does neither, it embraces the wave.\"\n\nThe album is their follow-up album to “American Beauty/American Psycho,” a platinum effort that debuted at No. 1 on Billboard in early 2015.\n\n7/12: Kendrick Lamar\n\nKendrick Lamar is launching The DAMN. Tour at Gila River Arena in Glendale on Wednesday, July 12, with Travis Scott and D.R.A.M.\n\nThe DAMN. Tour follows a spectacular appearance at Coachella, which you can read about in our review here, and the release of his critically acclaimed fourth album, “DAMN.,” his third release to hit the charts at No. 1, selling more than 603,000 album units.\n\nPitchfork hailed “DAMN.” As “a widescreen masterpiece of rap, full of expensive beats, furious rhymes, and peerless storytelling about Kendrick’s destiny in America” while Rolling Stone called it “a dazzling display of showy rhyme skills, consciousness-raising political screeds, self-examination and bass-crazy-kicking.”\n\nTickets go on sale to the general public starting at 10 a.m. Friday, April 28. For complete presale details and ticket information, please visit www.ticketmaster.co\n\n7/18: Earth, Wind & Fire with Chic\n\nEarth, Wind & Fire and CHIC ft. Nile Rodgers will bring 2054 The Tour to Talking Stick Resort Arena on July 18 with a DJ and a specialized seating configuration toward the front of the stage where seats will have additional space between them to encourage fans to dance, dance, dance, dance as Chic would put it (yowzah, yowzah, yowzah)\n\nTickets go on sale at 10 a.m. Friday, April 28, at www.ticketmaster.com. American Express cardholders will have access to presale tickets in select cities beginning 10 a.m. Monday, April 24.

Get your feet ready for a deluge of hits,\" says Rodgers, who was honored with an Award for Musical Excellence from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Earth, Wind & Fire were inducted in 2000.\n\n11/4: Sebastian Maniscalco reschedules\n\nSebastian Maniscalco has postponed his Celebrity Theatre stop on the Why Would You Do That? tour, originally scheduled for this Friday, April 21, to Saturday, Nov. 4.\n\nWhy would he do that?\n\nManiscalco shared a note with fans on social media.\n\n\"I would do anything for my fans who support me tremendously,\" the comic writes. \"Anything but miss the birth of my first child! WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?! Phoenix, I will have to reschedule this weekend’s show because baby Maniscalco is on the way! I’ll see you guys on November 4th instead! Thank you for understanding.\"\n\nAll tickets will be honored on the new date.\n\n10/5 Flaming Lips and Mac DeMarco\n\nThe Flaming Lips and Mac DeMarco are playing Comerica Theatre on Thursday, Oct. 5.\n\nThe Lips last played the Valley last October at the Arizona State Fair, a magical night to which I responded in my review (which you can read in its entirety just by clicking these words):\n\n“It takes a certain breed of entertainer to lead the members of an audience on an emotional journey from the smile-inducing spectacle of ‘Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots, Pt. 1,’ with Wayne Coyne surrounded by giant inflatables, including Santa Claus, to the existential majesty of ‘Do You Realize??,’ which brought me to tears.\n\nAnd I’m pretty sure the Flaming Lips would be the only actual entertainers in that certain breed.\n\nCoyne is such a bizarre, enigmatic performer, giving into the silliest aspects of the task at hand, with his bag of confetti, his smoke gun and his crazy jacket with strands of multi-colored lights hanging like extra-long fringe, while gleefully spreading his message of peace and love and making the most of the moment you’re in because ‘you realize that everyone you know someday will die.’”\n\nTickets are on sale at ticketmaster.com, the Comerica Theatre box office and 800-745-3000.\n\nThe Canadian singer-songwriter most likely to perform nude (with apologies to Gordon Lightfoot), DeMarco is touring an album titled “This Old Dog,” his much-anticipated followup to “Another One.”\n\nDeMarco is known for two things – songs that reach inside your soul and force you to reflect on what you’ve done and how you plan to make it right, and being a total goof onstage. A bit Paul Westerberg in that respect. And as Smokey Robinson, who may not have been writing specifically about DeMarco, could tell you, “There’s some sad things known to man / But ain't too much sadder than the tears of a clown.”\n\nI caught his set last Friday at Coachella, writing:\n\n“He mocked his placement on the bill. ... He brought out former bassist Pierce McGarry for an extended bit in which the bassist kept insisting he was actually Orlando Bloom. … He joked about King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, whose set had preceded his own on that stage. And he joked with a fan in the audience about his hat. ... As for the music, it was often as sublime as his behavior was ridiculous, from 'Salad Days' through 'On the Level.' \"\n\n9/10: Florida Georgia Line with Nelly\n\nFlorida Georgia Line will bring Nelly and Chris Lane to Ak-Chin Pavilion on Sunday, Sept. 10.\n\nGet tickets at at ticketmaster.com.\n\nThe country duo and Nelly are touring together, of course, because of their collaboration on the remix of “Cruise,” a bro-country landmark that five years later, remains the biggest-release digital release the country genre has ever produced.\n\nFour subsequent Florida Georgia Line followed “Cruise” to No. 1 on Billboard’s country charts while going multi-platinum -- \"Stay,\" the Luke Bryan-assisted \"This is How We Roll,\" \"Dirt\" and \"H.O.L.Y.\" (from their latest album, \"Dig Your Roots\").\n\n7/25: Buckingham McVie\n\nLindsey Buckingham and Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac: The Rumours Years are headed to Phoenix in support of their first album as a duo, playing Comerica Theatre on Tuesday, July 25, with the Wallflowers.\n\nThe 10-song album is due to hit the streets June 9, preceded by a single, “In My World,” available now.\n\nThe collaboration began three years ago, when McVie rejoined Fleetwood Mac for their “On With The Show” tour. The duo went in to record new material prior to rehearsals for the tour and their natural creative chemistry was reignited. According to Buckingham, “We were exploring a creative process, and the identity of the project took on a life organically. The body of work felt like it was meant to be a duet album. We acknowledged that to each other on many occasions, and said to ourselves, ‘What took us so long?!!’”\n\nMcVie says, “We’ve always written well together,Lindsey and I, and this has just spiraled into something really amazing that we’ve done between us.”\n\nSessions for the album took place at The Village Studios in Los Angeles, where Fleetwood Mac recorded several of their classic albums, including “Tusk.” Buckingham and McVie were joined in the studio by fellow bandmates Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, who supplied much of the dynamic rhythmic engine.\n\nTickets are on sale at livenation.com.\n\n10/3: The Shins with Spoon\n\nThe Shins and Spoon will be playing four concerts together this year. And one of those concerts is happening right in Phoenix (your reporter is resisting the urge to end that sentence with several exclamation marks).\n\nThe tour hits Comerica Theatre on Tuesday, Oct. 3, in support of two of this year’s most acclaimed releases, the Shins’ “Heartworms” and Spoon’s “Hot Thoughts.” Tickets are $39.50-$50 and available through ticketfly.com.\n\nThe Shins recently headlined the opening night of McDowell Mountain Music Festival, where the songs from that new album, of which there were many, more than held their own against such classics as “Caring is Creepy” and “New Slang.” You can see how that set went, complete with pictures, here.\n\nIn an interview quoted on Pitchfork, James Mercer, the last remaining member of the “Oh, Inverted World” lineup, said the new music is closer to the way they sounded on their first three albums by design.\n\n“I’m really excited about this record,” he said. “I think we’ve got something that Shins fans will really love, and I think there’s some other things on there that are different enough. I made a concerted effort on certain songs to fit the palette, to use the palette that I’ve used historically for the band.”\n\nSpoon’s fourth album in a row to crack the Top 10, “Hot Thoughts,” was released to just the sort of hyperventilating praise you can expect from critics when a new Spoon album hits the streets. And with good reason. They’ve already given us a number of the century’s best rock releases. And this new one more than lives up to the promise of that legacy. I now defer you to the wisdom of the Consequence of Sound reviewed who suggest that Britt Daniel’s “big statement is his Body of Work, of which every fine part adds up to a greater sum. Here comes another one.”\n\n8/25: Yestival\n\nFresh from taking their long-denied place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the members of Yes will be bringing a festival called Yestival to the Celebrity Theatre, with Todd Rundgren and Carl Palmer’s ELP Legacy on Friday, Aug. 25.\n\nTickets ($49.50, $89.50 and $125) are available at Celebrity Theatre, 440 N. 32nd St., Phoenix, www.celebritytheatre.com or 602-267-1600 ext. 1.\n\nYes will play a set of greatest hits from every album up to 1980’s “Drama,” showcasing the storied career of one of the world’s most influential, ground-breaking, and respected progressive rock bands.\n\nThat era produced such Yes staples as “Roundabout,” “I’ve Seen All Good People,” “Yours is No Disgrace,” “Long Distance Runaround,” “Heart of the Sunrise” and “Close to the Edge.”\n\n“We are looking forward to presenting songs from each of the first nine studio albums, including some surprises,” says guitarist Steve Howe.\n\nFor the purpose of this tour, Yes will feature Howe, Alan White (drums), Geoff Downes (keyboard), Jon Davison (vocals) and Billy Sherwood (the late Chris Squire’s chosen successor on bass).\n\n10/4: Father John Misty\n\nFather John Misty is playing the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix on Wednesday, Oct. 4, in support of “Pure Comedy.\"\n\nTickets are on sale at phoenix.ticketforce.com.\n\nThe singer’s darkly comic narratives, often done in character, have marked Misty as his generation’s Randy Newman – not that I see Pixar work in Misty’s future. “Pure Comedy” is guaranteed to figure prominently on the shortlist of the year’s most celebrated albums, a third straight triumph for the singer-songwriter. Mojo said this album lifts him “to another level altogether,” while the Skinny raved: “He embraces the role, plays up to it, uses it to bend and manipulate the parameters of modern rock music and has managed to create something bitingly acerbic and cynical, yet achingly sincere. Again.”\n\nHe topped our playlist of best February singles with a track from “Pure Comedy” called “Ballad of the Dying Man,” on which he turns his darkly comic eye for detail on a self-important know-it-all who wonders on his deathbed if he’s “successfully beaten back the rising tide of idiots, dilettantes and fools on his watch.”\n\nWeyes Blood opens.\n\n10/8: Scorpions\n\nThe Scorpions Crazy World Tour is bringing Megadeth to Talking Stick Resort Arena on Sunday, Oct. 8.\n\nTickets are $40-$125 at www.dannyzeliskopresents.com.\n\nWhy Crazy World? If you have to ask:\n\n\"When our album 'Crazy World' was released back in '91, right at the end of the Cold War,” Klaus Meine says, “we toured around a world that was pretty crazy back then, but there was so much hope in the air for a more peaceful future. Now, 26 years later, things are getting more crazy every other day. After all these years, Crazy World is still a good motto for our upcoming world tour. We are very much looking forward to seeing all of you out there.\n\nFounded in Hannover, West Germany, in 1965, Scorpions released their debut album, “Lonesome Crow,” released in 1972. They rose to arena status with seminal releases “Lovedrive,” “Virgin Killer” and “Animal Magnetism.” In 1982, they topped the U.S. rock charts with \"No One Like You,\" a soaring power ballad they soon followed with their first Top 40 single, \"Rock You Like a Hurricane.\" Their biggest U.S. hit came later with another ballad, \"Wind of Change.\" They finished 46th on VH1's Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, and \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" was No. 18 on VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs.\n\nThe set will offer a mix of fan favorites and highlights of their 19th studio release, “Return To Forever,” released in 2015 as part of their 50th anniversary festivities.\n\n5/2: New Found Glory\n\nPop-punk veterans New Found Glory are bringing their 20th Anniversary Tour to the Nile Theater in Mesa on May 2. They've been called \"the greatest pop-punk band in history\" by Bad Religion's own Brett Gurewitz, who scooped them up for Epitaph after they walked out on Geffen. Their first album for the label, \"Not without a Fight,\" debuted at no. 12 with Alternative Press declaring it \"a reminder of why we fell in love with NFG in the first place.\" After two albums on Epitaph, they switched to Hopeless for 2014's \"Resurrection,\" which Kerrang! declared \"a powerhouse of a record, the brave onward steps of New Found Glory proving that hope — like pop-punk — is not dead.\"\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 2. Nile Theater, 105 W. Main St., Mesa. $24-28. www.niletheater.com.\n\n5/4: Zac Brown Band\n\nThe Zac Brown Band will bring their Welcome Home 2017 tour to Gila River Arena in Glendale. The Atlanta-based band is embarking on a 40-date tour, and they will also release a new album, 'Welcome Home,\" just a few days later on Friday, May 12. The eight-member country-music band has three platinum albums and three Grammys.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Thursday, May 4.

Primary songwriter Jerry Cantrell, founding drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Inez, who joined in 1993, got back together three years after Staley’s death with a new singer, William DuVall. Since then, they’ve sent four singles to the top of Billboard’s mainstream-rock chart — “Check My Brain,” “Your Decision,” “Hollow” and “Stone.” Their latest album, “The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here,” debuted at No. 2 on Billboard’s album chart while earning a rave from No Ripcord, whose writer weighed in with “ ‘The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here’ is up there with the best Alice in Chains albums, with each track a conquest of structure and composition.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Friday, Sept. 30.

The quadruple-platinum \"Fancy\" spent seven consecutive weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100, the longest run at No. 1 by any female rapper, also earning the magazine's title of song of the summer. The triple-platinum \"Black Widow,” with Rita Ora, peaked at No. 3.

His latest album, “Summertime: Willie Nelson Sings Gershwin,” is exactly what the title would suggest. That album just before that, \"Band of Brothers,\" was his first release to focus on predominantly new material in nearly 20 years. It hit the country charts at No. 1. Of course, he'll probably just play some subtle variation of the set he always plays, but it's a good one, from \"Crazy\" and \"Funny How Time Slips Away\" to \"On the Road Again.\" Nelson also is known for such classics as \"Red Headed Stranger,\" \"Hello Walls,\" a heartbreaking cover of \"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\" and the great Waylon Jennings duets \"Good Hearted Woman\" and \"Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 15; 7 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 16.

At last count, more than 5 million people like Coronel's Facebook page; those people also have pushed his two albums, 2013's \"Con La Frente en Alto\" and 2014's \"Quiero Ser Tu Dueño,\" to the top of Billboard's Latin-music charts.

That song topped the charts in several countries, from Australia to the U.K. But he may be better known here in the U.S. as the featured singer on the Wiz Khalifa smash “See You Again,” a tribute to the last Paul Walker that enjoyed a 12-week stay at No. 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 on its way to going six-times-platinum. His highest-charting U.S. hit without Khalifa is the double-platinum “One Call Away,” which peaked at No. 12.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 21.

After becoming the first female stand-up comedian to sell out Madison Square Garden, the “Trainwreck” actress announced a 50-city world tour that hits Arizona’s Gila River Arena on Saturday, Oct. 22. Schumer’s brand of unabashed humor is also on display in a collection of personal essays in her new book titled, “The Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo.”\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 22.

Urban’s previous country hits included the chart-toppers “Somebody Like You,” “You’ll Think of Me,” “Days Go By,” “Making Memories of Us,” “Sweet Thing” and “Only You Can Love Me This Way.” He recently scored his first platinum singles with “We Were Us,” a Miranda Lambert duet, and “Cop Car.”\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 22.

Formed in 1983, they worked the psychedelic fringes for a decade before breaking through with “She Don’t Use Jelly,” an unlikely modern-rock radio hit, in 1993. That single would remain their only proper U.S. hit, but thanks to Wayne Coyne’s freaky cult of personality and fractured sonic vision, they’ve retained their position as critical darlings and lovable cult heroes while cranking out a string of modern classics. The most compelling introduction to their world may be 1999’s majestic “The Soft Bulletin” and 2002’s high-concept masterpiece, “Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.” But there’s something to said for tracking down their latest, a track-by-track re-imagining of the Beatles’ “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” with guest appearances by Miley Cyrus, Maynard James Keenan and the Valley’s own Treasure Mammal.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 22.

They’ve since followed through with a four-song EP, “Calibraska,” which hit the charts at No. 12.\n\nDetails: 5 p.m. Sunday, Oct. 23.

Co-founding guitarist Jeff Hanneman died in 2013, but they soldiered on with Exodus guitarist Gary Holt on last year’s excellent “Repentless,” a suitably punishing tribute to Hanneman’s memory that Punk News hailed as no less than “the best Slayer album of the 21st century.”\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 26.

Released in 1995, their self-titled debut went double platinum and spawned the classic Modern Rock hits \"Only Happy When It Rains\" and \"Stupid Girl.\" They’re touring on a new release, “Strange Little Birds,” which hit the streets in June and spawned their latest Top 40 appearance on Billboard’s alternative songs chart, “Empty.”\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 27.

Galvin Parkway, Phoenix. $10. 602-444-8770, tickets.azcentral.com.\n\n10/28: Flight of the Conchords\n\nThe genius of Flight of the Conchords was clear from the time “The Most Beautiful Girl (in the Room)” hit the end of its opening line in the season premiere of their HBO series in 2007. And like the Beatles, who also had great accents, this New Zealand duo knew just when to quit — which in their case, was after two seasons of staking their claim as the most consistently inspired purveyors of musical comedy ever. They still tour, though, on occasion, having last played Phoenix in 2013 on a bill that also featured Dave Chappelle. Billed as the Flight of the Conchords Sing Flight of the Conchords Tour, this latest run of dates will feature the debut of new material.\n\nDetails: Friday, Oct. 28. Comerica Theatre, 400 W.

That song remained his biggest hit until the triple-platinum triumph of “Honey, I’m Good,” his first and only Top 10 entry on the Hot 100.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Friday, Oct. 28.

Band topped the R&B charts with “Take Your Time (Do It Right),” their breakthrough hit, which also peaked at No. 3 on Billboard’s Hot 100. Evelyn “Champagne” King is best remembered for her breakthrough single, “Shame,” and the R&B chart-topper “I’m in Love.” Grandmaster’s Furious Five featuring Melle Mel and Scorpio are hip-hop legends best remember for “The Message.” Rob Base went platinum with “It Takes Two” as part of a duo with DJ E-Z Rock.

Hill launched her post-Fugees solo career in 1998 with “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,” an eight-times platinum debut on which her reputation may forever rest — in part because it’s so good and in part because she's yet to hit us with another full-length studio release. She did the “MTV Unplugged” thing in 2001. She's guested on some other people’s records and released a small handful of singles, including 2010's “Repercussions\" and 2013's \"Neurotic Society.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 13.

This is the former Beatle's longest-running All Starr lineup for a reason. As Starr explains, “I just love playing with this band. I joke that at the end of every tour I think it’s the last one and so I fire them. And then we keep finding places we can play and keep it going so I rehire them.”\n\nAmong the greatest drummers in the history of rock and roll, Starr assembled his first All Starr Band in 1989 and found consistent success as a live act with his revolving All Starrs touring the world with 12 different lineups to date. Among the songs you can expect to hear from Starr are \"Photograph,\" \"It Don't Come Easy,\" \"With A Little Help From My Friends,\" \"Boys\" and \"Yellow Submarine.\" The All Starr also take turns on the mic, which Santana hits from Rolie (\"Evil Ways,\" \"Black Magic Woman\"), Toto hits from Lukathar (\"Hold The Line,\" \"Africa,” \"Rosanna\") Mr. Mister hits from Page (\"Broken Wings\", \"Kyrie\"), and Rundgren doing Rundgren hits.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, Nov. 15.

And how did she sound with a cold? “Adele was in brilliant voice throughout,\" I wrote. \"She's like a soulful Barbra Streisand, belting out her songs in an amazing show of force that somehow seemed more powerful in concert than it does on her recordings, which have outsold any other superstar in recent memory. And it was all in service to the songs, conveying raw emotion while filling the venue with breathtaking vocal performances that never felt flashy or forced.”\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Monday, Nov. 21.

It’s just happening all the time, so it is sneaky,” said environmental epidemiologist Tarik Benmarhnia of the University of California, San Diego.\n\nThere’s been a 74% increase in deaths related to heat since 1980, a 2021 study found. With the ongoing climate crisis, high temperatures are expected to get worse, and heat waves will last longer, affecting parts of the country that aren’t used to them.\n\nMost heat-related deaths and health problems are avoidable. Three of the most common conditions to watch out for are dehydration, heatstroke and heat exhaustion.\n\nDehydration\n\nYour body needs water and other fluids to function. When you lose more fluid than you take in, you get dehydrated.\n\nMild or moderate dehydration is manageable by drinking more fluids, but severe dehydration needs medical attention.\n\nThe problem is that your body doesn’t always let you know early enough that you need more water. By the time you feel thirsty, you’re behind on your fluid replacement. Older people often don’t feel thirsty until they are actually dehydrated.\n\nExperts say that when you have to be out in the heat, it’s important to drink fluids even before you head out, or else you may not be able to catch up on what your body needs.\n\nWhile you’re outside, particularly if working or exercising in the heat, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends drinking a cup of water (8 ounces) at least every 15 to 20 minutes. But don’t drink more than 48 ounces per hour, which can lower your sodium levels too much, causing confusion and other health problems.\n\nYou also want to stay hydrated after coming inside from the heat, drinking enough fluids to replace what you’ve lost through sweat.\n\nChronic dehydration can raise your risk for kidney stones and urinary tract infections, as well as longer-term problems.\n\nHeatstroke\n\nThe “most worrisome consequence” of high heat is heatstroke, said Dr. Scott Dresden, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Northwestern University.\n\nWith heatstroke, the body can’t cool itself and regulate its temperature.\n\nIn normal temperatures, your body loses water through sweating, breathing and going to the bathroom. But when humidity rises above 75%, sweating becomes ineffective. Our bodies can let off heat only when the outside temperature is lower than our internal body temperature, usually around 98.6 degrees.\n\nIf the body’s temperature rises quickly, its natural cooling mechanism – sweat – fails. A person’s temperature can rise to a dangerous 106 degrees or higher within just 10 or 15 minutes. This can lead to disability or even death.\n\nOlder adults, people taking certain medications like beta blockers and antidepressants, and kids can all have a harder time with heat regulation. Alcohol can also make it hard for the body to regulate its temperature, as can being dehydrated or being overdressed for the heat.\n\nIf you notice that someone is confused, has a flush to their skin, seems to be breathing quickly or complains of a headache, move to the shade or into air-conditioning. Cool them with cool water, icepacks or wet towels around their neck, head, armpits and groin. And get medical help as soon as possible.\n\nA person who has heatstroke may sweat profusely or not at all. They can become confused or pass out, and they could have a seizure. Left untreated, heatstroke can quickly damage the brain. It can cause the heart to beat dangerously fast and the body to shut down.\n\nYou can lower your chance of heatstroke by wearing loose-fitting, lightweight clothing. Wear sunscreen, too: People who are sunburned have less of an ability to regulate their body temperature. Drink lots of water. Try to avoid working outside or exercising during the hottest parts of the day. Let yourself acclimate to high temperatures before you start running marathons or doing any other extreme outdoor exercise.\n\nHeat exhaustion\n\nHeat exhaustion happens when the body loses too much water or salt through excessive sweating. Typically, this can happen when you’re exposed to high temperatures combined with high humidity or if you are involved in strenuous physical activity, like running or playing football.\n\nHeat-related illness is the leading cause of death and disability among US high school athletes, according to the CDC. But it can be a problem for anyone taking part in everyday activities like mowing the lawn or going for a walk.\n\nSigns of heat exhaustion can include cool or moist skin with goosebumps, heavy sweating, feeling faint or tired, an unusual heart rate, muscle cramps, a headache or nausea.\n\nIf you think you or someone else has heat exhaustion, get some rest in the shade or in the air-conditioning. Drink cool water. If symptoms don’t improve, get medical attention.\n\nAt that point, the treatment isn’t all that pleasant. “We typically use ice baths in our emergency room,” Dresden said. “We’ll do cold-water immersion.”\n\nIf that isn’t available, a hospital may try wet sheets and a large fan.\n\nHow to stay healthy in the heat\n\nExtreme high temperatures can be linked to at least 17 causes of death, most of them related to heart and breathing issues but also including suicide, drowning and homicide.\n\nStudies have shown that exposure to extreme heat can contribute to mental health issues, problems for pregnant women and poor birth outcomes.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nEven if you aren’t working or exercising outdoors, be careful in extreme temperatures.\n\nDr. Stephanie Lareau, an emergency room physician in Rocky Mount, Virginia, said it’s important to keep an eye not just on the temperature but on the heat index. That takes into account humidity, and that can matter more for heat-related illness.\n\nWhen planning activities, try to keep them out of the heat, especially if you’ve got young kids or the elderly in your social circle, since they don’t handle the heat as well.\n\n“Make sure everyone is drinking plenty of fluids,” Lareau said. “You don’t have to take in copious amounts of water, but drink a little bit before you’re thirsty – and especially when you are thirsty. Those things are really important. Heat illnesses are totally avoidable with the right approach.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/09/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/06/us/arizona-hiker-heat-exhaustion-death/index.html", "title": "A hiker died from heat exhaustion in Arizona and others were ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA hiker in Arizona died and five others were rescued Monday after getting lost on trails and suffering heat exhaustion as triple-digit temperatures gripped the region, officials said.\n\nA man in his 20s was pronounced dead after being taken to a local hospital, according to Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Monica Bretado.\n\nFive others who were part of the hiking group were treated at the Spur Cross Trailhead, a hiking area about 40 miles north of Phoenix, officials said.\n\n“The hikers had run out of water and had gotten lost on the trails.

Why isn't the medical ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne day in July 2021, my then 15-year-old daughter Poppy stumbled and fell while walking down some stairs, grazing her knee. It wasn’t a serious wound, but over the weeks it didn’t heal.\n\nAround the same time, her wrists and knees became sore; her ankles started rolling when she walked; her hands began shaking; her headaches and stomach aches became more frequent and intensely painful. She was always exhausted.\n\nBefore her health declined, Poppy had enjoyed horse riding and gymnastics, she’d competed in cross country races and been a fearless goalkeeper for the school hockey team.\n\nBut within a couple of months, as walking became increasingly difficult, she asked me for a walking stick. We found one that folds up and fits neatly in her school bag.\n\nI took Poppy to doctors who conducted tests, but they couldn’t find out what was wrong with her. Then, in October, a breakthrough.\n\nA podiatrist who was measuring Poppy for insoles to support her aching feet asked if Poppy could bend her thumb to reach her forearm. She could. Could she pull her little finger back to form a 90-degree angle with the back of her hand? She could do that, too.\n\n“Have you heard of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?” the podiatrist asked me. I hadn’t – so as soon as I got home, I went looking on the internet.\n\nThere are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), according to research and advocacy organization The Ehlers-Danlos Society. Most types are very rare, and can be diagnosed using genetic tests. However, the genes that cause hypermobile EDS (hEDS) – the most common form, accounting for about 90% of cases – are unknown, so diagnosis is based on a checklist of symptoms. The list includes a hypermobility rating, known as the Beighton Score.\n\nPoppy had enough symptoms to qualify for hEDS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor one year ago, on Christmas Eve. He told us that although we can do our best to alleviate some symptoms, there is no cure.\n\nPoppy reacted to the news better than I did. She had known for some time that something was fundamentally wrong. The diagnosis was upsetting but identifying her illness also gave her a sense of relief. I felt shocked and overwhelmed, and I cried for weeks.\n\nReading about EDS was like a dreadful slow reveal.\n\nI learned that it’s a genetic disorder that causes the body to make faulty connective tissue, and connective tissue is everywhere – in the tendons, ligaments, skin, heart, digestive system, eyes and gums.\n\nWeak connective tissue leads to hypermobility, which may sound like a good thing, but some people with bendy bodies suffer a mind-boggling array of symptoms, including joint dislocations and subluxations (like a mini dislocation, when the joint partially slips out of place), soft stretchy skin, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain and fatigue.\n\nThe severity of symptoms varies wildly. Patients with milder cases can lead relatively normal lives, while others become housebound, and some can’t digest food and must be fed through tubes.\n\nWhat’s more, people with hEDS are prone to other conditions, including POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which makes you dizzy when you stand up) and MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome, which gives you allergy-type symptoms).\n\nI learned a lot of new acronyms and they all spelled bad news.\n\nZebras or horses?\n\nI initially thought hEDS was rare, because all forms of EDS are commonly referred to as rare. But within a few weeks, I felt like I was seeing references to hEDS everywhere. Actor, writer and director Lena Dunham; actor and presenter Jameela Jamil; and drag queen Yvie Oddly live with it. I deep dived into EDS Twitter and EDS Instagram, while Poppy found it comforting to watch TikTok videos made by teenagers with the condition.\n\nDrag queen Yvie Oddly, who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, crab walks down the pink carpet at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2019. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images\n\nI discovered multiple patient groups on Facebook, each with tens of thousands of members, which turned out to be great sources of support. I asked questions (what kind of shoes are best for weak ankles? Which knee braces are easiest to pull on and off?) and kind strangers sent helpful advice. At the same time, scrolling through countless personal stories of pain, despair and shattered dreams made me feel terrified about what might lie ahead.\n\nI noticed common themes. Many EDS patients had spent years seeking the correct diagnosis; others felt they’d been neglected and gaslit by doctors.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk of zebras.\n\nLinda Bluestein, a Colorado-based physician who specializes in EDS and other hypermobility conditions, and has hEDS herself, explains why.\n\n“I was told in medical school, ‘when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras,’” she says. Many trainee doctors receive the same advice – when a patient presents with symptoms, “look for the common thing.” That’s why EDS patients commonly refer to themselves as zebras – and also use the fabulous collective noun “dazzle.” The name represents rarity and evokes the stripy stretch marks that are a common feature on EDS skin.\n\nBut if people with hEDS are medical zebras, why am I encountering so many of them?\n\nBluestein says that for many years it was thought that one in 5,000 people had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. But she says the limited research that’s been carried out into the prevalence of hEDS suggests the true number of cases is “much, much higher” than that.\n\nDr. Linda Bluestein has treated hEDS patients who have been searching for a diagnosis for decades. Linda Bluestein\n\nBluestein points me to a 2019 study carried out in Wales – a country of 3.1 million people. An examination of primary care and hospital records from 1990 to 2017 found that one in 500 people there has either hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome (a similar condition with a slightly different set of symptoms). She says it’s “a good study” but believes it’s still an underestimate. The Ehlers-Danlos Society says more population studies need to be done to give a more accurate view of its incidence elsewhere.\n\nBut despite this possible prevalence, and how debilitating hypermobility disorders can be, the average time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms is 10 to 12 years, according to The Ehlers-Danlos Society.\n\nBluestein has firsthand experience of this. Growing up, she wanted to become a ballet dancer and trained six days a week. When puberty hit, she started experiencing joint pain and migraines, and at 16 had her first orthopedic surgery. She realized she wouldn’t succeed in the ballet world and instead pursued her “back-up plan,” to become a doctor. But despite her career choice, Bluestein only received her hEDS diagnosis when she was 47 – more than 30 years later.\n\n“I told my doctor on numerous occasions, ‘there is something wrong with me, I don’t heal well, I get injured more easily than other people’,” she says. “And he just never, never listened.”\n\nWhy, for so many patients, does it take so long to get diagnosed?\n\n‘The worst possible model’\n\nIn 2014 a leading EDS expert, Professor Rodney Grahame, remarked at a conference that “no other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.”\n\nFar more women than men are diagnosed with EDS, which could help to explain the neglect, because the medical profession has a long history of overlooking health complaints made by women.\n\nA 2009 study, conducted by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases, surveyed 414 families of EDS patients from five countries and found that the average delay to an EDS diagnosis was four years for men – but 16 years for women.\n\nThe report states that women with EDS tend to be “diagnosed later because their pain and hypotonia (poor muscle tone) aren’t considered as physical symptoms but rather as psychological symptoms or common complaints.”\n\n“We tend to get dismissed a lot more easily,” says Bluestein. “People jump to the conclusion that we’re histrionic females.”\n\nAnxiety is very common in patients with hypermobility issues, says Bluestein, which can cloud the picture. “When people with anxiety present to a physician, it can suck all the air out of the room, so that the physician almost can’t see anything else.”\n\nThis can ramp up the patient’s anxiety further “because people aren’t validating our symptoms, and then we start to doubt ourselves,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, medicine is divided into silos which creates the “worst possible model” for EDS patients, says Bluestein.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We're born with this and will never be free:' Hear stories from people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 05:02 - Source: CNN\n\nShe explains that undiagnosed patients might consult a neurologist for their migraines, a rheumatologist for joint pain, a cardiologist for palpitations, a gastroenterologist for digestive issues and a urologist for bladder symptoms. Each doctor focuses on the symptoms that fall within their specialty but doesn’t consider the other ailments. “Nowhere along the way does somebody realize that there are certain conditions that could tie all of these things together and explain everything,” says Bluestein.\n\nThe 2009 rare diseases study found that during the quest for a diagnosis, 58% of EDS patients consulted more than five doctors, and 20% consulted more than 20.\n\nThe consequences of not getting diagnosed for years can be devastating.\n\nMelissa Dickinson, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, Georgia, says she experienced symptoms of a “mystery illness” since childhood. Then in 2013, she “went on honeymoon to Mexico, relatively healthy, and came back disabled and with a dislocated neck.”\n\nWhile on vacation, Dickinson says she got food poisoning and was prescribed ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that can pose a serious risk of aortic aneurysm to people with EDS. Instead, she says it triggered significant nerve damage, digestive issues that almost made her go blind because her body wasn’t absorbing nutrients, and put her in a wheelchair.\n\nDickinson, who finally received her hEDS diagnosis in 2014, says taking the wrong medication “wrecked me from head to toe.” Now that she’s receiving treatment, “I can walk with mobility aids, but most of my body has to have constant support to function.”\n\nLara Bloom, president and CEO of The Ehlers-Danlos Society, who herself has hEDS, says many patients have “medicalized PTSD.”\n\n“They have had to stop their careers, they’ve had to drop out of school, their relationships have broken down.” The delay inevitably results in worsening symptoms and a declining quality of life, she says. In worst-case scenarios, patients “are dying by suicide, they’re self-harming.”\n\nSometimes, the failure to diagnose EDS has led to children being taken away from their parents.\n\nIn 2010, Americans Rana Tyson and her husband Chad were falsely accused of harming their 4-week-old twin daughters, who had unexplained fractures in their legs.\n\nAlong with their older sister, the baby girls were taken by state authorities in Texas and sent to live with relatives. “It was the worst day of my life,” Tyson tells me in a phone call.\n\nFive months later, a geneticist identified the twins as having a connective tissue disorder, and they were subsequently diagnosed with EDS and a vitamin D deficiency. The family was reunited but “12 years later, it still hurts,” says Tyson.\n\nBloom says some other parents of children with EDS have been wrongly accused of “fabricated or induced illness (FII)” – a rare form of abuse, formerly known as Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, in which a parent or care giver deliberately causes symptoms or tries to convince doctors that a healthy child is ill.\n\nEllie Pattison, who has hEDS, has been repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder. Ellie Pattison\n\nEllie Pattison, a 19-year-old student who lives in County Durham, England, suffers from severe digestive issues linked to hEDS.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Ellie was repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder, she says, while her mother Caroline was accused of FII on three separate occasions. Caroline successfully fought to keep her daughter at home, says Ellie, but the ordeal has left the whole family with “an unimaginable amount of trauma.” Ellie says she suffered from PTSD and endured years of horrific nightmares, triggered by living with the fear from a young age that she could be forcibly separated from her family.\n\nThis underlines why prompt diagnosis is so important, says Bloom. “Our hope and dream is for people to get diagnosed when their symptoms begin.”\n\nThe search for answers\n\nIn the case of hEDS, a crucial first step is to find out what causes it.\n\nCortney Gensemer, a biomedical scientist in the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, is trying to solve this mystery. She and research mentor Russell Norris, head of the lab, have been studying a gene mutation they believe causes hEDS (the results of the study are currently under peer review).\n\nLike Poppy, Gensemer was diagnosed with hEDS as a teenager. She says the disease affects every aspect of her work. Looking down a microscope is particularly painful at times – her neck is unstable because of her hEDS, and she’s had metal screws put into some of her neck vertebrae to fuse them.\n\nCortney Gensemer working in the Norris Lab and recovering from neck surgery earlier this year. Cortney Gensemer\n\nNorris kitted the lab out with special equipment, including motion sensor doors (standard lab doors are very heavy), adjustable chairs and ergonomic pipettes that are gentle on the hands. “If I didn’t have all that stuff, I don’t think I’d be able to do it,” says Gensemer.\n\nTo find a hEDS-causing gene, Gensemer says she and Norris sampled DNA from a large family with cases spanning four generations and looked for a mutation that appears only in relatives who have the disease. They identified a “strong candidate gene” and inserted it into mice using gene editing tools.\n\nGensemer and Norris found that the hEDS mice had significantly more lax tissues, and floppier tails than regular rodents. “You can tie a loose knot into the mutant mouse tail. With a normal mouse tail, you can (only) bend it into a circle,” Gensemer says.\n\nThe gene that Gensemer and Norris found won’t account for all hEDS cases, she says. They believe that eventually multiple genes will be identified, and hEDS may be split into different subtypes. This would help to explain why different patients have different symptoms. Crucially, if genetic information sheds light on how the connective tissue is “messed up,” it could lead to effective treatments, says Gensemer.\n\nThe Ehlers-Danlos Society is also looking for genes as well as blood markers, working with a team of experts to sequence and analyze the DNA of 1,000 hEDS patients from around the world. And at the UK’s University of Warwick, Ph.D. candidate Sabeeha Malek, another scientist with hEDS, has proposed that EDS might be caused by a fault in the way that collagen binds to cell membranes in connective tissue. If she’s right, she hopes her work will lead to a skin biopsy test that could identify all forms of the disease.\n\nSabeeha Malek is working to identify biomarkers that could make EDS diagnosis easier. Sabeeha Malek\n\nProgress is being made but on a very small scale. “If you look at any major academic institution, there are multiple labs studying cancer, multiple labs studying heart disease. When you look at a disease that affects one in 500 people, and probably more than that, there should be a lab studying it at every single academic institution,” says Gensemer.\n\nGensemer hopes that as more discoveries are made and data is accumulated it will “change the way the medical community looks at the disease” – and that it will be taken more seriously.\n\nA giant kitten for my zebra\n\nA year has passed since Poppy’s diagnosis. The initial shock has subsided, and while I’m still grieving the loss of her health, we’ve both learned to accept our new reality and have adjusted to living with EDS.\n\nI’ve assembled a team of supportive doctors and therapists and acquired an arsenal of paraphernalia to fight pain and manage symptoms, including braces and kinesiology tape to hold her joints in place; ice packs, heat pads, tiger balm and arnica gel for sore muscles; and a cupboard full of medications and supplements.\n\nWith Poppy often stuck at home, I also got her a giant kitten that she calls Bagel, and he provides the best therapy.\n\nPoppy with Bagel. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nWriting this article has taught me a lot more about EDS: It’s been upsetting to report on the terrible experiences some have suffered, but I’ve been awestruck by the dedication of people, many with the condition themselves, who are working to find solutions.\n\nI don’t know what the future holds for Poppy. Some patients’ symptoms improve with age; others experience an increase in pain and a loss of mobility. I’ve learned there’s a limit to what we can control but there’s a lot we can do, to tackle symptoms and make life easier. And I believe that change is coming.\n\nWith a better understanding of the condition and diagnostic tools on the horizon, my biggest hope is that there will be a cure one day – and that it will come in time for Poppy.", "authors": ["Sarah Lazarus"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/18/us/school-conditions-2022/index.html", "title": "US public schools get a D+ for poor conditions, and experts say ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen it gets too hot in Denver and Baltimore classrooms, students are sent home because their schools don’t have air conditioning.\n\nIn Massachusetts, checking for rusty water leaking from a ceiling has become a “morning ritual.”\n\nIn California, a school’s cockroach infestation has gotten so bad that some students fear eating lunch.\n\nWhile school infrastructure problems are a perennial challenge, national data and dismal stories from teachers suggest the crises are reaching an apex. Atrocious school conditions have even prompted some teachers this school year to go on strike.\n\nHow CNN found subpar school conditions CNN asked teachers about the conditions of their schools and received more than 250 responses from across the US. Some teachers spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.\n\n“We’re getting to a critical stage now,” said Mike Pickens, executive director of the National Council on School Facilities. “The average age of a school building now is from 49 to 50 years” – the highest in memory. Some schools date back to World War II.\n\nBut as schools get older and more desperate for repairs, the funding gap for public schools keeps getting worse.\n\n“American Society of Civil Engineers gives the condition of America’s 100,000 public school buildings an overall grade of D+,” the National Education Association said late last year. “And no wonder – half our school buildings are half a century old.”\n\nNow, everyone is paying the price for underfunded schools.\n\nStudents get sick, distracted or miss entire days of education when conditions turn abysmal. Parents sacrifice income to provide child care when classes suddenly get canceled.\n\nBurnt-out teachers already stressed by the pandemic and school violence are pushed closer to leaving the profession.\n\nEven those not directly connected to deteriorating schools will be impacted, Pickens said.\n\nWithout more investment in US public schools, he said, “we get further and further behind on the world stage.”\n\nFrom Maryland to Colorado, students struggle to breathe in oppressively hot classrooms\n\nIn Baltimore, Marcia Turner is sick of her kids feeling sick at school.\n\n“My children can’t even breathe in the school. It be so hot. One have asthma,” Turner told CNN affiliate WMAR.\n\nFourteen Baltimore schools don’t have any air conditioning, school district Chief Operating Officer Lynette Washington told CNN. Those students get sent home early when it’s too hot to learn – 85 degrees or higher in their classrooms, she said.\n\nStifling temperatures can impede students’ academic success. Researchers who looked at millions of test scores from American high schoolers found students tend to score lower when it’s a hot school year, according to a 2018 study published by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nBut air conditioning mitigated many of the negative effects, the researchers found.\n\nThe lack of air conditioning doesn’t just stymie students’ learning. It also hurts parents who can’t afford to leave work to take care of their children in the middle of the day.\n\n“And I can’t get off because I’m just starting a job,” Turner told WMAR.\n\nThe Baltimore school district’s COO said she’s frustrated, too. About 65% of the city’s public schools are over 41 years old; more than a third are over 51 years old.\n\n“We have such a backlog of infrastructure that has not been updated and upgraded in a consistent way. When they’re not upgraded toward the end of their life cycle, then we just hold onto them, and we just keep putting Band-Aids on them,” Washington said.\n\n“We do not have the dollars. We do not have the resources.”\n\nFive years ago, Baltimore had 75 public schools without air conditioning, Washington said. Installing AC in all those schools would cost $250 million – about five times the district’s entire annual infrastructure budget.\n\nSo Baltimore Public Schools is chipping away at the problem over years. Of the 14 schools that still lack air conditioning, six will have it in the next 24 months, Washington said. The other eight will be completely renovated – with air conditioning – or shuttered.\n\nWhy window AC units won't fix the problem For schools that don’t have air conditioning, window AC units aren’t a practical solution, said Baltimore Public Schools Chief Operating Officer Lynette Washington. “The challenge with these window air conditioning units is that they don’t meet what is called ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers) standards because they do not provide the ventilation and fresh air intake required for classrooms,” she said. “The other challenge with the air conditioning box units is that they have a very short life cycle. So they may last for a year or two … (and) have to be consistently maintained and replaced. We don’t have the resources.”\n\nMany states away in Colorado, more than 30 schools in Denver Public Schools had to send kids home early and four closed for full days this month due to the heat, the district said. Temperatures soared in Denver the first full week of September, with daily highs ranging from 97 to 99 degrees, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“I can’t change the fact that it’s 88 degrees in the classroom,” said Sara, a teacher at McAuliffe International School, which had three days of early dismissal. “It gets really draining, physically and emotionally, to be kind of beat down by these factors, day in and day out.”\n\nThe middle school in Colorado’s largest school district has no air conditioning, said Trena Marsal, the district’s executive director of facility management. The infrastructure, she said, was never meant for higher temperatures.\n\n“Our oldest building is (from) 1889,” she said.\n\nForty Denver public schools still lack AC, down from 55 in 2019, Marsal said. In 2020, Denver voters approved bonds to pay, in part, for the installation of air conditioning units in schools, including a two-year plan to air-condition McAuliffe, the school district said.\n\nBut supply chain problems delayed installations this summer, leaving the work at eight schools only partially completed.\n\nSo the district has heat mitigation liaisons, Marsal said. Portable cooling units are strategically placed during the day, and windows are opened at night, she said.\n\nOpening windows, though, means “we basically daily get wasps and flies – and it’s always exciting when that happens,” Sara said.\n\nIn the heat of day, Sara said, conditions in classrooms can make older kids anxious.\n\n“You have students, I’m sure, who are nervous about sweat stains or they sit down on a plastic chair and their butt gets sweaty,” she said. “It’s stuff as an adult we’re not as self-conscious about, but a teenager absolutely is.”\n\n“I sweat, like, everywhere,” seventh grader Zmarra Fleming told CNN affiliate KUSA. “In the classrooms, it’s really hot. It’s, like, hot where the point is you can’t really breathe in there.”\n\nMcAuliffe International School student Zmarra Fleming said it was hard to breathe in her hot classroom. KUSA\n\nBut the immediate fix – early dismissal – caused transportation problems this month for some students. McAuliffe got out at 1:32 p.m., according to the school’s website, but Marsal said early buses weren’t requested.\n\n“It’s very frustrating,” parent Stephanie Bates told KUSA. “I can’t imagine what parents who don’t have flexibility in their schedules do.”\n\nRusty water drips from classroom ceilings\n\nLeaking water in classrooms and brown, stained ceiling tiles have made for a “morning ritual” among some teachers at Joseph G. Pyne Arts Magnet School in Lowell, Massachusetts.\n\n“Outside my room, in the hallway, there’s several tiles that are stained brown like rusty, dirty water from leaks,” said Eric Kolifrath, a seventh and eighth grade science teacher. “Everyone on my floor, especially if it’s rained, we examine the ceiling to let the custodial staff know if we see new leaks.”\n\nEric Kolifrath says it's become a \"morning ritual\" to inspect for leaks on his floor of the school. Courtesy Eric Kolifrath\n\nLast school year, a ceiling tile got so wet it “bowed out like a bowl,” Kolifrath said. So custodians wheeled in a 33-gallon trash bin to collect the water.\n\nAnother time, a leak sprang right above his classroom projector.\n\n“That’s not a problem that my principal can fix,” Kolifrath said. “If she had a wand, she would wave it.”\n\nThat’s in part because Kolifrath’s school, which serves pre-K through eighth grade, and 28 others in the district are managed by the City of Lowell, which also looks after municipal buildings, City Manager Tom Golden said.\n\nThe setup is among the myriad ways American school buildings are maintained – which can lead to confusion over who’s responsible for repairs.\n\nA browning ceiling tile hangs over a room this school year at Joseph G. Pyne Arts Magnet School in Lowell, Massachusetts. Courtesy Eric Kolifrath\n\nLike many teachers nationwide, Kolifrath has crowdsourced financial support for his classroom.\n\nThe city is putting $2.3 million into all Lowell schools during the 2022-2023 school year and investing $389 million to build a new high school, Golden said.\n\nThe roof at J. G. Pyne was repaired last year, he said. But maintaining ceiling tiles “would be the responsibility of the custodians who work for the school department,” Golden said.\n\n“With the number of buildings that we have, there are always going to be issues and challenges on a day-to-day basis, which our lands and buildings professionals will be out there to rectify.”\n\nThe school funding gap keeps getting worse\n\nThe money spent on fixing or building US public schools falls woefully short of what’s needed to get buildings up to standard, according to the latest “State of Our Schools” report by the 21st Century School Fund, the International WELL Building Institute and the National Council on School Facilities.\n\nAnd the gap is widening. In 2016, public schools were underfunded by $46 billion a year (or $60 billion, when adjusted for inflation to 2020 dollars), the report said. By 2021, that annual deficit had grown by $25 billion.\n\nWhere does funding for public school buildings come from? The funding sources and ratios vary across the country. But in general, “local school districts bear the heaviest responsibilities for school construction capital funding,” according to the 2021 “State of Our Schools” report. From fiscal years 2009 to 2019: Local school districts paid 77% of the costs for PK-12 capital projects. States paid 22% to districts for capital outlay and debt service. But state support is highly variable, with 11 states paying nothing to eight states paying over half the district-level capital costs. Public school districts got slightly more than 1% from federal funds for school construction.\n\n“We have a gap of about $85 billion in our country from where we are to where we need to be to be current with codes and standards and the quality of education,” Pickens said. “In that, $57 billion is in capital improvements, and about $28 billion is in M&O – which is maintenance and operation.”\n\nThe trend is untenable as more American schools cross the half-century mark.\n\nEven with regular maintenance, “about 50 years is a good place to (consider) replacing a school.” Pickens said.\n\nBut funding sources vary widely, and it can be hard to secure money for school improvements without raising taxes.\n\n“Every state handles school facility improvements a little differently,” said John Heim, executive director of the National School Boards Association. But “it usually comes from property taxes.”\n\nAnd that can put already-disadvantaged students in a more dire situation.\n\n“It affects poor districts or those that have lower tax bases more than it does wealthier districts that have more tax base to call on,” Heim said.\n\n“And so as things get more expensive, you’re going to see that gap continue to grow.”\n\nAs schools deteriorate, so do teachers’ and students’ performance\n\nAt Reading Memorial High School in Massachusetts, a longtime teacher runs up to seven fans in his classroom to try to compensate for the school’s lack of air conditioning.\n\nBut those efforts don’t prevent him or his students from fading as the day gets hotter.\n\n“I don’t get the same caliber of work from them as I do during those cooler months when they’re actually comfortable,” he said.\n\n“I find myself adjusting my lessons as the day goes on because I know I’m not going to have the energy or mental capacity to do what I did earlier in the day because I’m so uncomfortable.”\n\nThe temperature in his classroom can reach 100 degrees, and the humidity can make you “slip on the floor,” the teacher said.\n\nThat’s especially problematic because he has an autoimmune disease and has suffered dizzy spells that have forced him to leave the classroom to splash cold water on his face, he said.\n\nHVAC preventative maintenance has been completed at all Reading Public Schools, the district said.\n\n“We are committed to ensuring high quality air ventilation in all of our classrooms,” Superintendent Thomas Milaschewski told CNN in a statement.\n\nThe district “will continue to encourage staff to open windows, as feasible, to increase air flow in classrooms, and to bring students outside when weather permits,” the superintendent wrote.\n\nBut that brings little comfort to the veteran high school teacher – especially because the building’s central and main offices are air-conditioned, he said.\n\n“I cannot think of many professions where people have graduate degrees or have a license where they would tolerate something like this,” the teacher said. “I don’t understand where the disconnect is, where you want your teachers to be the best that they can possibly be but you’re not even making them comfortable.”\n\nKids miss entire school days because some buildings don’t have heat\n\nWhile nonexistent air conditioning can hinder students at the beginning and end of the school year, the opposite problem can have even greater consequences.\n\n“We tend to have to close schools down more for heating issues than for cooling issues,” said Washington, the Baltimore school district COO. “Wintertime goes from December all the way up until March.”\n\nBaltimore teachers have reported classrooms as cold as 40 degrees. More than a third of the schools’ boilers are over 20 years old. Some pipes were installed when Harry Truman was President.\n\nBeyond that, one elementary school had no running water for more than two weeks last winter, according to a school district memo.\n\n“The district is severely underfunded,” Washington said.\n\n“Baltimore’s already taxed at a higher rate than the surrounding counties,” she said. But “Baltimore city has a low tax base. We have a disproportionate share of households that live below the poverty line. And so if we’re just depending on property taxes, we might not get there at all.”\n\nShe hopes the state will increase funding for Baltimore city schools “so that we won’t continue to have the infrastructure challenges that we’re having.”\n\nIf not, Washington said, “I cannot guarantee that our students will have the learning environments that they deserve and that they need to be successful.”\n\nWhy this year may be even more challenging\n\nFallout from the pandemic could make infrastructure problems harder to fix this year, Pickens said.\n\nSome school districts haven’t been able to complete projects due to supply chain shortages or an increase in the cost of raw materials, he said. And remote or hybrid learning during the pandemic means some parts of schools may have been neglected.\n\nA demonstrator in Columbus, Ohio, rallies in support of teachers at a Columbus Education Association protest in August. Barbara J. Perenic/Columbus Dispatch/USA Today Network\n\n“We’ve had two years of less use than we had,” Pickens said. “And because students were not in buildings, we probably did not continue the maintenance and operation and capital improvements of those school buildings because students weren’t in them.”\n\nInflation this year could also be getting in the way of school improvements, Heim said.\n\n“If we’re talking about an improvement that was to be made for the 2022-2023 school year, that bid process probably would have taken place back in January, February,” Heim said.\n\n“That’s when we were seeing those incredibly high building costs. And it’s also when we were experiencing all those supply chain issues. So … schools may not have been able to get the projects done in time or weren’t able to do as much because of the supply chain issues and inflation issues.”\n\nCockroaches make lunch a scary scene, teacher says\n\nSchools that aren’t well-maintained can attract unwelcome visitors. Around one school building, cockroaches have occupied corners, carpets, sinks and sticky glue insect traps, an Oakley, California, high school teacher said.\n\nThe bugs can be seen every day, inside and outside the school. They grow as long as 2 inches and seem to have multiplied after school resumed in-person learning last year, the teacher said.\n\nThe infestation at Freedom High School is so bad it inspired an Instagram account. The teacher verified the cockroach photos were taken at the school and shared some personal ones from the last week of August. The teacher submitted work orders about the cockroaches in recent years but didn’t report them directly to the administration, they said.\n\nDead cockroaches lie inside and outside a bug trap at Freedom High School in Oakley, California. Provided to CNN\n\nLiberty Union High School District Superintendent Eric Volta recognized Freedom High School in the social media photos, he said. The district sprays schools for pests quarterly, he said, and if there are additional needs, pest services are requested.\n\n“We fog, we spray, we bait, we trap. We do whatever we need to do to try to correct the issue,” Volta said. “We’ve been having triple-digit temperatures out here, and these things are coming up out of wherever they are just looking for water.”\n\nA big concern is cockroaches shed, leaving the teacher wary of eating in most places. Some students haven’t wanted school lunches because of the roaches, the teacher said.\n\nBut all kitchens and snack bars go through health inspections. So Volta is not worried about the pests in eating areas, he said.\n\n“I guess this is something that probably most teachers deal with,” the teacher said.\n\nWhile cockroaches might not be in every school, “there’s these problems that you have that are constant, but that you just go on teaching and doing what you have to do, knowing that you almost have no control over the situation,” the teacher said.\n\n“I can keep stepping on cockroaches and killing them, but there’s always more. The problem just sort of needs to be addressed instead of just putting Band-Aids on it.”\n\nThe consequences of inaction … and possible solutions\n\nAnd if America keeps underfunding public schools, the impact could last generations, said Mary Kusler, the National Education Association’s senior director for advocacy.\n\n“It’s really setting up a continued structural imbalance between the haves and the have-nots … unless we step up and push to ensure that a child’s ZIP code does not determine the education they receive,” she said.\n\nIncreasing funding for school infrastructure would “improve a lot of things in our country, including putting out into the workforce a more vibrant and more educated workforce,” said Pickens, the director of the National Council on School Facilities.\n\n“Also, by improving schools, somebody has to do the work on a school building. We’re putting people to work. We’re getting taxes from those people, from the labor. We’re increasing jobs. All of those things are factors in providing funds for school buildings.”\n\nTeachers and supporters rally in 2019 in Annapolis, Maryland.

Susan Walsh/AP\n\nIt’s in everyone’s best interest to ensure students in poorer communities have schools in which they can thrive – even if local tax revenues aren’t as plush as those in wealthier communities, said Heim, the director of the National School Boards Association.\n\n“I think it comes down to having good formulas that can compensate for that. I think states are reevaluating those all the time,” Heim said.\n\n“But that’s what it comes down to: affordability and helping those poorer districts with their facilities.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean wealthier school districts with state-of-the-art buildings should have anything taken away, Kusler said.\n\n“The issue isn’t that they deserve less. The issue is actually that all of our kids deserve more,” she said.\n\n“Ultimately, we are about creating the next generation of leaders in this country. And they will come from all over the country. Therefore, we need to make sure all of them have access to the education that they deserve.”", "authors": ["Christina Zdanowicz Holly Yan", "Christina Zdanowicz", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/09/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/world/cop27-egypt-what-to-watch-climate/index.html", "title": "COP27 climate summit: Here's what to watch | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs global leaders converge in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, for the UN’s annual climate summit, researchers, advocates and the United Nations itself are warning the world is still wildly off-track on its goal to halt global warming and prevent the worst consequences of the climate crisis.\n\nOver the next two weeks, negotiators from nearly 200 countries will prod each other at COP27 to raise their clean energy ambitions, as average global temperature has already climbed 1.2 degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution.\n\nThey will haggle over ending the use of coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, which has seen a resurgence in some countries amid the war in Ukraine, and try to come up with a system to funnel money to help the world’s poorest nations recover from devastating climate disasters.\n\nBut a flood of recent reports have made clear leaders are running out of time to implement the vast energy overhaul needed to keep the temperature from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius, the threshold scientists have warned the planet must stay under.\n\nReports from the United Nations and the World Meteorological Association show carbon and methane emissions hit record levels in 2021, and the plans countries have submitted to slash those emissions are beyond insufficient. Given countries’ current promises, Earth’s temperature will climb to between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius by 2100.\n\nUltimately, the world needs to cut its fossil fuel emissions nearly in half by 2030 to avoid 1.5 degrees, a daunting prospect for economies still very much beholden to oil, natural gas and coal.\n\n“No country has a right to be delinquent,” US Climate Envoy John Kerry told reporters in October. “The scientists tell us that what is happening now – the increased extreme heat, extreme weather, the fires, the floods, the warming of the ocean, the melting of the ice, the extraordinary way in which life is being affected badly by the climate crisis – is going to get worse unless we address this crisis in a unified, forward-leaning way.”\n\nHere are the top issues to follow at COP27 in Egypt.\n\nA fight over ‘loss and damage’\n\nPeople in Pakistan take refuge from flooding in a makeshift camp on August 31 in the Jaffarabad district of Balochistan province. Fida Hussain/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDeveloping and developed countries have for years tussled over the concept of a “loss and damage” fund; the idea which suggests countries causing the most harm with their outrageous planet-warming emissions should pay poorer countries, which have suffered from the resulting climate disasters.\n\nIt has been a thorny issue because the richest countries, including the US, don’t want to appear culpable or legally liable to other nations for harm. Kerry, for instance, has tiptoed around the issue, saying the US supports formal talks, but he has not given any indication of what solution the country would sign on to.\n\nMeanwhile, small island nations and others in the Global South are shouldering the impact of the climate crisis, as devastating floods, intensifying storms and record-breaking heat waves wreak havoc.\n\nThe deadly flooding in Pakistan this summer, which killed more than 1,500 people, will surely be an example the countries’ negotiators point to. And since September, more than two million people in Nigeria have been affected by the worst flooding there in a decade. At this very moment, Nigerians are drinking, cooking with and bathing in dirty flood water amid serious concerns over waterborne diseases.\n\nLoss and damage will have space on the official COP27 agenda this year. But beyond countries committing to meet and talk about what a potential loss and damage fund would look like, or whether one should even exist, it is unclear what action will come out of this year’s summit.\n\n“Do we expect that we’ll have a fund by the end of the two weeks? I hope, I would love to – but we’ll see how parties deliver on that,” Egypt’s chief climate negotiator Ambassador Mohamed Nasr recently told reporters.\n\nFormer White House National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy told CNN she thinks loss and damage will be the top issue at the UN climate summit this year, and said nations including the US will face some tough questions about their plans to help developing nations already being hit hard by climate disasters.\n\n“It just keeps getting pushed out,” McCarthy said. “There’s need for some real accountability and some specific commitments in the short-term.”\n\nA tense US-China relationship\n\nXi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China, left, and John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. Getty Images/AP\n\nPeople will be watching to see if the US and China can repair a broken relationship at the summit, a year after the two countries surprised the world by announcing they would work together on climate change.\n\nThe newfound cooperation came crashing down this summer when China announced it was suspending climate talks with the US as part of broader retaliation for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.\n\nKerry recently said the climate talks between the two countries are still suspended and will likely remain so until China’s president Xi Jinping gives the green light. Kerry and others are watching to see whether China fulfills the promise it made last year to submit a plan to bring down its methane emissions or updates its emissions pledge.\n\nThe US and China are the world’s two largest emitters and their cooperation matters, particularly because it can spur other countries to act, too.\n\nCan the world raise enough money?\n\nThis year's UN climate summit is being held in the Egyptian resort city of Sharm El-Sheikh, where thousands of climate negotiators and advocates will gather to raise their ambitions on the climate crisis. Mohamed el-Shahed/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSeparate from a potential loss and damage fund, there is the overarching issue of so-called global climate finance; a fund rich countries promised to push money into to help the developing world transition to clean energy rather than grow their economies with fossil fuels.\n\nThe promise made in 2009 was $100 billion per year, but the world has yet to meet the pledge. Some of the richest countries, including the US, UK, Canada and others, have consistently fallen short of their allocation.\n\nPresident Joe Biden promised the US would contribute $11 billion by 2024 toward the effort. But Biden’s request is ultimately up to Congress to approve, and will likely go nowhere if Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections.\n\nThe US is working on separate deals with countries including Vietnam, South Africa and Indonesia to get them to move away from coal and toward renewables. And US officials often stress they want to also unlock private investments to help countries transition to renewables and deal with climate effects.\n\nCountries are straight up off-track\n\nShips carry coal outside a coal-fired power plant in November 2021 in Hanchuan, Hubei province, China. Getty Images\n\nCOP27 is intended to hold countries’ feet to the fire on fossil fuel emissions and gin up new ambition on the climate crisis. Yet reports show we are still off-track to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nA UN report which surveyed countries’ latest pledges found the planet will warm between 2.1 and 2.9 degrees Celsius. Average global temperature has already risen around 1.2 degrees since the industrial revolution.\n\nRecords were set last year for all three major greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, according to the World Meteorological Organization.\n\nThere is a spot of encouraging news: the adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles is surging and helping to offset the rise in fossil fuel emissions, according to a recent International Energy Agency report.\n\nBut the overall picture from the reports shows there is a need for much more clean energy, deployed swiftly. Every fraction of a degree in global temperature rise will have stark consequences, said Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Program.\n\n“The energy transition is entirely doable, but we’re not on that pathway, and we have procrastinated and wasted time,” Andersen told CNN. “Every digit will matter. Let’s not say ‘we missed 1.5 so let’s settle for 2.’ No. We must understand that every digit that goes up will make our life and the life of our children and grandchildren much more impacted.”\n\nThe clock is ticking in another way: Next year’s COP28 in Dubai will be the year nations must do an official stocktake to determine if the world is on track to meet the goals set out in the landmark Paris Agreement.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/14/india/india-independence-day-75-years-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "title": "India Independence Day 2022: Modi pledges to turn India into a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nStanding in front of the historic Red Fort in Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday pledged to transform India into a developed country in the next 25 years.\n\n“The way the world is seeing India is changing.

And the Indian diaspora has spread far and wide, studying at international universities and occupying senior roles in some of the world’s biggest tech companies, including Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Twitter boss Parag Agrawal.\n\nMuch of this transformation was prompted by the “pathbreaking reforms” of the 1990s, when then Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao and his Finance Minister Manmohan Singh opened the country to foreign investment after an acute debt crisis and soaring inflation forced a rethink of socialist Nehru’s model of protectionism and state intervention.\n\nThe reforms helped turbocharge investment from American, Japanese and Southeast Asian firms in major cities including Mumbai, the financial capital, Chennai and Hyderabad.\n\nThe result is that today, the southern city of Bengaluru – dubbed “India’s Silicon Valley” – is one of the region’s biggest tech hubs.\n\nAt the same time, India has seen a proliferation of billionaires – it is now home to more than 100, up from just nine at the turn of the millennium. Among them are infrastructure tycoon Gautam Adani, whose net worth is more than $130 billion, according to Forbes, and Mukesh Ambani, founder of Reliance Industries, who’s worth about $95 billion.\n\nBut critics say the rise of such ultra-wealth highlights how inequality remains even long after the end of colonialism – with the country’s richest 10% controlling 80% of the nation’s wealth in 2017, according to Oxfam. On the streets, that translates into a harsh reality, where slums line pavements beneath high-rise buildings and children dressed in tattered clothes routinely beg for money.\n\nBut Rohan Venkat, a consultant with Indian think tank Centre for Policy Research, says India’s broader economic gains as an independent nation shows how it has confounded the skeptics of 75 years ago.\n\nSlums line the shore near the up-market neighborhood of Cuffe Parade, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.

Some of these were not entirely off the mark … but a lot of it was simple stereotyping.\n\nSince then, India’s trajectory has been “exceptional,” Venkat said.\n\n“To witness the largest transfer (of power) from an elite ruling the state, to now becoming a complete universal franchise … we are looking at an incredible political and democratic experiment that is unique.”\n\nRise of a geopolitical giant\n\nFor years after independence, India’s international relations were defined by its policy of non-alignment, the Cold War era stance favored by Nehru that avoided siding with either the United States or the Soviet Union.\n\nNehru played a leading role in the movement, which he saw as a way for developing countries to reject colonialism and imperialism and avoid being dragged into a conflict they had little interest in.\n\nThat stance did not prove popular with Washington, preventing closer ties and marring Nehru’s debut trip to the US in October 1949 to meet President Harry S. Truman. During the 1960s the relationship became further strained as India accepted economic and military assistance from the Soviets and this frostiness largely remained until 2000, when President Bill Clinton’s visit to India prompted a reconciliation.\n\nToday, while India remains technically non-aligned, Washington’s need to balance the rise of China has led it to court New Delhi as a key partner in the increasingly active security grouping known as the Quad.\n\nIndian Border Security Force soldiers hold the national flag during a motorbike rally ahead of the 75th anniversary of country's independence at the India-Pakistan border outpost in Panjgrain, about 60km from Amritsar on August 10, 2022. Narinder Nanu/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe grouping, which also includes Japan and Australia, is widely perceived as a way of countering China’s growing military and economic might and its increasingly aggressive territorial claims in the Asia Pacific.\n\nIndia, meanwhile, has its own reasons for wanting to counterbalance Chinese influence, not least among them its disputed Himalayan border, where more than 20 Indian troops were killed in a bloody battle with Chinese counterparts in June 2020. In October, the US and India will hold a joint military exercise less than 100 kilometers (62 miles) from that disputed border.\n\nAs Happymon Jacob, an associate professor of diplomacy and disarmament at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, put it: “India has been able to assert itself on the world stage because of the nature of international politics today and the political and diplomatic military capital that has been put in place by previous governments.”\n\nPart of India’s growing geopolitical clout is due to its growing military expenditure, which New Delhi has ramped up to counter perceived threats from both China and its nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan.\n\nFollowing their separation in 1947, relations between India and Pakistan have been in a near constant state of agitation, leading to several wars, involving thousands of casualties and numerous skirmishes across the Line of Control in the contested Kashmir region.\n\nIn 1947, India’s net defense expenditure was just 927 million rupees – about $12 million in today’s money. By 2021, its military expenditure was $76.6 billion, according to a report from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute – making it the third highest military spender globally, behind only China and the US.\n\nAmbitions on the world stage\n\nOutside economics and geopolitics, India’s growing wealth is feeding its ambitions in fields as diverse as sport, culture and space.\n\nIn 2017, the country broke a world record when it launched 104 satellites in one mission, while in 2019, Prime Minister Modi announced that India had shot down one of its own satellites in a military show of force, making it one of only four countries to have achieved that feat.\n\nLater that year, the country attempted to land a spacecraft on the moon. Though the historic attempt failed, it was widely seen as a statement of intent.\n\nA child touches a model of Indian mission to the moon. Pallava Bagla/Corbis News/Getty Images\n\nLast year, the country spent almost $2 billion on its space program, according to McKinsey, trailing the biggest spenders, the US and China, by some margin, but India’s ambitions in space are growing. In 2023, India is expected to launch its first manned space mission.\n\nThe country is also using its growing wealth to boost its sporting prospects, spending $297.7 million in 2019 before the spread of Covid-19.\n\nNeeraj Chopra at the medal presentation ceremony after winning the gold medal in the men's javelin competition during Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games on August 7th, 2021. Tim Clayton/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nThe Indian Premier League – the country’s flagship cricket tournament launched in 2007 – has become the second most valuable sports league in the world in terms of per-match value, according to Jay Shah, secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, after selling its media rights for $6.2 billion in June.\n\nAnd Bollywood, India’s glittering multibillion dollar film industry, continues to pull in fans worldwide, catapulting local names into global superstars attracting millions of followers on social media. Between them, actresses Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone have almost 150 million followers on Instagram.\n\n“India is a strong country. It’s an aggressive player,” said Shruti Kapilla, a professor of Indian history and global political thought at Cambridge University.\n\n“In the last couple of decades, things have shifted. Indian culture has become a major story.”\n\nChallenges and the future\n\nBut for all of India’s successes, challenges remain as Modi seeks to “break the vicious circle of poverty.”\n\nDespite India’s large and growing GDP, it remains a “deeply poor” country on some measures and that, consultant Venkat said, is a “tremendous concern.”\n\nAs recently as 2017, about 60% of India’s nearly 1.3 billion people were living on less than $3.10 a day, according to the World Bank, and women still face widespread discrimination in the deeply parochial country.\n\nViolence against women and girls has made international headlines in a country where allegations of rape are often underreported, due to the lack of legal recourse for alleged attackers through a legal system that’s notoriously slow.\n\n“Many of India’s fundamental challenges remain what they were at the time of independence in some ways, at different parameters and scale,” Venkat said.\n\nIndia is also on the front line of the climate crisis.\n\nRecent heat waves – such as in April when average maximum temperatures in parts of the country soared to record levels and New Delhi saw seven consecutive days over 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) – have tested the limit of human survivability, experts say.\n\nAnd it’s the country’s poorest people who are set to suffer the most, as they work outside in oppressive heat, with limited access to cooling technologies that health experts say is needed to contend with rising temperatures.\n\nAnd as the heat rises on the land, political pressure has grown with fears that the secular fabric of the country and its democracy are being eroded under the leadership of Modi, whom critics accuse of fueling a wave of Hindu nationalism that has left many of the country’s 200 million Muslims living in fear.\n\nMany states run by his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have introduced legislation critics say is deeply rooted in Hindutva ideology, which seeks to transform India into the land of the Hindus. And there has been an alarming rise in support for extremist Hindu groups in recent years, analysts say – including some that have openly called for genocide against the country’s Muslims.\n\nAt the same time, the arrests of numerous journalists in recent years have led to concerns the BJP is using colonial-era laws to quash criticism. In 2022, India slipped to number 150 on the Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders – its lowest position ever.\n\n“The challenges now are about India’s nature of democracy,” Kapilla said. “India is going through a major, contentious change at the fundamental political level.”\n\nSeventy-five years on, Nehru’s observation that “freedom and power bring responsibility” continue to ring true.\n\nIndia’s first 75 years ensured its survival, but in the next 75 years it needs to navigate immense challenges to become a truly global leader, and not just in terms of population, said Venkat, from the Centre for Policy Research.\n\n“Although (India) may end up being the world’s fastest growing major country over the next few years, it will still be miles behind its neighbor in China, or getting close to what it had hoped to achieve at this point, which was double digit growth.”\n\n“So the challenges are immediate and all over the place, chief among them being how to ensure its prosperity,” Venkat said.", "authors": ["Rhea Mogul"], "publish_date": "2022/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnists/mitch-albom/2017/06/11/chika-story-daughter-cancer-mitch-albom/322589001/", "title": "Mitch Albom shares Chika's story: A fight to cure the incurable", "text": "Mitch Albom\n\nDetroit Free Press\n\n\"Chika,\" someone asks, \"what do you want to be when you grow up?\"\n\n“Big,” she says.\n\nAPRIL 7, 2017\n\nWe lay beside her in a single bed, my wife on her left, me on the right. We stare at her small chest, praying for it to rise. There’s one breath, we say — but then nothing for two seconds, five seconds, seven seconds — there, another breath. This is all wrong. She is young. We are old. Yet every minute her heartbeats slow, while ours are racing.\n\n“Is she in pain?” I whisper.\n\n“She is not in pain,” the nurses say.\n\nA small plastic meter dangles from her middle finger, flashing digits, her pulse, her oxygen. For months, we have been fixated on this device, checking it nervously throughout the day and night. I hate it. I want to smash it into a million pieces.\n\nSomeone has figured how to put photos on the bedroom TV and they slide across silently, happy photos, Chika in a bathing suit, Chika writing on a blackboard, Chika with her face painted at a county fair, where she told the ride workers, “Guess where I am from? Haiti!”\n\nThe phone rings. No one answers. An oxygen machine thrums and sputters, breathing more regularly than she does. A plastic tube trails from her nose to her ears and behind a pink ribbon in her hair.\n\nPink. She loved pink.\n\nLoves pink. She is still with us.\n\nBreathe, I say silently.\n\nShe makes a small noise, like the squeal of a deflating balloon.\n\n“Are you sure she’s not in pain?” we ask.\n\n“She is not in pain.”\n\n“Then why--’’\n\n“In the final minutes, these are the sounds children sometimes make.”\n\nThese are the sounds children sometimes make. It seems so clinical, like we are observing a copy machine, not a 7-year-old. I glance at my wife. Her eyes are dripping tears. I look at Chika, this little girl — not our girl, and yet, our girl. Our girl. In every way, our girl.\n\nThe phone rings. No one answers. Once, the sounds from her little mouth were joyous; squeals of delight at her first American hot dog, high-pitched laughter while descending her first sled hill, and singing — always singing — like an Ethel Merman in size 1 shoes, belting out Creole prayers in our suburban Detroit home the way she once did at a Port-au-Prince orphanage, seeking the Lord’s ear beneath starry Caribbean skies.\n\nThat was before the long journey here, the operations, the catheters in her head, our worldwide search to cure the incurable, and the endless decisions we were forced to make — Which doctor? Which drug? Which country? — all funneled into this, here, now, a warm Friday afternoon, and one last choice:\n\nHow to watch her die.\n\nWe have chosen to surround her in bed, the way she always loved. We rub her narrow shoulders. We run fingers over her soft cheeks. We look again at the gentle face that rests between us, her large eyes mostly closed now, like someone fighting sleep.\n\nIt is a face that touched the lives of so many.\n\nA face that changed the doctors’ thinking.\n\nA face that brought parenthood to a man and a woman too old to be parents.\n\n“It’s all right, Chika,” we whisper. “We’re right here, Chika …”\n\nThe phone rings. No one answers.\n\nMAY 2015\n\nThe phone rings.\n\n“Hello, Sir?”\n\nYes, Alain?\n\n“Something is wrong with Chika.”\n\nThis is how it begins. Alain Charles, the 32-year-old director at the Have Faith Haiti Orphanage/Mission in Port-au-Prince, has a habit of delivering news in declarative statements. “We have no water.” “The van is broken.” “There’s something wrong with Chika.” It is up to me, as the person operating the orphanage, to explore the particulars.\n\nWhat’s wrong with Chika, Alain?\n\n“Her face is funny.”\n\nHow is it funny?\n\n“It is lowered. Her mouth. And her eye.”\n\nLowered? You mean drooped?\n\n“Drooped. Yes.”\n\nDid you take her to the doctor?\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWhat did he do?\n\n“He gave her eye drops.\"\n\nAlain, it’s not her eyes. It might be something they call Bell’s palsy.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nDo you know what that is?”\n\n“No, sir.”\n\nShe needs a neurologist.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nCan you find one?\n\n“I think so.”\n\nWe need to find one.\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\n[Click here to watch a documentary on Chika's battle with DIPG]\n\n* * * *\n\nWhat followed seems monumental compared to that simple conversation, but then, simple things often turn monumental in Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. Daily life is a hot, exhausting struggle. Money is scarce. Water is scarce. Food is scarce. And children die.\n\nOften.\n\nSeven out of every 100 Haitian children will pass away before their fifth birthday — 10 times the rate of the U.S. The fortunate families get some kind of explanation. The others, who lack money, live in far-off provinces or can’t reach a doctor, get nothing. “Ca se volonte Bondye,\" they lament, This is what God wants — although, in most cases, death may be less about God than malnutrition, injury, childbirth complications or pneumonia.\n\nBut even by Haitian standards, what struck 5-year-old Medjerda (Chika) Jeune was crushing.\n\nAnd rare.\n\nA proud, curious child with full cheeks, pouty lips and eyes as big as Haitian mountains, Chika had never exhibited health problems before. She was fond of pushing around the boys at the orphanage, or diving into a second helping of rice and beans, or dancing wildly during church services to the beat of conga-driven devotions.\n\nBut in late May 2015, she sat next to Alain, with her drooping mouth and drooping eye, inside a dimly lit Port-au-Prince medical facility, awaiting the sole MRI machine in their country.\n\nAlain had followed protocol: show up early and pay cash in advance (750 U.S. dollars). Haiti has no private medical insurance to speak of. More than 75% of health care costs come out of people’s pockets.\n\nFinally, after several hours, a nurse emerged and told Chika to drink some syrup. It made her sleepy. She was carried through a door and placed inside the machine. Halfway through the process, Chika woke up, asking where she was. More syrup was given. Again, she fell asleep. The MRI finished, and Alain and Chika went home.\n\nWhen the results were in, Alain was given the scan and a note. No explanation.\n\nHe took them to a neurologist.\n\n“It is something in her brain,” the doctor said. “It is very bad.”\n\n“What should I do?” Alain asked.\n\n“Is there any way you can get her to the United States?”\n\n“Why?’’\n\n“Because whatever this is, there is no one in Haiti who can help her.”\n\nJANUARY 2010\n\nShe is born on Jan. 9, three days before the worst earthquake to hit her country in nearly 200 years. She comes so quickly, her mother doesn’t have time to call the midwife, an older man named Albert. By the time he gets to the house, the baby is already in the world.\n\nThey formally name her “Medjerda,” a made-up name, but she will soon answer to “Chika,” a made-up nickname. Her mother, Rezulia Guerrier, is a tall, strong woman in her mid-30s who sells small items in the street for money. Her father, Fedner Jeune (the parents are not married), has experience with construction but, like many men in Haiti, looks for work and rarely finds it. He is around and not around.\n\nOn the third day of her life, Chika lies in bed with Rezulia in their one-room cinder-block house, taking shelter from the afternoon heat. At 4:53 p.m., the ground starts shaking as if thunder were just outside the door. In seconds, the house splits in two and crumbles around them, leaving mother and child exposed like a cracked-open walnut.\n\nIt is a 7.0 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter less than 16 miles from Port-au-Prince, the capital city. Nearly 3% of Haiti’s population will die from it. Ten percent — almost a million people — will be left homeless, including Rezulia, Chika and her two older sisters.\n\nThey spend that night in the sugarcane fields. Chika’s bed is a layer of leaves. The country is in ruins.\n\nThe baby sleeps.\n\nJUNE 2015\n\nIt was not easy to get Chika into the U.S. Even with help from Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who had once visited our orphanage, it took several weeks of phone calls and filings. Getting a passport. Medical affidavits. Securing an interview at the U.S. embassy. (No one moves fast in Haiti, even for terminal illness.)\n\nChika finally cleared her paperwork, and on June 3, holding Alain’s hand, she boarded her first airplane, at the same hour her friends at the orphanage were lining up for school. She arrived in Detroit late that night, wearing a pink dress and a white sweater and shivering from the air conditioning. In a bathroom, she turned a sink handle and yelled, \"Oooh!\"\n\nShe had never experienced hot water from a faucet.\n\nIn her time at the orphanage, Chika had always been curious. But this trip would test her sense of wonder. Every moment was a discovery. Every item was worth touching. We took her to Mott Children’s Hospital in Ann Arbor where they gave her a sticker (“Look!” she cooed) and she posed with a Superman statue. When the elevator lifted — her first ride — she beamed as if watching a magic trick.\n\nThat afternoon, she lay inside another MRI machine. The results left doctors skeptical. It was a brain tumor, a significant one, the kind often deemed not worth the risk of surgery. Days passed. They deliberated. Eventually, at a tumor board meeting, the members voted, by a narrow margin, to proceed with an operation, in hopes that, despite its size, what had invaded this little girl’s head was still a lower grade glioma.\n\nOn June 15, less than two weeks into her first trip out of Haiti — and not yet 4 feet tall — Chika was given a light blue gown, some yellow socks and an intravenous needle drip in the back of her hand. She was rolled away to surgery and my wife, Janine, and I were handed a pager.\n\n“Wait until it vibrates,” they told us.\n\nWe waited.\n\nDECEMBER 2010\n\nBaby Chika is baptized. Her cinder-block house is rebuilt. As Haiti struggles to recover from the earthquake, Chika learns to walk and talk. She sleeps beside her mother atop a single mattress on the dirt floor, along with her two older sisters.\n\nThey eat once a day. There is no electricity and no indoor plumbing. Chika is bathed in a bucket, with a can of water poured over her head. The water comes from a well on another property.\n\nSometimes, when Rezulia goes to a muddy river to wash clothes, she takes Chika with her. Years later, Chika will claim to remember those journeys. She will tell strangers in America, “My mommy used to take me to the swimming pool.”\n\n“Degaje pa peche” says a Haitian proverb. To get by is not a sin.\n\nJUNE 2015\n\nIn the operating room at Mott Hospital, the neurosurgeon, Dr. Hugh Garton, found himself dealing with a monster. The tumor tissue in Chika's brain was everywhere, wrapped throughout the healthy tissue. He could remove only 10% before disturbing vital elements of the brain itself.\n\nWhat he did remove was sent for pathology analysis.\n\n“Let’s hope for the best,” he said.\n\nHe forced a smile. There remained a slim belief that, despite the cancer’s spread, it was just Stage I, or at worst, Stage II.\n\nWere that the case, with treatment, Chika could eventually return to Haiti.\n\nAnd we would return to our previous life.\n\nWhich was what I always thought would happen.\n\nAnd.\n\nIt was never going to happen.\n\nAUGUST 2012\n\nChika’s mother dies.\n\nIt happens as she is giving birth to a son, inside the cinder-block house. The midwife — Albert, the same man who arrived late for Chika’s birth — does not realize how much blood Rezulia is losing. The boy is born with her last breath. He enters the world as a motherless child.\n\nNo one is called. No police. No investigation. Rezulia is buried the next day, in a nearby field.\n\nChika never gets to say good-bye.\n\nThe children are scattered among relatives, the stunned father unable or uninterested in caring for them. The newborn son goes to an uncle. The sisters are split up.\n\nChika is taken away by her godmother, a friend of Rezulia’s named Herzulia Desamour. \"From now on, you will live with me,\" she tells Chika. They share a one-room apartment by a church, with Herzulia’s husband and their three other children.\n\nChika eats mostly rice. Her mattress is in a corner. She tends to her own soiled sheets, carrying them up steps to dry on the roof, even though she is barely 3 years old.\n\nIn the spring of 2013, less than a year after taking her in, Herzulia puts Chika in a dress and loads her inside a Haitian “tap tap,” a rickety share taxi with a back door open to the traffic exhaust. Her destination is the Have Faith Haiti orphanage/mission, which I have been operating since 2010.\n\nShe wants us to take the child.\n\nI do the admission interview. I hear Herzulia say there is no money for this extra mouth to feed, that her own family can barely get by.\n\nI wave at the full-cheeked girl in front of me. She waves back. I make a face. She makes one back. A good sign, I think. Most Haitian children keep their heads down during these interviews.\n\nI tell Herzulia we will consider her request. She leaves holding Chika’s hand. Neither one looks back. But later I learn that every day that followed, Chika asked, ‘Kile blanc ap voye chache’m?”\n\n“When is the white man going to send for me?”\n\nHome video: See Chika during her first week at the mission\n\n* * * *\n\nI should say something here about my background. Although I have operated the orphanage/mission in Haiti since 2010, and make monthly visits to our 39 children there, my wife and I have no kids of our own. We were married in our late 30s, and despite our efforts, parenthood never happened. In time, we gave up trying, and a layer of acceptance settled in like sea fog, blocking the particular light of children from ever reaching us.\n\nOur brothers and sisters almost all had kids, and there were a lot of them: 15 nieces and nephews. We celebrated their milestones — birthdays, communions, graduations — we gave cards and kisses and presents that were too big, and in the car rides home we spoke about how cute they were, how big they were getting, but we never spoke about any emptiness we were feeling. We made our lives busy. We traveled. Our house was spacious and mature, lacking stray toys or crayon drawings on the refrigerator. We fell into that category that is both envied and pitied: The Couple Without Kids.\n\nSo it may seem strange that, in our late 50s, we found ourselves in a meeting room at Mott Hospital, looking every bit like a mother and father, side by side, braced for the news, parental in our posture, our furrowed brows — parental in everything except an actual relationship to the child.\n\nBut there we were. And with the biopsy results in, Dr. Garton, a thin, fit man who enjoys mountain climbing, had to scale a less pleasurable rock; telling the de facto parents about Chika’s disease, and adding a new four-letter word to our vocabulary:\n\nDIPG.\n\nIt stands for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, an insidious cancer of the brain stem that is nearly exclusive to children. It is the worst kind of tumor: the kind for which they don’t bother giving you hope.\n\nDIPG is aggressive and debilitating, invading the pons, which controls most of the body’s vital functions (heart rate, swallowing, breathing). It is rare — only 300 kids in the U.S. are diagnosed with it each year (there are no statistics for Haiti). And yet, because of its severity, it is the leading cause of death from pediatric brain tumors.\n\nThis is the bad news. Then comes the worst news: In more than 50 years of study, since astronaut Neil Armstrong’s 2-year-old daughter died from it in 1962, no real progress has been made.\n\nSurvival rate is, essentially, zero.\n\n“The average life expectancy without treatment,” Garton explained, “is maybe five months. If Chika gets radiation you could extend that another five or six months. But …”\n\nBut?\n\n“There’s a price to pay for radiation. It goes on for weeks. It’s not fun. Kids don’t like it. And there are potential complications. She’d be on steroids. She could get tired, vomit.”\n\nHe looked at us empathetically. He knew about Haiti. He knew about the 38 children Chika called her family. He knew how far Ann Arbor was from Port-au-Prince.\n\nHe knew how old we were.\n\n“Maybe,” he said, softly, “it would be better if you took her back, and let her live out her final months there.”\n\nI looked at Janine. She looked at me. The Couple Without Kids now faced a decision no couple with kids should have to face: to put a child through a hopeless medical marathon, or to stoically accept a doomed fate.\n\nWe went back to the room where Chika was recovering. Her head had been bandaged up high, like a white fez. Someone had brought her breakfast, and when we entered, Chika was in a chair, working her way through a blueberry muffin. All our kids in Haiti love to eat, having been hungry much of their lives. But here was this curious little girl, days after brain surgery, intent on digging a fork into a muffin and getting it to her mouth before it crumbled.\n\n\n\nAnd I knew what our answer would be.\n\nShe was a fighter.\n\nSo we would be fighters.\n\n“If she goes through the radiation, she has to be here for months,” the doctor had said. “Does she have someone to stay with?”\n\nWithout even looking at one another, Janine and I said, “Us.”\n\nAnd that is how a family was born.\n\nJULY 2015\n\nHere is Chika rolling on the carpet of my office, playing with flash cards. She has been here five weeks, and I am working on her English.\n\n“Five plus ONE!” she yells.\n\nHow much is that?\n\n“SIX!”\n\nCheck the back, I say.\n\nShe checks it.\n\n“I was … white!”\n\nYou were right.\n\n“I was … wwwwrrrright!”\n\nShe giggles wildly. I point to a chair.\n\nWhere is the chair? I ask.\n\n“There is it!”\n\nThere it is, I say. Not \"there is it.\"\n\n“There … it … is.”\n\nWhere is the paper?\n\n“There is it!”\n\nThere it is, I say.\n\nShe stops, squints and looks at me.\n\n“Where is the odder kids?” she asks.\n\nI realize she means the children at the mission. Is she missing them? Missing her home? I point to a photo of them on my desk.\n\n“There is it!” she yells.\n\nHome video: Chika studies math with Mitch\n\n* * * *\n\nWe got a second bed.\n\nThis would be where Chika slept — at the foot of our own bed and a few feet from the armoire. Janine and I had to quickly reset the house. We'd owned it for 24 years; it was organized, down to the throw pillows on the couch.\n\nBut your world turns elastic when a child arrives. And so our kitchen cabinet was stocked with Cheerios, and little shoes appeared in the closet, and a hanging rack of pint-sized clothes took root in our bathroom. Everyone who came by seemed to bring a toy, and we quickly collected a basket full of stuffed ponies, talking dinosaurs and silky-haired princesses.\n\nChika’s new bed was made up with a colorful blanket from Disney’s “Frozen.” The first night she slept there, we kissed her, got under our covers, and heard her little voice from somewhere below our feet:\n\n“Goodnight, Mr. Mitch. Goodnight, Miss Janine.”\n\nTo be honest, nothing was the same after that.\n\n* * * *\n\nCancer is speed. Broken down, that’s where it draws its power. The malignant cells spread illogically fast, splitting and multiplying and defying efforts to slow them.\n\nAs those cells were racing through her healthy brain tissue, Chika was racing through a brand new world. She’d rumble around the living room in a circle, touching each piece of furniture. She’d stand by a large window and scream, “Bird!” Everything was a revelation. The TV set. The dishwasher. When we drove her to the hospital, I watched her wide-eyed gazing out the car window, billboards, fast food outlets, a passing limousine. What must she be thinking, I wondered? Her sensory input was on overdrive.\n\nPerhaps that’s why she loved to hide. When I came in from the outside, she would pull a blanket over her head and yell, “Mr. Mitch? Where is Chika?”\n\n“Hmm, where is Chika?” I’d repeat. I’d fake a search. When I finally unearthed her, she’d howl with laughter.\n\n“There is she!” she’d yell.\n\n“There she is,” I’d correct.\n\nHer radiation began. Five days a week for six straight weeks, on a lower level at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. She was fitted for a helmet and had to lie on a slab, as a giant machine shot a beam at her tumor in hopes of destroying DNA in the cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact.\n\nChika understood none of this. Only that she had to stay still — and if she was good, we would go for ice cream or to the toy store. We had chosen not to explain cancer to her. We didn’t nickname her tumor. We told her only that she was a little sick right now, and these treatments would make her better. Our thinking was, she's a child, let her be a child. There’s no right way to do it. You pick a path. This was ours.\n\n“How old is she again?” the radiation oncologist, Dr. Peter Chen, asked one morning as we watched from a monitor outside the room.\n\n“She’s 5,” I said.\n\n“Really?”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“She’s lying so still. She’s better than the adults we treat.”\n\n“Well, she’s 5,” I said.\n\n“Remarkable,” he mumbled.\n\n* * * *\n\nI observe how quickly her English improves. She, meanwhile, is observing me.\n\nOne day, at the table, I am reading a complicated contract.\n\nOh, boy, I sigh.\n\n“Why do you say 'oh, boy'?” she asks. “There is no boy here.”\n\nIt’s just something people say when they are tired, I say.\n\nShe thinks.\n\n“Why don’t you say, ‘Oh, girl?’\n\nShe loves to sing, but the words are her own. Mary had a little lamb — “whose crease was crise of snow.” A spoon — “from the sugar” — makes the medicine go down. When I correct her, she insists, “It’s my mouth, I can say it the way I want.”\n\nOne morning, she makes an observation.\n\n“Mr. Mitch, when you sleep, you sound like a bear.”\n\nJanine laughs. I laugh. Chika laughs at us laughing. She makes a snorting sound and we laugh even harder. She is so happy, so pleased. There is rare delight, I recall, in making your parents crack up.\n\nEven if they are not your parents.\n\nAUGUST 2015\n\nRadiating a brain tumor can cause swelling, or edema. So steroids are prescribed to reduce that risk, which in turn quickly puff up a child. This is why, in photos of DIPG kids, they often seem ill-formed, their faces grotesquely swollen.\n\nIn Chika’s case, the doctors prescribed Dexamethasone (a substance, I noted, that will get you thrown out of the Olympics). I had written about steroids over the years, decrying their risk and long-term consequences. I silently cringed when she swallowed them every morning, hidden inside a spoonful of applesauce.\n\nBreakfast had become part of our routine, scrambled eggs, toast and, as the steroids increased her appetite, more eggs, more toast — plus avocado, tomato, jelly, cereal. Chika insisted that she could make the eggs (after watching me do it) so I stood behind her as she scrambled them in a bowl. She came up to my waist and sometimes I would wiggle my fingers in her hair.\n\n“Hey,” she would say, laughing, “stop doing that!’’\n\n“But I like it,” I’d say.\n\n“Ohhh-k,” she’d relent.\n\nOne day, as I did this, her hair came out in my fingers. She turned and looked. I quickly closed my fist.\n\nSoon, such changes were obvious. Chika’s soft, round face grew large and distorted (the steroids). Her middle swelled. Her thighs puffed. She ballooned from 48 pounds to 72 pounds. Lifting her became a challenge.\n\nMore patches of hair fell out. At night, her head got hot and she sweated, and at times she would scream during her sleep, much of it in Creole that we did not understand. In the morning, we asked if she had a bad dream, and she sometimes said, “I dreamed about a monster.”\n\nWe went through the summer this way, shuffling her to medical appointments, doctors, homeschooling her at the house. I fell behind on jobs. I was late filing stories. The parenting process hijacked every hour we used to have for ourselves.\n\nAnd yet, it never felt like a burden. More like a new purpose we had suddenly tumbled into, rendering our old life a phone call we just couldn’t make, or an appointment we just kept missing.\n\nJanine and I divvied up the daily tasks of keeping Chika occupied, Janine taking the dressing, the showering, the tea parties and game playing, while I handled the doctor appointments, the food gathering, the toy store runs — and the dental care.\n\nEach morning when Chika rose and each night before she went to bed, I would squeeze toothpaste on her newly purchased toothbrush. She’d developed some gum issues, so I added mouthwash in a little cup. As she went through her routine, I stood behind her, studying our reflections in the bathroom mirror, and the obvious contrasts in our ethnicity.\n\nI wondered how Chika saw us. Black? White? Haitian? American? She never asked about our differences, although in that mirror we could not have looked more opposite, short, tall, dark-skinned, light-skinned. It didn’t matter. We were there to brush teeth. Eventually, I would say, “OK, spit” and she would do so and laugh.\n\nOne night, Chika clomped ahead of me to the bathroom. She shut the door mischievously, before I could get in.\n\n“What are you doing, Chika?”\n\n“Just a minute!” she yelled.\n\nJust a minute?\n\nI knocked again.\n\n“Just a minute!”\n\nFinally, when she hollered, “OK!” I entered saying, “Chika, come on, you can’t shut—\"\n\nI stopped. She had laid two toothbrushes side by side, squeezed out the toothpaste, and lined up two cups of mouthwash.\n\n“Now, you can brush your teeth with me,” she said.\n\nAs the doctor said. Remarkable.\n\nHome video: Chika and Mitch bond over nightly ritual\n\n* * * *\n\nOn a monthly visit to Haiti, one of our young boys asks me, “When is Chika coming back?”\n\nHe asks in front of a dozen other kids standing in the dusty yard. I have been avoiding this question. I don’t want to lie. I tell them Chika is getting treatment from the doctors and we hope to bring her back for a visit soon.\n\n“Does she sleep with you and Miss Janine?”\n\nYes.\n\n“In your bed?”\n\nShe has her own.\n\n“Does she eat with you?”\n\nYes.\n\n“Beans and rice?”\n\nOther things.\n\n“Does she have dolls?\"\n\nSome dolls.\n\n“Which ones?”\n\nI don’t know their names.\n\n“Should we pray for Chika?”\n\nAlways.\n\n“Every night?”\n\nEvery night.\n\nThey look off, as if trying to comprehend all this. It is hot, as usual, and they squint in the sun. One girl raises her hand.\n\n“When Chika comes back, can she bring the dolls?”\n\nSEPTEMBER 2015\n\nAnyone dealing with a terminal illness today will, at some point, face a fundamental decision: explore the Internet, or not.\n\nWe avoided it for months, having once scrolled the “DIPG” entries and seen countless heartbreaking Facebook posts and wide-reaching but often contradictory suggestions. It seemed confusing, even depressing, photographs of swollen children, holding teddy bears at fund-raisers, making final trips to Disneyland, parents bravely pushing up smiles. And the medical conclusions were all over the map. Try this. Don't try this. This worked. This didn't work.\n\nI stopped looking. Wanting to believe our case was unique, however naive that was, held off a crashing wave of hopelessness.\n\nSo instead of the Internet, I spoke with doctors, I called them, hounded them — especially the pediatric oncologists at Mott, Dr. Pat Robertson and Dr. Carl Koschmann. I asked them constantly about alternative treatments. What were other researchers finding? What were the latest drugs? What about Europe? I’d been warned that radiation provides a “false honeymoon” for DIPG kids, and could improve Chika to a point where we thought she was OK.\n\n“Don’t be fooled,” they cautioned, “the tumor comes back — and stronger.” So I tried to be preemptive. Unfortunately, besides radiation, there is no real treatment for DIPG. What exists are clinical trials, experimental drugs, a potpourri of unproven choices, like some massive medical casino. Choose your odds. Place your bets.\n\nMeanwhile, during this time, DIPG was unusually present in our local news.\n\nChad Carr, the 4-year-old grandson of Lloyd Carr, the former Michigan football coach, had been diagnosed with the same disease, in the fall of 2014. His parents, Tammi and Jason Carr, had made his battle public, to raise awareness of DIPG. Stories were written. Photos were taken. A hashtag — #ChadTough — was created.\n\nRead more:\n\nChadTough gala raises $1.025 million to combat DIPG, pediatric cancer\n\nChad Carr's family sets up DIPG Day in Michigan in his honor\n\nOn the afternoon of Sept. 12, 2015, I was at Michigan Stadium, covering the Wolverines football game against Oregon State. Just before kickoff, the crowd rose and cheered.\n\nChad Carr was being carried onto the field by his family.\n\nThe stadium announcer bellowed, “Joining the game captains for the coin toss is Chad Carr. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Carr family…”\n\nAt that moment, more than 100,000 spectators knew this little boy was fighting for his life. Fighting DIPG. It might have been natural to tell a colleague, “I have a child with that same cancer.”\n\nI didn’t. I kept quiet. I went home and never mentioned it to Janine. I knew, deep down, this was folly, thinking silence could affect anything. But when it comes to facing a child’s certain death, folly is underrated.\n\nOCTOBER 2015\n\nWe are in New York City. We have committed Chika to an experimental procedure run out of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, something called CED, Convection Enhanced Delivery. In this process, a catheter is inserted directly into the tumor, and a radioactive iodine, attached to an antibody, is dripped through the tube and into the cancerous tissue. The theory is this will be more effective, because CED circumvents the blood-brain barrier that keeps other drugs — even chemotherapy — from ever reaching the trouble spot.\n\nIt is the second time in four months that doctors will break through Chika’s skull.\n\nWe try to make the trip an adventure. Chika has never been to a city like New York, and her head is a swivel. Her new word is “Hey!” and she puts it before everything.\n\n“Hey! That building is so tall!”\n\n“Hey! There is a horse in the street!”\n\nI think about what she is about to go through. I hug her close and put my head on top of hers.\n\n“Hey! Why do you lean on me? I am not a bed!”\n\nShe is giddy with the energy of Manhattan, and Janine and I each take a hand as we lead her across busy intersections. I realize, had things been different, this could be a snapshot of us 30 years earlier, a happy young family darting across the street.\n\nNow we look like grandparents.\n\nWe visit Serendipity on the East Side, a restaurant famous for gargantuan frozen hot chocolates. We get Chika one and take photos of her sipping it. Bloated by the steroids, her face and belly are huge, and I notice an older woman looking at her with an expression that says, “Does she really need to eat more?” I glare back.\n\nLater, we walk Chika through Times Square. There are people dressed as Superman, Spiderman, Olaf. We take photos. One of the characters, on a break, removes his large cartoon head.\n\n“Hey!” Chika screams. “There is a man inside Mickey Mouse!”\n\nThat night, in the hotel room, we sit with Chika between us on the bed. I rub her cheeks. She has been taking liothyronine and super-saturated potassium iodine to block the potential harm to her thyroid. We have been warned that this operation, which requires precise, hours-long, computer-aided placement of the catheter, might be dangerous. I’ve been given a form that lists the possible risks:\n\nComa.\n\nPotentially uncontrollable seizures.\n\nDeath.\n\nI ask myself who am I to sign this? What right do I have? Who gave me that power?\n\nAnd then I remember checking in at the hospital and being given a badge that read “PARENT.” And I sign the form, because as a parent, even a substitute one, letting Chika sink is not an option. I put on a happy face and hide behind it as I play with her, like a man inside a Mickey Mouse.\n\nNOVEMBER 2015\n\nChika made it through the procedure. In truth, she sailed through it, which gave us hope. The lead doctor, Mark Souweidane, a pediatric neurosurgeon, was pleased with the way the treatment spread around the tumor. He showed us a scan, the luminescent green being the radioactive agent; it was like watching Kryptonite invade Superman’s head.\n\nI realized how many times I had now seen Chika’s brain on film. When previous scans were put side by side, it was clear that something we had tried had shrunk the tumor significantly.\n\n“This is good, right?” I’d ask the doctors.\n\n“It’s good,” they’d say, but there was always something behind their response, a hesitation, a filter; I was stung that they would not share my enthusiasm. Had they become that hardened to good news?\n\nChika, for her part, remained nonplussed, asking mostly about toy stores or a trip back to Haiti. No matter where we dragged her, or how much weight she gained, we were astonished at her lack of a complaint gene. The closest she came was after her surgery at Sloan Kettering, when Janine took her into the bathroom, and she looked in the mirror, and realized the doctors, in clearing a path for the catheter, had shaved a 3-inch square patch of her hair just above the forehead. It looked as if someone let a lawnmower run over it.\n\n“Hey!” she declared. “What happened to my hair?”\n\nWe bought her headbands to cover the spot. They had large, colorful flowers.\n\nShe was happy once again.\n\nCHRISTMAS 2015\n\nKeeping a promise, I take her back to Haiti. She bounces up and down as the airplane lands. If not for the seat belt, she might fly away.\n\nIn the Port-au-Prince terminal, a five-piece band plays just beyond passport control, and Chika stops to dance freely in front of them, a smile pasted across her still-chubby face.\n\nHer arrival at the orphanage is triumphant. She hides behind the seat when the SUV pulls in, but she can hear chants of “Chi-ka! Chi-ka!” The children mob the door, calling her name.\n\nAmid an ocean of wild hugging and squeals from the happy nannies, she strips off her sweatshirt and runs to the swing set. The other kids surround her, pushing her higher. As she rises into the Haitian air, her face is a portrait of relief.\n\nShe is home.\n\nWatch: Chika returns to Haiti\n\nThat night, she returns to her lower bunk bed in a crowded room of 13 other girls. In Michigan, she has accumulated a bevy of dolls, shelves of books, games and toys.\n\nHere, she has none of that. Just a cubby for her clothes and a toothbrush in the common outdoor sink area. But if she misses anything, she does not show it. She falls in line for meals, for showers. I wait for her to hold court, regaling the other kids with stories of her U.S. adventures. It never happens. Perhaps talking about America reminds her she will have to go back.\n\nI give small toys to all the kids. After a day, Chika’s breaks. She brings it to me to fix.\n\nI get a screwdriver. I fix it. Chika says “thank you” and runs off happy.\n\nKids expect grown-ups to fix things. I know, deep down, she expects us to fix her.\n\nWe’re trying, Chika. We’re trying.\n\nFEBRUARY 2016\n\nIf terminal cancer allows a “honeymoon” period, we were surely in it during the early months of 2016. Chika’s walking had improved greatly. She could swim (something she loved). Her left eye had readjusted, her smile was nearly even, and her body was slowly returning to normal, the steroids, blessedly, no longer needed.\n\nOn a visit to Mott, Chika took off down the hallway, then ran back and jumped, unexpectedly, into Dr. Robertson’s arms.\n\n“Oooh,” the doctor said, nearly knocked backward. She hugged Chika, and I silently took pride in how well this little girl — our little girl — was performing.\n\n“She’s doing great, right?” I said.\n\n“Uh-huh,” came the reply, again, in my mind, less enthusiastic than I wanted.\n\nChika’s affection, reserved when she first arrived, was full-bore now. She regularly hoisted herself into our bed and snuggled between Janine and me. She knew, when visitors came, to give the “two arm hug.” And the more cartoon movies about princesses she watched, the more fascinated she became with kissing.\n\nSometimes, in the early mornings, I’d be down in my office and my cell phone would ring. The house line was calling.\n\n“Mr. Mitch?” came her voice, still froggy with sleep. “Do you want to play fluffy cozy bed camp?”\n\nAnd I would tramp upstairs, enter the bedroom, and see two lumps under the blankets. Forgetting about writing, I would crawl beneath them and tussle a giggling Chika, who promptly informed me that, “I am the boss, and Miss Janine is the second boss. You can be the third boss.”\n\nShe passed her sixth birthday with a celebration at the Rain Forest Café, and more than 30 people came out — friends and relatives who helped entertain and care for her. She drew cards for them. On Valentine's Day, she drew one for us, with a small figure (her) standing beside two bigger figures (us). It read: \"I love you Mr. Mitch, Miss Janine, CHIKA.”\n\nWhoever she encountered was instantly taken with her. Once, while in a Belleville Cracker Barrel with our friends, Jeff and Patty Alley, Chika’s enthusiasm caught the attention of Michigan football coach Jim Harbaugh. He had no idea who she was – and she certainly didn’t know him – but he was so taken with her, he bought her a toy guitar.\n\nShe had that effect.\n\nHer voice was magnetic — people actually stopped and complimented us on how sweet she sounded — and she was unafraid to use that voice to blurt out her growing immersion into English, even when her signals got crossed.\n\nExamples? When she washed with cold water, she declared, “Cold water, warm heart!” When I said I was bad at coloring, she said, “You never know since you try.”\n\nShe couldn’t get the word “rewind” right, so if I zoomed too far with the remote control, she’d say, “No! You have to remind it!”\n\nShe insisted the “Itsy Bitsy Spider” was the “Isby Bisby Spider” and the \"Sound of Music\" song went “Do-a-deer, an e-mail deer.” When she ate something she liked — which was all the time — she yelled “Yummy-yummy-yummy in my tummy, tummy, tummy!” and when she got dressed or used the bathroom it was “Privacy, please!” If she got testy, I’d say, “Remember, nobody likes a grumpy girl.”\n\n“Nobody like a grumpy boy, either!” she’d shoot back.\n\nOnce, while I was writing, she interrupted me multiple times to ask for crayons. I turned to her, patiently as I could, and said, “Chika, I have to work.”\n\n“Mr. Mitch,” she replied, “I have to play.”\n\nJanine and I made all the joyous stops with her, like one of those happy montage scenes in a movie. We took her to a musical, to Disneyland, we took her to “meet” Daniel Tiger. I took her for her first sled ride, which terrified her until she completed it and quickly yelled, “Can I do it AGAIN?” We hit the aquarium, the mall. We bought her a frilly yellow dress, a replica of the one Belle wore in “Beauty and the Beast.” She tried it on in front of a mirror and stared at herself for a long time\n\n“You’re a princess, Chika,” Janine said.\n\nChika beamed.\n\nAnd when she did, it was possible to think, even with a tumor the size of rubber ball sitting in her brain stem, that this child was going to be an exception, that she would push through and live to wear an adult version of that dress one day. This is what children do. They make you believe their youth can overcome anything.\n\nThen one day, she was swimming with an instructor, and I was on my way to work, and my phone rang and it was Janine. She was frantic.\n\n“Chika just threw up in the pool,” she said.\n\nI sped back home.\n\nHoneymoon over.\n\n****\n\nWe never hear from her father. According to the godmother, Herzulia, he is alive, but hasn’t been interested in his daughter since the day his wife died. She says he drinks. All the time. I cannot verify this. I have never met him.\n\nOn a monthly trip to Haiti, I ask Alain whether he thinks he can locate him.\n\n“I can try,” he says.\n\nHe makes some phone calls. He drives off in the mission car. Hours later, he returns with a short, mustached man, wearing gray slacks and a long-sleeved white shirt in the oppressive heat. Chika’s father. When I ask how he pulled this off, Alain shrugs. He says he made some inquiries, found a village, found the man and asked him to come.\n\nOnly in Haiti, I tell myself.\n\nHis name is Fedner Jeune. He is maybe 5 feet 7, slightly built. His large eyes are bloodshot, but they are Chika’s eyes. He looks like an unhappy, grown-up, male version of her. When I greet him, I feel empathy and resentment.\n\nTell him I’d like to know more about his daughter, I say.\n\nAlain does. He responds in Creole.\n\n“He says whatever you want to know, he will tell you.”\n\nI ask questions. About her birth. About her mother. I ask if he can take us to where Chika grew up. He says yes. We get in the car. He is missing two of his lower teeth. He never looks me in the eye.\n\nWe drive for an hour, beyond the traffic-choked maze of Port-au-Prince, teeming with street vendors and women carrying baskets on their heads. We reach the outskirts, where vegetation replaces buildings and paved roads turn to mud.\n\nAlain stops the car.\n\n“We are here,” he says.\n\nA tin door is hinged to a tree trunk. Inside, a patch of earth surrounds a small, square, cinder-block house, which is doorless.\n\nThis is where Chika was born? I ask.\n\n“Yes,” he says.\n\nThere is an extension cord that comes through the breadfruit trees. A single light bulb is hooked to it.\n\nAnd Chika’s mother died here, I ask?\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWhere is she buried?\n\nHe points outside.\n\nCan we go? I ask.\n\nIn a few minutes, we are at the site. I was expecting a cemetery. Instead, it is just a clearing, dotted by bushes and an old shack made of wood and tin. Laundry hangs on tree branches, and a woman and her children sit on buckets, watching us silently. A goat and a pig wander loose.\n\nSeveral slabs of concrete, each a different size, are above the ground. Fedner points to the biggest one.\n\n“There,” he says.\n\nShe is buried beneath that? I say.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nWith others?\n\n“Yes.”\n\nHow many others?\n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nIt is a mass grave. There are no markers. No names.\n\nHe pays someone every year, he says, to rent the space.\n\nThe goat bleats. Fedner scratches his head. I can tell he wonders why we are bothering with all this. I ask Alain to explain how sick Chika is, and how we hope we can find a cure for her tumor, but it is possible we may not.\n\nFedner has no reaction.\n\n\"If Chika dies,\" Alain asks him, \"Do you have any wishes where she should be buried?\"\n\nHe looks down and mumbles something.\n\nWhat did he say, I ask?\n\n“He says whatever you decide is fine with him.”\n\nA bug whizzes by my head. I study the slab above the mother’s remains. I promise myself it won’t be anything like this.\n\nMAY 2016\n\nThe tumor, it turns out, was like a sleeping bear: After winter hibernation, it grew hungry and stirred.\n\nChika’s eye drooped again. Her walking grew unsteady. February, March and April saw numerous medical maneuvers. A drug called Afinitor (Everolimus) was introduced, followed by Avastin, designed to shrink back some of the tumor growth. A new chemotherapy drug called Panobinostat — hailed as promising against DIPG by a Stanford physician — was procured by Dr. Robertson. Chika was approved to receive it and we braced ourselves to enter the “chemo” world. We were following a regimen of multiple nutritional supplements, mixed into a daily shake that Chika dutifully drank from a large princess cup.\n\nPrior to that, desperate to stay ahead of the tumor’s progression, we'd enrolled in a second CED treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering. The initial procedure again went well. But in the middle of the night, with the catheter locked in her skull and the radioactive iodine oozing into her tumor, Chika somehow got out of bed and walked over to where I slept in a chair.\n\nI heard a noise. My eyes sprung open. There was Chika, inches away, the line from the catheter stretched like a kitchen phone cord.\n\n“Can we go to the toy store?” she asked, dreamily.\n\nI lurched her back toward the bed, the cord retracting. \"Oh, my God, Chika,\" I said. I frantically called the nurses. It was nearly 4 a.m. When Dr. Souweidane rushed in, he was, like the rest of us, in virtual disbelief. But apparently, after careful review, no damage was done.\n\nAn hour later, Chika was sleeping, Dr. Souweidane was gone, the nurses were tending to other patients, and I was shaking my head.\n\nThe toy store?\n\n* * * *\n\nShe has trouble walking now, and I hold both hands and guide her up and down staircases.\n\n“Step, step, step,” I say.\n\n“Step, step, step,” she repeats.\n\nSometimes she wobbles and lands on her rear end. She does not cry. She’ll say “Woops!” or “Hey, I fell on my butt!”\n\nI find myself learning from her simple joys. She is just so content. She makes the bed for her dolls. She delights in brushing Janine’s hair. On airplanes, she takes things from the snack basket and meticulously tucks them away for later, happy as an industrious squirrel. She claps at the end of family movies. She shimmies when she hears music. When I can’t remember the words to a movie song, she exclaims, “You didn’t watch Mary Poppins before? Are you CRAZY?” I apologize and she says, “You just have to watch it again. No problem.”\n\nDuring the day, she is joyous when occupied. She colors. She reads. She watches Bible stories. But at night, when I tuck her in, I can see the illness bothers her.\n\n“When am I going to walk right?” she asks.\n\nI hope soon, I answer. That’s why we’re going to the doctors.\n\n“Mister Mitch?”\n\nMmm?\n\n“If I can’t walk, can I still live with the other kids?”\n\nOf course, I say.\n\nThis breaks my heart.\n\nChika, I say, do you know how much I love you?\n\nShe shakes her head no.\n\nThis much, I say.\n\nI hold my arms out and grunt as I stretch them behind me. I turn to show her. Suddenly, I feel her hands pushing mine even closer together, closer, until the fingers touch.\n\n“That much?” she says.\n\nThat much, I say.\n\nJULY 2016\n\nOver the months, we lost track of how many needles Chika absorbed. Her veins were extremely hard to find, hiding as if they knew what was coming. Nurses tried her arms, wrists, feet, toes. Warm compresses. Vein finders.\n\nNothing helped. Every blood test was a major struggle. Chika was like a pincushion, and she howled with every poke, more scared — like most kids — of the second needle than the first.\n\nFinally, in late June, an Avastin treatment had to be canceled because they could not get a clean vein for infusion. Janine and I were advised that, in order to continue, she would require an intravenous port.\n\n“No! I hate that idea,” Janine said. I agreed. A foreign chamber placed under the skin? With a catheter into a vein that travels to the heart? It was frighteningly futuristic, a permanent branding. But in the end, we had no choice. It was that, or no more medicine.\n\nThe procedure was done at Mott (“We do thousands of these” we were told) and once she got home, Chika studied this new addition to her upper chest. She called it her “bump.” We told her it meant “no more stickies,” which seemed to appease her.\n\nAs a reward, I promised her another trip to Haiti, after her first port infusion. She endured that.\n\nAnd the next day, we left.\n\nBut something seemed off. Just hours after our arrival at the mission, Chika’s forehead was hot. She looked tired. She wanted to sleep in her bunk bed with the girls, but I suggested she spend that night with me.\n\nAfter brushing her teeth, and putting her on a pillow, I lay down next to her and shut my eyes.\n\n“Mr. Mitch?”\n\n“Yes, Chika?”\n\nShe vomited all over me.\n\nShe started to cry. “It’s all right, Chika, it’s fine, this is nothing,” I said, wiping the mess with the sheets. “Here we go. Here we go.” I hurried her to the bathroom.\n\nThirty minutes later, having cleaned the floor, the bed, changed her clothes (and mine) and put her back onto the pillow, she called my name once more. Her chest was heaving. I turned.\n\nShe vomited again.\n\nIt happened two more times. I ran out of towels and put old T-shirts beneath us. She finally fell into a troubled sleep, while I stayed awake, monitoring her breathing, hoping this was a stomach bug and fearing far worse.\n\nThe rest of the trip was a blur. Chika was mostly groggy, rarely engaged, sleepwalking through events that would normally have her giddy. She didn’t play. She hardly sang during devotions. When we left for the airport, she didn’t even want to say good-bye to the other kids. She just got into the SUV and looked out the window.\n\nShe slept much of the ride home.\n\nWithin a day back in Detroit, she’d developed a raging fever. We raced to Beaumont Hospital and then, via ambulance, she was transferred to Mott. An infection of some kind, they said. Antibiotics were started. CT scans. PT scans. MRIs. Her temperature zoomed above 104. Her heart rate reached 160 beats a minutes. They thought it was her lungs. They checked for meningitis. They spoke of sepsis. We fell into a nervous vigil in the hospital room, sleeping in chairs, eating from the cafeteria, bringing in balloons to try to brighten the drabness.\n\nIn the end, the infection was traced back to the port. Somehow, bacteria had entered during the one time they’d used it. The device was removed (a month after its insertion) leaving a scar on Chika’s soft chest and endless head shaking from Janine and me.\n\n“I knew it was a bad idea,’’ Janine said, near tears. “I knew it. I knew it.”\n\nNow, we were informed, even as Chika lay groggy, sweating, pumped full of antibiotics, that she needed a new form of delivery. A PICC line was suggested (Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter) a long, thin tube that goes through an arm vein and, as with the port, tips into a larger vein that goes to the heart. But unlike the port, a PICC protrudes, hanging from your biceps like a marionette string; it needs to be constantly cleaned and protected.\n\nAgain, what choice did we have? The line was put inside Chika and we were given a crash course in how to use it, flush it, sanitize its tips, seal, tuck, then repeat the process.\n\nWe hid our frustration. Chika had been through enough. The night before she was to leave the hospital, we all watched a Cinderella movie on the room’s TV set. She loved to see Cinderella dance with Prince Charming.\n\n“You can dance that way at your wedding,\" Janine said.\n\n“If I marry a prince?”\n\n“Maybe.” Janine knew Chika's best friend in America was one of our nephews, a sweetly-tempered 8-year-old named Aidan. “Maybe if you marry Aidan,” she said, teasingly.\n\nChika frowned and shook her head.\n\n“Aidan will not marry a sick girl.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“Aidan will not marry a girl who cannot walk.”\n\nWe were stunned.\n\n“Chika. Of course he would.”\n\n“Aidan will not marry a girl who is missing her hair.”\n\n“Sweetheart. You marry people because you love them, no matter what their problems. Don’t say things like that.”\n\nShe looked at us blankly, as if these were the facts that we were too naïve to accept. With a tube sticking out of her arm, she turned back to the screen where Cinderella was dancing, a fairy tale more comforting than the truth.\n\n* * * *\n\nThe infection puts a hold on everything — including the chemotherapy she had started. It also shoots a hole in our confidence. The chemo is, at best, a long shot. Chika has already endured a second radiation therapy — something considered risky, but that we still tried. Any more radiation could damage her brain and possibly kill her.\n\nWe are running out of options, as if someone is crossing them off a list and saying, “Nope.”\n\nReluctantly, I return to the Internet. There are studies going on worldwide. Experimental drugs. Experimental trials. Each morning, I make calls and leave numbers. I send e-mails around the globe. Everyone wants to know what stage “the patient” is in, and when I detail what she has already been through — brain surgery, two radiations, two CEDs, chemo — a number of places say she is too deep into conflicting therapies, or, worse, just too far along. Every denial is like a chiming clock.\n\nI speak with Tammi Carr. She has offered to help. Her son, Chad, after a courageous battle, died of his DIPG, two months after that game at Michigan Stadium.\n\n“Chad gained his angel wings,” Tammi had written on her Facebook page.\n\nFifteen months from diagnosis to death.\n\nChika is at 15 months.\n\n“I know someone in Bristol,” Tammi says. “Bristol” is Bristol, England — just as “Houston” is the MD Anderson Cancer Center and “Mexico” is the intra-arterial treatments they are trying in that country. DIPG has a code of its own; all parents seem to know the shorthand.\n\nThe Bristol program is similar to Sloan Kettering, but instead of putting one catheter into the brain tumor, they use four. I correspond with the doctors there. I send scans through overnight delivery. Eventually, Chika is determined to be too far along (those words again). The doctor suggests an immunology program in Cologne, Germany.\n\nGermany?\n\nE-mails are sent. MRIs are sent. A Skype session is arranged. Chika qualifies. It is $45,000 for the treatment, no insurance taken, and at least three visits are required over three months time, eight days per visit, to judge the procedure's effectiveness.\n\nPlace your bets.\n\nSEPTEMBER 2016\n\nI pulled Chika’s wheelchair backward, up the small ramp and into the three-story apartment building in Cologne. A trolley rolled past. Passengers unloaded, students chatting loudly in German. We’d rented a flat here, and had been in it a week.\n\n“I have to go potty,” Chika moaned.\n\n“Hang on, hang on,” I huffed. I undid her belt, lifted beneath her arms, hoisted her onto my shoulders and clomped up a 20-step staircase. There was no elevator in the building.\n\n“Hang on, hang on,” I said, my breathing labored.\n\n“I have to go baaad.”\n\n“Hang onnnn.”\n\nI fumbled with the keys. I opened the door.\n\n“Hurry!”\n\nInto the bathroom, jacket off, leggings yanked down, hoist her onto the seat.\n\n“OK? OK?” I said, panting.\n\n“Privacy, please,” she replied.\n\nOut I went. In came Janine. This was our routine now. Chika had regressed from a walker to a wheelchair. For short distances she crawled across the floor. “My feet are sleepy,” she would say.\n\nShe had increasing issues with her bladder. Bathroom runs were a fire drill. Sometimes we found her quietly sobbing in the morning, and we’d say, “What’s wrong?” and we’d see the wet sheet beneath her and she’d say, “I need new underwear.”\n\nHer left eye no longer blinked, and at night we put soft tape over it to keep it from drying out. Her PICC line required constant care, robbing her of her beloved swimming or bubble baths. She could no longer pedal a toy car or run to hide behind a couch. We prayed that this immunology treatment would be her miracle. But the laundry list of things she had to surrender was growing longer than things she could do.\n\nAnd yet. Her adjustment skills were incredible. We’d sit and watch a film and she’d get so happy she’d throw her arms around me and say, “This is a really good movie!” I’d ask her what was her favorite part and she’d say, “Um, I don’t really understand what’s happening.”\n\nOr in Germany, in a small apartment, where we had to sleep in three twin beds pushed together. Chika loved it. She flopped between us as if we were pillows, asking Janine and me to kiss so she could watch. When we did, she clapped and said, “Now we can live happily ever after.”\n\nEvery day, after her treatments, we’d explore the streets of Cologne, me pushing her in her wheelchair, Chika flapping her arms and singing out loud, butchering lyrics from “Annie,”, “Frozen” or Christmas songs (“down through the chimney comes old, sick Nick!”). She remained totally unembarrassed. I envied her bravado.\n\nI wheeled her once to the towering Cologne Cathedral, first built in the 13th Century, and she surveyed it from her wheelchair and said she had never seen a building so big. I told her it was a church and that people prayed inside it.\n\n“What do they pray for?” she asked.\n\n“They pray for everything. They pray for their family. They pray they’ll get better if they are sick.”\n\n“They don’t pray for me. I’m not their child!”\n\n“They might be praying for you.”\n\n“They don’t even know me.”\n\n“People don’t have to know you to pray for you.”\n\n\n\nShe thought about that, then went back to chewing on a pretzel.\n\nChika was no stranger to faith. Sunday church and nightly devotions are routine at the Haiti mission, and she was always a loud and joyous force during those prayers. In Michigan, Janine once walked in on her intently singing a worship song to herself.\n\n“I’m no longer a slave to fear\n\nI am a child of God...”\n\nShe sang it, uninterrupted, for nine minutes, as if in private discourse with the Lord, her face calm, her eyes wide.\n\n\"I’m no longer a slave to fear\n\nI am a child of God.\"\n\nOne night, she asked if her mommy was in heaven.\n\n“Yes, she is,” we said.\n\n“When I go to heaven, will I see her?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“How will she know me?”\n\n“She’ll know you.”\n\n“Can you walk in heaven?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Can you run?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Can you have candy?”\n\n“Yes. Why?”\n\nShe shrugged. And then it hit me. She was listing all the things she could no longer do down here.\n\n* * * *\n\nOf all the maddening aspects of cancer, the worst may be the deal it seems to make with our immune systems. While our T-cells regularly attack other infections, cancer employs what some call a \"secret handshake\" that renders T-cells blind to their threat.\n\n\"Immunotherapy\" is a treatment that tries to alter that handshake — often by fooling the immune system into fighting the cancer. The Cologne clinic that treated Chika (called IOZK, and run by a Belgian oncologist) employed a technique that uses the patient’s own blood to create a cancer-fighting vaccine. This is done through the injection of a virus (NDV) that is deadly to poultry but harmless to humans. It attacks the DIPG tumor, the attack is studied, dendritic cells are beefed up in a specialized laboratory facility, and, ultimately, a vaccine from the patient’s own white cells and tumor antigens is injected back into the body, with the hope that the immune system does what the virus did: attack and kill the cancer cells in the brain.\n\nChika, again, didn’t understand any of this. But she listened to the doctors speak “a funny language” and she liked the water bed they let her lay in. The clinic was sparse, simple, on the fourth floor of an office building, one level above a gym. We sat near Chika as her head was heated by hyperthermia, and the poultry virus dripped through her PICC line, while she watched an iPad movie, lost in the magic of “101 Dalmatians.”\n\nA nurse brought me a cup of coffee. I heard conversations in German. I thought about how far we were from Haiti, and our kids kicking a soccer ball in the yard, wondering where Chika was and what she might be doing.\n\n* * * *\n\nI go to a doctor. I’m having pain in my lower abdomen. I may have a hernia.\n\n“Are you doing a lot of lifting?” the doctor asks.\n\nI almost laugh. Chika is constantly in my arms, and even at 62 pounds, is a challenge to pick up from funny angles.\n\nYes, I tell the doctor, a lot of lifting.\n\n“That could do it,” he says.\n\nHe says I should stop, but I know I will not. Holding this little girl, her arms hooked around my neck, head cradled beneath my chin, is the most satisfying posture I have ever known. I can feel Chika relax, feel the security that she gets from my grip. I try to find the word for it.\n\nTrust. That’s the word.\n\nTotal, unconditional trust.\n\nOne night I carry her to her bed, and I lay her down and she looks up sweetly. Janine is there, too.\n\n“How did you find me?” she whispers.\n\nHow did we find you? we say, surprised. You mean how did you come to us?\n\nShe nods.\n\nWe look at each other. It is the first time, really, she is asking who she is.\n\nSo we tell her. Her birth. The earthquake. Her long journey to this moment. When we finish, she seems satisfied. “One day,\" she says. \"I want to go back and live in Haiti.”\n\nBut if you weren’t here, we would miss you very much, we say.\n\n“Well,” she responds, “when I'm not here, you can close your eyes and think of me!”\n\nAnd while we cannot imagine life without her, the truth is, we would surely take this if it meant she could grow, if she could live out her years, seeing adolescence, graduating high school, finding a purpose, realizing her dream of being, as she once wished, “big.”\n\nWe would take it in a heartbeat.\n\nDECEMBER 2016\n\nThere was no joy at Christmas. Chika had suffered what the doctors euphemistically called “a setback.”\n\nUpon returning from her third trip to Germany, she was sluggish, her left side showed weakness and she threw up several times. She was drooling and her speech was slurring.\n\nWe returned to Mott. They took an MRI. The worst news was confirmed.\n\nThe tumor had sharply progressed.\n\nThis is the moment DIPG families dread. They are warned. They are briefed. Still, when it happens, it is like a sneak attack. I spoke with other parents. One told me his DIPG son was walking and talking and a week later, he was gone.\n\nFor the first time since Alain’s phone call, I began waking up in fear.\n\nChika’s eating grew labored. Her drinking, too. Her right arm and hand weren’t really functioning, and when I gave her cups, she bobbled them and they spilled.\n\n“Oops,” she'd say, quickly. “Sorry.”\n\n“It’s all right, no problem,” I’d reply, putting a cheer on every sentence.\n\nBut when your child’s outlook changes, your world changes with it. There was no personal time any more. Projects were tabled. Work meetings were canceled. I all but stopped writing for the newspaper. Janine and I wore floppy clothes around the house, showered less frequently, and almost never went out socially. The normal Christmas stuff was put on hold. No shopping. No gatherings. Instead, we spent nights monitoring Chika’s breathing, getting her to the bathroom on time, sitting with her as she tried to color, frustrated that her shaking hands could not stay within the lines.\n\nShe lost a tooth one night and, as was custom, she put it under her pillow for the Tooth Fairy. But we were so exhausted from giving her medicine, flushing her PICC line, and feeding her through syringes (which took hours, because she could no longer swallow whole food) that we fell asleep that night without tending to the matter.\n\nIn the morning, we found Chika sitting up, her head bowed, the tooth her hand.\n\n“Chika, what’s the matter?” we asked.\n\n“The Tooth Fairy forgot me,” she mumbled.\n\nOur fall was complete.\n\nOn Christmas Day, we woke her up, and dressed her in a red sweater. We tried to stir her interest, but she was groggy, her eyes blank. We sat her by the tree and slid in one present after another, gifts people had brought for her. She responded slowly, lacking any thrill of a year earlier, when she ripped open everything.\n\nIn the middle of this, Janine leaned over and gave her a kiss. Then she asked, “Do you want to kiss Mr. Mitch?” She nodded and kissed my cheek with a spitty smack. Then Chika whispered, “Kiss each other.”\n\nSo we did, in front of her face, and she had a look of wonder, and Janine started to cry and said, \"Thank you, angel.\" And with her good hand, Chika reached for the tissues and pulled one out and tried to dab Janine's tears, which only made her cry more.\n\nWatch: A lullaby for Chika\n\n* * * *\n\nThe disease progression is like death by a thousand cuts. But the hardest loss is Chika’s voice. That precious voice, like cotton candy melting in the air. When it begins to fade, I am desperate to hang on to its sound.\n\nGood morning, Chika, I say.\n\nNo response. Just a stare.\n\nGood morning, sweetheart.\n\nNothing.\n\nShe sleeps with many dolls now, so I take one, a small bear, and ask it questions, hoping to engage her.\n\nDo you belong to Chika? I ask the bear.\n\n“Yes,” Chika finally whispers.\n\nAh. You're a lucky bear. I think Chika is a really special girl. But don’t tell her! That’s just between you and me.\n\n“But ... I’m her bear,” she says. “I have to tell her everything.”\n\nOh, really? Well. I don’t want you to tell her how much I love her.\n\n“She knows.”\n\nShe does? How much? How much do I love her?\n\nChika slowly takes the arms of the teddy bear and pulls them behind its back.\n\n“This much,” she whispers.\n\nI choke up.\n\nThat’s right, I say. That much.\n\nWatch: Chika is celebrated on her birthday.\n\nFEBRUARY 2017\n\nNurses had arrived in our home. Hospice workers, too. Rehab was arranged, where therapists worked Chika’s otherwise motionless appendages. A support team of friends and family combined for 24-hour shifts. And Chika made a trade. Her PICC line was removed, because of swelling in her arm.\n\nAnd a feeding tube was inserted.\n\nAbove her belly button, just below her sternum, a tiny balloon was pushed through her skin topped by an exposed valve that was connected to a tube. Through that tube, you could drip almost anything — water, apple juice, smoothies, drugs.\n\nWe had to use it, because Chika’s swallowing was gone. Her speaking was gone. Her voluntary movement was limited to a finger wave — all because of the relentless DIPG tumor rooted in her pons and spreading like an ooze, slowly crippling her every ability. Germany was out. So were any return trips to Haiti. Chika could no longer endure the travel. I was almost grateful that she couldn’t ask to go home, because I hated having to disappoint her.\n\nShe’d thinned considerably, and with her hair braided, she looked younger, remarkably like the day she’d arrived, except for the 4 inches she’d sprouted, seemingly all in her legs. A hospital bed had replaced her previous one, and she slept just 2 feet away from us now, close enough to hear every breath. The pulse/oxygen monitor was placed on her finger, and small red digits were a constant reminder of her status. If they dropped, we needed to do something: tap her chest, pound on her back, put a suction tube down her throat and pull up whatever was clogging it.\n\nBecause so much of this felt barely human, we did all we could to humanize the rest. We read to Chika. We sang to her. We recited a special prayer. Each night, we Skyped with the kids in Haiti as they sang their devotions, and one by one, they stepped before the camera and said “Good night, Chika,” “Good night, sister.”\n\nWatch: The other childen wish Chika a good night.\n\nShe responded to their voices like Tinkerbell to pixie dust. I hated to cut off the connection. Sometimes she looked at me silently, and I remembered fixing her toy, and I could almost hear her say, “Can’t you fix this? You’re the grown-up.”\n\nIt haunted me.\n\nFor the first time in my career, I missed the Super Bowl, because Chika was throwing up the morning of my plane. I canceled all commitments. I stopped answering the phone. Our entire focus was on prolonging Chika's life.\n\nShe was a fighter.\n\nWe would be fighters.\n\nOur medical Hail Mary was a drug that few had heard of, Buparlisib, or BKM120, technically a “pan class phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor.” We understood it only as something that might stall the tumor growth, because Chika’s specific tumor mutations, on paper, matched up to this agent. It was nearly impossible to get. Numerous pleas were made to Novartis, the Swiss-based global health care company, to grant us the drug (not available to the public) through its “compassionate care” program. Although we were turned down several times, with help, we ultimately were granted a supply. Each morning, Janine and I opened the little capsules and dissolved them into water, then pulled the water into syringes and pushed it through Chika's feeding tube.\n\nJanine and I did this silently. Carefully. Neither one of us wanted to say what we were thinking: that we were out of chips, the last bet had been placed.\n\nSometimes, when we sat with Chika, I thought about how, in a certain way, she was growing backward, toward infancy. She'd gone from running to walking to crawling to being lifted. From eating to being fed. From bathrooms to being wiped.\n\nFrom talking to silence.\n\nShe was, in a strange way, returning to where she started.\n\nSo far from where she started.\n\n* * * *\n\nI arrange a one-day trip to Haiti.\n\nI have to purchase a grave.\n\nThe laws, I am told, require proof of interment arrangements before a body will be allowed to come into Haiti. I long ago decided that if things went badly, she would be buried here, in her home country, where one day the other children could come and visit. But I cannot fathom making these arrangements if Chika dies, and so I do it now, while it still seems abstract.\n\nAlain drives me to a cemetery called Parc Du Souvenir on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. I am told it is the nicest one. But in comparison to an American cemetery, it is only fair, the graves in uneven rows, plain white headstones, erratic plantings.\n\nI find two empty sites together. We go to the office and Alain informs the manager, a broad-faced, middle-age woman, that I want to purchase them.\n\n“For how many people?”\n\nOne, I say.\n\nShe almost laughs.\n\n“One person, you should use the crypt in the wall. A grave is for five people.\"\n\nAlain explains that in Haiti, bodies are stacked five high in grave sites.\n\n“Two would be for 10 people,” the woman adds.\n\nWell, I want two plots, I repeat. I want space for her loved ones to be able to sit and visit.\n\nShe shakes her head as if I am crazy.\n\n“Who is it for?” she asks.\n\nI don’t want to tell her the whole story.\n\nMy daughter, I say.\n\nShe looks at me.\n\n“I'm sorry,” she says.\n\nAPRIL 7, 2017\n\nThe phone rings. No one answers it. This is back where the story began, in our bedroom, on a Friday afternoon. Our friends and family have said their good-byes, exiting in tears. It is only Janine, the nurses, me.\n\nAnd Chika.\n\nWe surround her in the bed. We want to “cuddle” her, a word she loved, to hold her in our arms for her final hours. We are trembling. Her breaths are so infrequent. There’s one, we say. We were told that when the end came, it would be like this, the brain no longer sending the proper signals to breathe. It sounded chaotic. But it is not that at all. It is slow, gradual, like watching a sun disappear over the horizon.\n\nWe have surrendered, I hear myself say. I feel like such a failure. All the doctors tried so hard, the U-M doctors, the Beaumont doctors, the New York and Germany doctors — and the nurses, the therapists, the specialists, the radiologists, all great, all earnest, all answering phones in the middle of the night and procuring the latest drugs, treatments, procedures, data — and yet none of it could build the wall. None of it could stop the monster.\n\nOnly Chika was left, at the end, a sweet-voiced David versus Goliath, to make a final stand.\n\nThe day before, her breaths had slowed like this, she was down to one or two a minute, and we leaned on her tender body and the hospice nurses who had been called confirmed that this was likely the end.\n\nBut Janine heard a small sound, and another one, and said out loud, “It sounds like she’s trying to breathe.”\n\nWe heard it again.\n\n“If she’s trying, we’re trying,” I insisted.\n\nAnd so we propped her up, tapped her back with soft rubber pounders, suctioned her throat and nose. And rather quickly, Chika was breathing 33 times a minute. She’d literally risen from the almost-dead. The hospice people shook their heads in disbelief.\n\n“She’s unlike anyone we’ve ever seen,” they said.\n\nAnd she was. She always was. She was strong and stubborn and so filled with life that even a killer tumor struggled to suppress it. The doctors who predicted a quick demise were stunned by her longevity — 23 months is an eternity with DIPG — and her Michigan doctors said they learned things from her German doctors and her New York doctors and the drug interactions and the immunology we tried. It enlightened them to new ways of looking at this disease.\n\n“She’s taught us all a few things,” admitted Dr. Ken Pituch, the director of Mott’s palliative care team.\n\nAnd yet, she is only human.\n\nAnd the cancer is not.\n\nThe sun is strong outside. Soft prayer music is playing through an iPad. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, Janine asks for a stethoscope. She has never done this before. Something about the moment makes her want to listen.\n\nI kiss Chika’s cheeks. I rub her small shoulders. I realize, squeezed between the guard rails of the mattress, that we made the decision to get into this bed a long time ago, back when the whole thing started, that all parents of sick children do, you get into bed and you hug and you pray and you try desperately to protect your little one from an eternal sleep.\n\nThe music playing is the song Chika once sang by herself:\n\n\"I’m no longer a slave to fear\n\nI am a child of God …\"\n\nJanine puts the tips of the stethoscope into her ears. She leans over. She holds the diaphragm to Chika’s soft chest.\n\nShe listens.\n\nShe hears one final heartbeat.\n\nAnd our little girl is gone.\n\n* * * *\n\nI remember a day, after Chika was no longer walking, that we were sitting around the kitchen table, coloring. I looked at my watch.\n\n“Oh, wow, Chika,” I said. “I have to go.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“To work.”\n\n“I don’t want you to go.”\n\n“I have to.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“Because, Chika. It’s my job.”\n\nShe flashed her eyes.\n\n“No, it isn’t,” she said. “Your job is carrying me.”\n\nAnd she was right. Carrying her was my job. Carrying her to doctors, to hospitals, to the bathroom, to bed, carrying her through her amazing little life. It was the most honorable job I have ever had.\n\nAnd so, I carried her one last time.\n\nAfter Janine and her sisters and several friends had lovingly bathed her and done her hair and put on her favorite sherbet-colored dress and high-heeled princess shoes, I lifted this little girl, our little girl, and her head rolled into my chest. She looked beautiful, no more tubes, no more monitors, and I carried her down the hallway and out the front door, because nobody was coming in to touch her, and no stranger was ever going to take her from a home again.\n\nJanine was beside me. We walked down the driveway to a hearse that had been waiting. We placed Chika's body inside. And we watched the car pull away. The sky was clear and the trees were budding and the air was warm with a new, coming summer.\n\nI fell to my knees and buried my face in Janine’s hands.\n\n* * * *\n\nNearly 200 people came to Chika’s memorial service in a Troy funeral home, even though it was never announced or posted anywhere. Some of them had met Chika just once. But once, it seemed, was enough.\n\nThe next day we flew to Haiti. We greeted the other children at the mission and we hugged them tight and we answered their many questions. When one of them asked, “Does this mean God doesn’t listen to our prayers?” I nearly broke down. I had to say, “God listens to every prayer. But sometimes he doesn't give you the answer you want.\"\n\nI could not tell them why.\n\nI don’t know myself.\n\nAt Parc Du Souvenir, where Chika was laid to her final rest, the teachers who taught her and the nannies who looked after her sang prayers and cried, alongside Chika’s uncle, her baby brother, her two older sisters, her godmother, and even her father, who stood stoically near the back.\n\nAnd standing there, in the Haitian heat, the first time I had ever worn a suit and tie in this country, I realized families are like pieces of art: They can be made from many materials. Sometimes they are from birth, sometimes they are melded, sometimes they are forcibly constructed, and sometimes they are merely the confluence and time and circumstance, mixing together, like eggs being scrambled in a Michigan kitchen.\n\nBut they are all real. Chika was a daughter to a number of people. And for the last two years, she was ours, gloriously ours. And if we did not begin in the same place as other DIPG families, we ended there, railing against this tormenting disease and furious at the lack of weapons to fight it.\n\nYou can close your eyes and think of me, she once said. And that is all we are left with now. Medjerda (Chika) Jeune was born on the brink of an earthquake, and she shook our world in her own special way. With her, we became a combat unit, fighting against the unconquerable. But we also became something else:\n\nA family.\n\nAnd for all the harsh emptiness we feel today, for all our restless nights and morning tears, we can only be grateful the time we had. It was 23 months of an incomparable journey, endless memories, and limitless love. How can we be angry? We did not lose a child. We were given one.\n\nContact Mitch Albom: malbom@freepress.com.

The agency recently released information about a proposal by the Huntsville airport and Nevada-based Sierra Space to use the site roughly 15 miles west of downtown to land ships that resemble a small space shuttle with upswept wings, WHNT-TV reports. The spacecraft would be launched elsewhere and land on an existing runway in Huntsville, which has the largest commercial airport in north Alabama and is a hub for the aerospace industry. The Huntsville-Madison County Airport Authority said the FAA is conducting a preliminary review of the proposal. A study completed in 2015 found the airport compatible for the so-called Dream Chaser, which Sierra Space describes as a “spaceplane” designed to take crew and cargo into low-Earth orbit. It would be launched on an Atlas V rocket. Both the airport and the company would need licenses before any landings could occur.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A split federal appeals court panel has sent back for further legal review a 2019 decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw proposed restrictions on large-scale mining in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region. A panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the matter back to a lower court to determine whether the agency’s action “was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or contrary to law.” The appeals court panel expresses “no view on that question,” the decision dated Thursday said. The EPA during the Obama administration proposed but never finalized restrictions on large-scale mining in response to the Pebble Mine project. In 2019, during the Trump administration, the agency withdrew the proposed restrictions, removing what it called an “outdated, preemptive proposed veto of the Pebble Mine” and allowing the project to be vetted through the permitting process. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers last fall rejected a key permit for the proposed copper and gold mine. Pebble’s developer, the Pebble Limited Partnership, is appealing that decision. Trout Unlimited and other groups sued over the EPA’s 2019 decision. Nelli Williams, Alaska director for Trout Unlimited, called the ruling “an important step toward providing immediate Clean Water Act safeguards for Bristol Bay.”\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: A wig store that serves people who’ve lost their hair to chemotherapy continues to require shoppers to wear masks to protect people with cancer from COVID-19. But last month, the suburban Phoenix shop started receiving harassing phone calls after the founder of an anti-mask group tried to ruin the business by posting its name, phone number and address on social media. Since then, Sunny’s Hair and Wigs has received an outpouring of support from concerned citizens and even a visit from Mesa Mayor John Giles and city Councilman Francisco Heredia. “It’s just been overwhelming,” shop owner Lisa Memberr said. Memberr said her staff has been inundated with phone calls and visits from complete strangers bringing food, treats and some cash and “just letting them know that people care and that we are not alone in this and that they support what we did and are taking action to show that.” The store recently received a check for $1,000 from a woman in New Jersey to help buy wigs for people undergoing cancer treatment. The store was targeted May 28 by Ethan Schmidt, the 23-year-old founder of an anti-mask group who travels around metro Phoenix confronting businesses that still require customers to wear masks to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 while claiming he is the victim of discrimination.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: The head of the flagship University of Arkansas campus announced Thursday that he was stepping down, citing the challenge of leading the school in “today’s polarized society.” University of Arkansas Chancellor Joe Steinmetz’s resignation, which took effect Friday, came after the UA Board of Trustees met in executive session but took no action. “I still strongly believe in the mission of higher education, yet given the many challenges found trying to manage a university in today’s polarized society, I need to do what’s best for my family and I feel ready to make way for others,” Steinmetz said in a statement announcing his decision. He did not elaborate. Steinmetz’s resignation also followed his recommendation last month to move a campus statue of the late Sen. J. William Fulbright in response to complaints about Fulbright’s support of segregationist legislation. Republican lawmakers during a hearing last week told Steinmetz that such a move would violate a new state law protecting monuments and could result in criminal charges. Steinmetz has served as the school’s chancellor since January 2016. The university said in a release that UA System President Donald R. Bobbitt would visit with the campus and the school’s supporters before announcing plans for choosing the next chancellor.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state is now offering residents a digital record of their COVID-19 vaccinations that they can use to access businesses or events that require proof they got the shots. The state’s public health and technology departments said the new tool allows Californians access to their COVID-19 records from the state’s immunization registry and includes the same information as the paper cards issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To access the information, Californians will enter into a state website their name, date of birth, and the email or phone associated with their vaccine records, and they will be asked to create a four-digit PIN. The record will include a QR code that users can save to their mobile phones. With nearly 20 million people fully vaccinated in California and proof of vaccination already required in some circumstances such as travel, state health officials felt there would be demand for the tool, though it remains optional, said Dr. Erica Pan, the state’s epidemiologist. “The odds are someone is going to misplace their paper CDC card, and a digital COVID-19 vaccine record provides a convenient backup,” she told reporters Friday.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A coalition that wants to ask voters to approve higher taxes on recreational marijuana to help children make up for learning losses during the pandemic and address special needs for low-income and disadvantaged students said it’s been endorsed by former Democratic and Republican governors. Learning Opportunities for Colorado’s Kids is circulating petitions in hopes of collecting nearly 250,000 voter signatures needed by Aug. 2 to place its initiative on the November ballot. The campaign said former Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter, former Republican Gov. Bill Owens, state lawmakers from both parties, and a host of educational and advocacy groups, many serving Black and Latino children, have endorsed the effort. Initiative 25 would create a Colorado Learning Authority within the state education department to oversee out-of-school tutoring, English language instruction, special needs and disability instruction, mental health, and career and technical training for children ages 5 to 17. It would generally help children from low-income families and those falling behind their grade levels by certifying tutors, who can be teachers doing the work outside regular hours. To pay for the program, backers want voters to approve a 5% excise tax increase on recreational marijuana by 2024 to generate more than $137 million a year.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: One of the state’s legendary music clubs is reopening after a yearlong closure due to the pandemic, with the help of the federal government. Toad’s Place celebrated with its first live music, a jazz duo, Friday along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Rosa DeLauro. The club had been closed since March 2020. Blumenthal called the club “iconic.” Toad’s opened in the 1970s and has been a hot spot for local bands but also has hosted acts such as the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, U2 and, more recently, Cardi B and Kendrick Lamar. The club was awarded a $1 million grant through the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program. Venues that lost at least 90% of their revenues during the pandemic are eligible. DeLauro said the federal government has received about 13,000 applications for aid from entertainment venues, and it appears there is enough money to provide support to those that qualify. Catherine Marx, Connecticut district director for the Small Business Administration, said grants had been prioritized for the venues that had been hardest-hit by the pandemic, and Toad’s is one of 10 Connecticut venues to receive funds so far, the New Haven Register reports. “We’ve missed our performing arts. We’ve missed going out,” Marx said.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Lawmakers want to add protections in the state constitution for the LGBTQ community and people with disabilities. House Bill 199 by House Majority Leader Valerie Longhurst, D-Bear, would add “sexual orientation,” “gender identity” and “disability” to the Delaware Constitution’s equal rights clause. The legislation would make the First State the first state in the U.S. to add these protections for LGBTQ people to its constitution, lawmakers said. In Delaware, constitutional amendments require lawmakers to pass one bill for two consecutive legislative sessions, which span two years. This bill would be the first of two, and the next one would not be voted on until 2023 at the earliest. Earlier this year, lawmakers amended the constitution to add anti-discrimination protections for people of color. In 2019, they amended it to prohibit discrimination based on sex. The new bill comes five years after lawmakers failed to agree on a similar, more inclusive proposal from then-Sen. Karen Peterson that would have added protections for race, sex and national origin, along with age, religion, creed, color, familial status, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity. Since then, several new Democratic lawmakers – including members of the LGBTQ community – have been elected to the Statehouse.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The fight for D.C. statehood continues this week at the U.S. Capitol as proponents prepare to make their case in front of a Senate committee, WUSA-TV reports. The hearing before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs is scheduled for Tuesday morning, according to a statement from D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who said it will be only the second time ever the Senate has held a hearing on statehood for the nation’s capital. Many of the arguments at Tuesday’s hearing will likely echo those made at another hearing earlier this year. In March, Norton told a House committee that “Congress can no longer allow D.C. residents to be sidelined in the Democratic ... process.” For Norton and many other supporters, statehood for the district is a civil rights issue. “Denying American citizens a vote in the body that taxes them goes against the founding principles of this great nation,” D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said at that same hearing. However, GOP opposition in the House was strong, with many Republicans calling the push for statehood a political power grab to tip the balance in Congress in Democrats’ favor.\n\nFlorida\n\nPalm Coast: A high school principal spent the last several months of the school year crafting personalized notes for each of 459 graduates and left them on their seats to read before receiving their diplomas. Matanzas High School principal Jeff Reaves scoured through transcripts, emails and his own personal memories to prepare the notes in time for the June 2 graduation. He wanted to do something special since the seniors’ last two years were marred by the coronavirus pandemic. “I want to be positive for our students, especially in a time where there’s a lot of negativity and turmoil in the world,” Reaves said. “I wanted to shine some light on the students and encourage them as they begin their next journey in life.” He said the process was especially beneficial to him because he got a chance to learn more about each student. “It’s easy to get caught up in the numbers, but it’s the names that really matter. I was doing my part to help them feel connected as a community and have their high school experience to be positive.” Reaves said he’s always tried to work in something special for each class, by recognizing certain students and through the songs played at commencements. Last June, seniors graduated at Daytona International Speedway, and the school put customized yard signs for each student on the football field.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: The coastal county where Ahmaud Arbery’s slaying raised an outcry over racial injustice has hired its first full-time Black police chief. Glynn County commissioners voted Thursday for Jacques Battiste to lead an embattled department that some state lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to abolish last year. A former FBI agent now serving as a deputy constable in New Orleans, Battiste was chosen after a search conducted by the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police with assistance from the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. “I promise you I will bring my best game every day,” Battiste told residents during a community forum last week. Battiste’s hiring comes after a turbulent year for the Glynn County Police Department. The agency was widely criticized for making no arrests after Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was chased and fatally shot by three white men who spotted him running in their neighborhood Feb. 23, 2020. Charges came more than two months later after the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over. Days after Arbery’s killing, Glynn County Police Chief John Powell was indicted on unrelated malfeasance charges in what prosecutors called an illegal effort to cover up a narcotics officer’s affair with a confidential informant.\n\nHawaii\n\nHana: Some people who live in east Maui say the famed Road to Hana is becoming a gridlocked maze of illegally parked cars driven by tourists. Residents are asking for state and county help to address the traffic and parking problem, Hawaii News Now reports. Maui has seen an influx of visitors as pandemic restrictions have eased. The drive to Hana is among the most popular tourist activities on the island. Now that 8,000 visitors a day are arriving on Maui, the narrow, winding road is getting jammed. The coastal roadway brings visitors past waterfalls and sea cliffs along a rural and lush Hawaii rainforest. The remote shoreline’s residents are among the most geographically isolated in the state. Officials say 400 to 600 people drive the road each day. The state recently installed signs warning people of parking fines. But residents want a more comprehensive traffic plan. “We know our visitors are important to our economy. But there comes a time where you really start to look at the numbers,” said east Maui resident Kamalani Pahukoa, who often sees traffic jams and illegally parked rental cars. “That becomes a problem to our quality of life, traditions, culture and access.” Toll roads and reservation systems are among ideas being looked at, said Lauren Armstrong, the Maui Metropolitan Planning Organization’s executive director.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials have approved a plan for Boise government to be carbon neutral by 2035 and the entire city by 2050 to fight climate change. The Boise City Council voted unanimously last week to approve the Climate Action Roadmap. The plan includes a goal for government to use only clean electricity by 2030. Carbon neutrality means cutting greenhouse gas emissions to “net zero.” The goal is to reduce carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas warming the atmosphere. “Tonight is truly a historic moment for our city,” Mayor Lauren McLean said after the vote. “We’re the generation that must solve the climate crisis because our health and economy depend on us doing this now. Boise will be a climate innovation leader, and we will rise to the challenge of this moment.” The capital city has about 225,000 residents. Benefits of the plan include improving human health and growing a climate-friendly economy, officials said. Ways for the city to meet carbon neutrality include such things as switching to electric vehicles or sequestering carbon dioxide by planting trees that store carbon. The plan also calls for using less energy, traveling less and reducing waste. “It is a detailed plan with attainable goals,” Councilman Patrick Bageant said. “It’s not just a declaration of a wish list; it’s an actual plan that we will begin to execute.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s primary election will be moved from March to June next year under a voter access expansion signed into law by Gov. J.B. Pritzker. The new law makes mail voting a permanent option, allows jail inmates awaiting trial to cast ballots and makes Election Day in November a state holiday, among other things. The move is in contrast with other states that are moving to restrict voter access. “With attacks on voting rights on the rise in states across the nation, Illinois is proud to stand up for a strong, secure, and accessible democracy,” Pritzker said in a statement Thursday. The law took effect immediately. Next year’s primary will move from March 15 to June 28 because lawmakers decided not to draw new post-census district boundaries for members of Congress until official 2020 census figures, delayed by the pandemic, arrive later this summer. Many changes continue or expand existing practices put in place last year to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Election Day would continue to be a state holiday, with empty schools used as polling places. Also, Illinois counties would be required to establish at least one universal voting center to give voters alternatives sites.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A man who threatened his neighbor with anti-Black racial slurs, displayed a swastika and threw eggs in an attempt to intimidate the neighbor has been sentenced to 46 months in prison and three years supervised release for criminal violations of the Fair Housing Act and unlawful possession of firearms. Shepherd Hoehn, 51, pleaded guilty to the charges earlier this year. Among other racist actions, Hoehn burned a cross above the fence line facing his neighbor’s property and repeatedly played Confederate-era minstrel anthem “Dixie.” The intimidation began when Hoehn became angry as a construction crew began to remove a tree from the neighbor’s property, according to court documents. “Today, Mr. Hoehn was held responsible for his vile conduct,” Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan of the FBI Indianapolis Division said in a press release Friday. The case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Lawrence Police Department. “We are a diverse nation, bound together by shared values and beliefs,” Keenan said. “We are also a nation of laws. Those like Mr. Hoehn who would betray our shared values and beliefs through behavior such as this rightly suffer the penalties our laws prescribe.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A sharply divided Iowa Supreme Court on Friday stopped a lawsuit aimed at reducing the flow of fertilizer and hog farm waste into the state’s river and streams, finding that limiting pollution from farms was a political matter and not one for the courts. The 4-3 decision handed a significant defeat to environmental groups hoping to get the chance to prove that Iowa should scrap its voluntary farm pollution policy, order new mandatory limits on nitrogen and phosphorous pollution, and stop construction of new hog barns. It is the latest court rejection of an attempt to force the nation’s leading corn- and pork-producing state to clean up farm pollutants from its major rivers that provide drinking water to hundreds of thousands of Iowans. The lawsuit, which was brought by Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement and Food & Water Watch, contended that unregulated farm pollution is violating the rights of citizens to clean water in the Raccoon River for recreational and drinking water use. It said a legal concept that precedes Iowa statehood – the public trust doctrine – should apply to this case and require the state to ensure that citizens have a usable Raccoon River untainted by excess pollution caused by farm runoff of fertilizer and animal manure.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A team of archaeologists – Jay Sturdevant, Adam Wiewel, Nikki Klarmann and Robert Hoard – recently spent two days in the city laying the groundwork for an excavation project to take place next summer at the Brown v. Board National Historic Site. The Kansas Archeology Training Program field school will be held June 3-19, 2022. The public is welcome to help excavate land archaeologists believe will yield artifacts and the foundations of demolished buildings. Klarmann, public outreach archaeologist for the Kansas Historical Society, said the field school is an opportunity to get a taste of archaeology. “A lot of people think maybe it’s just going out, digging and collecting, but there’s a lot more to it than that. They get experience in the field excavating but also in the lab analyzing artifacts,” Klarmann said. The field school is open to anyone over age 12. Registration will open March 1, 2022, with a registration fee of $15-$90. Klarmann said most participants are people who are curious and don’t have an archaeology background. “Really it’s just people who are interested in history and learning more about their state,” Klarmann said. “We also have people who come from California to do this, and they’ve been coming for years.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Thousands of Kentuckians can now apply for a waiver that could clear them from having to repay the overpayments included in their unemployment benefits. The Kentucky Office of Unemployment Insurance says it has mailed notices to about 14,000 unemployment claimants identified as having been overpaid in 2020. The notices inform claimants how much they were overpaid and provide instructions on how to apply for the waiver, either online or by completing an enclosed form, the state agency said. Claimants have 30 days from the date postmarked on the letter to apply for the waiver and must attest that the overpayment was the result of no fault of their own, the agency said. Legislation allowing the state to waive the overpayment of some pandemic-related unemployment claims was passed by lawmakers this year and signed by Gov. Andy Beshear. The state has paid out more than $6 billion in unemployment benefits during the pandemic, Beshear’s administration said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nAvery Island: As storms grow more violent and Louisiana loses more of its coast, the family that makes Tabasco Sauce is fighting erosion in the marshland that buffers its factory from hurricanes and floods. Overall, the effort is probably a standoff, said CEO and President Harold “Took” Osborn, great-great-grandson of the McIlhenny Co.’s founder. But in a state that has lost 2,000 square miles of its coast since 1932, holding ground is a victory. The company has been brewing Tabasco Sauce since 1868 on Avery Island, the tip of a miles-deep column of salt. While sinking land is a problem throughout southern Louisiana, Avery Island and four smaller salt domes along the Gulf Coast are still slowly rising. But the danger from hurricanes remains. A 20-foot-high, $5 million earthen levee now encloses the 40 acres or so around Tabasco’s factory after Hurricane Rita’s storm surge pushed floodwaters within inches of it in 2005. Much of the wetlands work is low-tech, enlisting volunteers to plant marsh grass in the 30,000 acres around the island. Osborn holds a master’s degree in environmental science from Oxford University, and company founder Edmund McIlhenny was a self-taught naturalist. Osborn’s great-grandfather, E.A. McIlhenny, created an egret rookery at the island in 1895 because the birds were nearing extermination by hunters who sold their plumage to adorn women’s hats.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A statewide ban on single-use plastic bags will begin July 1. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection said it is working with retail stores and restaurants to make sure they are ready. The Legislature passed the ban in 2019, and it was initially scheduled to go into effect in April 2020. The state delayed enforcement of the ban because of aspects of the coronavirus pandemic. The first delay was due to concerns about the transmission of the virus and a second delay due to concerns stemming from disruption in packing supplies amid the pandemic, the DEP said. When the ban takes effect, stores and restaurants will not be allowed to provide single-use plastic bags, the DEP said. Grocery stores, box stores and other large retailers must collect a 5 cent fee for each such bag used, the agency said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Replacing Amtrak’s Baltimore & Potomac Tunnel will take a least a decade or more to complete. But the $4 billion rail project has officially begun, and officials say it will eliminate the biggest passenger rail bottleneck between Washington and New Jersey. The Baltimore Sun reports officials kicked off the project’s start at an event Friday that included the great-great-granddaughter of Frederick Douglass. The tunnel will be renamed after the famed abolitionist. Douglass had escaped the bonds of slavery on Maryland’s Eastern Shore and eventually boarded a New York-bound train from Baltimore in 1838. “If it had not been for the railroad,” Nettie Washington Douglass told the Sun in an interview, “I would not be standing here.” Jeffrey Ensor, Amtrak’s senior director for the south end of the Northeast Corridor, said the new tunnel will increase train speeds to more than 100 mph from 30 mph. Construction will be funded by the federal and state government because the tunnel is used by Amtrak and MARC passengers. Negotiations are underway to determine how much each government will contribute.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: In a move likely to strike a chord with music fans, the Boston Symphony Orchestra has announced plans to reopen Symphony Hall and resume in-person performances for a complete season starting in September. The BSO will open the 2021-22 season Sept. 30 – after an 18-month live-audience performance hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic – with Music Director Andris Nelsons sharing the podium with Boston Pops Conductor Laureate John Williams for a program featuring soloist Anne-Sophie Mutter. The program will feature Beethoven’s Consecration of the House Overture, the work that opened the orchestra’s inaugural concert in 1881. The reopening concert will also feature the Boston premiere of a new work by Williams, Violin Concerto No. 2, and Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra. The season that runs until next April also features a new cycle of six major works by Richard Strauss; a performance cycle of five Beethoven concertos with soloist Mitsuko Uchida; orchestra works of Berlioz, Brahms, Ives, Mahler, Prokofiev, Rachmaninoff, Still and Stravinsky; and world premieres by Julia Adolphe, HK Gruber, and Kaija Saariaho and American premieres by Unsuk Chin and Jorg Widmann. To celebrate the reopening of Symphony Hall, the BSO will also present a free community concert Oct. 3 featuring Nelsons, Williams, Keith Lockhart and Thomas Wilkins.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: Organizers of a popular festival that was shut down last year due to the pandemic are encouraging people attending this summer to receive free COVID-19 vaccinations on-site. Masks will not be required at the 95th National Cherry Festival, scheduled July 3-10 at Traverse City’s Open Space Park, according to MLive.com. The Grand Traverse Health Department will offer the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine at a tent at the park. Michigan lifted all indoor capacity restrictions and mask requirements Monday as the state’s vaccination rate increases and the numbers of COVID-19 infections continue to decrease. “With the impossibility of knowing when restrictions would be lifted or changed, we had to start planning in January to provide Traverse City with a safe, family-friendly event that allowed everyone to participate no matter how ready they are to fully enter back into ‘normal’ life,” said Kat Paye, festival executive director. The festival, a major northern Michigan summer destination for decades, typically offers parades, fireworks, concerts, farm tours, a carnival midway and cherry pie-eating contests. Many event spaces will be reconfigured this year. Some activities will be presented in new ways, such as the festival parade being stationary instead of participants marching along a parade route.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A new student group in the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry aims to continue the effort to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in the school. Better Together hosted its first event May 25, exactly one year after George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis. Arpun Johal, a third-year student and one of the group’s founding members, said Floyd’s murder prompted the group’s formation, The Minnesota Daily reports. “Last year, I feel that many people did a lot of reflection about racism and the political climate in the U.S.,” Johal said. “From that, we noticed that there was a lot of work to be done in our own careers to help with the larger civil rights movement.” The group’s first meeting covered recent hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, anti-Asian racism, the experiences of Asian dental students at the university and how to become a better ally to Asian students and patients. Zayna Jan, another third-year student and founding member of Better Together, created a toolkit for bystander intervention that students can review and utilize. “I wanted (the toolkit) to be something that people can look at easily and understand quickly – and for it to be dental school-specific,” Jan said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The more than 1,500 Mississippi National Guard members who have been working throughout the state over the course of the coronavirus pandemic to help with virus testing, vaccinations and other initiatives are being withdrawn next month, Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday. The state will cease all operations with the Mississippi National Guard on July 15, Reeves said. The Republican governor also announced that he will lift the COVID-19 state of emergency order Aug. 15. While all pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted, the state of emergency order has remained in place to ensure that members of the National Guard continue to be paid while stationed in Mississippi. Guard members have been serving in Mississippi since March 2020, stationed at dozens of state-run vaccination and testing sites. Adjutant General of the Mississippi National Guard Maj. Gen. Janson D. Boyles said Friday that the governor’s timeline to lift Mississippi’s state of emergency declaration ensures his service members will “complete all necessary out-processing requirements and receive the benefits and entitlements they have earned during their dedicated service to our state.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Joseph: Summer classes have moved online for some elementary and middle school students because of COVID-19 cases. The St. Joseph News-Press reports Robidoux and Pershing schools will conduct classes virtually through July 1, when summer school ends. Only about 1 in 5 eligible residents, or 20.6%, have received a COVID-19 vaccine in Buchanan County, where St. Joseph is located. That’s below the still-low statewide average of 37%. The vaccine is generally available to all people 12 and older. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved any vaccine for those under age 12, which has been a cause for increased precautions regarding COVID-19 in an elementary school environment. “We just took a precautionary measure,” said Gabe Edgar, the district’s assistant superintendent, adding that because the district has a remote learning system in place, it “really doesn’t make sense to leave those kids in there, potentially at risk.” She said all other summer school locations will remain in person. Summer sessions already were being conducted online only for high school students.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Glacier National Park says it’s seeing more visitors showing up early in the morning and evening when the park’s new ticketed entry system is not in effect. Glacier administrators say people who arrive at the park’s West entrance after 5 p.m. should expect heavy traffic and long waits. The park in northwestern Montana on the Canada border had almost 300,000 visits through May. That’s the highest year-to-date number on record. To ease congestion on the popular Going-to-the-Sun Road, Glacier this year began requiring visitors to obtain an entry ticket and reservation prior to arrival. About a quarter of Memorial Day weekend visitors arrived without a reservation at the park’s West and St. Mary entrances.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Work has begun on nearly $30 million in renovation projects that will change the entrance to Omaha’s Eppley Airfield and upgrade one of the national airport’s garages. The entrance to the airport terminal will be moved about a quarter-mile south, toward downtown along Abbott Drive, the Omaha World-Herald reports, under a project estimated at $20.8 million. The change comes following several studies in recent years showing the need for a longer, wider entrance that will give drivers more time to make maneuvering decisions. The $8.3 million in improvements to the airport’s south garage will include construction of an express ramp to provide access to premier parking and provide wider parking stalls. Both projects include new signs, lights and landscaping. Construction began Wednesday and is slated to be finished by late 2022. Both the terminal and south garage will be open during construction, although drivers may encounter occasional minor detours or closures. Most of the funding for the projects will come from Omaha Airport Authority revenues, but the terminal entrance project is getting a $12 million boost in grants from the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Amid a second year of intense drought, the Nevada Department of Wildlife’s water developments – the only source of water for miles for desert bighorn sheep – have hit perilously low storage levels in Valley of Fire State Park. Without the agency’s emergency intervention, animal populations will decline, and ecosystem viability is threatened. “We’ve had drought conditions before. We have had to haul water on an emergency basis, but not anywhere near approaching this magnitude, this scale of severity,” Wildlife Game Biologist Pat Cummings told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “I have been in Southern Nevada since the mid-’70s. I remember 2001 and 2002 as being the worst, back-to-back dry years, even worse than 1996. But what we see now is even worse, even worse.” Last year, Las Vegas went 240 days without measurable rainfall. This year, 40% of the state is in exceptional drought, the highest level, according to the National Weather Service. “All animals, especially bighorn sheep, which have evolved to coexist with the desert environment, rely a lot on the vegetation for water,” Southern Region Game Supervisor Joe Bennett said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Disciplinary hearings for police officers accused of misconduct serious enough for decertification should not be automatically held behind closed doors, a judge ruled. The judge’s decision came as the Legislature voted to make disciplinary proceedings public. A spokesman for Gov. Chris Sununu told New Hampshire Public Radio that the governor supports the bill. The Union Leader newspaper sued over the disciplinary proceedings of a detective and an officer in Manchester, arguing that the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council’s practice of shielding hearings and certain records from public view, if requested by the officer, was a violation of the state’s Right to Know law. Judge Andrew Schulman agreed that the council should no longer automatically exempt the public from reading materials or viewing disciplinary proceedings. However, the order does not create a blanket requirement that all disciplinary proceedings be made public. The attorney general’s office is still reviewing the decision and hasn’t said if it will appeal.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: In a state where medical marijuana is often more expensive than flying elsewhere and buying it there, patients registered with some financial assistance programs could see their weed costs covered. The cost of New Jersey medical marijuana, among the highest of any state in the country, would be covered for patients enrolled in four different financial assistance programs meant to help children, seniors, crime victims and those with disabilities, under identical bills already approved by the Senate and Assembly health committees. The bills, sponsored by Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex, and Assemblyman Herb Conaway, D-Burlington, could see votes as soon as this week. Under the legislation, patients enrolled in these programs could only have to pay a small copay for medical marijuana or have their costs covered: the Catastrophic Illness in Children Relief Fund, Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled, the Senior Gold Prescription Discount and the Victims of Crime Compensation Office. “The cost of cannabis can run into the hundreds of dollars per month for individuals,” Conaway said. “This bill serves those who are financially distressed and ... ensures the benefits of medical cannabis are available to all who may need it.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state ranked 49th in a report released Monday measuring child well-being based on data gathered before the pandemic. That’s an improvement over last year, when New Mexico ranked 50th among U.S. states. “It’s encouraging to see that child well-being in New Mexico was improving before the pandemic hit,” said James Jimenez, executive director for New Mexico Voices for Children, which partners with the foundation. He said he’s cautiously optimistic that state policies “helped offset some of the health and financial problems caused by the pandemic.” The annual Kids Count report released by the Annie E. Casey Foundation tracks 16 metrics of children’s access to education, health, economic and social stability at home. It ranks New Mexico at or near the bottom on education, economics, and “family and community,” which tracks rates of single-parent homes, teen birth rates and whether the head of household has a high school degree. Roughly 1 in 5 New Mexico children lives in an area where 30% of the population is at or below the federal poverty line. Nationally, only 1 in 10 children lives in a high-poverty area, according to the report. The report ranks the state 37th in child health, with kids having average access to insurance (94%) and only slightly higher-than-average obesity (32%).\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Stonewall Inn’s owners say they won’t serve certain beers at the famous LGBT bar during Pride weekend to protest manufacturer Anheuser-Busch’s political contributions to some politicians who have supported anti-LGBT legislation. Co-owners Stacy Lentz and Kurt Kelly said they would be instituting the ban Friday in support of the “Keep Your Pride” campaign, a recently launched effort highlighting five companies that it says advertise support during Pride but have also made contributions to anti-LGBT lawmakers. The campaign, a project of Corporate Accountability Action, used data compiled from the National Institute on Money in Politics to show that Anheuser-Busch contributed more than $35,000 to 29 legislators it described as anti-LGBT between 2015 and 2020. “We just felt Stonewall having the platform, the power to do this, it was important to stand up,” Lentz said. “We really just want Anheuser-Busch to stop donating to lawmakers who are trying to legalize discrimination.” In a statement, Anheuser-Busch said: “We support candidates for public office whose policy positions and objectives support investments in our communities, job creation, and industry growth.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A museum criticized for a planned reenactment of a white slave owner being pursued by Union soldiers says its doors will be closed until further notice, a local department said. The Mecklenburg Park and Recreation Department announced Thursday that the Historic Latta Plantation is closed and that all previously scheduled events are canceled while the department assesses the future use of the county-owned property, the agency said on its website. The house and the grounds also will be closed, the department said. The 19th-century house is owned by Mecklenburg County, while a nonprofit operates the facilities and runs the events at the plantation site. Last Tuesday, Mecklenburg County announced it would let its contract with the museum expire next month over the controversial event that many deemed as racially insensitive. The reenactment was scheduled for June 19, the traditional commemoration date of the emancipation of enslaved people in the U.S. known as Juneteenth. On Thursday, President Joe Biden signed legislation making Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: Officials say wildfires have burned about 156 square miles of land across the drought-stricken state so far this year – more than seven times the amount from all of last year. The North Dakota Department of Emergency Services and North Dakota Forest Service report that nearly 1,400 fires have been confirmed in 2021. A total of 921 fires recorded last year burned less than 20 square miles. North Dakota has experienced some of the driest winter and spring months in 127 years of recordkeeping, according to State Forester Tom Claeys. Limited moisture along with warm temperatures have increased the intensity and size of wildfires this year, the Minot Daily News reports. Several local, tribal, state and federal agencies responded to two large wildfires over the April 30-May 2 weekend. The Roosevelt Creek Fire in the Little Missouri National Grassland, north of Medora, burned more than 7 square miles, while another fire on the Fort Berthold Reservation, about 6 miles south of Mandaree, burned more than 15 square miles. “This year, it’s imperative that we all know how to mitigate against wildfires, especially as we make plans to enjoy the summer months by recreating outside with friends and family,” Claeys said, noting that the Fourth of July is “right around the corner.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Just like saving treats for furry friends waiting under the dining room table, utility company AEP Ohio will now donate its leftovers to the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and The Wilds. Trimmings from trees and shrubs pruned throughout the Columbus area to keep electric power lines clear will soon be used to feed giraffes, beavers and a variety of animals at the zoo and the safari park near Cumberland. Through a new partnership called “Trim to Treat,” AEP Ohio will deliver those leftovers to the zoo twice a week. Those trimmings will then be sorted through to determine what should be used to feed the animals. “We’re just really thankful,” said Jan Ramer, interim senior vice president for animal care and conservation at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and The Wilds. Ramer said browse – the ecological term for tree trimmings – is good for the animals’ physical and mental health alike. It provides them with fiber needed to aid in their digestion, but it also provides the feeling of being in nature as opposed to captivity. Before the AEP Ohio partnership, Ramer said horticulturalists at the zoo would cut browse from trees and shrubs on its grounds. While that process won’t end with the formation of the partnership, Ramer said AEP’s contributions will supplement and support the zoo’s browse supply.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority, which pioneered the use of electronic passes 30 years ago, is preparing to take a long-awaited first step toward cashless tolls but has yet to comply with a 2016 deadline to integrate the PikePass system with tolling authorities across the country. When introduced, the PikePass system was hailed as a way to reduce crashes that occurred at toll booths with drivers stopping and slowing down as well as a cost savings for the trucking industry. The turnpike authority reports 2,093,460 vehicles are tagged with PikePasses that stick to the top of a windshield and record when drivers enter and exit toll roads in Oklahoma. Toll booths, however, are still operated on the state’s 11 turnpikes, and traffic backups still occur at toll plazas along busy corridors like the Will Rogers, Turner and Kilpatrick turnpikes. Later this summer, the Kilpatrick Turnpike will be the first to be switched to cashless tolls in which drivers without PikePasses will be billed by mail. “We continue to have accidents at cash lanes, so the impact of this is enormous,” said spokesman Jack Damrill. “It will not just help with safety; it with help with the environment also.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Authorities in Lake Oswego and Tigard are among communities asking residents to reduce water use during a chlorine shortage. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports water treatment facilities use the chemical in small amounts to prevent harmful bacteria growth in drinking water supply. State officials say they have a plan to help water districts get the chlorine they need if their stockpiles run low, and there’s no threat to the water on which the public depends. The shortage occurred after a power outage earlier this month at the Westlake chemical facility in Longview, Washington, the main provider of chlorine for Oregon. Matt Marheine, deputy director at the Oregon Department of Emergency Management, said the shortage is not unique to Oregon, and “the drinking water in the state of Oregon is clean and safe to use and drink.” The concern is how long the current chlorine supply will last. Most Oregon water districts have about a month’s supply of chlorine, according to Andre Ourso, administrator for the Oregon Health Authorities’ Center for Health Protection.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: The remains of 10 more Native American children who died more than a century ago at a boarding school in central Pennsylvania are being disinterred and will be returned to their relatives, authorities said. A team of archaeologists began work Saturday at the cemetery on the grounds of the Carlisle Barracks, which also houses the U.S. Army War College. Nine of the children were from the Rosebud Sioux tribe in South Dakota and one from the Alaskan Aleut tribe. The cemetery contains more than 180 graves of students who attended the former Carlisle Indian Industrial School – a government-run boarding school for Native American children. This is the Army’s fourth disinterment project at the school in as many years. The school founded by an Army officer opened in 1879 and housed some 10,000 Indigenous children before it shut down in 1918. Students were forced to cut their braids, dress in uniforms, speak English and adopt European names. Infectious disease and harsh conditions claimed the lives of many of the children buried there. The Army is fully funding the cost of the project – about $500,000 per year, including travel to the transfer ceremony as well as transport and reburial of the deceased children, said Barbara Lewandrowski of the Office of Army Cemeteries.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The administrator of the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles said he had no idea that a sex business was allegedly operating in a building he owns. Cranston police raided the building owned by Walter “Bud” Craddock through his real estate holdings company following a months­long investigation into six properties where investigators suspect prostitution was taking police, according to a police affidavit. Craddock told WPRI-TV he knew there was a business but didn’t know about any illegal activities. “I personally had never gotten any complaints, otherwise this would have been rectified a long time ago,” Craddock said. “If I was aware of the things that were alleged to be going on there, the lease would have been terminated.” The 3,200-square-foot property is one of several owned by Craddock’s LUC Realty and was subject of a raid in 2017 “for the same activity, prostitution and massage without a license,” Cranston Police Chief Col. Michael Winquist told WPRI in an email. All six massage businesses that were raided were shut down, 11 people were arrested, and police are investigating whether women were working against their will, Winquist said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Beach towns are ticketing more people for public drinking as summer visitors flock to the coast. The Post and Courier of Charleston reports open container citations on Isle of Palms and Sullivan’s Island have risen above their pre-pandemic levels. On Folly Beach, not a single person received an open container ticket in the weeks leading up to Memorial Day in 2019. This year, officers handed out seven citations between the end of April and May 23. On Sullivan’s Island, beach officers wrote 180 open container tickets ahead of Memorial Day, a 120% increase from tickets in the same period in 2019. Town officials say the alcohol violations might be related to people enjoying their lives as vaccinations have emboldened some and helped keep many COVID-19 cases at bay. Sullivan’s Island Town Administrator Andy Benke said open container tickets usually pick up after Memorial Day because the beach service officers, who are Citadel cadets this year, get better at ticketing – and less reluctant to punish beachgoers having a good time – over the summer. “If you’ve driven that far to spend the day at the beach, maybe you’re more inclined to roll the dice and take a chance,” Benke told the newspaper. “But Sullivan’s Island and Folly and Isle of Palms don’t allow alcohol on the beach. That’s just the way it is.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: An abandoned gypsum mine in Black Hawk that was exposed by a sinkhole in 2020 may extend farther than current mapped areas show, according to a geophysical study. Mohammad Sadeghi, a professor of geological engineering at Montana Technical University who led the study, said there’s a possibility that the mine extends below Interstate 90. The study recommends further research be done in the area. More than 40 people from 15 homes in the Hideaway Hills neighborhood were forced to evacuate after the collapse in April 2020 in Black Hawk, about 8 miles northwest of Rapid City. At least two lawsuits have been filed in relation to the collapse, one of which is one step closer to class-action status, the Rapid City Journal reports. The Fitzgerald Law firm of Rapid City filed a lawsuit against developers and county and state entities. Fox Rothschild, a large national law firm, filed one against state government. Hideaway Hills residents are also seeking answers to a potential loss of sewage service due to the mine. Sadeghi has presented his team’s research methods to Hideaway Hills residents and said he believed the sinkhole opened due to surface water infiltrating the ground and seeping into the roof of the mine that dissolved gypsum.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee Department of Correction announced it is participating in a service that provides the public with criminal case information and custody status of inmates. The Victim Information and Notification Everyday service will be used in conjunction with TDOC’s current victim notification system. That system already provides written notice of offenders’ location, transfer, sentence expiration, release and parole hearings. The VINE system will allow crime victims to have more control over the type of notifications they receive and choose the method by which they are notified, according to the Correction Department. Anyone wishing to receive updates can sign up at VINELink.com. Live operators are also available to provide support at 888-868-4631.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Families who opted for remote learning last school year will have to return to in-person classrooms when the next semester begins Aug.17. The Austin school district announced Friday that it plans to return all students to campus and will not offer a remote learning option for the 2021-22 school year. Austin joins the Round Rock, Lake Travis, Leander, Eanes and Hays school districts in announcing the return to on-campus-only learning. The Austin district cited low COVID-19 case numbers as well as the Legislature’s failure to pass a bill that would have authorized local public schools to count students in remote learning programs as part of their enrollment. School districts are funded based on their daily enrollment numbers. The bill became a casualty of House Democrats’ walkout to kill a Republican voting bill ahead of a midnight deadline last month. Austin and 29 other school districts around the state sent a letter to Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday asking him to take up this legislation in the special session he has promised to call this summer to focus on overhauling the state’s voting laws.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: A local public health expert says an increase in opioid abuse amid the coronavirus pandemic was recorded throughout the state. Gabriela Murza, who leads Utah State University Extension’s HEART initiative in Utah County, presented data to the Utah County Commission during a work session last week while discussing the state-funded program, which “brings academic resources into the community, partnering locally and nationally to address the opioid epidemic and other pressing public health issues,” the Daily Herald reports. According to Murza, the program operates in nine counties, including Utah County, “where opioid use disorder has had some of the most devastating effects as far as overdose and deaths related to opioid use.” Other counties served by the program include Salt Lake, Davis, Tooele and Box Elder. Murza told the commissioners that the rate of opioid use disorder has “leveled off” in recent years, and “the trend seems to be getting a little bit better in Utah.” But “then 2020 hit, and everywhere the numbers went up, they did increase as far as deaths due to opioids,” the public health professor said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: An innovative health care program set up to keep patients healthier while reducing costs missed its financial target between 2017 and 2019, a new report by the Vermont state auditor has found. The report released Monday by State Auditor Douglas Hoffer said that OneCare Vermont, the organization set up to run the program, missed its Medicaid financial targets over the three years by $11.1 million. And the state paid $14.5 million for OneCare’s operating costs to reach a total of $25.6 million total. Hoffer said the financial costs to run the program exceeded any Medicaid savings attributed to it. The goal of what’s known as the all-payer model is to keep patients healthier while reducing health care costs by paying a set amount of money for each covered patient rather than paying for each service provided. “I anticipate the people implementing the All-Payer Model will say the scale and complexity of the reform initiative merit patience before reaching conclusions, and that is reasonable … to a point,” Hoffer said in a statement. OneCare CEO Vicki Loner said she disagreed with the conclusions of Hoffer’s report, and the organization is proud of the work it is doing “tackling one of the most pressing issues of our time.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s “dangerously” full mental hospitals are overwhelmed amid staffing shortages, a situation that has long plagued the hospitals and only worsened during the pandemic, according to state officials. But The Washington Post reports lawmakers and policy experts hope pandemic relief funds can help bring about systematic changes that free inpatient beds and develop community services to keep people out of hospitals in the first place. When the General Assembly reconvenes in August, it will decide how to spend about $4 billion Virginia is getting from a pandemic relief package earlier this year. A joint subcommittee studying mental health services is preparing recommendations for how to use the funds in time for the session. “We have the opportunity with these funds to really do something transformational. That is what we are asking for,” Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Services Commissioner Alison Land said in a presentation to the subcommittee this month. The state’s nine inpatient psychiatric hospitals, which have a total of 2,124 beds, are operating at an average 98% capacity, she said. And efforts to contain the coronavirus have had unintended consequences.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A federal judge has issued a summary judgment in favor of the state against two gold mining companies over years of water pollution stemming from the Buckhorn Mountain gold mine in Okanogan County. U.S. District Court Judge Rosanna Malouf Peterson on Thursday dismissed the companies’ main defenses, writing there was no support for their claims that the state attorney general cannot enforce all of the mine’s Clean Water Act permit. The lawsuit filed by Attorney General Bob Ferguson contended that Crown Resources and Kinross Gold violated the law by discharging illegal levels of pollutants into creeks in Okanogan County flowing into the Kettle River. Now the focus shifts to how much the companies will owe for the violations. They potentially face millions of dollars in penalties for their pollution, and the judge will decide how much. “Crown and Kinross knew even before the mine’s construction that it could release significant contamination, including arsenic and chloride, into surrounding waters, yet plowed ahead anyway,” Ferguson said. “Washington takes our water quality seriously.” Crown Resources and its parent company, Kinross Gold, extracted approximately $1.3 billion in gold from the mine from 2008 to 2017.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A new campaign is encouraging residents to support small businesses as the economy continues to reopen. The West Virginia Small Business Development Center launched its “Come In, We’re Open” campaign Sunday. It’s an invitation to people to visit local businesses in their communities, center Director Debra Martin told The Exponent Telegram. “Throughout the pandemic, small-business owners have adapted and persevered and continue to be the backbone of our economy. As West Virginia reopens, it’s critical that small businesses receive enough support to survive long term,” she said. Business owners around the state can get involved by displaying a “Come In, We’re Open” sign and posting to social media with “#WeAreOpenWV.” The campaign will last through September, officials said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Superintendents, school board members and other education leaders on Monday demanded that Republican lawmakers devote more state aid to schools. Superintendents and other school officials have been criticizing the amount of state aid for education that the Legislature’s Republican-controlled finance committee inserted in the state budget proposal last week. The full Legislature is expected to pass the budget, which would run from this July through mid-2023, as soon as next week. School leaders predicted that without more state funding, they might have to hold staff salaries flat or cut liberal arts classes. “All students and staff across our state deserve better than zero,” Verona Area School District Superintendent Tremayne Clardy said outside the state Capitol. “This budget simply does not meet the needs of students and families across the state.” Democratic Gov. Tony Evers proposed giving K-12 schools $1.6 billion over the next two years. Republicans on the Legislature’s budget committee scrapped that plan and instead allocated $128 million – about $400 million less than they needed to allocate to ensure the state’s schools would get about $2.3 billion in federal pandemic relief.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: With 80% of adults over 18 fully vaccinated in Teton County, health officials are launching an innovative effort to further increase the community’s protection from COVID-19. “The whole goal is to try to get to the people, to make it easier for people,” Public Health Response Coordinator Rachael Wheeler said. The Health Department’s new “Vaxi Taxi,” a repurposed START bus turned mobile vaccine clinic, aims to increase access to COVID-19 vaccines by reaching outlying populations that are unable to get their shots at the health department in town. “Having a more mobile unit where we can easily set up inside that unit becomes really convenient for us,” Wheeler said. Nurses check in patients under a tent outside the bus and ask patients about any potential COVID-19 symptoms or recent contact with infected individuals. Nurses also patiently describe side effects they might experience after the vaccine, usually a sore arm and mild fever, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Patients then head onto the Vaxi Taxi, where they receive their shots in the seats passengers have generally used for transportation. The Vaxi Taxi sports two tables that can be set up and put away with ease, seats for vaccine recipients, medical forms and equipment for vaccine distribution, and a team of friendly professionals.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/03/12/coronavirus-vermont-live-updates-cases-closures-covid-19/5023835002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Vermont: Latest news and impact", "text": "Free Press Staff\n\nAs the situation surrounding the COVID-19 caused by the new coronavirus continues to evolve in Vermont, here are updates and information.

The rating, according to Moody's, means the airport's obligations are medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk, but that it has a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\n\n________________\n\nProperty taxes for Williston residents will be a bit higher than expected this year due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic delayed construction in the town, which impacted property values, the town stated in a news release. As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15. The other two deadlines will remain the same.\n\n________________\n\nMonday, July 20, 2020\n\nThree full-time staff were laid off at Colchester Parks and Recreation due to diminished demand for camps and recreation programs during the pandemic, Town Manager Aaron Frank announced last week.\n\n\"Please do what you can to help towards positive changes in COVID outcomes that will allow us to bring back these valuable programs and staff that help make Colchester a great place to live, work and play,\" Frank wrote in a newsletter.\n\nOn a more upbeat note, the town announced that rehabilitation work on the Colchester Causeway is moving along ahead of schedule.

Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15. The second round is expected to launch in October, and will cover between June 16 to Sept. 30.\n\n_________\n\nBurlington School District will host a series of town hall meetings this week, inviting community members to learn about and participate in the district's plans to reopen schools this fall.\n\nThe meetings will be conducted virtually via Zoom and split between two days to allow both families and staff the opportunity to ask questions and hear from school administrators about the reopening.\n\nThe town hall meeting for families will meet 7 p.m. on July 15, whereas a meeting for staff will be conducted the following day, at 7 p.m. on July 16.\n\n“This is a key moment in our planning process,\" said Tom Flanagan, the new superintendent for Burlington School District when began his tenure on July 1st.\n\n\"We need to hear from the community in order to finalize our plans and inform our families so they can start planning their lives.\"\n\nFor more information, those interested can visit the district's website via this link.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday.

He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund is also supported by federal CARES Act funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19.

Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

A similar situation unfolded during the first launch attempt on Monday, Aug. 29.\n\nThe space agency's attempt for a rescheduled launch of the crewless Orion capsule on Saturday afternoon was first halted at about 9 a.m. ET as engineers began attempting to fix a hydrogen fuel leak in the engine section at the rocket's bottom.\n\nWhen the launch team could not successfully stop the leak, NASA officials scrubbed the Saturday liftoff at about 11:20 a.m. EDT.\n\nGraphics:After 50 years, US takes first step back to moon with launch of Artemis I\n\nOpinion:'Space is the place': NASA administrator touts Artemis I as the key to our future on Mars\n\nThe NASA rocket had been set to launch the Artemis I mission on Monday from Florida's Kennedy Space Center, the same launch site that saw the Apollo missions send humans to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nWhen that attempt was delayed, NASA aimed for Saturday, which had a favorable weather forecast, for the next launch attempt.\n\nArtemis I is the first in a series of missions over the coming years with the goal of putting astronauts on the moon again and lay a foundation for sending humans to Mars, NASA has said.\n\nWhy was Artemis I launch scrapped?\n\nLaunch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson and the launch team were faced with another hydrogen fuel leak. Monday's attempt was also cancelled due to escaping hydrogen, but Saturday's came on another part of the 322-foot rocket, the most powerful ever built by NASA.\n\nThe team tried twice to stop and restart the flow of super-cold liquid hydrogen in hopes of completing the seal and ending the leak. They also flushed helium through the line, but the leak remained.\n\nArtemis Mission Manager Michael Serafin said the leak earlier this week \"was a manageable leak. This was not a manageable leak.”\n\nArtemis I:Hardware issues force NASA to again scrub Artemis I launch at Kennedy Space Center\n\nNASA Artemis I moon launch schedule\n\nNASA has yet to determine a new launch window for the mission, but officials said Artemis I will not launch before Tuesday, when a two-week launch blackout period kicks in.\n\n\"We do not launch until we think it’s right,\" said the NASA administrator, former Sen. Bill Nelson.\n\nOfficials will have more information early next week, said Associate Administrator for Exploration Systems Development James Free.\n\nThe rocket must be transported four miles to the Vehicle Assembly Building rather than worked on at the launch pad, officials said Saturday afternoon.\n\nNASA currently has an Oct. 3 SpaceX launch scheduled to send a crew to the International Space Station. Free said the overlap would need to be reconciled, and may put Artemis I's launch to later in October.\n\nThe mission around the moon and back is expected to take 39 days.

Kennedy comes on saying, \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\n\nAll over the world, anxious faces await this historic milestone. With eyes glued to their television screens, everyone holds their breaths as they get ready to watch the first men land on the moon. In mission control in Houston, workers stand alert as footage from the lunar surface comes alive on their screens.\n\nYet something's different. The faces of the American men and women watching aren't filled with hope or excitement. Instead, their faces show anger, disappointment, fear and perhaps most notably, regret.\n\nThe year is 1969. But instead of the U.S. becoming the first nation to land on the moon, it's the Soviet Union. That's the alternate reality depicted in Apple TV Plus's new show, \"For All Mankind,\" set to release Nov.1.\n\nThough it didn't actually happen, that first-man-on-the-moon glory went to the United States, propelled in large part by work done here on the Space Coast, it's curious to imagine another reality. A reality where the Soviets were the first to land on the celestial body next door to us.\n\nApple TV+ is only $4.99 per month:Here's why it's so cheap\n\nWhat else can i watch?:Here are all the new Apple TV+ shows and movies\n\nApple's new show offers up one possibility: Instead of giving up on the space race, the show depicts a version where the U.S. decides to achieve an even heftier goal. In Apple's telling, NASA seems to immediately set its sights on Mars and other parts of the solar system.\n\n\"When (Ron Moore, the creator and writer for the TV series) told me about the idea that we were going to have this alternate reality where the Russians get to the moon first and they beat us ... and what would have happened differently in the world and when he told me that, my eyes lit up and I said, 'Oh my goodness, that is a great idea for a TV show. I love it,'\" former NASA astronaut and director of space operations at SpaceX who served as a technical advisor for the show, Garrett Reisman told FLORIDA TODAY.\n\nThis alternate depiction resembles what NASA is doing in real life under the new program, Artemis that aims to send the first woman and next man back to the moon by 2024. The current plan is this: Head back to the moon, specifically the south pole, to use its resources – namely the water ice found there to produce rocket fuel, which will help propel future spacecraft to venture farther into the solar system.\n\nThe show also incorporates a female character aspiring to be an astronaut, so female astronauts walking on the moon isn't completely ruled out either.\n\nUnlike the current agency, however, the NASA in the TV series seems to be fueled with a competitive vengeance to get back at the Soviets and prove to the rest of the world that the U.S. can still be the leaders in space.\n\nHow realistic is it?\n\nBut could that have actually happened after having lost so dramatically and during such a turbulent time in history?\n\nSpace policy expert at American University, Howard McCurdy doesn't believe so.\n\n\"All the magazines in 1947 and again in 1952 reported the following message: The nation that's first in space will win the Cold War,\" McCurdy said. \"In essence, what the quotation was, is the nation that wins the space race will control the Earth.\"\n\nAt the 46th Space Congress in Cape Canaveral held this past June, NASA's deputy administrator James Morhard reiterated that same message. He said whoever gets anywhere in space first, becomes the leader in space and in our world. He was talking about the first people to set foot on Mars.\n\nThus, had the Soviets been first to land humans on the moon, they would have been the leaders in outer space – eliminating the option for the U.S. to venture farther afield, according to McCurdy.\n\n\"If the initial purpose is to demonstrate to uncommitted nations that the United States is first and we're clearly not first, why spend the money to be second when you could reinvest that money in missile defense or in reconnaissance satellites, or in gamma-ray detectors that would confirm whether or not a nation was cheating on the atmospheric tests and atomic weapons and all the other aspects of the Cold War,\" McCurdy said.\n\nFurthermore, he adds there wouldn't have been the support from the public or funding needed from Congress to do so.\n\n\"What it says is beginning in the late 1960s, people would've begun to doubt the technical capabilities of the United States,\" McCurdy said.\n\nFormer NASA historian Roger Launius also doesn't believe the U.S. would have succeeded in trying to send humans on other deep space missions if we'd lost the race to the moon.\n\n\"If you publicly announce that you lost the moon race and that your technology was not up to snuff and your economy was not sufficient to support it and all that other stuff that goes along with an admission of failure, why would you turn around and say, 'Oh no, we're not going to do that. We're now going to do something that's at least an order of magnitude more difficult,\" Launius said.\n\n\"You're setting yourself up for failure a second time.\"\n\nReisman, on the other hand, disagrees.\n\n\"I think it's certainly possible,\" he said. \"I think in some ways, the fact that we were kind of stuck in low Earth orbit for all that time (after the Apollo program ended) and hadn't really advanced any further in space was a bit of a letdown for a lot of people and I think this show kind of addresses that.\"\n\nOther possibilities to losing space race\n\nHad the Soviets been first to land humans on the moon, both McCurdy and Launius instead believe the U.S. would have proposed a joint venture between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.\n\n\"It probably would have been more likely that there would have been a deal cut by the Americans and the Russians to go to the moon,\" Launius said.\n\nBut McCurdy does not believe that would have worked.\n\n\"I think that's what the United States response would have been and the Soviet response would have been what it was in 1961, 'You've got to be kidding me. You're making this proposal because you're behind, not because you're ahead,\"' he said.\n\n\"They wouldn't have done it. They would have gone ahead and landed on the moon and try to reap the international benefits of that accomplishment through the 1970s and through the 1980s.\"\n\nAnother possibility could have been to send robotic spacecraft on deep-space missions, like many of the current NASA science missions, instead of sending humans to explore the universe.\n\n\"There probably would have been political support for a more modest robotic scientifically-emphasized space program, but it wouldn't have worked because it doesn't capture the imagination of world leaders who are neutral in the Cold War,\" McCurdy said.\n\nAfter all, the space race and the Cold War were linked.\n\nPurpose of the space race\n\nAfter World War II, a new tension began between the world's two greatest superpowers – the democratic U.S. and the communist Soviet Union. The Cold War pushed both nations to compete for first place in technological superiority – best showcased through the \"space race.\"\n\n\"This was war by another means,\" Launius said.\n\nThe U.S.'s greatest weapon to combat this war? The Apollo program.\n\n\"The Apollo mission was designed as a Cold War version of a hot war,\" McCurdy said. \"Instead of going to war, we went out on the jousting fields like medieval knights and demonstrated our technological prowess.\"\n\nThe whole purpose of the space race was essentially to win the Cold War without the need to actually go to war. It was a figurative death struggle between these two superpowers trying to bring in undecided countries to rally behind them.\n\n\"If you want your economic and political system to be the master, you want to persuade these other countries to go along with you,\" Launius said. \"That's what it's about. Because science and technology are going to determine the future and this is a demonstration of science and technology of the most profound type.\"\n\nMcCurdy reiterates the same message.\n\n\"The purpose of the space race was not science. It wasn't even to land on the moon,\" he said. \"It was to demonstrate the technologies that were being developed and hopefully never used in the Cold War.\"\n\nMcCurdy speculates that if the Soviets had been first to land on the moon, they probably would have also won the Cold War as a result.\n\n\"One of the reasons we won the Cold War is because we won the space race,\" he said.\n\n\"Science and technology determine the future ... and who controls that science and technology, is going to be the dominant force in shaping that,\" Launius said.\n\nSo what would the world be like if the Soviets had won the space race and consequently, the Cold War?\n\nHow world would be different\n\nWhen Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin stepped foot on the moon, they left behind a plaque that read, \"Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the moon July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.\"\n\nWould the cosmonauts have done the same? After all, the U.S. was a free and democratic country, while the Soviet Union was not.\n\nEven the Apollo 11 mission patch displayed how this was an accomplishment to be shared by all humankind, not just America. Though it had the bald eagle, the United States' national bird, included in the patch, both the Apollo 11 and 13 mission patch are the only Apollo patches to not show any space hardware, have the names of the crew or display the American flag – proof that this was a feat to be shared globally.\n\nBut how would the world be if the Soviets had landed on the moon instead?\n\n\"If (the U.S.) loses the Cold War, then I can piece together a series of events that allows the Soviet Union to be much more intact and much more powerful than it turned out to be when they lost the race to the moon,\" McCurdy said. \"That's what it leads to. The Soviet Union still being the Soviet Union.\"\n\nThe fall of the Berlin Wall probably wouldn't have occurred, the Soviet Union would still have a pretty firm grasp on most of Eastern Europe and many undecided countries at the time could have gone over and allied with the Soviets instead of the Americans, McCurdy and Launius speculated.\n\n\"Anything's possible,\" Launius said. \"The reality was, there were so many deficiencies in the Soviet system; the command economy didn't work as well as it should have; the totalitarian nature of things created all kinds of difficulties and those could have played out regardless of who was the first nation on the moon.\"\n\n\"The economy of the Soviet Union was much inferior to the United States and ultimately, that's what did them in in the 1980s,\" he said.\n\nA new space race?\n\nThe reason the U.S. was able to send humans to the moon in the first place was because of the fear fueled by the space race and consequently, the Cold War. The fear that the Soviets would get there first.\n\nToday, such fear doesn't exist.\n\n\"This was a life and death warfare type struggle and we've not had that situation since, so nobody's been willing to spend the kind of dollars on it that it requires,\" Launius said.\n\nWith the plan to head back to the moon in five years and then eventually on to Mars, not having the necessary funding won't help NASA get anywhere anytime soon.\n\n\"NASA now is kind of in a bind,\" Reisman said. \"They want to do this very ambitious program and they want to do it the traditional way, by relying on government programs like (the Space Launch System rocket that would send astronauts to the moon), which are very expensive. So NASA is in a bit of a quandary because I don't think they're going to get the money to do Artemis and put Americans on the moon by 2024 the way they want to do it.\"\n\nMcCurdy argues there is a second space race heating up with China, this time to be the first to send crewed missions to Mars.\n\nBut Launius disagrees.\n\n\"The situations are so different,\" Launius said. \"I've heard people asking those questions about China all the time. None of us care whether or not China sends a taikonaut to land on the moon or even Mars. We do not fear them like we feared the Soviet Union.\"\n\nDuring the Apollo program, 39% of Americans believed the U.S. should do everything they can to be the first nation on the moon, according to a 1965 Gallop poll. Now, only 8% of Americans, according to a poll commissioned by C-SPAN for the 50th anniversary of the moon landing believe a crewed moon mission should be a top priority for NASA. The figure jumps to 18% for a crewed mission to Mars.\n\nAfter all, this isn't the first time since the Apollo program that NASA has repeated its wish to head back to our nearby satellite and finally meet our red neighbor.\n\n\"We've been down this road at least three times and we've not done any of those things,\" Launius said. \"So yeah, I'm skeptical.\"\n\nContact Jaramillo at 321-242-3668 or antoniaj@floridatoday.com.

The spacecraft embarked on a journey that is expected to last slightly over a month before landing on the moon’s surface later in August.\n\nApplause and cheers swept through mission control at Satish Dhawan Space Center, where the Indian Space Research Organization’s engineers and scientists celebrated as they monitored the launch of the spacecraft. Thousands of Indians cheered outside the mission control center and waved the national flag as they watched the spacecraft rise into the sky.\n\n“Congratulations India. Chandrayaan-3 has started its journey towards the moon,” ISRO Director Sreedhara Panicker Somanath said shortly after the launch.\n\nA successful landing would make India the fourth country — after the United States, the former Soviet Union, and China — to achieve the feat.\n\nThis year's mission is to land safely and softly on the moon\n\nThe six-wheeled lander and rover module of Chandrayaan-3 is configured with payloads that would provide data to the scientific community on the properties of lunar soil and rocks, including chemical and elemental compositions, said Dr. Jitendra Singh, junior minister for Science and Technology.\n\nIndia’s previous attempt to land a robotic spacecraft near the moon’s little-explored south pole ended in failure in 2019. It entered the lunar orbit but lost touch with its lander that crashed while making its final descent to deploy a rover to search for signs of water. According to a failure analysis report submitted to the ISRO, the crash was caused by a software glitch.\n\nThe $140-million mission in 2019 was intended to study permanently shadowed moon craters that are thought to contain water deposits and were confirmed by India’s Chandrayaan-1 mission in 2008.\n\nSomanath said the main objective of the mission this time was a safe and soft landing on the moon. He said the Indian space agency has perfected the art of reaching up to the moon, “but it is the landing that the agency is working on.”\n\nNumerous countries and private companies are in a race to successfully land a spacecraft on the lunar surface. In April, a Japanese company’s spacecraft apparently crashed while attempting to land on the moon. An Israeli nonprofit tried to achieve a similar feat in 2019, but its spacecraft was destroyed on impact.\n\nWith nuclear-armed India emerging as the world’s fifth-largest economy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nationalist government is eager to show off the country’s prowess in security and technology.\n\n“Chandrayaan-3 scripts a new chapter in India’s space odyssey. It soars high, elevating the dreams and ambitions of every Indian,” Modi said in a tweet after the launch.\n\nMore:Ample evidence NASA rockets have reached outer space | Fact check\n\nIndia's first mission with International Space Station slated for next year\n\nIndia is using research from space and elsewhere to solve problems at home. Its space program has already helped develop satellite, communication and remote-sensing technologies and has been used to gauge underground water levels and predict weather in the country, which is prone to cycles of drought and flood.\n\n“This is a very critical mission,” said Pallava Bagla, a science writer and co-author of books on India’s space exploration, adding that India will require soft landing technology if it wants to attempt more missions to the moon.\n\nIndia is also looking forward to its first mission to the International Space Station next year, in collaboration with the United States as part of agreements between Modi and U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House last month.\n\nThis one-off visit by an Indian astronaut to the International Space Station will not hamper India’s own program, which aims to launch an Indian astronaut from Indian soil on an Indian rocket in late 2024, Bagla said.\n\nAs part of its own space program, active since the 1960s, India has launched satellites for itself and other countries, and successfully put one in orbit around Mars in 2014.\n\nSingh said that based on the current trajectory of growth, India’s space sector could be a trillion-dollar economy in the coming years.\n\nAs of April, India has launched 424 satellites for 34 countries, including Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. The ISRO has earned approximately 1.1 billion rupees ($13.4 million) in the past five years from the launch of foreign satellites, the minister told India’s Parliament in December.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/middleeast/why-arabs-are-furious-world-cup-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Why Arabs and Muslims feel stung by coverage of the Qatar World ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories.

Today I feel a migrant worker,” FIFA chief Gianni Infantino said in a fiery tirade on Saturday, comparing his own plight as a redhead son of migrants to that of marginalized communities.\n\nHis ostensible empathy with Qatar was due to the barrage of criticism the nation has faced in Western media for hosting the tournament.\n\nBut it’s hypocritical of the West to be giving lessons in morality to others, he said.\n\nThose statements on the eve of the World Cup went viral, inviting much anger and ridicule. But to many Arabs and Muslims, they resonated strongly.\n\nUS actor Morgan Freeman (2nd L), Qatari singer Dana al-Fardan (2nd R), and Qatari YouTuber Ghanim al Muftah (R) perform during the Qatar 2022 World Cup opening ceremony on Sunday. Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOmar Alsaadi, a 21-year-old Qatari, told CNN that Infantino vocalized “from a Western point of view” what many of his compatriots have felt about being targets of racism.\n\nIn the run-up to the tournament, Western media coverage has been dominated by the controversies surrounding the event rather than the sport itself, including the Gulf nation’s treatment of migrant workers, its rules on LGBTQ people and its tight social restrictions. Britain’s public broadcaster, the BBC, refrained from airing the opening ceremony on television, opting instead to cover criticism of the host nation. The BBC said it did broadcast the ceremony on their video-on-demand service.\n\nThis year’s World Cup is certainly like no other before it. It is the first to be held in a Muslim country and Qatar has gone a long way to give the event a distinctly Arab and Muslim flavor.\n\nThe Bedouin-themed opening ceremony on Sunday began with a female singer donning a traditional burqa, a kind of face covering that has been banned in several European countries. It also cited a verse from the Quran about God creating humanity into “nations and tribes” so they can get to know each other.\n\nAccording to social media reports, some hotel rooms in the country offer visitors QR codes to learn about Islam, and Muslim volunteers have been teaching visitors about Islamic fashion.\n\nQatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), which is responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nBut in an earlier statement to CNN, the SC said it was committed to “an inclusive and discriminatory-free” World Cup.\n\n“Everyone is welcome in Qatar, but we are a conservative country and any public display of affection, regardless of orientation, is frowned upon. We simply ask for people to respect our culture.”\n\nThe visibility of Islamic symbols in Qatar hasn’t escaped those attending. An on-air joke by a French journalist about the presence of “a lot of mosques” in the country caused outrage among Muslims on social media.\n\nWestern news outlets have also been accused of peddling stereotypes about Arabs and Muslims.\n\nThe Times of London on Monday said “Qataris are unaccustomed to seeing women in Western dress in their country” in a photo caption that was later deleted after being flagged on social media. Around 87% of the country’s population of 2.9 million is made up of expatriates, many of whom are Western.\n\n“I think that the Western media is biased because they don’t want to see an Arabic success, a Muslim success in the delivering and hosting of a global cup for football in a third [world country],” Najd Al-Mohanadi, a 20-year-old Qatari, told CNN.\n\nBut some in the Western media have spoken out against stereotyping and alleged biases. Ayman Mohyeldin, an MSNBC host who previously worked for Qatar’s Al Jazeera, said recent coverage of Qatar shows “the depths of Western prejudice, performative moral outrage and, perhaps most significantly, gross double standards.”\n\nThe Economist and the New York Times have also run articles defending Qatar’s right to host the tournament. The Times of London ran an essay saying criticism of Qatar was “laced with hypocrisy.”\n\n“I always question the timing [of the criticism], as migrants throughout the region endure poor living arrangements for meager pay, while also working under strenuous physical and mental conditions,” said Mira Al Hussein, a postdoctoral researcher from the UAE who is studying at Oxford University in England.\n\n“Scrutiny is overdue and it makes no sense to tie it to global events where virtue-signaling becomes deeply problematic,” Al Hussein told CNN.\n\n“Especially when it comes from non-NGO entities that are themselves embroiled in human rights violations within and across their borders.”\n\nJames Lynch, director of the human rights group FairSquare and a former British diplomat in Qatar, said that while some of the coverage around Qatar in the West has reinforced negative stereotypes about the Arab Muslim world, most of the criticism has been “fair and proportionate.”\n\n“It’s absolutely right to call out instances of that kind of coverage, but wrong to generalize from those examples to imply that all, or most, criticism is driven by racism,” he said.\n\nWorkers in the country continue to “face harsh, abusive working conditions and severe exploitation, with domestic and construction workers among those most at risk,” he said, adding that Qatar’s women and LGBTQ people “face serious discrimination and repression, both in law and practice.”\n\nCritics of Western media coverage of Qatar have countered that other countries with questionable human rights records didn’t receive such scrutiny when hosting global sporting events.\n\n“At the risk of engaging in whataboutism… Qatar’s human rights records, as poor as they may be, cannot possibly be more outrageous than other countries, such as Russia, China and Israel,” said Al Hussein. “Qatar is certainly not engaging in ethnic cleansing, nor are migrants living in concentration camps, despite the poor living conditions.”\n\nMaryam AlHajri, a Qatari researcher at the Doha Institute for Graduate Studies, said some of the recent rhetoric around Qatar shows that some Western critics have been more concerned with feeding into an “orientalist discourse,” referring to language aimed at imposing Western worldviews, than human rights.\n\n“This should not be read as a justification to cease criticizing the migrant worker condition in Qatar,” she said. “Rather, it should be interpreted as an argument for the necessity to contextualize the migrant workers situation as part of a globalized economic order built on colonialism and racial capitalism.”\n\nShe noted however that some over-zealous defenders of the government on the Qatari side have neglected the country’s human rights shortcomings.\n\n“Many of the people defending Qatar are also using terrifyingly pro-government language,” she said, adding that it reaches a point that doesn’t help the cause of Qatar’s migrant workers.\n\n“The plight of migrant workers in places like the US or the UK does not take away from the fact that we have problems in Qatar,” AlHajri told CNN. “It shouldn’t be about whataboutism.”\n\nWith additional reporting from Mariam Dirar Alqasem in Doha\n\nIran protests\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN hears testimony from women who say they experienced sexual violence by Iranian regime 06:31 - Source: CNN\n\nSocial media videos have emerged allegedly showing Iranian security forces sexually assaulting female demonstrators on the streets.\n\nWith media access inside Iran severely constrained, CNN went to the region near Iraq’s border with Iran, interviewing eyewitnesses who’d left the country and verifying accounts from survivors and sources both in and outside Iran.\n\nThe covert testimonies revealed sexual assaults on male and female activists as a women-led uprising spreads throughout Iran.\n\nUS Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley on Tuesday tweeted it is “a reminder of what is at stake for the Iranian people - and of the lengths to which the regime will go in its futile attempt to silence dissent.”\n\nRead the article here.\n\nHere’s the latest on the protests in Iran:\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Tuesday that the rising number of protest-related deaths highlights the “critical” nature of the situation in the country. The UN said its sources had reported over 40 deaths “in mainly Kurdish cities in the past week.”\n\nForty foreign nationals “affiliated in riots” have been arrested in Iran since protests started in September, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Masood Satayshi said without revealing their nationalities.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Tuesday the US is taking steps to “push back against actions Iran is taking to repress its own people.”\n\nMobile internet was restored in Iran after a major disruption on Monday, according to internet watchdog NetBlocks, which said that cellular data was down for about 3.5 hours as security forces cracked down on protesters in the Kurdish region of Iran.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nSaudi Arabia produced one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Tuesday, beating Lionel Messi’s Argentina 2-1 in an astonishing Group C match.\n\nMany had expected the South American team, ranked third in the world, unbeaten for three years and among the favorites to win the tournament, to sweep aside its opponent, ranked 48 places below it in the world rankings.\n\nWatch CNN’s Becky Anderson speak to celebrating fans of the Saudi team:\n\nAlso read:\n\nThe digest\n\nTeenage student dies in twin explosions in Jerusalem\n\nTwo explosions shook Jerusalem early Wednesday, killing one person and injuring 18 others in a suspected “combined terror attack,” according to an Israeli police spokesperson. The first explosion occurred at a bus station near the entrance of Jerusalem, killing a 16-year-old student at a Jewish seminary, his family told local media. The second explosion occurred almost half an hour later at the city’s Ramot junction. Initial investigations indicated that explosive devices were placed at both blast sites and a search is underway for suspects, the police spokesperson said.\n\nBackground: The attack brings the number of people killed on the Israeli side of the conflict to at least 29 this year. This year has also been the deadliest for Palestinians in the West Bank since 2015.\n\nWhy it matters: Jerusalem has not seen a double bombing like this one in many years. Prime Minister Yair Lapid said after participating in a situation assessment with security officials that the incident was “different from what we have seen in recent years.” The explosions come after months of tensions in the occupied West Bank.\n\nRussia to build attack drones for Ukraine war with the help of Iran, intelligence assessment says\n\nIran and Russia have reached an agreement to begin the production of attack drones in Russia, according to a new intelligence assessment from a country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program. Iran is beginning to transfer blueprints and components for the drones to Russia after the initial agreement was struck earlier this month, said a source familiar with the assessment.\n\nBackground: US officials have said that Russia has received hundreds of drones from Tehran which have had a deadly effect in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the Iranian government acknowledged for the first time that it had sent a limited number of drones to Russia in the months before the start of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhy it matters: The move would further cement the partnership between Tehran and Moscow and likely provoke significant anger from Ukraine and its western allies including the US. Sources explained that the goal is for Russia to produce thousands of new attack drones using Iranian components and blueprints.\n\nSaudi Arabia says it may take steps to balance market\n\nOil rose on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia said OPEC+ was sticking with output cuts and could take further steps to balance the market, outweighing global recession worries and concern about China’s rising Covid-19 case numbers, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman on Monday was also cited by state news agency SPA as denying a Wall Street Journal report that said OPEC was considering boosting output.\n\nBackground: The Wall Street Journal earlier on Monday reported an output increase of 500,000 barrels per day was under discussion for the next meeting of OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, on December 4. The report cited unidentified OPEC delegates. The report sent oil prices plunging by more than 5%.\n\nWhy it matters: The oil cartel last month cut production by 2 million barrels per day in an effort to stabilize the market “in light of the uncertainty that surrounds the global economic and oil market outlooks.” The oil cut was made despite strong US pressure against it. Potential further cuts could exacerbate already tense relations between the US and Saudi Arabia.\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim Abbas Al Lawati", "Nadeen Ebrahim", "Abbas Al Lawati"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/football/rainbow-clothing-mcallister-wahl-qatar-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Rainbow clothing: US journalist says he was initially denied entry to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSome people attending 2022 World Cup matches have said they have experienced difficulties in Qatar when trying to enter stadiums wearing clothing in support of LGBTQ rights.\n\nAt the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium on Monday, ahead of the United States Men’s National Team’s (USMNT) match with Wales, US football journalist Grant Wahl and former Wales captain Laura McAllister both said they had been told to remove rainbow-colored items of clothing by security staff.\n\nWahl said he was detained and briefly refused entry to the match because of the “rainbow soccer ball t-shirt” he was wearing, posting on Twitter that security staff had told him: “You have to change your shirt. It’s not allowed.”\n\nThe journalist wrote on his website that when he tweeted about the incident on his phone, “one guard forcibly ripped my phone from my hands.”\n\n“One security guard told me that my shirt was ‘political’ and not allowed,” Wahl wrote. “Another continually refused to give me back my phone. Another guard yelled at me as he stood above me – I was sitting on a chair by now – that I had to remove my shirt.”\n\nWahl said he was released 25 minutes after being detained and received apologies from a FIFA representative and a senior member of the security team at the stadium.\n\nWahl told CNN on Tueday that he had been given assurances beforehand that he would be allowed to wear rainbow-decorated clothing and that he “probably will” wear the shirt again as he has “no fear here about any of this.”\n\nWhen asked about standing up for the LGBTQ community, Wahl said: “It’s really important to me and it’s not required by any stretch of the imagination.\n\n“I’ve got family members who are gay. I’ve got friends who are gay. I’ve got journalist friends who are gay who are here in Qatar. But you don’t need that to be supportive, to be an ally.\n\n“So, I was thinking about all of those people yesterday. I was thinking about Colorado Springs. I was thinking all sorts of stuff. And if I have to be detained for 30 minutes, it’s kind of annoying. But it’s not an issue for me. And so I was glad to at least help out a little bit.”\n\nMcAllister – who captained the Welsh women’s national football team in the 1990s – said she was stopped by security officials and had her rainbow-colored hat confiscated before she was allowed to enter the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium.\n\n“So, despite fine words from @FIFAWorldCup before event, @Cymru (Wales) rainbow Bucket hats confiscated at stadium, mine included,” McAllister tweeted of the incident.\n\n“I had a conversation about this with stewards – we have video evidence. This #WorldCup2022 just gets better but we will continue to stand up for our values,” added McAllister.\n\nVideo posted online by British media outlet ITV appears to show McAllister being stopped at a security checkpoint and a person in a police uniform gesturing towards her hat.\n\n“They were insistent that unless I took the hat off we weren’t actually allowed to come into the stadium,” McAllister said in the interview with ITV.\n\nMcAllister, who played 24 times for Wales, told ITV that security officials said the rainbow hat was a “banned symbol.”\n\n“I think we’ve had plenty of warning that this wasn’t going to be a tournament where human rights, LGBT rights and women’s rights were going to be well respected, but coming from a nation like Wales, we were very keen that we still took a stand coming here,” McAllister told ITV.\n\nThe hat in question is sold by The Rainbow Wall, a self-described LGBTQ+ Supporters Group for the Wales national teams.\n\nEarlier on Monday, shortly after it was announced that the captains of several European nations would not wear “OneLove” armbands at the World Cup in Qatar due to the danger of receiving yellow cards, former England international Alex Scott wore a rainbow armband as she formed part of the BBC’s coverage of England’s match against Iran.\n\nEngland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and Wales were set to participate in the “OneLove” campaign to promote inclusion and oppose discrimination.\n\nBut those countries’ associations said in a statement on Monday that the armband – which features a striped heart in different colors to represent all heritages, backgrounds, genders and sexual identities – would not be worn in Qatar.\n\nEngland's Harry Kane wearing the 'OneLove' armband during a match in September. Nick Potts/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday, it was announced that supermarket chain Rewe had ended its cooperation with the German football association, DFB, because of what it said was FIFA’s “scandalous” ban on the “OneLove”armband.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken has also criticized the sport’s world governing body for its stance on the armbands.\n\n“It’s always concerning from my perspective when we see any restrictions on freedom of expression. It’s especially so when the expression is for diversity and for inclusion,” said Blinken.\n\n“And in my judgment, at least, no one on the football pitch should be forced to choose between supporting these values and playing for their team,” Blinken told reporters while speaking in Doha on Tuesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Belgian FA announced it had to remove the word “love” from its kit due to a commercial clash which predated the decision to not wear the “OneLove” armband.\n\nCNN has reached out to FIFA and the World Cup organizers for comment, and to clarify the World Cup’s official dress code.\n\nAccording to the FIFA handbook, “expats and tourists are free to wear the clothing of their choice, as long as it is modest and respectful to the culture.”\n\nIn the buildup to the World Cup, Qatar – where sex between men is illegal and punishable by up to three years in prison in the country – has come under criticism for its stance on LGBTQ rights.\n\nA report from Human Rights Watch, published last month, documented cases as recently as September of Qatari security forces arbitrarily arresting LGBT people and subjecting them to “ill-treatment in detention.”\n\nHowever, the country has insisted that “everyone is welcome” at the tournament, adding in a statement to CNN this month that “our track record has shown that we have warmly welcomed all people regardless of background.”", "authors": ["Kevin Dotson Ben Morse", "Kevin Dotson", "Ben Morse"], "publish_date": "2022/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/politics/nuclear-fusion-energy-us-scientists-climate/index.html", "title": "US scientists reach long-awaited nuclear fusion breakthrough ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor the first time ever, US scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction resulting in a net energy gain, a source familiar with the project confirmed to CNN.\n\nThe US Department of Energy is expected to officially announce the breakthrough Tuesday.\n\nThe result of the experiment would be a massive step in a decadeslong quest to unleash an infinite source of clean energy that could help end dependence on fossil fuels. Researchers for decades have attempted to recreate nuclear fusion – replicating the fusion that powers the sun.\n\nUS Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm will make an announcement Tuesday on a “major scientific breakthrough,” the department announced Sunday. The breakthrough was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nNuclear fusion happens when two or more atoms are fused into one larger one, a process that generates a massive amount of energy as heat. Unlike nuclear fission that powers electricity all over the world, it doesn’t generate long-lived radioactive waste.\n\nScientists across the globe have been inching toward the breakthrough, using different methods to try to achieve the same goal.\n\nThe National Ignition Facility project creates energy from nuclear fusion by what’s known as “thermonuclear inertial fusion.” In practice, US scientists fire pellets that contain a hydrogen fuel into an array of nearly 200 lasers, essentially creating a series of extremely fast, repeated explosions at the rate of 50 times per second.\n\nThe energy collected from the neutrons and alpha particles is extracted as heat, and that heat holds the key to producing energy.\n\n“They contain the fusion reaction by bombarding the outside with lasers,” Tony Roulstone, a fusion expert from the University of Cambridge’s Department of Engineering, told CNN. “They heat up the outside; that creates a shockwave.”\n\nEven though getting a net energy gain from nuclear fusion is a big deal, it’s happening on a much smaller scale than what’s needed to power electric grids and heat buildings.\n\n“It’s about what it takes to boil 10 kettles of water,” said Jeremy Chittenden, co-director of the Centre for Inertial Fusion Studies at Imperial College in London. “In order to turn that into a power station, we need to make a larger gain in energy – we need it to be substantially more.”\n\nIn the UK, scientists are working with a huge donut-shaped machine outfitted with giant magnets called a tokamak to try to generate the same result.\n\nAfter a small amount of fuel is injected into the tokamak, giant magnets are activated to create a plasma. The plasma needs to reach at least 150 million degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. This forces the particles from the fuel to fuse into one. With nuclear fusion, the fused product has less mass than the original atoms. The missing mass converts to an enormous amount of energy.\n\nNeutrons, which are able to escape the plasma, then hit a “blanket” lining the walls of the tokamak, and their kinetic energy transfers as heat. This heat can then be used to warm water, create steam and power turbines to generate power.\n\nLast year, scientists working near Oxford were able to generate a record-breaking amount of sustained energy. Even so, it only lasted 5 seconds.\n\nWhether it’s using magnets or shooting pellets with lasers, the result is ultimately the same: Heat sustained by the process of fusing the atoms together holds the key to helping produce energy.\n\nNIF's target chamber is where the magic happens -- temperatures of 100 million degrees and pressures extreme enough to compress the target to densities up to 100 times the density of lead are created there. Damien Jemison/LLNL\n\nThe big challenge of harnessing fusion energy is sustaining it long enough so that it can power electric grids and heating systems around the globe.\n\nChittenden and Roulstone told CNN that scientists around the globe now must work toward dramatically scaling up their fusion projects, and also bring the cost down. Getting it commercially viable will take years of more research.\n\n“At the moment we’re spending a huge amount of time and money for every experiment we do,” Chittenden said. “We need to bring the cost down by a huge factor.”\n\nHowever, Chittenden called this new chapter in nuclear fusion “a true breakthrough moment which is tremendously exciting.”\n\nRoulstone said there’s much shows more work needs to happen to make fusion able to generate electricity on a commercial scale.\n\n“The opposing argument is that this result is miles away from actual energy gain required for the production of electricity,” he said. “Therefore, we can say (it) is a success of the science but a long way from providing useful energy.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen René Marsh", "Ella Nilsen", "René Marsh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/08/24/fact-check-dennis-hopes-sale-land-moon-isnt-legal/8215690002/", "title": "Fact check: Dennis Hope's sale of land on the moon isn't legal", "text": "The claim: A man named Dennis Hope has been selling land on the moon for the past 35 years\n\nFancy moving away from Earth, or at least pretending to?

Now, our Korean people and our young people’s dream and hope will reach toward space.”\n\nPrior to South Korea’s mission on Tuesday, only Russia, the United States, the European Union, China, Japan and India had developed a space launch vehicle capable of carrying a satellite weighing more than 1 ton, according to the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI).\n\nSouth Korea first tried to launch a dummy satellite with the Nuri rocket last October. The attempt failed when the rocket’s third-stage engine shut down and the dummy satellite failed to reach low Earth orbit.\n\nBurgeoning space industry\n\nSouth Korea has struggled to keep up with its Asian neighbors in the space race.\n\nIts first two carrier rocket launches in 2009 and 2010 used Russian-developed engines, and both failed to reach orbit. In 2013, South Korea finally succeeded in sending a carrier rocket into low Earth orbit – but this, too, was developed using Russian technology.\n\nSince 2010, South Korea has invested nearly 2 trillion Korean won (about $1.5 billion) in building the three-stage Nuri – which means “world” in Korean. Nuri is the country’s first rocket using its own technology, opening the door to a range of future satellites and missions.\n\nA total of 300 South Korean companies took part in developing the rocket, according to KARI.\n\nKARI head Ahn Sang-il has previously said the rocket’s success would allow South Korea more autonomy in its space program.\n\n“In the past, cube satellites were launched using rockets in other countries but from this launch, we’ll have an opportunity to load Korean-made cube satellites to a rocket also made in Korea,” he told a news briefing in April. “We can have our satellites launched according to our own needs and at the right timing for us from this launch.”\n\nAfter the failed attempt last year, then President Moon Jae-in said South Korea planned to launch the rocket five more times by 2027.\n\nThe country has other space projects in the works: its first lunar orbiter, developed in partnership with NASA, is expected to launch in August next year.

Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nElectronic music, strobe lights, glittered faces and hundreds of thousands of people in mixed-gender gyrations are all part of a new kind of ritual in Saudi Arabia that didn’t exist just three years ago.\n\nThe kingdom’s Soundstorm music festival, which began in 2019, is back again for its fourth year and will start on Thursday.\n\nIn just five years since Saudi Arabia lifted its ban on musical events, the kingdom’s concert scene has arguably outshined even that of Dubai, long seen as the Gulf region’s premier entertainment hub.\n\nThe country that has been better known as the birthplace of Islam than a rave capital has gone through a tremendous makeover since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MBS) took control of the everyday running of the kingdom in 2017. Soundstorm is an eye-catching symbol of that change.\n\nFor three days every winter, hundreds of thousands of people from across Saudi Arabia and the region descend on a desert site outside the capital Riyadh to listen to some of the top Western and Arab acts .\n\nThe rave is a manifestation of the ethos behind Saudi Arabia’s socioeconomic transformation, according to Anna Jacobs, a senior analyst at the Crisis Group think tank. “(It) is a particularly powerful example because it seeks to bring together young people and women from across Saudi Arabia and the world,” she said.\n\nDavid Guetta, Post Malone and Bruno Mars are just a few of the stars performing at this year’s event, which prides itself as being “the loudest festival in the region,” aiming to “amplify the unseen” as it supports local and international music in the Middle East. Tickets cost between 149 riyals (around $40) for a single day and 6,699 riyals (around $1,800 ) for a three-day VIP treatment.\n\nThe festival reportedly welcomed 730,000 partygoers last year. By contrast, Las Vegas’ Electric Daisy Carnival, considered North America’s biggest dance music festival, had an attendance of over 400,000 this year.\n\nAn event like Soundstorm was inconceivable in the country just six years ago, when the notorious religious police would roam the streets and censure Saudis for mixing with the opposite sex or flouting social norms. But it is now part of a liberalization initiative spearheaded by MBS, the kingdom’s de facto ruler. It accompanies a series of steps to relax social rules, including lifting the ban on women’s driving and reining in the religious police.\n\nIn 2016, Saudi Arabia established the General Entertainment Authority in tandem with Vision 2030 – the crown prince’s plan to diversify its economy beyond oil, which accounts for more than half of the government’s revenue. Among its goals was to almost double household spending on cultural and entertainment activities within the kingdom. Riyadh is now seeing more than $64 billion in entertainment investment, reported Arab News, with a significant proportion of that going to the live music industry.\n\nVision 2030 prides itself on offering “world-class entertainment” and says that it has organized up to 3,800 entertainment events in the country, attended by more than 80 million people.\n\n“The whole principle about allowing festivals is to provide youth with domestic entertainment and local tourism opportunities so they don’t need to travel abroad in search of fun,” said Ali Shihabi, a Saudi author and analyst.\n\nSome conservatives may find the festival unacceptable, Shihabi said, but given that youth make up the majority of the country’s population, they remain the primary beneficiaries.\n\nAround two-thirds of Saudi Arabia’s population is 34 years old or younger, according to the Saudi General Authority for Statistics. Analysts say it’s the youth that MBS needs to placate, not the conservatives.\n\nAlcohol continues to be banned in the kingdom, as are sexual relations between men, and unmarried couples.\n\nThe festival is not, however, without international criticism and accusations of whitewashing the kingdom’s human rights record. Last year, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said that performers should either “speak up” about Saudi Arabia’s human rights violations or not attend the festival at all.\n\n“Saudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars hosting massive entertainment and cultural events in a deliberate (attempt) to whitewash the country’s abysmal human rights record and the Soundstorm music festival is no different,” Joey Shea, a researcher at HRW told CNN. “The creation of the country’s local entertainment industry was accompanied by waves of arbitrary arrests of dissidents, activists, human rights defenders and ordinary Saudi citizens.”\n\nShihabi rejects the argument that the festival whitewashes the country’s rights record, saying that it “has little to do with any global image and is purely focused on servicing local needs.”\n\nMdlbeast, the organizers of Soundstorm, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.\n\nSome however argue that opening up countries to international norms and values can allow for better discussion on human rights shortcomings.\n\n“I think there is a way for these major international events – whether that be the World Cup in Qatar or music festivals in Saudi Arabia – to help open public discourse to critical debate,” said Jacobs.\n\n“They can help cultivate healthy criticism and discussion around human rights issues in the region,” she added, “and as the Gulf continues to solidify its position as the region’s center of gravity, I think this is what we will see.”\n\nIran protests\n\nThe families of Iran’s World Cup football team had been threatened with imprisonment and torture if the players failed to “behave” ahead of the match against the United States on Tuesday, a source involved in the security of the games said.\n\nFollowing the refusal of Iranian players to sing the nation’s national anthem in their opening match against England on November 21, the source said that the players were called to a meeting with members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThe source said that they were told that their families would face “violence and torture” if they did not sing the national anthem or if they joined any political protest against the Tehran regime.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nThe Norway-based Iran Human Rights organization said on Tuesday that at least 448 people have been killed in the unrest surrounding the protests. CNN cannot independently verify the death toll.\n\nMembers of the activist art group Pussy Riot wore shirts in support of Iranian protesters at Tuesday’s World Cup game between Iran and the United States in Doha.\n\nTwo Iranian footballers were freed from detention on Tuesday, according to reports. Voria Ghafouri, who was facing charges of incitement against the regime, was released on bail, reported Iranian judiciary news site Mizan News. And a former member of Iran’s national team, Parviz Boroumand, who was arrested during protests in Tehran, was also released, according to state news agency IRNA.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna announced Monday that a third tranche of European Union sanctions against Iran is “being prepared” over the ongoing repression of protests.\n\nThe digest\n\nQatar to send 2 million tons of LNG to Germany in new energy deal\n\nQatarEnergy signed a deal on Tuesday that will allow Germany to receive flows of Qatari liquefied natural gas (LNG) over a period of at least 15 years, Qatar’s state news agency QNA said. The deal is the first of its kind to Europe from the expansion project of Qatar’s North Field, the world’s biggest gas field, and is meant to make up for some of the shortage triggered by Russian supply cuts.\n\nBackground: Until the Ukraine war, Germany was heavily reliant on Russian gas. Talks with Qatar have been in the works for months, as Germany and other European countries try to find alternative energy sources as the market tightens following sanctions on Russian supplies. The contract provides Germany with two million tons of LNG annually and the first shipment is due in 2026.\n\nWhy it matters: Tensions were high this month as Germany ramped up its criticism of Qatar ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, questioning its human rights record and later opposing the Gulf country’s ban on the rainbow-colored armband. Europe’s biggest economy has been running short on natural gas, with German economy minister Robert Habeck previously saying that rationing could not be ruled out ahead of the coming winter.\n\nUS State Department approves potential anti-drone system sale to Qatar for $1 billion\n\nThe US State Department has approved the potential sale of an anti-drone system to Qatar in a deal valued at $1 billion, Reuters cited the Pentagon as saying on Tuesday. The principal contractors will be Raytheon Technologies and Northrop Grumman Corp, the Pentagon said.\n\nBackground: The potential sale approval comes after US President Joe Biden earlier this year designated Qatar as a major non-NATO ally of the US, granting special status to a key friend in a turbulent region. Separately, Qatar has also played a role in the Iran nuclear talks and in relations with Afghanistan, where Washington’s interests were represented by the small Gulf country.\n\nWhy it matters: The approval comes as the use of drones rises in Middle East warfare. In 2019, a drone attack blamed on Iran knocked off half of Saudi Arabia’s oil production. Iran, which has friendly relations with Doha, has also been accused by the US of supplying Russia with drones in its war with Ukraine. The Pentagon said the proposed sale will improve Qatar’s capability to meet threats by providing electronic and kinetic defeat capabilities against drones.\n\nUS-backed Syrian Democratic Forces fear Turkish ground invasion could start in a week\n\nThe head of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) on Tuesday said a Turkish ground invasion could take place in a matter of days if Turkey does not see forceful opposition to a military incursion from countries such as the US and Russia.\n\nBackground: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has launched a recent series of airstrikes against Kurdish militants in northern Syria, and has warned that a ground operation will soon follow. The operation is meant to target Kurdish groups that Turkey believes were behind a deadly bomb attack in Istanbul earlier this month.\n\nWhy it matters: The SDF’s backbone is the Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) militia, which Turkey considers a wing of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and seeks to eliminate. But the group has been instrumental in the fight against ISIS since 2014 and has warned that a Turkish assault will complicate the fight against the militants. It is unclear if the US will heed its calls to restrain Turkey. The US has reduced the number of patrols with SDF ahead of a possible incursion.\n\nWorld Cup\n\nQatar’s World Cup chief Hassan Al-Thawadi said that between 400 and 500 migrant workers have died as a result of work done on projects connected to the tournament – a greater figure than Qatari officials have cited previously.\n\nIn an interview with Piers Morgan which aired on TalkTV on Monday, Al-Thawadi was asked about the number of migrant workers fatalities due to construction for the World Cup and said: “The estimate is around 400, between 400 and 500.\n\n“I don’t have the exact number, that’s something that’s been discussed. One death is too many, it’s as simple as that.”\n\nIn November 2022, a government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on World Cup stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths.\n\nRead more:\n\nAround the region\n\nA rendition of the Rashid Rover provided by the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre. Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre\n\nOn Thursday, the UAE is set to become the first Arab country to launch a mission to the moon. The Rashid Rover will begin its trip from Cape Canaveral Space Station in Florida where it aims to land on the lunar surface in the coming months.\n\nBeginning construction in 2017, the solar-powered rover has been developed by Dubai’s Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) and is named after the emirate’s late ruler Sheikh Rashid Al Saeed.\n\nThe rover will take a low-energy route and is expected to land on the lunar surface in March 2023. The vehicle will be delivered by the Japanese HAKUTO-R lander and will touch down on the Atlas crater.\n\nIt will spend one lunar day (equivalent to 14.75 days Earth time) where it will analyze the plasma of the moon’s surface and conduct experiments on lunar dust. It will then spend another lunar day in which it will attempt to survive the moon’s harsh environment, before decommissioning.\n\nThe launch aims to be the first step in the UAE’s greater space prospects. By 2117, the country aims to have a colony built on Mars’s surface. “We are starting small,” Hamad Al Marzooqi, project manager of the Emirates Lunar Mission at the MBRSC, told CNN. “But we hope that this small step will be eventually the starting point to reach our targets.”\n\nThe UAE launched a mission to Mars in February last year.\n\nBy Ollie Macnaughton\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/21/us/reedy-creek-walt-disney-florida/index.html", "title": "Reedy Creek: Why Disney has its own government in Florida and ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story was originally published on April 21, 2022. It has been updated to reflect Florida’s 2023 special legislative session.\n\nCNN —\n\nDisney’s Orlando-area theme parks and who will govern them are under renewed scrutiny in Florida – the latest in a yearlong spat between Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state’s largest private employer.\n\nLawmakers have returned to Tallahassee for a special session called in part to address what happens to Disney’s special taxing district, called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, after they previously passed legislation dissolving it, which was supposed to take effect in June.\n\nState Republicans on Monday unveiled a bill to turn over control of Disney’s special taxing district to a five-member board hand-picked by DeSantis and rebrand Reedy Creek the “Central Florida Tourism Oversight District.”\n\nThe move to take over Reedy Creek comes after DeSantis sparred last year with Disney over a bill to restrict certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nHere’s a look at the history of Reedy Creek, why it has become the focus of another special legislative session in Florida, and how proposed changes would give DeSantis more control.\n\nWhat is Reedy Creek?\n\nReedy Creek is the name for the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special purpose district created by state law in May 1967 that gives The Walt Disney Company governmental control over the land in and around its central Florida theme parks. The district sits southwest of Orlando.\n\nAt the time, the land was little more than uninhabited pasture and swamp, according to Reedy Creek’s website. With the special purpose district, Disney took over responsibility for providing municipal services like power, water, roads and fire protection – but was also freed from dealing with legal red tape or paying taxes for services that benefited the broader public.\n\nAccording to Richard Foglesong, the author of the book “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando,” Disney had previously had issues with the government of Anaheim, California, at its Disneyland park, completed a decade earlier. With those issues in mind, Disney pushed for a special purpose district in Florida that would give the company the ability to self-govern.\n\nIn exchange, Florida became the home base for Disney World and its millions of tourists.\n\n“Florida needed Disney more than Disney needed Florida,” Foglesong told CNN.\n\nToday, the Reedy Creek special district encompasses about 25,000 acres in Orange and Osceola counties, including four theme parks, two water parks, one sports complex, 175 lane miles of roadway, 67 miles of waterway, and the cities of Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, its website says.\n\n“The cooperation and commitment between the Reedy Creek Improvement District and Walt Disney World Company is as strong today as it was when the District was created in 1967,” the Reedy Creek website states. “The result is an example of how a working partnership between business and government can be prosperous for both sides.”\n\nWhy is this an issue now?\n\nLast year, DeSantis challenged lawmakers to unravel the 55-year-old Reedy Creek Improvement Act as part of a special legislative session and ultimately signed a bill that would sunset the district on June 1.\n\nLawmakers left town without a plan to unwind a half-century of Disney control or for how to ensure Orange and Osceola county residents wouldn’t be on the hook for funding Reedy Creek services or its $1 billion in debt. Amid the fallout, Reedy Creek told its bondholders that Florida could not dissolve the district without assuming its debts.\n\nDeSantis repeatedly offered assurances that taxpayers wouldn’t have to pick up the tab.\n\nNow, GOP lawmakers have returned to the state Capitol and are trying to breath new life into the taxing district and keep many of its special powers. The final page of the 189-page bill proposed Monday states: “The Reedy Creek Improvement District is not dissolved as of June 1, 2023, but continues in full force and effect under its new name.”\n\nThe Republican-controlled legislature is likely to pass the proposed changes within the next couple of weeks and the governor is supportive of them.\n\nWhat are lawmakers proposing?\n\nThe bill, introduced Monday by state Rep. Fred Hawkins, seeks to limit the damage that could be done to Disney, one of the state’s most vital tourism engines, and to taxpayers.\n\nThe measure guarantees that the changes to Reedy Creek will not affect the district’s existing debt or any other contracts.\n\nInstead of ending the district, the proposed legislation would rebrand it as the “Central Florida Tourism Oversight District” and curb some of its powers, including the ability to build an airport or a nuclear power plant.\n\nThe board, previously made up of Reedy Creek landowners with close ties to Disney, will instead become a five-member board of supervisors appointed by the governor. The bill makes clear that none of the appointees chosen by the governor can be recent Disney employees or their relatives, nor that of a competitor. The state Senate, where Republicans hold a super majority, would have final approval of the appointees.\n\n“These actions ensure a state-controlled district accountable to the people instead of a corporate-controlled kingdom,” DeSantis spokesman Jeremy Redfern said.\n\nWhat has Disney said?\n\nDisney said Monday it is watching the bill.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Jeff Vahle, the president of Walt Disney World Resort, said the company is “monitoring the progression of the draft legislation, which is complex given the long history of the Reedy Creek Improvement District.”\n\n“Disney works under a number of different models and jurisdictions around the world, and regardless of the outcome, we remain committed to providing the highest quality experience for the millions of guests who visit each year,” Vahle said.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Florida schools?\n\nReedy Creek has been tied to the feud between DeSantis, who has widely been seen as a potential 2024 GOP presidential contender, and Disney over a measure that bans certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom.\n\nThe “Parental Rights in Education” bill – which critics have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill – was signed into law last March and prohibits schools from teaching children about sexual orientation or gender identity “in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate.” The legislation also allows parents to bring lawsuits against a school district for potential violations.\n\nThe law’s vague language and the threat of parental lawsuits have raised fears that it will lead to discrimination against LGBTQ students and will have a chilling effect on classroom discussion. DeSantis spokesperson Christina Pushaw said on Twitter last year that the legislation would protect kids from “groomers,” a slang term for pedophiles, and described those who oppose the law as “probably groomers.”\n\nBob Chapek, the then-CEO of Disney, which employs 75,000 people in Florida, initially declined to condemn the law last year but reversed course after facing employee criticism. A company spokesperson then released a statement stating its goal was for the law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts.\n\n“Florida’s HB 1557, also known as the ‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, should never have passed and should never have been signed into law,” the March 2022 statement said. The company said it was “dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of LGBTQ+ members of the Disney family, as well as the LGBTQ+ community in Florida and across the country.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Dianne Gallagher Steve Contorno Jack Forrest", "Eric Levenson", "Dianne Gallagher", "Steve Contorno", "Jack Forrest"], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}]}

And note: It focuses exclusively on people and bands born in Wisconsin — leaving out, for instance, former Madison resident and \"Funky Drummer\" Clyde Stubblefield, or longtime Milwaukee soul man and \"Disco Lady\" writer Harvey Scales, who was born in Arkansas.\n\nBut their collective legacy shows the mark Wisconsin has made on the music we listened to, and still listen to. Check out the listening suggestions for refreshers on why they matter.\n\n50. Ava Max\n\nIt's true that Ava Max's career is just getting started; she released her debut full-length album, \"Heaven & Hell,\" last fall.

Joe Schermie\n\nThree Dog Night had 14 top 20 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, and six gold and one platinum album, from 1968 to 1972, when Madison-born bassist Schermie was part of the band.\n\nListen to: Three Dog Night's cover of the Randy Newman-penned \"Mama Told Me Not To Come\" — their first Hot 100 chart-topper — is better known today than the original recording, with Schermie's bass lending a funky vibe to this trippy tale of debauchery.\n\n44. Spanic Boys\n\nWhen Sinead O'Connor scrapped plans to be a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live\" with just three days' notice in 1990, the show's then-bandleader G.E. Smith reached out to this little-known Milwaukee father-and-son-led rock band to fill the slot.

Die Kreuzen\n\n\"They just missed that window where they could have been massive,\" Butch Vig once said of the Milwaukee band, who broke up in 1992 before they were offered a deal with Atlantic Records.

If we made millions playing for thousands of screaming fans night after night, we might struggle to give that up too.\n\nCher did a farewell tour once. And the Who. And KISS. And they're all touring again in 2019 — although KISS swears this farewell tour really is their farewell tour.\n\nAnd KISS is hardly alone, announcing their \"End of the Road Tour\" when we're seeing more goodbye runs than ever before — including another one from Osbourne.\n\nRELATED:From Bob Seger to Elton John to KISS, farewell concert tours abound, and business is booming\n\nRELATED:From Elton John to Bob Seger, the top 10 concerts in Milwaukee this winter\n\nRELATED:These are all the Milwaukee arena, amphitheater and stadium concerts happening in 2019\n\nSo will all these retiring artists really quit the road forever?\n\nHere's a look at seven acts who are on or have recently wrapped final tours, and our best guess for which farewells are legit, and which ones are fake-outs.\n\nBOB SEGER\n\nThe old-time rocker, and \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" hit-maker, said he's done with the road at the end of his current tour this spring, after scrapping some shows in 2017 when he suffered a ruptured disc and had to have emergency spinal surgery. He's long talked about retirement and given his age (73) and health issues, we suspect this farewell's legit.\n\nLocal Date:Jan. 24, Fiserv Forum\n\nELTON JOHN\n\nJohn's \"Farewell Yellow Brick Road\" tour is stretching a long time — through 2021 — with more than 300 shows on five continents. He's long been a road warrior, but that is quite a commitment for a man who'll be either 73 or 74 when it finally ends, and he wants to spend more time with his kids, who are currently 6 and 8. Our guess is he'll do just that, and this farewell is legit — although we also think it's highly likely he'll be doing loads of Vegas shows after \"Road\" reaches its conclusion.\n\nLocal Date:Feb. 19, Fiserv Forum\n\nKISS\n\nKISS calling it quits? You're kidding, right? Bear in mind they did a farewell tour back in 2000, only to tour again in 2003. Sure, Gene Simmons is 69 now, and yeah, there's more physical demand on them compared with John at the piano. But interviews show Simmons and frontman Paul Stanley still have healthy egos, and this is a band that clearly loves making money, as extensive merchandising for its loving fan base has long shown. Our verdict: This farewell's a fake-out, although the touring likely slow down after the current \"End of the Road\" run wraps.\n\nWisconsin Date:March 1, Fiserv Forum\n\nOZZY OSBOURNE\n\nOsbourne himself downplayed the alleged finality of \"No More Tours II\" when he announced the second solo farewell run of his career this year. While Osbourne said he doesn't have another world tour in him after this one, he promised he'd \"still be doing gigs.\" Expect to see some one-off Ozzfests and festival headlining gigs, but we also suspect the 70-year-old Osbourne still has a little actual touring left in him. We're guessing this farewell is a fake-out.\n\nWisconsin Date:July 4, American Family Insurance Amphitheater, Summerfest\n\nLYNYRD SKYNYRD\n\nThe band behind \"Free Bird\" should have a lot more free time on their hands after their \"Last of the Street Survivors Tour\" (which played a sold-out Resch Center in Green Bay in October) ends in England this June. Maybe it's just us, but England just doesn't seem like the proper place for Skynyrd to say \"cheerio.\" (Wouldn't a farewell work better in, we dunno, ALABAMA?) Besides, guitarist Gary Rossington is the only original member left, anyway. Honestly, the hits are still so beloved, this is a band that can still do decent touring business without an original member, which is why we're thinking this farewell's a fake-out.\n\nKENNY ROGERS\n\nThe country legend finally knew when to fold 'em, going on \"The Gambler's Last Deal\" tour that brought him to the Riverside Theater in Milwaukee in 2017. The tour ended earlier than expected last year due to some health issues, and Rogers was noticeably struggling even a few years prior at the Wisconsin State Fair. We suspect sadly that Rogers' farewell tour was legit, but he no doubt has left behind a one-of-a-kind legacy.\n\nMOTLEY CRUE\n\nSuspecting fans would be skeptical when they announced their final tour in 2014 (which hit Madison, Green Bay, and Milwaukee twice before ending New Year's Eve 2015), the guys in Motley Crue went so far as to sign a \"cessation of touring\" contract that reportedly would keep the band from ever touring again. Of course, no one outside the band's inner circle got a really close look at the details of the contract, and the guys are all younger than most farewell artists these days (drummer Tommy Lee, for one, is only 56). And coming soon to Netflix, we'll be seeing \"The Dirt,\" based on the acclaimed tell-all book documenting the band's hedonistic early days, which will spark renewed interest from old fans and new admirers alike. Contract be damned, we suspect the band's alleged final tour was a fake-out.\n\nMore on music\n\nPiet Levy talks about concerts, local music and more on \"TAP'd In\" with Jordan Lee, 8 a.m. Thursdays on WYMS-FM (88.9).

The Opry has played a foundational role in her life and career.\n\nOn that evening in 1967 – just after her then-new husband Ken Dudney, a Navy pilot, was deployed to Vietnam – the former country music child star visited the Ryman Auditorium with her family for a live taping of the Opry's weekly television program.\n\nWhile sitting in the Ryman's balcony, the then-retired Mandrell saw Dolly Parton and told her father, \"If you'll manage me, I want to get back into show business.\"\n\n\"If you want me to,\" he replied, \"I'll bet my last penny on you.\"\n\nHer father's bet has paid unfathomable dividends and inspired generations of fans, fellow artists and every great female performer that has followed in her legacy.\n\nMandrell is currently the Opry's 10th-oldest active inducted member. However, in studying her contributions to the art of live performance, her membership carries timeless resonance in every country music conversation.\n\nBarbara Mandrell interview::Singer reflects on 50 years of family and friendship with the Grand Ole Opry\n\n\"The Grand Ole Opry feels comfortable and is home,\" Mandrell says. \"I'm proud to be a member of the family of members that can call the Opry home for the rest of their careers.\"\n\nHer relationship with the program's longtime hosts Roy Acuff and Minnie Pearl is also noteworthy.\n\nRespectfully, Mandrell still refers to the onetime self-proclaimed \"King of Country Music\" and first living inductee into the Country Music Hall of Fame as \"Mr. Acuff.\"\n\n\"Mr. Acuff and (then-Opry general manager) Bud Wendell inducted me into the Opry on July 29, 1972,\" says Mandrell, adding that the night was \"one of the proudest moments of her career.\"\n\nAcuff's \"wonderful, beautiful introductions\" and notes of support (\"treasured compliments\") were highlights of their friendship, she says.\n\nCurrently, a shirt emblazoned with the title of Mandrell's 1981 hit single \"I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool\" is available for sale on the Grand Ole Opry website. When asked about the importance of one of her signature songs to summarize her career, she offered the story she told the song's writers 24 hours before it was written.\n\n\"One day, I was telling Kye Fleming and ‎Dennis Morgan, that when I was a child, kids used to tease me, 'Yeehaw, country music,' they'd say, trying to tease me or make me feel embarrassed. Years later, those same kids were adults and showed up in autograph lines.\n\n\"It might be tacky of me to say that, but I'm proud of country music. I love it. It's everything to me.\"\n\nMandrell made a rare public appearance Saturday night at the Opry to celebrate her 50th anniversary of being an Opry member.\n\nBorn in Texas and raised in California, Mandrell was just 23 when she became a member in July of 1972. But she was already a seasoned entertainer by the time she came to Nashville, after her teenage years were spent playing steel guitar and appearing regularly on the California-based country TV show “Town Hall Party.”\n\nCarrie Underwood interview:Singer on upholding the \"hustling\" legacies of top-tier country icons like Barbara Mandrell, Dolly Parton\n\nOver her decades-long career, the actor, multi-instrumentalist and singer turned millions of fans onto country music in the ’70s and ’80s, not only through her popular TV show “Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters,” but also through hits like “Sleeping Single in a Double Bed,” “If Loving You is Wrong (I Don’t Want to be Right)” and “I Was Country When Country Wasn’t Cool.”\n\nShe became the first country artist to earn back-to-back entertainer of the year awards from the Country Music Association, crossing over with R&B covers and bringing glamour and showmanship to the genre. Her performances were a showcase of her musicality, whether she was singing to the top of the rafters, playing pedal steel, the banjo or the saxophone.\n\n“It’s called show business. You need to show them something,” Mandrell told the Associated Press. “Otherwise, they could sit at home and listen to your recordings or listen to you on the radio. You’ve got to give them something that entertains them.”\n\n2014 Musicians Hall of Fame induction:12 members added, including Barbara Mandrell, Randy Bachman\n\nThis Saturday night, Mandrell was still a champion of country music. Before the show began, Mandrell watched Carrie Underwood from side stage as Underwood did her soundcheck of “I Was Country When Country Wasn’t Cool,” stopping to give her a hug and greeting Underwood’s band members.\n\nUnderwood said growing up, Mandrell’s voice was always around.\n\n“She has been such an inspiration to me and so many others that stand on the shoulders of great female artists like her,” Underwood told the Opry crowd.\n\nRelated:Carrie Underwood talks 'selfish' duet with Axl Rose, 'timeless' appeal of 'Denim & Rhinestones'\n\nDuring the Opry show, Mandrell enthusiastically applauded the all-female artist lineup, including CeCe Winans, Linda Davis and Suzy Bogguss, as they performed her hits.\n\n“I already feel on top of the world. I feel the deepest of gratitude and excitement because I am such a huge fan of these ladies,” said Mandrell.\n\nFrom her seat in the middle of the crowd, Mandrell waved and blew kisses at her fans, who snapped photos of the country star.\n\nMandrell hasn’t played music or sung — other than in church — since she retired in 1997. Her last concert ever was held at the Opry House and made into TV special called, “Barbara Mandrell and the Do-Rites: The Last Dance.”\n\nDressed smartly in a hot pink pantsuit and surrounded on stage by 50 dozen lavender-colored roses bought by her fans, Mandrell gave another goodbye from the same Opry stage 25 years later.\n\n“I chose my home to do my final performance on and it was this one,” Mandrell said. “God bless you!” she told fans before she walked off stage into the shadows.\n\nContributing: Kristin M.

When Nicks was added to the lineup in 1975, the two became fast friends.\n\nTheirs was not a competitive relationship, but a sisterly one – both women were gifted songwriters responsible for crafting many of the band’s best-known tunes. Though the two grew apart in the 1980s amid Nicks’ worsening drug addiction and the band’s growing internal tension, they came back together when McVie returned to Fleetwood Mac in 2014.\n\nAt a concert in London, shortly before McVie officially rejoined the band, Nicks dedicated the song “Landslide” to her “mentor. Big sister. Best friend.” And at the show’s end, McVie was there, accompanying her bandmates for “Don’t Stop.”\n\n“I never want her to ever go out of my life again, and that has nothing to do with music and everything to do with her and I as friends,” Nicks told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 2015.\n\nOn Wednesday, McVie, the band’s “songbird,” died after a brief illness at age 79. Below, revisit McVie’s and Nicks’ years-long relationship as bandmates, best friends and “sisters.”\n\nMcVie and Nicks hit it off from the start\n\nThe story of Nicks joining Fleetwood Mac is legend now: Band founder and drummer Mick Fleetwood wanted to recruit guitarist Lindsey Buckingham, who stipulated that he would only join if his girlfriend and musician Nicks could join, too. McVie cast the deciding vote, and the rest is history.\n\n“It was critical that I got on with her because I’d never played with another girl,” McVie told the Guardian in 2013. “But I liked her instantly. She was funny and nice but also there was no competition. We were completely different on the stage to each other and we wrote differently too.”\n\nChristine McVie and Stevie Nicks were fast friends when Nicks joined Fleetwood Mac, protecting each other in a male-dominated industry. Aaron Rapoport/Corbis Historical/Getty Images\n\nThroughout the band’s many personal complications – McVie married and divorced Fleetwood Mac bassist John McVie and had an affair with the band’s lighting director, while Nicks had rollercoaster romances with Buckingham and Fleetwood – they were each other’s center.\n\n“To be in a band with another girl who was this amazing musician – (McVie) kind of instantly became my best friend,” Nicks told the New Yorker earlier this year. “Christine was a whole other ballgame. She liked hanging out with the guys. She was just more comfortable with men than I had ever been.”\n\nThe two protected each other, Nicks said, in a male-dominated industry: “We made a pact, in the very beginning, that we would never be treated with disrespect by all the male musicians in the community.\n\n“I would say to her, ‘Together, we are a serious force of nature, and it will give us the strength to maneuver the waters that are ahead of us,’” Nicks told the New Yorker.\n\nThe band succeeds but McVie and Nicks grow distant\n\n“Rumours” was the band’s greatest success to date when it was released in 1977. But the band’s relationships with each other were deteriorating, save for the one between McVie and Nicks. While the pair were enduring breakups with their significant others, Nicks and McVie spent their time offstage together.\n\nThe Guardian asked McVie if she was trying to offset the band’s tumult with her songs on “Rumours,” including the lighthearted “You Make Lovin’ Fun” and optimistic “Don’t Stop.” She said she likely had been.\n\nAs multiple members’ drug use intensified, the band’s dynamic grew tense. McVie distanced herself from the group in 1984 amid her bandmates’ addictions, telling the Guardian she was “just sick of it.” Nicks, meanwhile, was becoming dependent on cocaine.\n\nAfter Fleetwood Mac was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, Christine McVie (third from left) quit the band. Jon Levy/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMcVie told Rolling Stone that year that she’d grown apart from Nicks: “She seems to have developed her own fantasy world, somehow, which I’m not part of. We don’t socialize much.”\n\nIn 1986, Nicks checked into the Betty Ford Center to treat her addiction, though she later became addicted to Klonopin, which she said claimed years of her life. She quit the prescription drug in the 1990s.\n\nAfter recording some solo works, McVie returned to Fleetwood Mac for their 1987 album “Tango in the Night,” and two of her songs on that record – “Little Lies” and “Everywhere” – became major hits. But Nicks departed the band soon after, and the band’s best-known lineup wouldn’t officially reunite until 1997 for “The Dance” tour and subsequent live album.\n\nThe reunion was short-lived: After the band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, McVie officially quit Fleetwood Mac, citing a fear of flying and exhaustion of life on the road.\n\nMcVie returns to Fleetwood Mac – and to Nicks’ side\n\nIn the 2010s, after more than a decade of retirement, McVie toyed with returning to performing. She officially rejoined Fleetwood Mac after calling Fleetwood himself and gauging what her return would mean for the group.\n\n“Fortunately Stevie was dying for me to come back, as were the rest of the band,” she told the Arts Desk.\n\nIn 2015, a year after she’d rejoined Fleetwood Mac, McVie hit the road with her bandmates. Touring with the group was tiring but fun, the first time they’d performed together in years.\n\n“I’m only here for Stevie,” she told the New Yorker that year.\n\nChristine McVie (left) and Stevie Nicks perform together at Radio City Music Hall in 2018. Steven Ferdman/Getty Images\n\nNicks concurred: “When we went on the road, I realized what an amazing friend she’d been of mine that I had lost and didn’t realize the whole consequences of it till now,” she told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune in 2015.\n\nDuring that tour, McVie wore a silver chain that Nicks had given her – a “metaphor,” McVie told the New Yorker, “that the chain of the band will never be broken. Not by me, anyways. Not again by me.”\n\nMcVie told the Arts Desk in 2016 that she and Nicks were “better friends now than (they) were 16 years ago.”\n\nTouring with Buckingham and Fleetwood could quickly get tumultuous for Nicks, McVie said, due to their shared history. “But with me in there, it gave Stevie the chance to get her breath back and not have this constant thing going on with Lindsey: her sister was back,” she said.\n\nTheir mutual praise continued: In 2019, McVie said Nicks was “just unbelievable” onstage: “The more I see her perform on stage the better I think she is. She holds the fort.”\n\nWhen their 2018-2019 tour ended, though – without Buckingham, who was fired – the band “kind of broke up,” McVie told Rolling Stone earlier this year. She added that she didn’t speak with Nicks as often as she did when they toured together.\n\nAs for a reunion, McVie told Rolling Stone that while it wasn’t off the table, she wasn’t feeling “physically up for it.”\n\n“I’m getting a bit long in the teeth here,” she said. “I’m quite happy being at home. I don’t know if I ever want to tour again. It’s bloody hard work.”\n\nNicks remembers her ‘best friend’ McVie\n\nNews of McVie’s death rattled Nicks, who wrote that she had only found out McVie was sick days earlier. She called McVie her “best friend in the whole world since the first day of 1975.”\n\nOn her social media accounts, Nicks shared a handwritten note containing lyrics from the Haim song “Hallelujah,” some of which discusses grief and the loss of a best friend.\n\n“See you on the other side, my love,” Nicks wrote. “Don’t forget me – Always, Stevie.”", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/08/17/dickey-betts-real-allman-brothers-band-stories-behind-almost-famous/5601008002/", "title": "Dickey Betts: The real Allman Brothers stories behind 'Almost Famous'", "text": "Relaxing at home on Little Sarasota Bay, Florida, Dickey Betts laughs when asked what it was like to be a rock star in 1973.\n\n“Well, I don’t know,” he says. “It kind of came on so gradually I didn’t notice it. I’d been working for years before that, you know? It was nice having big crowds and all.” Betts pauses for a moment, then adds, “It sure was a lot of fun.”\n\nThe Allman Brothers were one of the biggest, best and hardest partying bands in America in 1973 when a 16-year-old Cameron Crowe joined them on tour that summer to write a Rolling Stone cover story. Crowe would later emerge as a top Hollywood filmmaker and following his blockbuster “Jerry Maguire” made the semi-autobiographical “Almost Famous,” which celebrates its 20th anniversary on Sept. 22. Largely based on Crowe’s experiences on the road with the Allman Brothers – as well as other bands he interviewed on tour during that period, including Led Zeppelin and The Eagles – the film tells the fun, often poignant tale of a young journalist trying to complete a profile of the fictitious rock band Stillwater for Rolling Stone.\n\n“Almost Famous” earned Crowe an Academy Award for his original screenplay and remains a beloved cult classic. While Kate Hudson and Frances McDormand each earned Oscar nominations for best supporting actress, the film’s top-billed star is Billy Crudup, who plays Russell Hammond, the long-haired, mustachioed guitarist for Stillwater. Crudup’s resemblance to Betts is unmistakable. “Crudup’s look, and much more, is a tribute to Dickey,” Crowe told Rolling Stone in 2017. “Dickey seemed like a quiet guy with a huge amount of soul, possible danger and playful recklessness behind his eyes. He was a huge presence.”\n\nThat time Cameron Crowe went on the road with the Allman Brothers\n\nBy late 1972, Betts had emerged as the Allman Brothers’ leader following the premature deaths of Gregg Allman’s older sibling Duane Allman and Berry Oakley, both killed in eerily similar motorcycle accidents about a year apart. After having largely completed their new album “Brothers and Sisters,” the Allman Brothers returned to the road in early ’73 with a new lineup and new fans, having graduated from playing clubs and theaters to sports arenas and stadiums.\n\nThe album spent five weeks at No. 1 and produced the chart-topping single “Ramblin’ Man,” written and sung by Betts.\n\nAt the height of their popularity, the Allman Brothers Band was approached about having Crowe join them on the road to write a profile. Problem was, the Allman Brothers weren’t on speaking terms with Rolling Stone after disagreements over a piece published a few weeks after Duane Allman’s death in ’71.\n\n“We had some bad experiences with Rolling Stone,” Betts, 76, says. “So the band was really gun shy about having anyone come on the road with us.\n\nBetts, who had been interviewed by Crowe previously, vouched for him. “And it turned out, he did a good article on us.”\n\nGregg Allman's best quotes: On fame, addiction and living a colorful life\n\nAlmost real? 'Almost Famous' hits theaters\n\nFlash forward to 2000, after Betts' bitter, highly publicized split with the Allman Brothers Band. He rarely goes to movies, but his wife Donna reads about one she thinks they might enjoy, and so they go and see “Almost Famous.” During the opening credits, the camera offers a glimpse of an Allman Brothers Band ticket stub from a show held in Crowe’s hometown of San Diego at the Sports Arena on Aug. 5, 1972. But, it’s not until 20 minutes later that Betts really takes notice: When Billy Crudup walks onscreen as Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist of the band Stillwater and the rock star who becomes closest with William Miller (played by Patrick Fugit), the rock writer based on a teenage Crowe.\n\n“I was pretty shocked, really, it was like watching myself,” Betts says. “It was pretty cool. Billy told me he based the character on me. ... I was pretty flattered.”\n\nThe Allman Brothers’ connections to Stillwater continue throughout the film. Red Dog (Zack Ward), a roadie with long red hair and matching beard, is clearly based on original Allman Brothers Band roadie Joseph “The Legendary Red Dog” Campbell, who died in 2011.\n\nThere’s a poster of Stillwater on William’s wall seemingly modeled on the “At Fillmore East” album cover and later we hear the Allman Brothers’ explosive live version of “One Way Out” followed by a bus scene with Russell playing slide guitar, something Betts recalls doing on the ’73 tour after taking over lead and slide guitar duties following Duane's death.\n\n'Say Anything' sequel?Director Cameron Crowe wishes he made 'two or three more movies'\n\nWhen Crowe’s character William attempts to interview Russell at the various hotels, he keeps getting met by “Do Not Disturb” signs on the door. “ ‘Do not disturb. Don’t ring the phone. Don’t knock on the door.’ I had about seven or eight signs on there,\" Betts remembers. \"Because I was sick of being up all night and by the time I got to sleep, the damn maid would be banging on the door. So I put those signs up. That was funny.”\n\nNot everything about “Almost Famous” rings true for Betts, though. For instance, Kate Hudson plays groupie Penny Lane, who has a relationship with Russell before he trades her to the band Humble Pie for $50 and a case of beer during a game of poker. “Yeah, they kind of overdid the groupies. We never experienced anything like (the beer trade),\" he says, but the relationships were true to life. \"You’d have a relationship and even though it didn’t last very long – there were girls who were a lot of fun, of course – it would keep you going.”\n\nOne of the most memorable scenes in “Almost Famous” takes place at a house party thrown by teenagers in Topeka, Kansas. Russell attends with just William and has a great time with his fans, who give him acid. Russell then climbs to the roof of the house and screams “I’m a golden god,” before jumping into the pool below. “That might have been somebody else, one of the other bands, the Eagles or Led Zeppelin,” Betts says. “I never did anything like that.\n\n\"I was bad about going home with people, though. And the road manager would be more worried about that. But I’d always be there for the bus the next morning or the next day.”\n\nIn the movie, Rolling Stone’s editors are thrilled with William’s profile of Stillwater but when the magazine’s fact checker calls the band, Russell tells her 90% of it has been fabricated and the magazine refuses to run the piece. (Later, Russell verifies the facts and they run it as a cover story.) What actually occurred with the Allman Brothers cover story, though, is that Crowe nearly had his assignment ruined after Gregg Allman confiscated his interview tapes upon fearing he had revealed too much, or perhaps being worried that Crowe was an undercover cop.\n\n“I said, ‘Well, I’ll get ’em for you.’ And I went down and talked Gregg out of them and got his tapes back for him. I took to Cameron Crowe, I liked him. He was a young kid, you know, trying to make a big break for himself.”\n\nWhat Dickey Betts loves most about music\n\nOne of the most touching scenes in “Almost Famous” occurs at the end, when Russell is in William’s bedroom and the young journalist gets out his tape recorder and asks Russell, “What do you love about music?” Betts, who retired a couple of years ago following a mild stroke that affected his right hand, is asked the same question.\n\n“I like the crowds mainly, and what the music did for them,” he says. “They got more out of the music than I did. ... I just really get a kick out of the audience and how they could just kind of drift away to another world in a concert.”\n\nNew in streaming:This essential CREEM documentary gets to the rock magazine's irreverent, outrageous heart\n\nDickey Betts and Gregg Allman were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame together along with the rest of the surviving Allman Brothers Band members in 1995 before going their separate ways in 2000. Today, of the founding six-man Allman Brothers Band lineup, only Betts and drummer Jaimoe are still alive.\n\nOf course, Allman Brothers fans have all the albums to return to, but it’s also nice to know the band’s spirit lives on in Crowe’s smart, heartwarming film.\n\n“It was a pretty accurate movie,” Betts says. “It was entertaining, too. It was just well done all the way around. And it was probably the closest to what the road is like more than any rock movie that I have seen. It was really close.”\n\nWade Tatangelo wrote the liner notes for the Dickey Betts Band’s 2019 CD/DVD “Ramblin’ Man Live at the St. George Theatre.”\n\n10 albums you need to hear this month:Katy Perry, Deep Purple and Glass Animals", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/10/09/gary-levox-rascal-flatts-split-i-hate-way-ended/6070178001/", "title": "Gary LeVox on Rascal Flatts split: 'I hate the way that it ended'", "text": "Former frontman Gary LeVox is opening up about the end of Rascal Flatts.\n\nThe 51-year-old vocalist and his bandmates, Joe Don Rooney and Jay DeMarcus, announced in January 2020 the band would be embarking on a farewell tour after 20 years of performing together.

But it appears we've seen Arlo Guthrie tell us that in person for the last time.\n\nIn lengthy posts on his Facebook page and website, the 73-year-old folksinger announced Friday he is retiring from performance immediately. He's canceled numerous shows he had planned around the country for the next year and said he won't be booking any more.\n\n“It’s been a great 50-plus years of being a working entertainer, but I reached the difficult decision that touring and stage shows are no longer possible,” he said in the statement titled “Gone Fishing.”\n\nGuthrie did not respond to email and phone messages asking to elaborate but indicated in his statement that health issues played a major role. He said he'd suffered two strokes in recent years, including a serious one that hospitalized him for several days last year.\n\nThe son of folk music legend Woody Guthrie rose to overnight fame in 1967 with the release of “Alice's Restaurant Massacree,\" a hilarious 18-minute talking blues ballad about how his Thanksgiving Day 1965 arrest for littering kept him out of the Army during the Vietnam War.\n\nAs he finger-picked a maddeningly memorable tune over and over on his acoustic guitar, Guthrie related how he’d mocked the local police chief who arrested him, appeared before a blind judge who couldn’t see the photos submitted as evidence against him and berated his draft board for concluding he “wasn’t moral enough to join the Army and burn women and kids’ houses and villages after being a litterbug.”\n\nHe's gone on to record more than 30 albums, write several children's books and occasionally appear in television shows and films, including playing himself in the 1969 movie “Alice's Restaurant.”\n\n“A folk singer’s shelf life may be a lot longer than a dancer or an athlete, but at some point, unless you’re incredibly fortunate or just plain whacko (either one or both) it’s time to hang up the ‘Gone Fishing’ sign,\" he said Friday.\n\nGuthrie, who frequently declined to play “Alice's Restaurant Massacree” for audiences over the years, had planned to perform it at next year's shows. He had played it at New York's Carnegie Hall in 2019 at what he'd previously announced would be the last of his 50 Thanksgiving weekend shows at that venerated music hall.\n\nBut the day before, ironically on Thanksgiving, he suffered the second and more severe of his strokes. Two days later he was in the hospital and later underwent several days of physical rehabilitation.\n\nBy the next year, he was back on his feet and back on tour when the coronavirus pandemic struck. He estimated Friday he'd recovered about 80 percent of his health by then, but following months of idleness from the road, he decided it was time to stop.\n\nIn July he released a new song, Stephen Foster's \"Hard Times Come Again No More,” and indicated Friday that his retiring from the stage doesn't mean he'll go away completely.\n\n“In fact, I hope to be a thorn in the side of a new administration pretty soon,” he said in a veiled reference to President Donald Trump.\n\n50 years later:Woodstock photos forgotten in filing cabinet are displayed for first time", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/03/entertainment/paramore-misery-business-hayley-williams-cec/index.html", "title": "Paramore plays 'Misery Business' again after retiring it due to lyrics ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne of Paramore’s biggest hits is back on its setlist.\n\nThe emo-pop band revived its breakthrough single “Misery Business” at its tour stop in Bakersfield, California, on Sunday, playing it live for the first time since retiring it in 2018.\n\nAt the time, lead singer Hayley Williams said the band would stop playing the song “for a really long time” largely due to listener backlash. Some critics found “Misery Business” sexist, particularly for one lyric that refers to another woman as a “whore.”\n\nBut after years of fans defending the song and Williams reiterating her commitment to feminism, the band felt comfortable playing it live again.\n\n“Four years ago, we said we were gonna retire this song for a little while, and I guess technically we did,” Williams told her audience at Sunday’s gig, according to Rolling Stone. “But what we did not know was that, just about five minutes after I got canceled for saying the word ‘whore’ in a song, all of TikTok decided that it was OK.”\n\nWhen she and the band launched into the song, the audience cheered wildly, per footage of the concert shared online by attendees.\n\nUpon its release in 2007, “Misery Business” catapulted Paramore to stardom. Written by a 17-year-old Williams, the single told the story of a tumultuous love triangle between teenagers. Fans of the band looked forward to its appearance on Paramore tours, when Williams would pluck an audience member to sing its rapid-fire lyrics and chorus with her. The song and Paramore’s subsequent work has influenced artists like Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo (the latter even had to credit Williams and an ex-Paramore guitarist on her popular single “good 4 you” due to similarities between the two songs).\n\nBut in the years since its release, some fans and music critics reconsidered the lyrics to “Misery Business.” The derogatory term appears once, but the lyric and song’s subject matter – two young women vying for the same boy’s affections – motivated some listeners to describe it as “anti-feminist,” as Williams recounted in various interviews.\n\n“The problem with the lyrics is not that I had an issue with someone I went to school with … It’s the way I tried to call her out using words that didn’t belong in the conversation,” she said in a 2017 interview.\n\nEven before she stopped performing it, Williams distanced herself from its lyrics in a 2015 blog post. She also stopped singing some of the controversial lyrics in live performances until the 2018 concert when she told the crowd that the band felt it was “time to move away from (performing the song) for a little while.”\n\nWilliams reiterated her position on “Misery Business” as recently as 2020, when she called out Spotify for adding “Misery Business” to a playlist of women rock stars.\n\n“I know it’s one of the band’s biggest songs but it shouldn’t be used to promote anything having to do with female empowerment or solidarity,” she wrote on Instagram in 2020.\n\nBut earlier this year, WIlliams seemed to soften her stance on the song, joining Eilish to perform it as a duet at Eilish’s Coachella set in April. And when she sang it live again on Sunday, she told her audiences that she’d reconsidered it herself: “What I’m trying to say – it’s a word,” she said. “You know, we can all learn from ourselves, right?”\n\nSeveral artists have decided to retire certain songs, even hits, due to listener backlash as the songs age: Elvis Costello last year said he’d never sing “Oliver’s Army” again, one of his UK hits, because it contains a racial slur. The Rolling Stones have also stopped performing “Brown Sugar,” which opens with a slave narrative and sexualizes young Black women.\n\nMeanwhile, some artists have bowed to listener demands to update lyrics that some fans considered offensive, a decision that itself isn’t without controversy. Lizzo and Beyoncé both removed the word “spaz” from songs this year after a disability advocates implored them to. In the UK, the term is a slur for people with disabilities, but in the US, particularly in African American Vernacular English, it’s used to describe “going all out” or “being in the zone,” CNN reported earlier this year.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/01/21/farewell-concert-tours-abound-and-goodbye-business-booming/2575769002/", "title": "Farewell concert tours abound, and the goodbye business is booming", "text": "In 1992, Ozzy Osbourne hit the road for his farewell “No More Tours” run.\n\nIn 2019, there’s the sequel, “No More Tours II.”\n\nThat would seem to contradict the whole “farewell” thing, but such is the way with rock ‘n' roll.\n\nIt's become as predictable as the concert encore. Time and again, artists book \"one final tour\" and make a load of cash, only to book another tour a few years later. Cher, LCD Soundsystem, the Who — they've all said goodbye, and they've all stuck around.\n\nOver the past two years, we’ve seen a flurry of farewell tours, more than ever before, from Joan Baez to Lynyrd Skynyrd to Paul Simon to Slayer.\n\nAt least four more of them will be in Milwaukee through July: Bob Seger (Jan. 24 at Fiserv Forum), Elton John (Oct. 19, Fiserv Forum), KISS (March 1, Fiserv Forum) and Osbourne (July 4, the American Family Insurance Amphitheater, during Summerfest).\n\nBut with the artists allegedly bidding goodbye often in their twilight years — and the deaths of music supernovas like David Bowie, Tom Petty and Prince still fresh in our memories — fans are taking these farewell tours seriously, and the tours are making some serious money.\n\n\"These artists are getting older, and they're seeing their friends pass away,\" said Dave Brooks, founder of Amplify, a live-music news site acquired by Billboard last year.\n\nSeger is 73, John is 71, Osbourne is 70, and KISS' Gene Simmons is 69.\n\n\"With the farewell tour,\" Brooks said, \"you can go out on top and make some good money.\"\n\nLast chance to say goodbye\n\nKISS — which is embarking on the second farewell tour of its career — is doing three times the business in Milwaukee compared with the band’s previous Milwaukee show in 2016, said Charlie Goldstone, co-president of FPC Live, the show’s Madison-based concert promoter, and a partner company with Live Nation.\n\nIn 2018, for the start of John's “Farewell Yellow Brick Road” tour that will extend through 2021, the shows grossed on average $2.5 million a night — a 56 percent increase from his previous tour average in 2016, according to data from concert trade magazine Pollstar.\n\n\"There is a sense with a lot of these older bands that, if you don’t see them now, you will not be able to see them again,\" said Steven Hyden, an Appleton native and author of last year's classic rock retrospective \"Twilight of the Gods.\"\n\n\"With Bob Seger and Elton John, artists on the road a long time who tend to come around on a fairly regular basis, billing this as a farewell is a way to motivate people to buy a ticket, and to buy more expensive tickets,\" Hyden said.\n\nJohn concert tickets on average cost $134.81 in 2018, according to Pollstar, up from two years ago when the average ticket cost was $121.22.\n\nIn Milwaukee, KISS tickets are going for $1,000 for the front row. A second row John seat will set you back $1,500.\n\n'The perfect generational mish-mash'\n\nPeople are willing to pay big bucks for an artists' goodbye. But in 2019, with the economy still strong, people are paying a lot for live music, period.\n\nThe top 100 grossing tours worldwide last year made a staggering $5.64 billion, according to Pollstar, just shy of 2017's $5.65 billion tally, when the industry celebrated its sixth consecutive year of record growth.\n\nAnd acts bidding adieu in 2019 can appeal not only to longtime fans and fellow boomers, but to millennials.\n\n\"Right now, we're in the perfect generational mish-mash,\" said Scott Leslie, co-president with Goldstone of FPC Live. \"An 18-year-old who loves KISS says, 'I need to see a KISS concert before they stop touring.' And they're in line with their parents or an uncle who have seen KISS since they were 18 and want to see them one more time, too. That is what is breeding heavy ticket sales.\"\n\nPlay the hits\n\nBesides being easy money, a farewell tour is an easy artistic endeavor with just one key rule: Play the hits.\n\n\"If you're an artist looking at a farewell tour, there's something kind of liberating about it,\" Brooks said. \"You're performing your most popular songs. You don't need to reinvent yourself. You're celebrating your accomplishments.\"\n\nAnd that sort of celebration feeds into something for these aging musicians that may matter more than their bank accounts: their ego.\n\n\"We're talking about people who have already made millions of dollars doing this,\" Leslie said. \"When you get to that point of rare air, how you are remembered really matters. Every performance is a legacy-defining exercise for these guys.\"\n\nNot to mention literal exercise, with the demands of the stage taking their toll, to speak nothing of the touring grind.\n\n\"It's hard to get on the road every night in your twenties and thirties, let alone your sixties and seventies,\" Goldstone said.\n\n\"It's physically hard to tour, and I think these artists don't want to sacrifice their performance.\"\n\nThat's the motivation for KISS calling it quits — again — frontman Paul Stanley told the \"Rolling Stone Music Now\" podcast last fall.\n\n\"It only makes sense because of the nature of what we are,\" Stanley, 66, said. \"We’re not a band of guys in jeans and sneakers, standing on stage, playing. We’re athletes. We’re Superman playing a guitar. So yeah, at some point you look at each other and go, 'How long can we do this the way we want to do it?' … If you’re smart, you plan so that you can make the most of something, rather than just kind of sail off into the sunset. I didn’t want that to happen. … I'd rather take a victory lap.\"\n\n'Father Time doesn't lie'\n\nTaking a victory lap is something Prince didn't get to do. Or Milwaukee native Al Jarreau, who retired from touring just a few days before he died in 2017. Or Neil Diamond, who abruptly retired from the road early last year, and canceled planned 50th-anniversary tour dates, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.\n\n\"Tom Petty died a week or two after the end of the 40th-anniversary tour,\" Hyden said. \"Some musicians feel like, 'I don’t want to die on the road, I need to retire and stop before that happens.'\n\n\"Whether you want to look at farewell tours as cynical marketing or not, Father Time is not a cynical marketer. Father Time does not lie. At some point, he cashes in.\"\n\nIt's why Susan Reinholz, 60 from Whitewater, is seeing Seger in Milwaukee, a rocker she's loved since she was in high school. She's never had a chance to see him live.\n\n\"He's not a spring chicken anymore,\" Reinholz said. \"You don't want to miss out. With (the Eagles') Glenn Frey and Tom Petty, I'm glad I got to see them before they passed. You've got to take advantage when you can.\"\n\nDifferent kind of touring\n\nEven if this is indeed the final run for Seger — who underwent spinal surgery in 2017 — that's not to say all the performers on their farewell tours will be gone forever. Osbourne has said so himself.\n\n\"I'm not retiring from the music business; I'm just not doing world tours anymore,\" he said at a press conference announcing \"No More Tours II\" last year. \"I'll be doing gigs.\"\n\nNot only are farewell tours flourishing, but so are concert residencies, where star artists can avoid the hassles of travel and have audiences come to them.\n\n\"Springsteen on Broadway\" did boffo business for the Boss, grossing $88.3 million in 2018, according to Pollstar. And the idea of the Las Vegas residency has drastically changed in recent years, where even younger pop artists like Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys and Lady Gaga are having great success.\n\n\"There used to be this connotation with Vegas that there were all these old people and it was cheesy productions,\" Hyden said. \"But people of all ages go to Vegas, and the shows are often quite lavish.\"\n\nJohn's done plenty of Vegas residencies, and likely will again when \"Yellow Brick Road\" comes to an end. KISS, undoubtedly, is exploring the same thing.\n\nBut even if their farewell tours are fake-outs and they hit the road again, the fans will no doubt forgive and forget and flock to their shows.\n\n\"People have emotional connections to these artists and they want to hear these songs again and experience the way these songs make them feel again,\" Leslie said. \"I don't think anyone bought a ticket for a farewell tour and asked for a refund when the artist decided to tour again.\"\n\nEditor's Note: On Feb. 13, Elton John's farewell tour stop in Milwaukee was postponed from Feb. 19 to Oct. 19.
