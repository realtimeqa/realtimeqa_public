After more investigation, he has now found five more.\n\nThe additional graves were uncovered after studying historical surveys of Staffordshire and Enville drawn by the prominent 19th-century architect John Chessell Buckler. “We are fortunate Buckler came to make these drawings.

Formed around 1119, the order was tasked with ensuring the safety of pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem, but would take on greater military roles throughout the Crusades of the 12th and 13th centuries.\n\nTheir prominence and wealth would eventually provoke opposition from rival orders. “Falsely accused of blasphemy and blamed for Crusader failures in the Holy Land, the order was destroyed by King Philip IV of France” in 1307, said Britannica.\n\n“The Templars live on in popular culture – from the video game ‘Assassin’s Creed’ to Dan Brown’s ‘The Da Vinci Code’,” said The Washington Post. But author Dan Jones told the paper there is “no credence to the conspiratorial fantasies that have been spun around the Templars over the years. No, they do not guard the Ark of the Covenant or the Holy Grail, and never did. No, a surviving remnant does not protect the identities of the descendants of Jesus and Mary Magdelene. No, the order does not secretly run the world.”\n\nWhat do we know about the graves?\n\nThe reason there are so many Templar graves in a Staffordshire church remains a mystery – although members of the order were believed to have attached themselves to churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary.", "authors": ["The Week Staff"], "publish_date": "2023/08/17"}]}

It’s actually coming from drug use becoming more dangerous,” said study author Joseph Friedman, a researcher studying medicine and medical informatics at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nAdolescent overdose deaths in the United States more than doubled from 2010 to 2021, jumping from 518 to 1,146 deaths annually, according the study, which published in JAMA.\n\nIn 2021, fentanyl was involved in more than 77% of adolescent overdose deaths, the study said. Fentanyl is 50 times more powerful than heroin and is extremely cheap to produce, according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nWith drug use among teens currently at a historic low, researchers said the amount of fentanyl being sold to them in the form of counterfeits of common medications – and the lack of awareness of the risks they face taking these pills – is a big part of the problem, Friedman said.\n\nYoung people are buying what they think are legitimate pills, but actually “they are pressed pills with drugs that were made in the underground market, and they were pressed to look real,” said Sheila Vakharia, deputy director for the Department of Research and Academic Engagement in the Drug Policy Alliance.\n\nVakharia was not involved in the study.\n\nTablets believed to be laced with fentanyl are displayed at the Drug Enforcement Administration Northeast Regional Laboratory in New York in 2019. Don Emmert/AFP/Getty Images\n\nChanging our schools and family conversations\n\nThe focus in reducing teen drug use in the US has been successful, said study author Morgan Godvin, a writer and an advocate for overdose policy.\n\nThe bad news is that big changes need to be made to reduce overdose deaths, she added.\n\nThese aren’t the prescription pills that older generations used (and teens sometimes swiped from their medicine cabinets). Counterfeits are now being made with fentanyl, packaged to look near identical to legitimate medicines and sold on the street to teens who are unaware of the risks they pose, said Godvin.\n\n“We need to update their understanding so that they know that pills are actually becoming the most dangerous thing,” Friedman said.\n\nAnd with varying levels of fentanyl in different pills, both people who are experimenting and those who regularly take the pills often don’t know what they are getting and are at risk, Friedman said.\n\nTo address the rise in deaths, Friedman, Godvin and Vakharia said that schools and families need to focus on educating adolescents on the real risks around drugs, what an overdose looks like, how to access naloxone, which is used to treat overdoses, and how to test drugs for the presence of fentanyl.\n\nHarm reduction is not enabling\n\nSome families of adolescents may be afraid that honest conversations about safe practices to reduce overdose deaths could open the door for their children to begin using, but Godvin said the opposite is true.\n\n“This fear of sending the wrong message about drugs is sending teenagers to their graves,” Godvin said. “(Parents) are so critical as a credible messenger for their own kids or for those in their kid’s peer group.”\n\n“Harm reduction is not enabling them,” she added.\n\nNot all teens will engage in experimentation with substances, but many will. Even with historic low rates of drug use, nearly 20% of teens in 8th, 10th and 12th grades used illicit drugs in 2021, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\nBoth teens who will try drugs and alcohol and those who don’t benefit from having an honest, nuanced understanding of the risks that they pose.\n\nIf a parent says that people who try ecstasy often die immediately, and a child goes to a party where dozens of other teens take the drug and show up at school on Monday, they may lose confidence in the information they get from the trusted authorities in their life, Godvin said.\n\nInstead, they often then turn to peers, the internet and popular media for their information – which can often give dangerous misinformation, she added.\n\nConversations that teach which drugs are risky and which are outright dangerous as well as how to handle drugs safely benefits teens on multiple fronts. They both empower adolescents to make smarter decisions and give kids the message that their families are there for when they have questions part of the problemas well as when they need help, Vakharia said.\n\n“When you give people better options, they make better choices,” Godvin said.", "authors": ["Madeline Holcombe"], "publish_date": "2022/04/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/24/health/covid-19-thanksgiving-bq/index.html", "title": "New subvariants, family gatherings may bring more Covid-19 after ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs millions of Americans travel to gather with friends and family over the next few days, there’s a good chance that Covid-19 will follow.\n\nExperts expect that Thanksgiving gatherings will stir up social networks and give new coronavirus subvariants fresh pockets of vulnerable people to infect. As a result, cases and hospitalizations may tick up after the holiday, as they have for the past two years.\n\nCovid-19 is not unique in this regard. Thanksgiving gatherings have the potential to amp up the spread of other viruses too, notably respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, and influenza, which are both already at high levels for this time of year.\n\n“We have seen, in some regions, RSV numbers starting to trend downward. Flu numbers are still on the rise. And we are concerned that after holiday gathering, lots of people coming together, that we may see increases in Covid-19 cases as well,” Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday on CNN.\n\nBut things have been relatively quiet on the Covid-19 front. Experts say it may not stay that way for long.\n\n“Covid positivity is going up,” said Shishi Luo, associate director of bioinformatics and infectious disease at the genetic testing company Helix, which has been monitoring coronavirus variants. “It’s increasing fastest among 18- to 24-year-olds” in the Helix sampling.\n\nIt’s the first time test positivity in the Helix data has risen since July.\n\nWhen test positivity increases, it means a greater proportion of Covid-19 tests are returning positive results, and it can be an indication that transmission is on the rise.\n\n“We should expect more cases,” Luo said. “Whether they’re measured in how we measure cases right now, I don’t know, but I think in general, you should see more people who are sick. I definitely am.”\n\nIncreasing cases may not be picked up as quickly by official counts because people are mostly testing for Covid-19 at home and not reporting their results – if they test at all.\n\nWill new subvariants drive a wave of cases?\n\nThe BQ subvariants of Omicron have risen to dominate transmission in the US. BQ.1 and its offshoot BQ.1.1 are descendants of BA.5; they have five and six key mutations, respectively, in their spike proteins that help them evade immunity created by vaccines and infections. Because of these changes, they’re growing more quickly than BA.5 did.\n\nFor the week ending Nov. 19, the CDC estimates that BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 were causing about half of all new Covid-19 cases in the US. But so far, they’ve risen to predominance without much impact.\n\nCovid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths have remained flat for the past four weeks. But it’s not gone: On average, more than 300 Americans die and 3,400 people are hospitalized each day with Covid-19, according to CDC data.\n\nNobody knows exactly what will happen with the BQ variants. Many experts say they feel hopeful that we won’t see the big waves of winters past – certainly nothing like the original Omicron variant, with its jaw-dropping peak of nearly a million new daily infections.\n\nThere’s reason for optimism on a number of fronts.\n\nFirst, there’s the experience of other countries like the UK, where BQ.1 has outcompeted its rivals to dominate transmission even as cases, hospitalizations and deaths have fallen. Something similar happened in France and Germany, notes Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\n“Cases went up in France and Germany just before the subvariants came in. Then the subvariants came in, and cases actually dropped,” he said.\n\nBill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, thinks our behavior and our social contacts might be bigger determinants of whether cases will rise this go-round than whatever variant is in the lead.\n\nHe thinks it’s likely that we’ll see a rise in cases that may peak around the second week in January – as it has in years past – but that it won’t have a big effect on hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nAndrew Pekosz, a virologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, says that’s probably because BQ.1’s advantages are incremental, not drastic.\n\n“It’s probably got a bit more of a fitness advantage, so what we’re seeing is gradual replacement without a massive change in the total number of Covid-19 cases,” he said.\n\nAmerica lags in vaccination\n\nAll that’s not to say that BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 won’t have any impact. They’ve shown marked resistance to the antibodies that are available to protect and treat people who are vulnerable to severe Covid-19 infections. From that standpoint, there’s good reason for people to be cautious if they have weakened immune systems or will be around someone who does.\n\nBut these subvariants will land at a time when population immunity is higher than ever, thanks to vaccines and infections. It’s a very different setting than the virus encountered when Omicron emerged a year ago, and that should also help dampen any coming wave, Pekosz says.\n\n“With lots of people now being boosted and vaccinated and with people having some immunity from an Omicron infection, it’s also a very, very different sort of population landscape for a variant to emerge in,” he said. “All the signs are, I think, the best part of the scenario in terms of not seeing these massive increases in cases.”\n\nIf there’s reason to worry about BQ in the US, it could be this: Americans aren’t as well-vaccinated or boosted as other countries. CDC data shows that two-thirds of the population has completed the primary series of the Covid-19 vaccines, and only 11% of those who are eligible have gotten an updated bivalent booster. In the UK, 89% of the population over age 12 has completed their primary series, and 70% have been boosted.\n\nNew research indicates that a country’s vaccination rate matters more than any other single factor when it comes to the effects of variants on a population.\n\nScientists at Los Alamos National Labs recently completed a study delving into what drove the effects of 13 dominant variants of coronavirus as they transitioned from one to another in 213 countries. The study includes data up to the end of September and was published as a preprint ahead of peer review.\n\nAmong 14 variables that influenced the speed and height of new Covid-19 waves, a population’s vaccination rate was by far the most important.\n\nThe number of previous cases in a country, the percentage of people who wore masks, average income and the percentage of the population older than 65 ran a distant second, third, fourth and fifth, respectively.\n\nHow many other variants are in the mix when a new one rises is also an important factor, says senior study author Bette Korber, a laboratory fellow in the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group at Los Alamos.\n\nShe points to the Alpha variant, B.1.1.7, and how it behaved in the UK versus the US.\n\n“When it came through England, it was just extremely fast, but it was much slower in the Americas,” Korber said.\n\nBy the time Alpha reached the United States, we were evolving our own variants out of California and New York “that were very distinctive and had a competitive edge compared to what it had to come up against in England,” Korber said, which probably slowed its roll here.\n\nThe CDC is tracking a soup of more than a dozen Omicron subvariants that are causing cases in the US, and that variety may end up helping dampen any wave over the winter.\n\nBut Korber isn’t making any predictions. She says it’s just too difficult to know what’s going to happen, pointing to Asia as the source of her uncertainty.\n\nAsian countries have been contending with waves driven by the recombinant XBB, a subvariant that really hasn’t had much of a presence in the US. The BQ variants arrived later, but she says they look impressive against XBB, which is also highly immune-evasive.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“BQ is really making a stand there,” Korber said. “So I think it’s not really possible to be certain yet” what could happen in the US.\n\n“To me, it’s a good time, when it’s possible, to wear masks,” she said. Masks protect the wearer as well as others around them. “And get the booster if you’re eligible and it’s the right moment for you,” especially as we gather around the table to feast with our friends and family.\n\n“It’s a time to exercise a little additional caution to prevent that wave that we don’t want to see happening, or at least make it a smaller bump,” Korber said", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/health/covid-variants-concern-new-year/index.html", "title": "2022 ends with looming risk of a new coronavirus variant, health ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs the world enters a new year, many public health and infectious disease experts predict that monitoring for new coronavirus variants will be an increasingly important part of Covid-19 mitigation efforts – and some are turning their attention to a surge in cases in China.\n\nSubvariants of the Omicron coronavirus variant continue to circulate globally, and “we’re seeing Omicron do what viruses do, which is it picks up mutations along the way that helps it evade a little bit of immunity that’s induced by previous infection or vaccination,” said Andrew Pekosz, a microbiologist and immunologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.\n\n“We haven’t seen any major jumps in terms of Omicron evolution in some time,” he said. But “it’s getting to that stage where it’s something that we have to continue to monitor.”\n\nIn the United States, the Omicron subvariants XBB.1.5, BQ.1.1, BQ.1, BA.5 and XBB are causing almost all Covid-19 infections, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFor this week, the CDC estimates that XBB.1.5 now causes 40.5% of cases in the US, followed by BQ.1.1 at 26.9%; BQ.1 at 18.3%; BA.5 at 3.7%; and XBB at 3.6%.\n\n“SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is constantly changing and accumulating mutations in its genetic code over time. New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to continue to emerge,” CDC researchers write in their data tracker. “Some variants will emerge and disappear, while others will emerge and continue to spread and may replace previous variants.”\n\nOmicron’s offshoots appear to dominate globally as well, but as the coronavirus continues to spread – especially in China after Beijing’s rapid easing of restrictions – there is now concern about where Covid-19 trends could be heading in 2023 and the risk of new variants emerging.\n\n“It is a worry,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. “And that, of course, has led to the CDC’s very recent announcement that they are going to oblige people who come to this country from China to be tested and test negative before they can come into the country.”\n\nUS health officials announced Wednesday that, starting January 5, travelers from China will be required to show a negative Covid-19 test result before flying to the country. Passengers traveling to the US from China will need to get tested no more than two days before flying and present proof of the negative test to their airline before boarding.\n\nOfficials also announced that the CDC is expanding the traveler-based Genomic Surveillance Program to airports in Seattle and Los Angeles, bringing the total number of airports participating to seven with about 500 weekly flights from at least 30 countries covered, including about 290 weekly flights from China and surrounding areas.\n\nThe Chinese government has not been sharing a lot of information about the genetic composition of the viruses that it’s seeing there, Schaffner said.\n\n“Because the Chinese government was not doing that, that was the main reason CDC put this new travel requirement in place. It’s certainly not to prevent simple transmission of Covid from China here. We’ve got plenty of Covid. That would be like telling people not to pour a bucket of water into a swimming pool,” he said. “This travel testing requirement is a way to buy us some time and help create somewhat of a buffer between ourselves and China, should a new variant suddenly appear in that country.”\n\nHe added that the US will need “as much time as possible” to update vaccines and antivirals to respond to a potential emerging variant of concern.\n\n‘It really is a bit of a black hole’\n\nThe US testing requirements for travelers will “buy some time,” but they won’t prevent new Covid-19 cases from coming to the United States or new variants from emerging, said Dr. Carlos Del Rio, the executive associate dean for the Emory School of Medicine and Grady Health System in Atlanta.\n\n“I don’t think we’re going to see much benefit, honestly,” he said of the travel requirements. “The most important thing we need right now is, we need the Chinese to have more transparency and tell us exactly what’s going on, and that is pretty much a diplomatic decision. This is about diplomacy.”\n\nIn terms of the genetic data on coronaviruses in China that is accessible to the public, “It really is a bit of a black hole,” Pekosz said. Almost 250 million people in China may have caught Covid-19 in the first 20 days of December, according to an internal estimate from the nation’s top health officials, Bloomberg News and the Financial Times reported last week.\n\n“To me, what’s really a concern is the ongoing infections and whether they’re producing more variants in China that might be of particular concern for us, and testing people before they get on a plane won’t answer that question,” Pekosz said.\n\n“What we really need is to do a much better job of sequencing the viruses from individuals who are traveling from China so that we can aid in terms of understanding what kinds of variants are circulating there,” he said, adding that throughout the pandemic, Chinese officials have not been very transparent about their data on variants.\n\nMore spread, more variants\n\nConstant spread of a virus is what can lead to the emergence of variants. The more a virus spreads, the more it mutates.\n\n“For a variant to emerge – and this is true not only for Covid, but for influenza and for a lot of other viruses – the most critical thing is, the more cases that you have, the more likely that the virus will start to accumulate mutations that might have the ability to evade immunity more effectively or to transmit more effectively,” Pekosz said.\n\n“So when you have a situation like what’s starting to turn out in China, where you’re going to have millions upon millions of infections, every one of those infections is just one additional opportunity for the virus to pick up a random mutation that might make it better at infecting people,” he said. “Combine that with the fact that the Chinese population has been using less-than-optimal vaccines and has apparently not been as good about putting boosters into their population as other countries have, that means that there’s probably a lower amount of immunity in the population.”\n\nHealth authorities in China have “noticeably increased” the number of coronavirus genome sequences and other related data they are submitting to the global database GISAID, an initiative that maintains databases for scientists around the world to share data on flu viruses and coronaviruses.\n\nBut many experts argue that it’s not enough.\n\nGISAID said in an email to CNN on Wednesday that China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and several regional centers in the country, “have noticeably increased the number of submissions of genome sequence and associated metadata from samples taken in recent days.”\n\nThe number of genome sequences from China grew to just shy of 1,000, as of Friday, according to GISAID.\n\nGISAID also confirmed that the sequences from China “all closely resemble known globally circulating variants seen in different parts of the world between July and December 2022,” compared with the 14.4 million genomes in its database.\n\n“These latest data provide a snapshot of the evolution of the Omicron variants and shows that these most recently shared sequences from China are closely related to variants that have been circulating for some time,” according to GISAID.\n\nWhat the future may hold\n\nCovid-19 is in a relatively “stable” state right now in the United States, but the nation still sees about 350 deaths related to the disease each day, said Dr. Jessica Justman, an associate professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and senior technical director of the global health program ICAP.\n\nWhile Covid-19 levels remain far below those of prior surges, trends are on the rise in parts of the US, new hospital admissions have jumped nearly 50% over the past month, and there is growing concern that case numbers could soar after the winter holidays.\n\nTo reduce the risk of increased Covid-19 spread, Justman said, it will be important for people in the new year to continue to stay up-to-date with their Covid-19 vaccinations.\n\nOnly 14.6% of the US population ages 5 and older has gotten their updated booster shot, according to CDC data.\n\n“So where are we going? That does take me to China,” Justman said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“I’m concerned that China right now is one giant incubator of SARS-CoV-2. There is the potential to have so many infections and with that, new variants,” she said.\n\n“I think we’re going to be looking at new variants of concern” in 2023, Justman said. “The question is: Will we go back to a point where we have a variant of concern that causes such severe illness that we don’t get the benefit of our protection from prior infections and from prior vaccinations? … I’m going to be optimistic and say I don’t think we’re going to go back to that point.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/health/why-winter-colds-flu-wellness/index.html", "title": "Why colds and flu viruses are more common in winter | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\n\nCNN —\n\nA chill is in the air, and you all know what that means — it’s time for cold and flu season, when it seems everyone you know is suddenly sneezing, sniffling or worse. It’s almost as if those pesky cold and flu germs whirl in with the first blast of winter weather.\n\nYet germs are present year-round — just think back to your last summer cold. So why do people get more colds, flu and now Covid-19 when it’s chilly outside?\n\nIn what researchers are calling a scientific breakthrough, scientists behind a new study may have found the biological reason we get more respiratory illnesses in winter. It turns out the cold air itself damages the immune response occurring in the nose.\n\n“This is the first time that we have a biologic, molecular explanation regarding one factor of our innate immune response that appears to be limited by colder temperatures,” said rhinologist Dr. Zara Patel, a professor of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine in California. She was not involved in the new study.\n\nIn fact, reducing the temperature inside the nose by as little as 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius) kills nearly 50% of the billions of virus and bacteria-fighting cells in the nostrils, according to the study published Tuesday in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.\n\n“Cold air is associated with increased viral infection because you’ve essentially lost half of your immunity just by that small drop in temperature,” said rhinologist Dr. Benjamin Bleier, director of otolaryngology translational research at Massachusetts Eye and Ear and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\n\n“it’s important to remember that these are in vitro studies, meaning that although it is using human tissue in the lab to study this immune response, it is not a study being carried out inside someone’s actual nose,” Patel said in an email. “Often the findings of in vitro studies are confirmed in vivo, but not always.”\n\nA hornet’s nest\n\nTo understand why this occurs, Bleier and his team and coauthor Mansoor Amiji, who chairs the department of pharmaceutical sciences at Northeastern University in Boston, went on a scientific detective hunt.\n\nA respiratory virus or bacteria invades the nose, the main point of entry into the body. Immediately, the front of the nose detects the germ, well before the back of the nose is aware of the intruder, the team discovered.\n\nAt that point, cells lining the nose immediately begin creating billions of simple copies of themselves called extracellular vesicles, or EV’s.\n\n“EV’s can’t divide like cells can, but they are like little mini versions of cells specifically designed to go and kill these viruses,” Bleier said. “EV’s act as decoys, so now when you inhale a virus, the virus sticks to these decoys instead of sticking to the cells.”\n\nThose “Mini Me’s” are then expelled by the cells into nasal mucus (yes, snot), where they stop invading germs before they can get to their destinations and multiply.\n\n“This is one of, if not the only part of the immune system that leaves your body to go fight the bacteria and viruses before they actually get into your body,” Bleier said.\n\nOnce created and dispersed out into nasal secretions, the billions of EV’s then start to swarm the marauding germs, Bleier said.\n\n“It’s like if you kick a hornet’s nest, what happens? You might see a few hornets flying around, but when you kick it, all of them all fly out of the nest to attack before that animal can get into the nest itself,” he said. “That’s the way the body mops up these inhaled viruses so they can never get into the cell in the first place.”\n\nA big increase in immune power\n\nWhen under attack, the nose increases production of extracellular vesicles by 160%, the study found. There were additional differences: EV’s had many more receptors on their surface than original cells, thus boosting the virus-stopping ability of the billions of extracellular vesicles in the nose.\n\n“Just imagine receptors as little arms that are sticking out, trying to grab on to the viral particles as you breathe them in,” Bleier said. “And we found each vesicle has up to 20 times more receptors on the surface, making them super sticky.”\n\nCells in the body also contain a viral killer called micro RNA, which attack invading germs. Yet EVs in the nose contained 13 times micro RNA sequences than normal cells, the study found.\n\nSo the nose comes to battle armed with some extra superpowers. But what happens to those advantages when cold weather hits?\n\nTo find out, Bleier and his team exposed four study participants to 15 minutes of 40-degree-Fahrenheit (4.4-degree-Celsius) temperatures, and then measured conditions inside their nasal cavities.\n\n“What we found is that when you’re exposed to cold air, the temperature in your nose can drop by as much as 9 degrees Fahrenheit. And that’s enough to essentially knock out all three of those immune advantages that the nose has,” Bleier said.\n\nIn fact, that little bit of coldness in the tip of the nose was enough to take nearly 42% of the extracellular vesicles out of the fight, Bleier said.\n\n“Similarly, you have almost half the amount of those killer micro RNA’s inside each vesicle, and you can have up to a 70% drop in the number of receptors on each vesicle, making them much less sticky,” he said.\n\nWhat does that do to your ability to fight off colds, flu and Covid-19? It cuts your immune system’s ability to fight off respiratory infections by half, Bleier said.\n\nYou don’t have to wear a nose sock\n\nAs it turns out, the pandemic gave us exactly what we need to help fight off chilly air and keep our immunity high, Bleier said.\n\nWearing a mask can protect you from cold air that can reduce your immunity, an expert says. sebra/Adobe Stock\n\n“Not only do masks prrhinologist Dr. Benjamin Bleierotect you from the direct inhalation of viruses, but it’s also like wearing a sweater on your nose,” he said.\n\nPatel agreed: “The warmer you can keep the intranasal environment, the better this innate immune defense mechanism will be able to work. Maybe yet another reason to wear masks!”\n\nIn the future, Bleier expects to see the development of topical nasal medications that build upon this scientific revelation. These new pharmaceuticals will “essentially fool the nose into thinking it has just seen a virus,” he said.\n\n“By having that exposure, you’ll have all these extra hornets flying around in your mucous protecting you,” he added.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/health/early-onset-cancer-increase/index.html", "title": "A global epidemic of cancer among people younger than 50 could ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIana dos Reis Nunes was 43 when she told her husband that she could feel something like a bubble in her abdomen when she lay on her side.\n\nAn ultrasound scan found spots on her liver, which led to blood tests and a colonoscopy.\n\n“There was a tumor the size of your fist, and she had no pain and no problems with bowel movements or anything like that,” recalled Brendan Higgins, her husband, who works as an artist in New York City.\n\nBy the time doctors found it, dos Reis Nunes’ colon cancer had spread. It was stage 4, meaning it had reached other parts of her body.\n\nThe family was blindsided.\n\n“She had had a baby 15 months prior to her diagnosis, so she’d had a million blood tests, you know, care from doctors and sonograms … and there was no indication of anything, nothing whatsoever.”\n\nWhen cancer strikes an adult under the age of 50, doctors call it an early-onset case. These cancers at younger ages are becoming more common.\n\nIana dos Reis Nunes was 43 when she was diagnosed with colon cancer. Brendan Higgins\n\nA new review of cancer registry records from 44 countries found that the incidence of early-onset cancers is rising rapidly for colorectal and 13 other types of cancers, many of which affect the digestive system, and this increase is happening across many middle- and high-income nations.\n\nThe review’s authors say the upswing in younger adults in happening in part because of more sensitive testing for some cancer types, such as thyroid cancer. But testing doesn’t completely account for the trend, says co-author Shuji Ogino, a professor of pathology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nOgino says the spike is due to an unhealthy stew of risk factors that are probably working together, some which are known and others that need to be investigated.\n\nHe notes that many of these risks have established links to cancer like obesity, inactivity, diabetes, alcohol, smoking, environmental pollution and Western diets high in red meat and added sugars, not to mention shift work and lack of sleep.\n\n“And there are many unknown risk factors as well, like a pollutant or like food additives. Nobody knows,” he said.\n\nOgino thinks the fact that so many of these cancers – eight out of 14 studied – involve the digestive system points to a big role for diet and the bacteria that live in our gut, called the microbiome.\n\n“I think this actually is an important piece because what it’s pointing to is changing exposure prevalences at early ages, that are producing earlier-onset cancers,” says Dr. Elizabeth Platz, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who also edits the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, who was not involved in the review.\n\nTake obesity. Once, it was rare. Not only has it become more common to have a dangerously high body mass index, but people are becoming obese earlier in life, even in childhood, so these cancer risks are building decades earlier than they did for previous generations.\n\nAn explosion of colorectal cancer in younger adults\n\nThe surge in early-onset colorectal cancer – the cancer dos Reis Nunes had – has been particularly steep.\n\nOgino’s review found that across the years of the study, the average yearly climb in colorectal cancer in young adults was about 2% in the US, Australia, Canada, France and Japan. In the UK, it’s almost 3% per year in England, Scotland and Wales. In Korea and Ecuador, it is roughly 5% per year.\n\n“It doesn’t seem big, but you can think about inflation: If it’s 2% every year, it’s going to be a big change in 10 years or 20 years, you know?” Ogino said. “It’s not trivial.”\n\nBetween 1988 and 2015, those yearly upticks pushed the rates of early colorectal cancers from nearly 8 per every 100,000 people to almost 13 per 100,000 – a 63% increase, according to another recent review published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nStudies show that about 1 in 10 colorectal cancers in the US is diagnosed in someone who is between the ages of 20 and 50.\n\nThe younger you are, the higher the risk\n\nOgino’s review found something called a cohort effect, meaning the risk of an early-onset cancer has increased for each successive group of people born at a later time. Those born the 1990s have a higher risk of developing an early-onset cancer in their lifetime than those born in the 1980s, for example.\n\nOther malignancies going up in younger Americans include those in the breast, endometrium, gall bladder and bile duct, kidney, pancreas, thyroid, stomach and plasma cells in the blood – a cancer called myeloma.\n\nDr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, calls the review “a call to arms.”\n\nCancer is a serious diagnosis at any age, but when it shows up in younger adults, the tumors are typically more aggressive, and they often go undetected for longer because routine cancer screening isn’t recommended for some of the most common cancer types, such as breast and prostate, until age 50.\n\n“Not only were these early-onset type of cancers more likely to be diagnosed when the tumor is at a more advanced stage, it was also in some of the reports that were tabulated here associated with worse survival outcome,” Knudsen said.\n\n‘Not an old person’s disease anymore’\n\nDos Reis Nunes started treatment in 2017 at Sloan Kettering and Mount Sinai cancer centers in New York.\n\nHer husband remembers the doctors explaining that she was one of a growing number of younger patients they were seeing.\n\n“I recall it being a point of discussion in both hospitals that people getting colon cancer were getting younger and younger, more and more, and they couldn’t explain it,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins says he spent a lot of time in online support groups, looking for answers and comfort.\n\n“And there were a lot of young people in those groups,” he said. “It wasn’t populated by people in their 50s and 60s. It’s like 30s, 40s, 50s. So I was very conscious that this wasn’t an old person’s disease anymore,” he said.\n\nIn fact, routine screening – with colonoscopies and tests that check for blood in stool – has driven down cases of colorectal cancer and made it less fatal in older adults, even as cases have soared in those under 50.\n\nKnudsen says three things should happen in the wake of large, definitive reviews like this one.\n\n“One is a call for research so that we truly do understand some of the specific trends that we are seeing,” she says.\n\nSecond, she wants to see more awareness of the risks, which will hopefully help people modify their behavior to control what risks they can.\n\nThird, she says, groups that make recommendations for cancer screenings should re-evaluate when those screenings should start. It could be that some should start at younger ages.\n\nIn fact, that’s already happening.\n\nLast year, the rising incidence of colon cancer in younger adults prompted the US Preventive Services Task Force to lower the age at which it recommends doctors start screening people for colon cancer to 45.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“If you’re heading to 45, you should really be thinking about this and not waiting until 50 or 55,” Higgins said.\n\nHiggins said his wife’s first 12 months of cancer treatment were almost miraculous, “like remarkable reactions to the chemo.”\n\n“And then – I read about this actually – it can unravel really quickly,” he said. “And once it started unraveling, it just went downhill extremely quickly.”\n\nHis wife died in 2019, leaving behind their daughter, Maeve, who had not yet turned 4, an 11-year-old and a 20-year-old.\n\n“We had a great love story,” he said. “I’m still bitter.

Vaccinating a patient’s close circle of contacts is like vaccinating a “ring” around them.\n\nThis approach has been used in response to sexually transmitted infections and prior monkeypox outbreaks.\n\n“We can have a really effective strategy of containment and elimination by identifying all the cases and then providing the cases with treatment and the close contacts of those cases with post-exposure prophylaxis,” said a federal health adviser who requested anonymity because they’re not a government employee and don’t speak for any federal agency.\n\n“We know that this works,” the adviser said. “We have data from other outbreaks to say that it is effective. And so in the beginning, when cases were low – in the tens, the dozens of cases – we were able to effectively work with jurisdictions to identify those cases and, through consultation, figure out how many doses of vaccines would they need to vaccinate as many contacts as they think existed.”\n\nBut toward late June, the monkeypox outbreak had spread.\n\nThe CDC’s initial strategy “was just doomed to failure,” Murphy said, referencing how a “ring” strategy requires swift and robust outreach to all known contacts of a monkeypox patient – which was becoming increasingly difficult to do as cases were growing, and in more places.\n\n“A ring vaccination strategy was never going to work, frankly,” Murphy said. “I mean, look how fast this virus has spread.”\n\nFederal health officials expanded vaccination efforts to focus on the broader community of men who have sex with men, the demographic that makes up most US monkeypox cases.\n\n“We recognized that a traditional post-exposure prophylaxis strategy was no longer the best strategy for that current moment of the outbreak – and so we shifted, along with the nation,” the federal health adviser said.\n\nAfter initial orders for 72,000 vaccines, 300,000 additional doses were made available. Another nearly 800,000 doses were OK’d this week, and will be available in the coming weeks. But the CDC estimates 1.5 million people are eligible for the two-dose vaccine.\n\nThe CDC’s strategy still directs shots toward people who might have had a monkeypox exposure – not preventing cases among those who might be exposed in the future.\n\nAs of Friday, the US has tallied nearly 5,200 confirmed or probable monkeypox cases. With limited supply and growing awareness of the virus and its painful effects, vaccination appointments are still going fast.\n\nLimitations of the ring strategy\n\nEven though the US response to the monkeypox outbreak has evolved, there are clear reasons why federal health officials would immediately consider a ring vaccination strategy early on.\n\n“That’s the way that we eradicated smallpox from the planet, and it was the way that prior monkeypox outbreaks have been controlled,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nBut Adalja and many other public health experts argue that a broader vaccination response against monkeypox should have been implemented from the beginning, as the ring strategy comes with a limitation: It hinges on robust contact tracing.\n\n“Because of the unique characteristics of this outbreak – the fact that it’s spreading mostly amongst men who have sex with men and has been kind of exploiting anonymous sex parties, raves and the like – it became quickly clear that contact tracing was going to miss a lot of contacts, especially if individual case patients didn’t even know the names of their contacts,” Adalja said.\n\n“It’s not that we don’t have the contact tracers. It’s that the individuals don’t know their contacts,” he said. “The contact trace data was not complete enough to be able to rely solely on ring vaccination.”\n\nFor ring vaccination to work, “there has to be enough vaccine, those in the ring need to be identified and vaccinated, and this has to be done quickly,” Dr. Tom Frieden, former CDC director and president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\n“Because many contacts of cases were from anonymous encounters, this makes ring vaccination much more challenging,” he wrote. “And because monkeypox is spread by intimate contact, identifying those who were close to the patients is much harder than for smallpox, both because of the sensitivity of this information, and because some of the contacts may have been anonymous.”\n\nCDC spokesperson Kristen Nordlund told CNN that “ring vaccination can only be effective if all contacts of a case are identified and vaccinated.”\n\n“As the outbreak went on, it became clear that some of the cases were having anonymous close encounters, which fueled transmission. CDC then expanded our vaccination strategy,” she wrote in an email.\n\nThe federal health adviser said this is not unique to monkeypox.\n\n“Ring vaccination requires identification of cases and identification of contacts, and that is challenging no matter what disease it is. It’s challenging for Covid; it’s challenging for HIV; it’s challenging for syphilis,” the adviser said. “And so just because it’s challenging doesn’t mean we didn’t want to pursue this strategy.”\n\n‘We went against CDC’\n\nSome local health officials saw the writing on the wall early in the outbreak and never implemented a ring vaccination of just close contacts. Instead, vaccines have been offered to a broader group of higher-risk people from the beginning.\n\nIn the nation’s capital, the DC Department of Health has been closely tracking the spread of monkeypox virus since the spring, watching anxiously as cases emerged in regions of the world where the virus typically is not seen.\n\nWhen the first US case was reported in Massachusetts, DC health officials organized a team that was trained in identifying monkeypox and how it spreads. Around that time, the city also ordered vaccines.\n\n“I was one of the first to order vaccines from CDC, before we had a case,” said Anil Mangla, state epidemiologist for the DC Department of Health. The first potential monkeypox case in DC was reported in early June.\n\nAfter DC’s vaccine order arrived, shots were offered in late June in two rings. Ring one included the close contacts of cases identified by the epidemiology team. Ring two included any adult resident who was gay or bisexual with multiple anonymous partners in the previous two weeks or who was a transgender woman or nonbinary who has sex with men or sex workers or staff at establishments where sexual activity occurs.\n\nAmong the close contacts, “we actually have vaccinated 246 people in that first ring,” Mangla said Wednesday. “When I broaden that net, we have vaccinated – as of last night – 6,628.”\n\nHe added that if DC just focused on vaccinating the close contacts in ring one, those thousands of people who voluntarily got immunized in ring two would have received the vaccine much later during the outbreak.\n\n“We went against CDC,” Mangla said of the district’s broad two-ring vaccination approach, adding that the CDC is now working on projects with the DC Department of Health to better understand this outbreak response model.\n\nHowever, the monkeypox vaccine supply has not met the growing demand in DC – or in most regions across the country.\n\n“It’s very clear with the spread of this that there now has to be a balance between vaccines available for those who clearly have been exposed, as well as those at risk,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN this week. “What you want to do is a balance between vaccinating those who clearly have had an exposure, but go well beyond that.”\n\nThe public health community “is recognizing the tension between our desires and limited supply,” the federal health adviser said.\n\nWith limited supply, cities prioritize first doses\n\nOn Monday, the DC Department of Health announced that due to the “very limited” supply of vaccines, only first doses will be provided to high-risk residents, even though Jynneos is a two-dose vaccine. Second doses will be provided at a later time.\n\n“This decision is based on the available scientific evidence, the acceleration of the outbreak, the demand for vaccine from the high number of eligible people, and extreme shortages of the JYNNEOS Monkeypox vaccine nationally,” the announcement said. “DC Health is confident that additional vaccine doses will be available when needed for those who have received their first dose.”\n\nIn New York City, which also expanded eligibility for the monkeypox vaccine to any adult in a high-risk group, first doses have been prioritized.\n\n“New York City is the epicenter of the monkeypox outbreak in the U.S. and yet does not have sufficient vaccine supply,” the city announced in mid-July. “Given the rapid increase in cases, the Health Department has decided that providing first doses to offer protection to more at-risk New Yorkers is the best strategy until we receive adequate vaccine supply. This single dose strategy is consistent with the monkeypox vaccine distribution strategy taken in the UK and Canada.”\n\nChicago also is prioritizing first doses of vaccine.\n\nThe city announced that it is prioritizing doses for all known close contacts of monkeypox cases as part of a ring strategy, while offering vaccine to those who are gay, bisexual or trans men who have sex men and have had sexual contact with multiple partners, in a social or sexual venue or by giving or receiving money in exchange for sex.\n\nThese vaccines are being offered through doctors’ offices and clinics as well as pop-up events at venues, such as bathhouses and Pride events, according to the city’s announcement.\n\n“The goal is address equity along with maximizing doses administered,” Massimo Pacilli, the Chicago Public Health Department’s deputy commissioner of disease control, wrote in an email.\n\nMeanwhile, in a state that does not have many monkeypox cases or vaccines, the Connecticut Department of Public Health announced Thursday that it will launch a program to administer doses of vaccine starting Monday to any adult resident who is gay, bisexual, a man who has sex with men, transgender, gender nonconforming, or gender nonbinary and has had multiple or anonymous sex partners in the past 14 days. Connecticut has 28 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases.\n\n“This is a national model that has been developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and it is consistent with our neighboring jurisdictions,” Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani said. “DPH is partnering with 15 community-based clinics to expand the availability and efficient delivery of the vaccine to those who need it the most.”\n\nA ‘rapidly closing’ window\n\nStill, questions remain around where the nation’s fight against monkeypox is heading.\n\n“It’s not clear that monkeypox can be contained at this point, but it’s certainly worth trying,” said Frieden, the former CDC director.\n\nFederal health officials remain optimistic that the nation can end the outbreak.\n\n“To the question, can we not only stay ahead of this virus but end this outbreak? Absolutely,” Becerra said Thursday.\n\n“We believe that we have done everything we can at the federal level to work with our state and local partners and communities affected to make sure we can stay ahead of this and end this outbreak, but everybody’s got to take the oar and row. Everybody’s got to do their part.”\n\nLawrence Gostin, faculty director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University, said “the window for containing monkeypox is rapidly closing.”\n\n“I do think it’s still possible to contain, but it’s also equally possible that this may become endemic in the United States,” he said.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nEndemic means a disease has a constant presence in a population but is not affecting an alarmingly large number of people, as typically seen in a pandemic. As part of the current outbreak, the United States now has the highest case count of monkeypox among nonendemic countries.\n\nTo contain the monkeypox virus, Gostin called for the United States to declare a national public health emergency, raise awareness about the virus in non-stigmatizing ways and, of course, make more vaccine doses available.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared the monkeypox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern last week. On the national level, HHS has yet to make such a determination.\n\n“We continue to monitor the response throughout the country on monkeypox,” Becerra said Thursday. “We will weigh the decision on declaring a public health emergency based on the response we’re seeing throughout the country.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/health/dementia-ultraprocessed-food-wellness/index.html", "title": "Ultraprocessed food may contribute to dementia, study says | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Eat, But Better: Mediterranean Style.

Besides, they are just darn tasty — who isn’t susceptible to hot dogs, sausages, burgers, french fries, sodas, cookies, cakes, candy, doughnuts and ice cream, to name just a few?\n\nIf more than 20% of your daily calorie intake is ultraprocessed foods, however, you may be raising your risk for cognitive decline, a new study found.\n\nThat amount would equal about 400 calories a day in a 2,000-calories-a-day diet. For comparison, a small order of fries and regular cheeseburger from McDonald’s contains a total of 530 calories.\n\nThe part of the brain involved in executive functioning — the ability to process information and make decisions — is especially hard hit, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Neurology.\n\nMen and women in the study who ate the most ultraprocessed foods had a 25% faster rate of executive function decline and a 28% faster rate of overall cognitive impairment compared with those who ate the least amount of overly processed food.\n\n“While this is a study of association, not designed to prove cause and effect, there are a number or elements to fortify the proposition that some acceleration in cognitive decay may be attributed to ultraprocessed foods,” said Dr. David Katz, a specialist in preventive and lifestyle medicine and nutrition, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“The sample size is substantial, and the follow-up extensive. While short of proof, this is robust enough that we should conclude ultraprocessed foods are probably bad for our brains.”\n\nThere was an interesting twist, however. If the quality of the overall diet was high — meaning the person also ate a lot of unprocessed, whole fruits and veggies, whole grains and healthy sources of protein — the association between ultraprocessed foods and cognitive decline disappeared, Katz said.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods drag diet quality down, and thus their concentration in the diet is an indicator of poor diet quality in most cases,” Katz said. “Atypical as it seems, apparently some of the participants managed it. And when diet quality was high, the observed association between ultraprocessed foods and brain function abated.”\n\nUltraprocessed foods, like burgers and fries, could raise your risk for cognitive decline if it's more than 20% of your daily calorie intake, a new study found. d3sign/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nA lot of ultraprocessed foods\n\nThe study followed over 10,000 Brazilians for up to 10 years. Just over half of the study participants were women, White or college educated, while the average age was 51.\n\nCognitive testing, which included immediate and delayed word recall, word recognition and verbal fluency, was performed at the beginning and end of the study, and participants were asked about their diet.\n\n“In Brazil, ultraprocessed foods make up 25% to 30% of total calorie intake. We have McDonald’s, Burger King, and we eat a lot of chocolate and white bread. It’s not very different, unfortunately, from many other Western countries,” coauthor Dr. Claudia Suemoto, an assistant professor in the division of geriatrics at the University of São Paulo Medical School, told CNN when the study abstract was released in August.\n\n“Fifty-eight percent of the calories consumed by United States citizens, 56.8% of the calories consumed by British citizens, and 48% of the calories consumed by Canadians come from ultraprocessed foods,” Suemoto said.\n\nUltraprocessed foods are defined as “industrial formulations of food substances (oils, fats, sugars, starch, and protein isolates) that contain little or no whole foods and typically include flavorings, colorings, emulsifiers, and other cosmetic additives,” according to the study.\n\nThose in the study who ate the most ultraprocessed foods were “more likely to be younger, women, White, had higher education and income, and were more likely to have never smoked, and less likely to be current alcohol consumers,” the study found.\n\nIt’s not just the brain\n\nIn addition to the impact on cognition, ultraprocessed foods are already known to raise the risk of obesity, heart and circulation problems, diabetes, cancer and a shorter life span.\n\n“Ultraprocessed foods in general are bad for every part of us,” said Katz, president and founder of the nonprofit True Health Initiative, a global coalition of experts dedicated to evidence-based lifestyle medicine.\n\nUltaprocessed foods are usually high in sugar, salt and fat, all of which promote inflammation throughout the body, which is “perhaps the most major threat to healthy aging in the body and brain,” said Dr. Rudy Tanzi, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and director of the genetics and aging research unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Meanwhile, since they are convenient as a quick meal, they also replace eating food that is high in plant fiber that is important for maintaining the health and balance of the trillions of bacteria in your gut microbiome,” Tanzi added, “which is particularly important for brain health and reducing risk of age-related brain diseases like Alzheimer’s disease.”\n\nWhat to do\n\nHow can you keep this from happening to you? If you include ultraprocessed foods in your diet, try to counter these by also eating high-quality, whole foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n\n“The conclusion suggested here is that ultraprocessed foods are, indeed, an important ‘ingredient,’ but the exposure that should be the focus of public health efforts is overall diet quality,” Katz said.\n\nOne easy way to ensure diet quality is to cook and prepare your food from scratch, Suemoto said.\n\n“We say we don’t have time, but it really doesn’t take that much time,” Suemoto said.\n\n“And it’s worth it because you’re going to protect your heart and guard your brain from dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.

The U.K. variant has several mutations that affect the \"spike protein\" on the virus surface that attaches to human cells.\n\n\"It’s able to bind to the receptors on cells better, and therefore is transmitted better,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said at the end of December.\n\nIs the new strain more lethal?\n\nThere is no evidence that B.1.1.7 causes more severe illness or increased risk of death, according to the CDC.\n\nIs the vaccine effective for the new variant?\n\nResearchers believe current COVID-19 vaccines will likely protect against B.1.1.7, but data is needed. The virus would \"likely need to accumulate multiple mutations in the spike protein to evade immunity induced by vaccines or by natural infection,\" according to the CDC.\n\n\"From what we know from experience with this mutation and other mutations, it's unlikely to have a large impact on vaccine-induced immunity, or existing immunity from previous strains,\" said Dr. Greg Armstrong, director of the CDC's Office of Advanced Molecular Detection. Armstrong said it is unclear how the variant may respond to COVID-19 treatments, such as monoclonal antibody treatments.\n\nHow long has the variant been in the US?\n\nResearches first identified the B.1.1.7 variant in the U.S. in Colorado on Dec. 28 in a COVID-19 patient with no reported travel history, suggesting that the virus was spreading from person to person in the community. It's unclear how widespread the variant has become, experts say.\n\nThe U.S. has sequenced viruses from only about 51,000 U.S. cases, according to the CDC. The nation now has more than 20 million confirmed coronavirus cases. \"Given the small fraction of U.S. infections that have been sequenced, the variant could already be in the United States without having been detected,\" the CDC said last month.\n\nThe CDC said it plans to launch a national strain surveillance program this month that requires each state to submit at least 10 samples biweekly for sequencing.\n\n\"The new strain is estimated to represent about 1% of all infections (in the U.S.) at this moment but because of its increased contagiousness, the best estimates are that it will become a majority of all new infections by March,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health, wrote in a blog post Tuesday.\n\nWhere has the new strain been detected?\n\nThe B.1.1.7 strain has been identified in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas, and public health experts expect it to be identified in more states in the coming days.\n\nColorado identified the first known case of the variant in the U.S. on Dec. 28 and was investigating a second possible case – both in National Guard soldiers who were deployed to support staffing at a nursing home in Simla, outside Denver, state health officials said.\n\nCalifornia identified the second confirmed U.S. case on Dec. 30 in a 30-year-old San Diego County man with no travel history. Less than a week later, the county reported 32 cases of the new strain have been detected.\n\nFlorida reported its first case Dec. 31 in a Martin County man in his 20s with no travel history.\n\nNew York reported its first case on Jan. 4, a man in his 60s who is associated with a jewelry store in Saratoga Springs, north of Albany.\n\nGeorgia reported its first case on Jan. 5, an 18-year-old man with no travel history.\n\nConnecticut reported its initial cases on Jan. 7: Two people, described as between ages 15 and 25, both from New Haven County. Each had traveled recently outside the state, one to Ireland and one to New York state.\n\nThe first case in Texas, a Harris County man between 30 and 40 years old with no travel history, was reported on Jan. 7.\n\nPennsylvania identified its first case on Jan. 7 in Dauphin County, a person who tested positive after known international exposure.\n\nThe strain has been detected in at least 33 countries, including Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, The Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nSouth Africa has also identified a strain similar to B.1.1.7, but it emerged in October independently of B.1.1.7 and is not related to it, according to the CDC. Like B.1.1.7, the South Africa variant (B.1.351) appears to spread more easily and quickly but is not more severe. U.S. health officials said last week they did not know if the South Africa strain was also circulating in the U.S.\n\nA third variant also emerged this fall and has been detected in Nigeria, but there is no evidence that it is more severe or more transmissible, according to the CDC.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/12/health/walking-cancer-heart-early-death-wellness/index.html", "title": "Walking can lower risk of early death, but there's more to it than ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide up will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts.\n\nCNN —\n\nTaking 8,600 steps a day will prevent weight gain in adults, while already overweight adults can halve their odds of becoming obese by adding an additional 2,400 steps — that’s 11,000 steps a day, according to an October 2022 study.\n\nThis research echoes results from a recent study in Spain in which researchers found health benefits rose with every step until about 10,000 steps, when the effects began to fade. Counting steps may be especially important for people who do unstructured, unplanned physical activity such as housework, gardening and walking dogs.\n\n“Notably, we detected an association between incidental steps (steps taken to go about daily life) and a lower risk of both cancer and heart disease,” study coauthor Borja del Pozo Cruz told CNN in an earlier interview. Del Pozo Cruz is an adjunct associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense and senior researcher in health sciences for the University of Cadiz in Spain.\n\n“By and large, I think the study is well done and it certainly continues to add to the foundation of knowledge that tells us exercise is good stuff,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado. He was not involved in the research.\n\n“Physical activity is just absolutely magnificent,” Freeman said. “And when if you blend that with eating a more plant-based diet, de-stressing, sleeping enough and connecting with others – that’s your magic recipe. It’s the fountain of youth, if you will.”\n\nWalking helps dementia too\n\nThe same research team also published a similar study in September 2022 that found walking 10,000 steps a day lowered the risk for dementia by 50%; the risk decreased by 25% with as few as 3,800 steps a day.\n\nHowever, if walking occurred at a brisk pace of 112 steps a minute for 30 minutes, it maximized risk reduction, leading to a 62% reduction in dementia risk. The 30 minutes of fast-paced walking didn’t have to occur all at once either — it could be spread out over the day.\n\n“Our take is that intensity of stepping matters – over and above volume,” said del Pozo Cruz via email.\n\nThe new study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, followed 78,500 people between the ages of 40 and 79 from England, Scotland and Wales who wore wrist step counters for 24 hours a day over a seven day stretch.\n\nAfter counting each person’s total number of steps each day, researchers placed them into two categories: Fewer than 40 steps per minute – which is more of an amble, like when you’re walking from room to room – and more than 40 steps per minute, or so-called “purposeful” walking.\n\nA third category was created for peak performers – those who took the most steps per minute within 30 minutes over the course of a day (although, again, those 30 minutes did not have to occur in sequence).\n\nAbout seven years later, researchers compared that data to medical records and found people who took the most steps per minute – in this case, approximately 80 steps per minute – showed the biggest reduction in risk for cancer, heart disease and early death from any cause.\n\nResearchers found the association between peak 30-minute steps and risk reduction to be dependent on the disease studied: There was a 62% reduction for dementia, an 80% decline for cardiovascular disease and death, and about a 20% drop in risk for cancer.\n\n“We observed a 62% reduction for dementia: This figure was almost 80% for CVD mortality and incidence and much less (approx. 20%) for cancer,” del Pozo Cruz said via email.\n\n“This may be related with specific pathways by which physical activity is beneficial,” he said. “It pushes the body in general: can generate more muscle, a bigger heart and a better fitness, all of which are known protective factors for cardiovascular disease and cancer, and other health issues too.”\n\nGet breathless\n\nWhat’s the takeaway? You don’t have to fixate on the numbers of steps (unless you really want to), Freeman said.\n\n“Does every step count? Absolutely. And we know that brisk walking each day brings on extra benefits in terms of blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular training and so forth,” said Freeman, who was the founding chair of the American College of Cardiology’s Nutrition & Lifestyle workgroup.\n\nA major limitation of all studies using step trackers is that people who wear them tend to be more active and healthier than the norm, the researchers said. “Yet the fact that we were able to detect robust associations between steps and incident disease in this active sample suggests even stronger associations may exist in a more sedentary population,” they said.\n\nWhat is breathlessness as it applies to exercise? It’s not gasping and panting so hard you can barely breathe. Instead, breathlessness is when you are walking with someone, they talk to you, and you have a bit of trouble talking back, Freeman said.\n\n“Spend 30 minutes being breathless at whatever pace you’re at, and then keep challenging yourself to be slightly unsatisfied at your current level so you can get better and better,” Freeman said.\n\nBeing more physically active often jumpstarts other healthy habits, such as an improved diet, and discourages unhealthy ones, such as smoking, he added.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}]}

In fact, Ford said in his younger days, he might have made friends with the new species named after him.\n\n“The snake’s got eyes you can drown in, and he spends most of the day sunning himself by a pool of dirty water — we probably would’ve been friends in the early ‘60s,” Ford said, in a statement to Conservation International.\n\nThe new species, named Tachymenoides harrisonfordi after the actor, was discovered in the Andes mountains in Peru, according to a statement by Conservation International. Details about the snake, its discovery and its naming were published in the scientific journal Salamandra.\n\nResearchers from Peru and the U.S. discovered the reptile – one male snake – in May 2022, sun-basking in a swamp within the Otishi National Park area in Peru’s Andes, said Conservation International.\n\nThe newly named species is a type of slender snake measuring 16 inches long when fully grown. It is pale yellowish-brown and has black blotches scattered on its skin, a black belly, and a vertical streak over its copper-colored eye, allowing it to camouflage itself in its surroundings. It feeds on a diet of lizards and frogs.\n\nWhy was the snake named after Ford?\n\nResearchers said they named the new species after Ford in recognition of his decades-long environmental advocacy through his role as the vice chair of Conservation International and for raising his voice for nature.\n\n'Humbled by the honor'\n\n“These scientists keep naming critters after me, but it’s always the ones that terrify children,\" said Ford, 81, in a statement. \"I don’t understand. I spend my free time cross-stitching. I sing lullabies to my basil plants, so they won’t fear the night.\"\n\nThis is the third animal species to be named after Ford. Earlier, an ant (Pheidole harrisonfordi) and a spider (Calponia harrisonfordi) were named after him. The slender snake is his first reptile namesake.\n\nHowever, he was humbled by the honor, saying that the discovery is a reminder that there is so much more to learn about the world and that humans are just a small part of an \"impossibly vast biosphere\".\n\n\"On this planet, all fates are intertwined, and right now, one million species are teetering on the edge of oblivion. We have an existential mandate to mend our broken relationship with nature and protect the places that sustain life,\" he added.\n\nMore:What is the most venomous snake in the world? Meet the inland taipan (if you dare).\n\nDangerous expedition\n\nThe area where the snake was discovered is one of Peru's least explored because of its remote and high location in the Andes. The park is accessible largely by helicopter only, and illegal trade across the region makes scientific expeditions more difficult.\n\nLead researcher, Edgar Lehr, a professor of biology at Illinois Wesleyan University, told Conservation International that he and his team almost had a run-in with drug cartels in the area dubbed \"Peru's cocaine valley,\" where the snake was discovered, because of which they also decided to end their trip a week earlier.\n\nHowever, it was all worth it because the team is “honored” that Ford accepted the snake’s new name.\n\nLehr hopes the new snake and the hype around its namesake \"will create awareness about the importance of biological fieldwork that intends to discover the unknown – often an adventurous and expensive process requiring more financial support from funding agencies.”\n\nMore:It's not just Burmese pythons in Florida: Green anacondas may be breeding in state\n\nManager of the Conservation International-IUCN Biodiversity Assessment Unit, Neil Cox said that the reptiles are an important part of the ecosystem.\n\n“Too often, reptile conservation can be overlooked – most people likely don’t find snakes as cute as a fluffy panda cub, but their role in the world’s ecosystems is just as important,” said Cox. “This discovery helps us better understand how snake species exist and survive in the world, and I hope that its fun name will help draw attention to the threat of extinction facing reptiles globally.”\n\nCox, who authored the 2022 Global Reptile Assessment, found that 21% of all reptile species are threatened with extinction.\n\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

A \"timeless hero of the silver screen,\" it is, in fact, his heroic devotion to the planet that has earned him the 2018 Jane Alexander Global Wildlife Ambassador Award.\n\nThis award — created by the Indy Prize in honor of Tony and Emmy-winning actor and conservation advocate Jane Alexander — recognizes individuals who have been \"effective, credible and consistent voices for wildlife.\"\n\nFord's selection was announced today by the Indianapolis Zoo. The actor, also known for his role as Han Solo in Star Wars, has spent countless hours both in the field and in boardrooms fighting for conservation.\n\nTalk to IndyStar's environmental reporters: Join us on Facebook.\n\n\"Harrison Ford is among today's most credible conservationists,\" said Michael Crowther, CEO of the Indianapolis Zoological Society, Inc., which administers the award. \"And [he] is widely respected by the professional and academic conservation communities.\"\n\nThe actor has been part of Conservation International, a nonprofit environmental organization, for more than 25 years. Serving on its executive committee, he has helped with the group's growth and direction. Ford also serves on the board for CI's Global Conservation Fund that has worked to protect more than 40 million acres across three continents.\n\nHis work has also taken him out of suits and into hiking boots.\n\nFord traveled to Indonesia to better understand the challenges of deforestation, taking viewers along with him in Showtime's Years of Living Dangerously documentary television series.

He points out that the computer-generated Buck (played by motion-capture actor Terry Notary) actually matches the breed in London's novel. \"Dogs were of such value to those who were pursuing Klondike gold because there wasn't another way of getting around. They needed strong, trainable dogs.\"\n\nBuff Harrison Ford's chest needed no digital help: About that 'Call of the Wild' shirtless scene\n\nOur review: Grizzled Harrison Ford works but the digital dogs don't in 'The Call of the Wild'\n\nDirector Chris Sanders says it's clear how widespread the husky misconception is every time he posts a picture of his new Buck on Instagram.\n\n\"People either say, 'Good, that's how the dog was described in the book' or (they're) completely confused and upset. They're like, 'It's supposed to be a husky!' \" says Sanders. \"My wife is quick to point out, 'If you look at the book, it's actually not a husky.' \"\n\nBefore he's stolen from his comfortable, Santa Clara Valley home and sold into the dangerous life of a sled dog, Buck is described by London as a powerful mix – the son of Elmo, a huge St. Bernard, and mom Shep, a Scotch shepherd. Later, London explains that Buck, who breaks free, succeeds in the wild because of his size (140 pounds) and his keen intelligence.\n\nLondon was inspired by a St. Bernard-shepherd mix owned by his friends Marshall Latham Bond and his brother Louis Whitford Bond, later writing, \"Yes, Buck is based on your dog.\"\n\n\"When you look at the films, they are not always actual representations of the Jack London story,\" says Tjiska Van Wyk, executive director for the management group running the Jack London Historic State Park in Glen Ellen, California.\n\nIn real life, the Klondike work dog breeds were varied, with Julian, a mighty yellow mastiff, being one of the most heroic and famous, says Jonathan Hubbell, a park ranger at Seattle's Gold Rush National Historical Park.\n\n\"But this movie Buck is more true to the book than others,\" says Hubbell.\n\nThe first film, a 1935 version starring Clark Gable as Thornton, featured Buck as a vicious St. Bernard mix. Sanders wanted to make a faithful version of the novel, with Buck at the center. He began with a CG version of a similar breed, a Bernese mountain dog.\n\nBut during filming last year, the director's wife, Jessica Steele-Sanders, scoured Petfinder for a household pet and found a St. Bernard and shepherd mix in Kansas – named, appropriately, Buckley.\n\n\"She drove to Kansas, paid $25 and then drove back to set,\" says Sanders. \"Everybody took one look at him and said, ‘Let's make that the dog.’ It was almost exact. The way his face looked, the way his eyes looked. Everything.\"\n\nThe filmmakers had a star that could make appearances on the set and at premieres. The Sanders family even formally shortened their new pet's name to match the book's hero.\n\nTelling the story with a computer-generated dog allowed \"Call of the Wild\" to be told from Buck's point of view.\n\n\"We wanted to tell 'Call of the Wild' as it was written, with Buck as the protagonist,\" says screenwriter Michael Green. \"Other films have told a version of John Thorton’s story with a dog at his side.

Liz Cheney is a villain on Fox today.\n\n“The voters are saying they’ve had enough – and that it’s time to bury the tragic Bush-Cheney era once and for all,” Fox’s 10 p.m. host Laura Ingraham said Tuesday night, around the same time Cheney conceded to Harriet Hageman in the GOP primary in Wyoming.\n\nCheney was a punching bag and punchline all across GOP-aligned media as the primary results came in. Many right-wing commentators repeated the same points they had made for months: That Cheney’s condemnation of former president Donald Trump and her collaboration with Democrats on the House select committee investigating January 6 made her an enemy.\n\nOn Fox, the tone was quite personal and bitter, and an extraordinary turn for a network that once celebrated the Cheney family dynasty. Back in 2012, Liz Cheney was even a paid Fox commentator. And when she left the network in 2013 to run for Senate in Wyoming, Sean Hannity endorsed her.\n\nBut she crossed Trump, and thus Fox’s biggest stars. On Tuesday night Tucker Carlson mocked her public stance in defense of democracy, which stemmed from Trump’s 2020 plot to overturn the election result, and derided media outlets that have taken her seriously. He predicted that she will soon “be writing a column for National Review and will be releasing a book from Simon and Schuster called ‘Democracy.’”\n\nOne hour later, Hannity opened his show by calling Cheney “the most obsessive Trump hater in the country.” He pooh-poohed talk of a potential Cheney presidential run, saying that “if she can’t win Wyoming, she’s not going to win any other red state that I can think of.”\n\nIn the 10 p.m. hour, Ingraham’s program showed about five minutes of Cheney’s concession speech, then cut away to guests who ridiculed Cheney. CNN and MSNBC aired the speech in full.\n\nFox’s coverage did include Cheney telling supporters that she could have easily won the primary – “the path was clear” – but “it would’ve required that I go along with President Trump’s lie about the 2020 election. It would’ve required that I enable his ongoing efforts to unravel our democratic system and attack the foundations of our republic. That was a path I could not and would not take.”\n\nNewsmax did not show any of Cheney’s speech. Instead, 10 p.m. host celebrated the fact that “Liz Cheney is gone.”\n\nNumerous right-wing commentators portrayed Hageman’s win and Cheney’s loss as a perfect example of democracy in action, implying that it undermines Cheney’s warnings about threats to democracy.\n\nBut unlike Trump, Cheney didn’t deny that she lost the race, or encourage people to believe she won, or incite supporters to block Hageman’s victory from being certified.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter.

Tyson Steele, 30, was picked up Thursday in what appeared to be good health at his remote homestead 20 miles outside Skwentna, troopers said in a dispatch. A mid-December fire had killed his dog and left Steele with no means of communication, Steele told troopers. After his family members and friends hadn’t heard from him for several weeks, they requested a welfare check. The trooper helicopter crew reached the homestead about 11 a.m. and saw Steele waving his arms near the makeshift shelter. Skwentna, with a population of 35, is 70 miles northwest of Anchorage.

Hamill tweeted that it felt “totally unexpected & positively surreal” to get back the record he hadn’t seen since the early 1990s. He commended the store for being honest and not selling it. Williams had written on the vinyl’s sleeve: “Dear Mark Hamill, May the force always be with us.” The record was one of numerous “Star Wars” items brought in by a woman after her father’s death in 2018. Micheil Salmons, the store’s general manager, said Hamill signed a DVD of “Star Wars: A New Hope” and two medals that are replicas of those given to his character and Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, in the film.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Republican governor on Monday defended his decision to continue accepting new refugees, challenging skeptical GOP lawmakers to avoid creating “fear” about welcoming people from other countries. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told a legislative committee that fewer than 50 refugees will likely be resettled in Washington County in northwestern Arkansas under his decision. Arkansas is among 42 states that have said they will continue to accept refugees since the Trump administration issued an order in September that gave state and local governments the authority to refuse to accept them for the first time in history. “Each of you are leaders in your community. You’ve got a choice to make: You can create fear, or you can help resolve fear,” Hutchinson told lawmakers. He introduced them to two refugees from Congo and another from Afghanistan who have resettled to Arkansas in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Diego: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed adding a California butterfly to the list of threatened species, officials say. The agency wants the Hermes copper butterfly added to the list in recognition of the threats it faces in its home region of San Diego County, The San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The service filed its proposal Jan. 8, estimating it will take a year to finalize the listing and draw up critical habitat plans for the butterfly. A public comment period for the listing is expected to run through March 9. The Hermes copper lives only in Mexico’s Baja California and California’s San Diego County, which has a high concentration of endangered species, federal wildlife officials say. The butterfly is among a suite of local species suffering from urban sprawl and wildfires that have altered the landscape in recent decades, officials say.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The state Department of Public Safety announced Monday that it will scale back “proactive” investigation of mysterious drone sightings that have perplexed residents since late last year. The department has confirmed no incidents of criminal activity, and investigations have not substantiated reports of suspicious or illegal drone activity, according to a report released Monday. Beginning before the holidays, the drones – which were initially spotted traveling in grid-like formations – were reported to be seen flying at high altitudes from about 7 to 10 p.m. in northeastern Colorado, as well as in southwestern Nebraska, according to the Denver Post. The FAA, 25 other government agencies and private companies, including Amazon, claimed to know nothing about the initial sightings in northeastern Colorado, according to a list compiled by 9News.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The city planned to mark the birthdate of the nation’s most famous traitor, Benedict Arnold, by turning off the Christmas lights at City Hall on Tuesday. Regan Miner, the executive director of the Norwich Historical Society, said the event serves as a “tongue-in-cheek way” to mark the 279th anniversary of Arnold’s birth. Danye Rugh was to deliver a lecture after the lights were turned out, accompanied by period-themed cocktails and food. The son of Norwich was born in 1741 and fought for the Continental Army before wounding his leg in the Battle of Saratoga. The region handles Arnold’s legacy in different ways. In New London, Arnold’s body is burned in effigy, and a replica of his leg is placed in a coffin and sent to Norwich.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The First State’s roads are still some of the nation’s most deadly. After some improvement a year ago, the state’s number of traffic deaths grew from 111 in 2018 to 132 last year, a rise of about 19%, according to the Office of Highway Safety. The number of pedestrian deaths rose from 24 to 30, returning Delaware to among the nation’s leaders. “There’s no silver bullet to solve this,” says John McNeal, chairman of the state’s Pedestrian Council. Education campaigns and some road improvement projects have been implemented since 2015, when Delaware ranked as the most deadly state for pedestrians. But officials acknowledge the efforts haven’t been enough and say more needs to be done. Two weeks into 2020, at least three pedestrians have died in crashes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Unsafe and filthy conditions at Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority parking garages have prompted changes in how the structures are cleaned. Feces, bottles of urine, used condoms, overflowing trash and other unsanitary conditions were found at several Metrorail station garages, the transit authority’s Office of the Inspector General said in a summary of its report. The transit authority spent $2.2 million on contracted cleaning services, according to the inspector general. The audit found the employees weren’t doing their job properly 84% of the time. The Metro system took action immediately and began pressure-washing efforts after learning of the inspector general’s findings, spokeswoman Sherri Ly said in a statement, according to news outlets. The agency also plans to phase out contractors in favor of hiring custodial workers in-house, according to the statement.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: In his State of the State address Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for teacher raises, the eradication of Burmese pythons in the Everglades, and a new law to force girls to get their parents’ permission before getting an abortion. DeSantis said keeping taxes low, improving education and protecting the environment will help Florida continue to grow. The speech marked the opening of the Legislature’s annual 60-day session. He spoke in the House chamber, where lawmakers desks’ were covered in flowers. Members of the Supreme Court and the state’s three Cabinet members also attended the address. While touting a boost in adoption, DeSantis told lawmakers he wants them to pass a bill that would require girls under the age of 18 get their parents’ permission to get an abortion. The state already requires girls’ parents be notified if they have an abortion.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: An endangered newborn right whale spotted with grievous injuries to its head off the state’s coast is unlikely to survive, though scientists may try to inject the calf with antibiotics using a syringe fired from an air gun if they can safely get close enough, government experts said Monday. Foggy weather along the coast was delaying efforts to relocate the wounded baby whale and its mother by plane. The calf was first seen from the air last Wednesday, and a boat crew got close enough Friday near St. Simons Island for scientists to conclude its injuries were worse than initially feared. Scientists estimate 400 or fewer North Atlantic right whales still exist. Dr. Teri Rowles, a veterinarian for the National Marine Fisheries Service, said the wounds were likely caused by the propeller of a boat.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: This tropical state is getting its first Olive Garden. A popular Honolulu bar and restaurant will close and be replaced by a new outlet of one of the nation’s biggest restaurant chains, officials say. The Mai Tai Bar and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. at Ala Moana Center, the state’s largest mall, are slated to close next month, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Bubba Gump Chief Operations Officer Jim DuFault said the closure is the result of a rental dispute, and Bubba Gump is prepared to file a lawsuit if the landlord or a future tenant attempts to “steal our Mai Tai intellectual property.” Olive Garden filed a $50,000 building permit for the mall location. The Italian-American restaurant chain, owned by Darden Restaurants Inc., is coming to Hawaii after years of television commercials running in the state.\n\nIdaho\n\nGrangeville: The screen of a 65-year-old drive-in movie theater was destroyed by high winds, and the owner says he hopes to rebuild – if he can find someone who can do the specialized work. Chris Wagner, owner of Sunset Auto Vue drive-in theater in Grangeville, told The Lewiston Tribune the screen has only been damaged by winds twice since it was built in 1955. The first time, in 2007, he rebuilt with a modern design that was intended to withstand wind gusts up to 110 mph. But last week, high winds estimated by the National Weather Service at about 60 mph flattened the 32-by-72-foot outdoor screen, leaving behind a mass of twisted metal. “I’ll be making a call to the manufacturer, but he was 75 years old when he showed up the last time (in 2007) to do it,” Wagner said. There are only a handful of drive-in theaters in the Gem State.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state is updating its birth certificate system to affirm the gender identities of transgender parents, after a transmasculine person asked to be officially recognized as a father who gave birth to their daughter. Myles and Precious Brady-Davis of Chicago learned after their daughter, Zayn, arrived in December that the Illinois Department of Public Health automatically names the parent who gives birth as “Mother/Co-Parent” on a birth certificate. Myles Brady-Davis is transmasculine, which describes a person who was born female but is typically masculine in gender expression. Transmasculine people do not always identify as male. Myles, who uses they/them pronouns, carried and gave birth to Zayn and wants to be listed as her father, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Precious Brady-Davis is a transgender woman and the baby’s mother.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Gov. Eric Holcomb has declared Jan. 27 “Eva Education Day” in honor of the late Eva Kor, the Holocaust survivor who dedicated much of her life to educating the world about the experiments of Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Jan. 27 is the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where Kor and her twin sister, Miriam, were subjected to Mengele’s experiments. The Terre Haute woman’s experience was chronicled in a documentary titled “Eva: A-7063.” That film is part of an Eva Educational Toolkit that has been distributed to every middle school and high school in Indiana. Kor died July 4, 2019, while conducting her annual group tour of the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland.\n\nIowa\n\nHarlan: A man has asked a judge to let him engage in a sword fight with his ex-wife and her attorney so he can “rend their souls” from their bodies. David Ostrom, 40, of Paola, Kansas, said in a Jan. 3 court filing that his former wife, Bridgette Ostrom, 38, of Harlan, Iowa, and her attorney, Matthew Hudson, had “destroyed (him) legally.” The Ostroms have been embroiled in disputes over custody and visitation issues and property tax payments. The judge had the power to let the parties “resolve our disputes on the field of battle, legally,” David Ostrom said, adding in his filing that trial by combat “has never been explicitly banned or restricted as a right in these United States.” He also asked the judge for 12 weeks’ time so he could secure Japanese samurai swords. Shelby County District Court Judge Craig Dreismeier said in his own filing Monday that he won’t be issuing a decision anytime soon, citing irregularities with both sides’ motions and responses.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A former Newman University professor who alleged the university discriminated against her because she was a woman should receive more than $800,000 in damages and be reinstated, a federal jury ruled Monday. The jury found in favor of Cindy Louthan, former assistant professor of elementary education at Newman, who sued the private Roman Catholic university in Wichita in 2018. Cindy Louthan alleged a supervisor was hostile toward women and harassed and discriminated against her because she is female. She also contended the university did not investigate her concerns and punished her when she complained about the supervisor, ending in her losing her job, The Wichita Eagle reports. Louthan was one of five former university employees who sued the school alleging unfair treatment or termination in recent years. The university has denied the allegations in each case.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A Christian school expelled a student last week after her family says school officials discovered the 15-year-old had celebrated her birthday with a rainbow-themed cake. Kimberly Alford says that until Jan. 6, her daughter had been a freshman at Whitefield Academy. That’s when Alford says she received an email from the academy’s head of school, Bruce Jacobson, explaining how her daughter was being expelled “immediately due to a post on social media.” Alford had recently posted a photo on her Facebook page showing her daughter celebrating her birthday at a Texas Roadhouse restaurant, wearing a sweater featuring a rainbow design and sitting by a colorful, rainbow-themed cake. Alford says someone shared the photo with school officials. Alford says Jacobson wrote that the picture “demonstrates a posture of morality and cultural acceptance contrary to that of Whitefield Academy’s beliefs” and follows two years of “lifestyle violations.” Alford says her daughter is not gay, and the cake was simply a fun treat.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The zoo in the capital city is asking for the public’s help to name its newest male giraffe. The Baton Rouge Zoo is holding a contest for people to nominate their favorite names for the facility’s latest addition, born last month. Nominations will be accepted through Jan.22. Zoo staff will take those public submissions and narrow them to three finalists, which will be up for a final vote from the public after that. The zoo will announce the finalists and more details about the voting at a later date. Six-year-old giraffe Rosie gave birth Dec. 26 to the male giraffe, the 20th giraffe to be born at the Baton Rouge Zoo.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A proposal in the Legislature would halt a form of discrimination against people who take medication to prevent HIV infection. Democratic Sen. Heather Sanborn of Portland said the state’s insurance code should be amended to prevent denial of life insurance for people who take pre-exposure prophylaxis medication to prevent HIV. The prophylaxis is commonly called “PrEP.” The proposal received a public hearing before the Health Coverage, Insurance and Financial Services Committee on Jan. 8. It will be subject to committee votes before it can move on to the full Maine Legislature. Sanborn said the state’s insurance code should “reflect modern medical practices, instead of perpetuating discriminatory behavior.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan highlighted initiatives to fight violent crime in Baltimore, improve education statewide and protect the environment Tuesday in presenting his budget plan for the next fiscal year. Hogan, a Republican, referenced a violent weekend in the state’s largest city in calling on lawmakers to support his crime-fighting proposals this session. On Saturday, 12 people were shot – five of them fatally – in Baltimore. It marked the third time in the past month that at least eight people were shot in a single day. “The No. 1 concern of Marylanders by far is crime,” Hogan said at a news conference. “Citizens are demanding more accountability for the violent criminals for shooting and killing people in the streets of Baltimore.” The city had 348 homicides last year, the fifth straight year with more than 300 slayings in the city. It was Baltimore’s most violent year ever on a per capita basis.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A group working to make it legal in the state for doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to mentally competent patients with terminal illnesses says it will continue its fight despite a recent legal setback. Compassion & Choices in its suit filed in 2016 said legalizing the practice, referred to as medical aid in dying or MAID, would help terminally ill patients avoid needless suffering. In a decision Dec. 31, a judge said the issue should be left up to lawmakers. Compassion & Choices said in a statement Monday that it intends to appeal. “This setback is disheartening, but we will continue this legal battle,” Dr. Roger Kligler, a Cape Cod physician with terminal cancer and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in the statement. Second Thoughts Massachusetts, a group that opposes medical aid in dying, praised the decision.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Michigan State Police has suspended the contract with the company that issues the state’s breath alcohol testing devices amid concerns the results could be flawed. In a letter written to police and prosecutors statewide, state police officials warned law enforcement agencies about “performance-related issues” with the Datamaster DMT breathalyzer devices, according to the Detroit News. Such issues could affect drunken driving cases. The letter did not identify the problems or how they were uncovered. State police Lt. Michael Shaw said the agency will take over calibration of the devices, as well as the contractor’s duties of certifying and serving the breathalyzer units. Oakland University criminal justice professor Daniel Kennedy said such issues with the breathalyzer devices could be troublesome for drunken driving cases in Michigan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMoorhead: The city might consider requesting a state permit to remove aggressive wild turkeys after some residents complained about the birds, a police official said. Moorhead Deputy Police Chief Tory Jacobson said the police department doesn’t have the skills or resources to add wildlife management to its list of responsibilities. The department, which also runs the city’s animal control unit, estimates about 300 turkeys are currently roosting and walking in residential neighborhoods. Moorhead residents shared tales about living in close proximity to the wild turkeys during the department’s meeting last week, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Some feel as though the turkeys are taking over. But others welcome the animals as neighbors. Brett Bernath says about 20 to 30 congregate in his backyard, leaving behind filth.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican Tate Reeves was inaugurated as governor Tuesday, pledging to provide economic opportunities for all people in the state and to defend a “loving culture that underpins our quality of life.” Reeves, 45, is the 65th governor of Mississippi. He succeeds Republican Phil Bryant, who served two terms. “This will be an administration for all Mississippi,” Reeves said during his inaugural speech. Reeves served two terms as lieutenant governor and two terms before that as the elected state treasurer. He took the oath as governor before family, friends, lawmakers and other officials in the House chamber of the state Capitol. “A culture of love and kinship has knitted Mississippi families together, and tied them to each other, for ages,” Reeves said. “It is what makes us special in a fast-paced and transient world. I will defend that culture against the erosion that frays societies.”\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Planned Parenthood is challenging the state’s denial of claims for Medicaid payments for a second time in two years. KCUR reports that Planned Parenthood’s affiliates in Overland Park, Kansas, appealed Missouri’s cutoff of their fiscal 2020 funding last week in Jackson County, Missouri, after an administrative law judge ruled against them last month. Meanwhile, an appeal of the cutoff of 2019 funding is pending before the Missouri Supreme Court. “It’s kind of a continuation of the same old song and dance,” said Charles Hatfield, Planned Parenthood’s attorney. Republican lawmakers in Missouri have for years sought to stop any taxpayer money from going to Planned Parenthood, even clinics that do not provide abortions. But legislators struggled with “loopholes” that allowed Planned Parenthood clinics that provide other health care to continue receiving funding.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A campaign to legalize, regulate and tax marijuana use has submitted two proposed ballot initiatives for state review, the group New Approach Montana announced. The first ballot proposal would legalize recreational use of marijuana for adults in Montana and establish a regulatory framework and a 20% sales tax. Part of the tax money would be used to reduce the tax on medical marijuana from 2% to 1%. The second ballot issue is a constitutional amendment that would restrict marijuana consumption, like alcohol, to people age 21 or older. The initiatives were delivered to the secretary of state and the Legislative Services Division on Monday, Montana Public Radio reports. The Attorney General must approve the language before the group can start gathering signatures in an effort to put the issues before voters in November 2020.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The Game and Parks Commission has prepared special Valentine’s Day offers for people who want to mark the day at a state park. Guests who reserve a cabin or lodge room – at a 30% discount – at Eugene T. Mahoney State Park between Feb. 10 and Feb. 14 can add a Valentine’s Special package to their reservation. The $25 offer includes a gift package consisting of a rose, two wine glasses, sparkling juice, a 2020 Nebraskaland Calendar, chocolates and more.

Add the Silver Package for $25 and get complimentary champagne, wine or cider; sausage and cheese platter; bouquet of flowers; cheesecake dessert; drink tickets and more.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Animal rescuers have confirmed one of three hat-wearing pigeons that gained popularity on social media has died. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue employees say fumes from glue used to affix the hats could have poisoned Bille the Pidge. Lofty Hopes Pigeon Rescue tweeted Sunday that the female bird was weak and had lost toes to a condition where its toes are isolated by a string and fall off. Officials say the three pigeons were first discovered in December wearing miniature red cowboy hats in Las Vegas. Rescue employees say the hats were glued on. Employees say pigeons have fragile respiratory systems, and a veterinarian had to trim feathers to remove the hats. It wasn’t certain if the bird’s death was connected to the hat. It is still unknown who put the hats on the birds. Billie is survived by two other former cowboy pigeons – Cluck Norris and Coolamity Jane.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Animals are on the agenda at the Statehouse with bills aimed at both protecting and pursuing them. Lawmakers have filed at least a dozen bills this session focused on wildlife or domesticated animals, including measures to ban the declawing of cats and docking of dog tails. Both bills have public hearings Thursday. Three bills before a House committee Tuesday were about killing other species. One would repeal a prohibition on hunting with ferrets; another would create a new safari hunting license for those taking elk and boar at a private game reserve; and a third would lower the bar for killing animals that damage crops or other property. Current law allows someone to kill wild animals that cause “actual and substantial” damage, but a bill sponsored by Rep. Howard Pearl, R-Loudon, would remove the “and substantial” language. He said requiring substantial damage was too subjective.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: State lawmakers on Monday passed legislation to prohibit flavored vaping products, sending the measure to Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk. The Democrat-led Senate passed the bill 22-15, with the Democratic-controlled Assembly voting 53-11 with eight lawmakers not voting on the measure that bans e-cigarettes flavors, including any fruit or candy among others. Lawmakers say the flavors are meant to hook young people, who are using the products in increasing numbers. Opponents of the legislation, who crowded part of the Statehouse complex Monday, say officials should better enforce the smoking age instead of barring of-age adults from buying products they enjoy using. The smoking age in New Jersey is 21. Murphy has been supportive of the idea of a flavor ban, but his office didn’t respond when asked how he’ll handle the legislation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The National Science Foundation has awarded two universities in the state and the New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute a $5 million grant to establish a comprehensive forestry research center for the Southwest. The five-year grant will fund the development of a Center of Excellence in Forest Restoration. It will be charged with advancing the understanding of the effects of restoration activities on forested areas through a combination of multidisciplinary research and education. The center will train students in fire management as well as forest ecology and restoration, offering undergraduate and masters programs at Highlands University. Plans also include developing a collaborative Ph.D. program between Highlands and New Mexico State University.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s policing of subway fare beaters is drawing scrutiny from the state’s attorney general for possible racial bias. Letitia James announced Monday that her office is investigating the New York Police Department’s fare-enforcement practices after the department released new data showing black and Hispanic people account for the vast majority of its fare-related summonses and arrests. James’ office sent a letter to the police commissioner Monday seeking additional data, such as the number of officers assigned to each subway station each day – figures she said could shed light on whether officers are targeting communities of color. James, a Democrat, promised to take legal action if her office finds evidence of discrimination. NYPD spokeswoman Devora Kaye said officers “patrol day and night to keep 6 million daily riders safe and enforce the law fairly and equally without consideration of race or ethnicity.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCorolla: A group that manages herds of wild horses on the state’s coast is warning drivers to watch out for the animals taking advantage of unseasonably warm weather by sleeping on the sand at night. Temperatures in the 60s and 70s across the Carolinas have the wild horses acting “more like it’s June, not January,” the Corolla Wild Horse Fund said in a message posted to social media. The pleasant weather has coaxed the animals out of the islands’ forests, where they usually shelter from cold winter winds, and into the path of recreational vehicles, The News & Observer reports. Daniel T. Myers III was driving on Corova Beach over the weekend when he spotted the horses in the dark. He told McClatchy News Group the animals are very hard to see and warned others to keep an eye out. Crashes are one of the leading causes of death among the Outer Banks herds, the newspaper says.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A pipeline spill of oil-field wastewater has affected cropland in northwestern North Dakota. State environmental scientist Bill Suess said regulators were notified Monday of the 8,400-gallon pipeline leak in Renville County. The pipeline is operated by Wichita Falls, Texas-based Cobra Oil and Gas. Suess said the spill of produced water happened 2 miles north of Sherwood and within a mile of the U.S.-Canada border. The cause of the pipeline leak is unknown. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It’s a byproduct of oil and gas development. Suess said about 1,000 square feet of cropland was affected. He said no water sources were harmed.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Self-driving shuttles will do a circuit through a residential neighborhood in the capital city as part of a yearlong pilot program starting in late January. Three 12-passenger, disabled-accessible electric shuttles will travel the 2.8-mile route in the Linden neighborhood. The shuttles, which are autonomous but monitored by on-board operators, will run between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m and connect riders to locations with social services like St. Stephen’s Community House, which has a food pantry and health and job resources. Other stops include a recreation center and a transit center. The circuit will be timed so riders can connect to Central Ohio Transit Authority buses. The route will be suspended for 30 minutes in the morning and afternoon as a precaution because of students walking to school, says Mandy Bishop, the program manager for Smart Columbus, the city’s mobility initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state has adopted a new electronic tracking system that will allow sexual assault survivors to monitor the location and status of their rape kits. The purpose of the system is to empower survivors with information, help law enforcement with investigations, and foster transparency and public trust, The Oklahoman reports. Only survivors and entities that update the system can access the records. The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation operates the system, which was authorized through legislation passed last year. A task force made recommendations in an effort to improve the state’s response to sexual assaults. “I’m hoping it will hold all of us accountable to make sure that we don’t let victims fall through the cracks,” says Andrea Fielding, division director of criminalistics for the OSBI.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The City Council has voted unanimously to draft an emergency declaration legally allowing car camping in certain areas. Many members of the public who spoke at the council meeting Monday supported the push for car camping but stressed more needed to be done to help the homeless population. Most demanded immediate action. Mayor Chuck Bennett said he was “deeply concerned” about the homeless crisis, but it has been 30 years in the making, and officials are working to fight that crisis in a matter of weeks. He said the actions made during Monday’s session will help meet the needs of the community. A study researching the option found the city has neither the funds nor the resources to manage a city-sponsored program. A privately sponsored program – where site owners provide supervision, trash receptacles and access to bathrooms – was suggested as an alternative.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s second lady, Giselle Fetterman, will help lead a campaign to raise awareness of this year’s census and encourage residents to respond, state officials said Monday. Fetterman, whose husband is Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, said she will tour the state, making stops in Philadelphia and in Centre, Erie, Allegheny, Lancaster and Luzerne counties over the next three months. Gov. Tom Wolf signed an executive order in 2018 to create a commission to help ensure a robust census count and signed legislation in October authorizing up to $4 million to buttress the count. Meanwhile, 94 nonprofit community organizations are working together to encourage their targeted communities to return census forms. Current census projections show Pennsylvania is growing more slowly than the rest of the country and is expected to lose a congressional seat in 2023.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The federal government is finally paying for baggage screening systems at the state’s main airport that were upgraded after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed said. The Democrat met Friday with officials from the Rhode Island Airport Corp. and the Transportation Security Administration at the T.F. Green Airport in Warwick to discuss air travel safety. Reed said millions were allocated nationally in a 2020 spending bill to reimburse airports for baggage screening systems and security improvements, of which $5.5 million will be directed to T.F. Green. The airport upgraded its baggage screening systems after the terrorist attacks, enhancing safety and saving the federal government millions in reduced labor and worker’s compensation costs, but the airport corporation wasn’t fully reimbursed, Reed said. The payment brings the total reimbursement so far to $18 million of $30 million owed, he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Mayor Knox White says he’s found a way to commit up to $5million toward buying land for affordable housing at County Square, although he says he’s still working on the details. The mayor says the $5 million would be in addition to $2 million Greenville County had previously pledged toward affordable housing in the neighborhood that includes County Square. It’s the latest step in a project that has been in the works for three years: the $1 billion public-private redevelopment of county-owned land along University Ridge. Negotiations have intensified since since last summer among city and county leaders, downtown residents and RocaPoint over how best to hash out a plan everyone can live with. It is the biggest project Greenville has ever seen, promising thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenues, and a 37-acre expansion of the downtown business district.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nElk Point: A school district will pay $65,000 to settle a discrimination lawsuit brought by a former honor student. Addison Ludwig says she was singled out by the former Elk Point-Jefferson High School principal after she was featured in the student newspaper in 2017 and described a hobby as “Netflix n’ Chill with my boyfriend.” Ludwig says she didn’t know it was a term some use to describe casual sexual encounters until the principal, Travis Aslesen, made her look it up on the internet. Aslesen revoked her senior privileges and honors study hall and removed her as editor of the newspaper. Ludwig in her lawsuit said male students who used the term had not been disciplined, including a boy who had used the term in a profile in the newspaper earlier in the year, the lawsuit said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Senate started the 2020 legislative session passing its first bill of the year: a controversial measure that protects religious adoption agencies if they choose to discriminate against same-sex couples. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Paul Rose, R-Covington, declares that no licensed adoption agency would be required to participate in a child placement if doing so would “violate the agency’s written religious or moral convictions or policies.” It also prohibits the state from denying an agency’s license or grant application for public funds because of the group’s refusal to place a child with a family based on religious objections. The adoption agency would also be protected from lawsuits for such a refusal. The Senate passed the bill 20-6, with five Republican members declining to vote on the measure, including Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge. The House passed the bill in April, and it now heads to Gov. Bill Lee for his signature.\n\nTexas\n\nStephenville: Researchers at Tarleton State University’s Southwest Regional Dairy Center are using devices similar to Fitbits to track the health habits of dairy cows, the Weatherford Democrat reports. The researchers say tracking a cow’s eating, sleeping and movement helps them take better care of the animals, according to a press release from the Texas A&M University System. The devices track how long cows eat, how long they lay down and how many steps they take, while another wearable device monitors how much milk each cow gives. “We have two Fitbits on every cow,” Southwest Regional Dairy Center Director Barbara Jones says. The data can warn producers that a cow may be sick before the animal starts showing symptoms. The devices also free up time for the dairy producer, who can tend to other business instead of monitoring their herd visually, according to the press release.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Membership growth in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has slowed to its lowest level in decades. The church added just 4,900 members in the state in between October 2018 and September 2019, according to statistics it provided to The Salt Lake Tribune. Utah’s total population grew by 53,000 people over the same period, according to estimates. The church grew by fewer than 10,000 people in a year only one other time since 1989, the first year the newspaper had access to membership data. That was in 2018, when membership rose by just over 9,000 people. By comparison, the faith widely known as the Mormon church added more than 40,000 new members in 2013, which was the high mark of the last decade. In Salt Lake County, the state’s largest, the number of Latter-day Saints fell by 6,710 even as the county’s total population grew by 10,000 people.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: A bill has been proposed in the Legislature to decriminalize adult prostitution. The legislation is co-sponsored by four female legislators. Rep. Selene Colburn, a Burlington progressive, said she thinks decriminalizing sex work will improve safety and health of prostitutes, mynbc5.com reports. “The underlying question is do we need to criminalize consensual sex between adults on any terms?” she said. Sex trafficking, exploitation and solicitation of minors will remain a serious felony, she said. The bill is in the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state moved a step closer to ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment on Tuesday, even as the measure’s future nationally remains in doubt. A House committee approved a resolution to ratify the gender equality measure, which advocates hope will become the next amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The 13-9 vote split along party lines, with all Democrats supporting it and all Republicans opposing it. A Senate committee already advanced a similar resolution. The resolutions are now before the full House and Senate, where floor votes are expected Wednesday. Democrats control both chambers, and their legislative leaders have said their caucuses unanimously support the measure. “Each action we take to move this resolution forward signals to the country that we’re more than ready to do our part in creating a world where women are treated as equals,” Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, a sponsor of the House resolution, said in a statement.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Seattle Police Department’s civilian watchdog has found that an officer’s ruse in a 2018 hit-and-run case contributed to the driver’s suicide. The Office of Police Accountability said that to get the suspect to turn himself in, the officer told one of the suspect’s friends that the crash left a woman in critical condition and that she might not survive, The Seattle Times reports. In reality, it was a fender-bender with no injuries. The driver’s friend told him what the officer had said, and the driver began to think he had possibly hit a pedestrian without knowing it. The friend reported that the driver had been addicted to heroin for two decades and became increasingly despondent over the possibility he killed someone. Soon thereafter, in June 2018, he died by suicide. The officer was suspended for six days without pay.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Rescue dogs could soon become the state’s official state dog under a proposal approved Tuesday in the Senate. The resolution, sponsored by state Sens. Ryan Weld and Stephen Baldwin, says it seeks to bring attention to dogs living in the more than 500 animal shelters in West Virginia. “Just because a dog is at a shelter doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with the dog,” said Weld, a Republican. “That dog needs a second chance and is looking for a new friend, just like you might be.” The proposal now moves to the House of Delegates. West Virginia already has a bunch of official state flora and fauna. The black bear is the state animal, the sugar maple is the state tree, the cardinal is the state bird, and the rhododendron is the state flower.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans are introducing a package of bills that would impose tougher sanctions and sentences on criminals. The legislation would require the Department of Corrections to recommend revoking a person’s extended supervision, parole or probation if he or she is charged with a crime; prohibit people convicted of violent crimes from finishing probation early; and block violent criminals from participating in early release programs. The bills also would impose a mandatory 180-day jail sentence for shoplifting; forbid prosecutors from amending charges of illegally possessing a gun against a person convicted of a violent felony or attempting to commit a violent felony; and expand the violations that could land a child in a youth prison to include any act that would be a felony in adult court.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A company has settled a federal lawsuit by a former employee who claimed she was pressured to take Scientology courses as a condition of her employment. Julie A. Rohrbacher filed the lawsuit in 2018 against Teton Therapy, which operates physical and occupational therapy offices in four Wyoming locations. Rohrbacher claimed that owner Jeff McMenamy declined to promote her and then forced her to resign in 2013 after she refused to enroll in Church of Scientology courses. She sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits religious harassment and discrimination at work. The suit was settled Jan. 2, and Chief U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl dismissed the case, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Scientology is a church founded by science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the early 1950s. The church has about 10 million members worldwide.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/30/animatronic-groundhog-coalfield-crayfish-old-bay-sauce-news-around-states/41109713/", "title": "Animatronic groundhog, coalfield crayfish: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAtmore: The state is largely shutting down a state prison that houses more than 600 inmates because of sewer and other infrastructure problems in the 51-year-old facility, the state commissioner announced Wednesday. The move is the latest upheaval in the prison system that has struggled with overcrowding, low staffing, violence and aging facilities. Alabama Corrections Commissioner Jeff Dunn said 617 inmates at Holman Correctional Facility at Atmore will be sent to other state prisons. Dunn said the decision was made because maintenance crews were struggling daily to maintain sewer and electrical systems housed in a tunnel running beneath the main prison building. Some inmates, including death row inmates, will remain at Holman in units that run on separate systems, he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The population of endangered beluga whales in Alaska’s Cook Inlet continues to decline, federal marine mammal authorities announced Tuesday. A biennial survey conducted by the fisheries arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimated the population of the white whales at 250 to 317, with a median estimate of 279. “The population is estimated to be smaller and declining more quickly than previously thought,” NOAA Fisheries said in the announcement. The survey is based on data collected by aerial surveys in summer 2018. The survey also documented that a contraction has persisted of the summer range of belugas, the geographical area where they live. Since 2008, on average 81% of the total population occupied the Susitna Delta near the north end of the inlet in early June during the aerial survey period. Before that, about 50% did.\n\nArizona\n\nGrand Canyon National Park: If you want to tie the knot at the Grand Canyon, you’ll want to get your request in sooner rather than later. A lack of staffing means applications for special use permits will take longer to process, park officials said this week. Weddings, family reunions, memorial services, organized group hikes or runs within the canyon, and scattering ashes within the park all require special use permits. The most popular request is to say “I do” at Shoshone Point at the South Rim, the only viewpoint available for outdoor receptions, or at a multipurpose building known as Shrine of the Ages, said Sharon Ringsven, the park’s deputy chief of commercial services. Other wedding locations are available within the park. Basic permits now take up to 30 days to process but will take up to 45 days starting Feb. 14. More complex requests could take up to 90 days.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit trying to block from this year’s ballot a referendum on a new law expanding the procedures that optometrists can perform. Pulaski County Circuit Judge Wendell Griffen dismissed the lawsuit by Arkansans for Healthy Eyes, a group formed in opposition to the referendum effort. The lawsuit claimed the referendum wasn’t approved under the correct process. The new law allows optometrists to perform several procedures that previously only ophthalmologists could perform, including injections around the eye, the removal of lesions from the eyelids and certain laser eye surgeries. The law’s supporters say optometrists are already trained to perform the procedures but were being forced to refer patients elsewhere. It has drawn heavy opposition from ophthalmologists who say the change puts patients at risk.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A top public official and go-to bureaucrat to mayors over two decades was charged with public corruption Tuesday, upending City Hall as elected leaders scrambled to reassure the public that bribery and kickbacks would not be tolerated. The complaint unsealed against San Francisco Public Works Director Mohammed Nuru and longtime restaurateur Nick Bovis focuses on an aborted attempt in 2018 to bribe a San Francisco airport commissioner for retail space. It also alleges other schemes in which Nuru is accused of trying to help his friend score contracts to build homeless shelters and portable toilets, along with a restaurant at the city’s new $2 billion transit station. Nuru is also accused of accepting free labor at his vacation home and a John Deere tractor as well as lavish gifts from a developer, including a $2,070 bottle of wine.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A state audit found Colorado may be losing significant tax revenue due to oil and gas companies failing to submit thousands of monthly reports used to track how much energy they produce. The audit estimated the energy producers operating in the state would have been subject to “about $308 million in penalties for delinquent reports,” Colorado Public Radio reports. Regulators are not imposing penalties or tracking missing or incomplete production reports, the audit found. The reports help the state determine whether the companies have paid the correct tax amounts. The audit said 10% of operators also filed reports with missing information. “It was distressing to see that there was a culture of acceptance of not filing forms,” said Rep. Dafna Michaelsen Jenet, the Democratic vice chair of the committee. “And the top producers are the biggest violators, and we’re talking about thousands upon thousands of forms not filed. ”\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: The city is asking police to enforce a youth curfew following a shooting outside a courthouse that left four people in the hospital. Bridgeport Police Chief Armando Perez said Tuesday that the department increased patrols across the city immediately after the shooting. The victims were sitting in a car outside Bridgeport Superior Court on Monday afternoon when someone in a passing SUV opened fire, police said. City officials said the shooting was not random, and the four people were targeted. They were all taken to the hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening. The youth curfew, based on an ordinance passed and enforced in 2012, will be enforced from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Sunday through Thursday and midnight to 6 a.m. Friday and Saturday. Mayor Joe Ganim said it is up to police whether they will issue a $50 fine or order community service for curfew violations.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Reunited rockers Rage Against the Machine and Grammy record-setter Billie Eilish will lead a high-powered 2020 lineup for Firefly Music Festival on the first weekend of the summer. The festival, entering its ninth year in the city, revealed the lineup – which also includes Halsey, Khalid, Blink 182 and Maggie Rogers as headliners – on Tuesday morning. The three acts that will close Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights on the main stage are Rage, Eilish and Halsey, officials said. Presale tickets will go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. at fireflyfestival.com. Fans must first go to the site and register for a unique access code to the sale. Four-day general admission passes start at $299, VIP at $699 and Super VIP at $2,499. Tickets will open to the general public Monday. Once the $299 general admission tickets are sold out, they will increase in price by $20 increments each time a new batch sells out, topping out at $359 each.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Local leaders have vowed not to support a former councilman who filed papers to run for the seat he vacated less than two weeks ago amid ethics violation allegations. Jack Evans filed paperwork Monday to seek reelection to the D.C. Council, news outlets report. Evans resigned Jan. 17, shortly before councilors were set to vote on his expulsion. An investigation found he used his position to benefit private clients and failed to recognize their payments as conflicts of interest. “I cannot support him coming back,” council Chairman Phil Mendelson said Tuesday. Evans has also been the subject of a federal investigation, according to news outlets. He’s denied any wrongdoing. “We should all call on Jack to do not what’s best for Jack but what’s best for the District of Columbia,” Mayor Muriel Bowser said. A special election to fill Evans’ former Ward 2 seat has been scheduled for June.\n\nFlorida\n\nSanford: Inmates are sewing cloth pouches for kangaroos and koalas orphaned by wildfires in Australia, even if animal care organizations there have enough of them for the time being. The Seminole County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday tweeted video showing two inmates hard at work at sewing machines, stitching together what are called “joey pouches” for the orphaned marsupials. The pouches are made from old uniforms. “Inmates making them learn a new skill they can use upon their release,” tweeted the sheriff’s office, located outside Orlando. Australia’s unprecedented wildfire season has charred huge expanses of brushland, rainforests and national parks – killing more than a billion wild animals by one estimate. People hoping to help out from afar have been sewing pouches and sending them to Australia – so many that earlier this month, an organization distributing the pouches said it was being “overwhelmed.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Terrapin Beer Co. has installed solar panels and aims to reduce its energy consumption by 30%. The Athens-based brewery recently cut the ribbon on the project, which involves 720 solar panels on Terrapin’s roof and on its parking lot’s sunshades. “At Terrapin, we want to be bigger than beer,” Terrapin president Dustin Watts said. “That is our main focus and goal. ... Beer brings people together, and, with that beverage, if we can inspire people to do good or do better things for the planet and for human beings in general, that’s our main goal.” The solar panel array is part of Terrapin’s larger sustainability campaign called Terraprint. There’s now a TV screen in the tap room that shows customers how much solar energy is being used at any given time.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Fewer sea turtles were found stranded on Maui last year than in 2018, although officials say most cases continue to be caused by fishing gear. There were 141 documented cases of green sea turtles stranded on Maui last year, down from 174 in 2018, The Maui News reports. Among the stranded turtles reported in 2019, 117 were located alive. Fishing gear caused 102 strandings, and 13 were stranded due to unknown causes. The remaining 26 were caused by boat strikes, buoyancy disorders, injured flippers, shark bites, diseases, or turtles becoming stuck in rocks or sand, officials said. The Maui Ocean Center Marine Institute said fishermen are encouraged to help turtles by removing hooks and lines. The institute is the nonprofit arm of the Maui Ocean Center aquarium that coordinates responses to sick, injured, distressed or expired sea turtles on Maui.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s top wildlife official on Tuesday requested authorization from lawmakers to spend $408,000 to count wolves. Department of Fish and Game Director Ed Schriever told the Legislature’s budget-setting committee that the expense would become part of the agency’s annual budget to keep a running tally of the number of wolves in the state. Idaho stopped counting wolves in 2015 after it was no longer required to do so by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service following the lifting of protections for wolves under the Endangered Species Act. In April, Schriever cobbled together existing efforts to count wolves, and last week he announced there are 1,000 wolves in Idaho based on information from 600 cameras scattered around the state. The population had been closer to 1,500 early in the summer of 2019 but was reduced through hunting, trapping and killing of wolves that preyed on livestock.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Old St. Patrick’s Roman Catholic Church will no longer host its World’s Largest Block Party, the church announced on its website Tuesday. The 35-year-old, two-day festival of music and food drew thousands of people to a street west of Chicago’s business district. Old St. Patrick’s pastor, the Rev. Tom Hurley, said in the letter that the summer event environment in Chicago is more competitive than it was 35 years ago and more difficult for the 175-year-old church to navigate. “We are grateful for where we have been and we are excited as we look to the future and starting to plan events, experiences and programs that reflect where we are going,” Hurley wrote. In the block party’s place, the church on March 14 will host what Hurley calls a “Shamrock’n the Block” party to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day. Old St. Patrick’s used proceeds from the World’s Largest Block Party to fund its social justice initiatives.\n\nIndiana\n\nGary: State officials have put the Gary Community School Corp. on notice for violating Indiana law by offering enrollment incentives last fall. The district posted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram offering $25 Visa gift cards to parents who referred students to successfully enroll in Gary schools, Northwest Indiana Times reports. The posts said those students also would be entered in a raffle to receive an iPad. Indiana law explicitly prohibits any public, charter or private schools who receive state scholarship funding from offering incentives in the form “of any item that has monetary value, including cash or a gift card.” The incentive offer was posted online with a Sept. 13 deadline – the same day all Indiana districts were required to submit student enrollment totals to the Department of Education for verification. State school funding is directly tied to student enrollment.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state will for the first time have two women on its Supreme Court after Gov. Kim Reynolds on Tuesday named an eastern Iowa attorney to the seven-member panel. Dana Oxley, the only female finalist on the list forwarded to the governor Jan. 9, is an attorney who has questioned the importance of abiding by past decisions. In her application she said that the court should “not blindly apply its prior decisions but must be vigilant in protecting the rule of law.” Oxley, 52, of Swisher is the second woman on the court, joining Susan Christensen, appointed by Reynolds in 2018. Oxley is only the fourth woman ever named to the state’s highest court. Reynolds said gender was not a factor in her choice. “We need more women in the courts, yes, but I don’t make my decision based on gender. They earned those selections,” Reynolds said. “She’s smart; she’s articulate; she’s hard-working; she brings a breadth of experience to the court.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Cropland that turned into a crime scene of serial slayings in the 1870s is up for auction. The 162-acre tract where the Bender family killed at least 11 people will be sold off to the highest bidder by an auction company next month, The Wichita Eagle reports. Accounts say the family of four who came to be known as the “Bloody Benders” would lure travelers into their home, inviting them for a hot meal and a place to rest. Once seated at the dinner table, instead of hospitality, these travelers would get their throats slit or heads bashed in – their bodies tossed into the cellar until they were able to be hauled out and buried at night. An 1873 excavation found 11 bodies in the garden, although some suspect the Benders killed up to 21 people. When people became suspicious over the missing travelers, the Benders fled. They were never captured. The Feb. 11 auction is open to the public.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A transgender candidate for the state House is criticizing three GOP bills affecting the transgender community. One measure would prohibit students from using public restrooms that don’t align with their “biological sex,” another would make it a felony for doctors to prescribe gender-altering medications to minors, and a third would require student-athletes to play sports based on the sex listed on their birth certificate. Democrat Ramona Thomas, who began transitioning in 2017, said Tuesday that she wants to fight to protect transgender youth. Thomas is running for a House seat to represent southwestern Jefferson County. “These bills are the end result of LGBT people and trans people not being present in our government for so long,” Thomas said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A military veteran who was sent to prison for life after selling less than 1 gram of marijuana to an undercover investigator should be allowed to pursue an appeal of the harsh sentence, defense attorneys told the Supreme Court of Louisiana on Monday. Attorneys representing Derrick Harris said that during a habitual offender sentencing hearing, his trial lawyer failed to note mitigating circumstances, including mental health problems and drug addiction following his service during Operation Desert Storm in the 1990s. Those factors would have allowed the judge to impose less than the life sentence called for under Louisiana’s habitual offender statutes, his lawyers at Monday’s hearing said. In addition, an appellate lawyer failed to raise some of the trial lawyer’s failures in an initial appeal, according to a brief filed for Harris.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state ranks last in New England in access to high-speed internet, but a new push from state and federal leaders seeks to change that. A proposal before the Legislature would provide $15 million to ConnectME Authority, which seeks to bring broadband to more households in the state. The proposal, submitted by Democratic Sen. Erin Herbig of Belfast, received a public hearing Tuesday. Also, officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Democratic Gov. Janet Mills are expected to make an announcement Thursday in Arrowsic about new broadband investments around the state. USDA officials called the new push “a multimillion-dollar Reconnect Pilot Program investment.” The pilot program provides grants and loans to improve broadband access in rural areas. The USDA funding will bring high-speed internet to more than 4,500 homes in Maine, officials with the agency said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Chesapeake flavor of Old Bay seasoning has been turned into a hot sauce. Hours after the release of a limited-edition Old Bay hot sauce, McCormick & Co.’s website sold out. In a tweet Wednesday afternoon, the company thanked its ardent fans for their love and said it is restocking. In an earlier press release, McCormick said the new sauce would hit stores in the next month. The company suggests using it to “warm up” foods like chili, soup, chicken wings, nachos and dips, as well as drinks like Bloody Marys. Old Bay Hot Sauce will be sold in Acme, Giant, Food Lion, Safeway and Wegmans, among other grocery stores. The company says it will also be offered in “many local favorite restaurants.” A 10-ounce bottle retails for $3.49. Old Bay seasoning is a trademark of Maryland seafood, but some loyalists in the region will use it on almost anything.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAuburn: The battle to eradicate Asian longhorned beetles continues over a decade after the species was first discovered in the Worcester area. Officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that an infested tree was discovered Jan. 14 at Pakachoag Golf Course in Auburn. Officials said survey crews will search trees on public and private property around the area where the infested tree was discovered, the Telegram & Gazette reports. Rhonda Santos, spokeswoman for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said there were no other infested trees when the area was inspected last week. The infested tree was a red maple tree, according to Santos. Santos said there were no adult beetles found, but there were egg sites and emergence holes. Tree climbers will be dispatched to the area to conduct additional surveys for the next one to two weeks, according to Santos.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has signed a $2.5 million agreement to design a project to remediate contaminated sediment and create a substantial new habitat at a riverfront park being developed in the city. The contaminated sediment at the Ralph C. Wilson Jr. Centennial Park is within the Detroit River Area of Concern and identified by the U.S. and Canada as one of 43 toxic hot spots in the Great Lakes basin, according to the EPA. The project agreement allows the EPA to evaluate and develop a plan along the shoreline of the 22-acre site along the city’s west riverfront. Work will be funded through a Great Lakes Legacy Act cost-sharing partnership with the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy, which has agreed to contribute nearly $900,000 to the project’s cost.\n\nMinnesota\n\nGrand Portage: Ryan Redington has won the John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon in northeastern Minnesota for the second time in three years. The Alaskan musher and his huskies spent more than 29 hours on the nearly 300-mile trail along Lake Superior before arriving in Grand Portage late Tuesday afternoon. The Star Tribune says Redington comes from a family of dog mushers. He won the Beargrease marathon in 2018 and has competed in numerous races, including Alaska’s famous Iditarod, which his grandfather founded. The seven dogs who finished the race with Redington were treated to hunks of frozen meat. A sleep-deprived Redington said he was looking forward to a shower and a warm meal. Redington’s team crossed about 15 minutes ahead of second-place finisher Keith Aili, of Ray, Minnesota.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: The University of Southern Mississippi expects hundreds of children’s librarians, teachers, and fans of books for children and young adults at its 53rd Fay B. Kaigler Children’s Book Festival on April 1-3. The event at the Hattiesburg campus includes lectures and workshops featuring renowned authors and illustrators and other experts in the field. The Wednesday-through-Friday festival also includes presentation of the Ezra Jack Keats Awards and the Magnolia Book Awards. The Keats title honors an outstanding new writer and an outstanding new illlustrator. Mississippi children and teens will vote in February for Magnolia Book Awards in four age categories. The festival’s top award, the Southern Miss Medallion, is going to Rita Williams-Garcia, who has written a dozen young adult and middle-grade novels.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The State Capitol dome will shine red for the Kansas City Chiefs as the team prepares to make its first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years. Gov. Mike Parson announced in a news release that he ordered the dome to glow in the team’s color Friday night. Parson said that as a season-ticket holder and longtime fan, he “couldn’t be more excited for the Chiefs.” The team’s last Super Bowl appearance was in 1970, when the Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings. Parson said it’s “about time we had another big win.” The Chiefs are playing the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday in Miami.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: They hope to come up with a plan everyone can bear. The state kicked off a two-day summit Wednesday for groups that educate the public about grizzly bears with encouragement from the head of Fish, Wildlife and Parks to teach people how to live with and understand the ursines. “People were surprised at how many different efforts are going on right now at education and information regarding grizzly bears,” FWP Director Martha Williams said about conversations during a dinner with attendees the night before. Grizzly bear populations are growing in Montana, including into areas where they have not lived for decades, state officials said. Grizzly bears are listed as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act in all areas of Montana, and delisting efforts continue in places where recovery goals have been met. There are reportedly more than 1,850 grizzly bears in north-central and northwestern Montana and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.\n\nNebraska\n\nGretna: The driver of a snowplow plunged the vehicle into the Platte River on Tuesday as he was being followed by authorities who later arrested him. U.S. marshals and Sarpy County sheriff’s deputies believed the driver of the Nebraska Department of Transportation snowplow was a wanted federal fugitive and began following the plow on a highway south of Gretna. After a few minutes, Deputy U.S. Marshal Will Iverson said the plow left the road and went down an embankment into the river. The driver managed to get out of the cab, and officers pulled him from the river. The driver’s name wasn’t released, but the Transportation Department told the Lincoln Journal Star he was employed by the agency. After being treated at a hospital, he was taken to jail. Charges against him remain sealed.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: About 1 in 10 people booked last year into the two largest jails in the city had no permanent place to live, a police official told a panel studying homelessness last week. Las Vegas Department of Public Safety Lt. Danielle Davis told the group the homeless make up about 10% of the overall city jail population, but one measurement put the figure at just over 15% of the more than 33,000 people booked last year, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Of the nearly 75,000 people processed into the Clark County Detention Center in 2019, just over 6% identified themselves as homeless, Las Vegas Metropolitan police Capt. Neldon Barrowes said. The presentations came with the city beginning Feb. 1 to enforce a law making it illegal for people to sleep on streets when beds are available at established shelters.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A pair of civil engineers took their relationship to new heights atop a local bridge. Dan Del Tufo arranged to have the Memorial Bridge in Portsmouth lifted to its maximum height, and that’s where he surprised Julia Kallmerten with a marriage proposal – so she could, in his words, “aggravate me for the rest of my life.” She said yes. The couple met at the University of New Hampshire, and both have worked on projects around the bridge, The Boston Globe reports. “This is not something we typically do, but through the description of the work they did at UNH and the work that (Julia) has done, DOT approved the request as long it could be tied to normal bridge maintenance operations,” said Eileen Meaney, communications officer for the New Hampshire Department of Transportation. “They were super cute, and we wish them the best.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A motorcyclist cited for turning his license plate upside down because he thought “it was cool” has lost another bid to rescind a traffic ticket he received. In a ruling issued Tuesday, a state appellate court determined that the ticket and the $139 penalty Scott DiRoma received in municipal court were both justified. The ruling upheld a decision issued by a Somerset County judge. DiRoma was driving his motorcycle in Warren Township in June 2018 when he was stopped by a police officer who noticed his license plate was mounted upside down. DiRoma told the officer he liked the way the plate looked and “wanted to be different,” authorities said. A municipal court judge eventually imposed a $106 fine and $33 in court costs after DiRoma was found guilty of violating a state law mandating that license plates be kept clear and distinct.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A Democrat-backed bill to legalize recreational marijuana businesses in all towns and counties across the state passed its first test late Tuesday amid heighten interested from businesses and health care advocates. The Senate Public Affairs Committee voted 4-3 along party lines to move along the measure that would subsidize medical marijuana and automatically expunge many past pot convictions. The committee had to convene on the Senate floor to accommodate crowds around a proposal that would subsidize medical marijuana for low-income patients and expunge many past pot convictions. An initial draft of the bill from Democratic Sen. Gerald Ortiz y Pino of Albuquerque would also override local governments that don’t welcome the industry. The condition is an attempt to stamp out black markets. “This is the future,” Ben Lewinger, executive director of the New Mexico Cannabis Chamber of Commerce, told lawmakers. “New Mexico doesn’t have time to waste precious years.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Bureau of Prisons is holding off on transferring the warden who was in charge of the New York City jail where Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. The agency said Tuesday that it would defer the transfer of Lamine N’Diaye to a leadership role at FCI Fort Dix, a low-security prison in Burlington County, New Jersey, until the internal investigation is completed into the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. Epstein was found unresponsive in his jail cell Aug. 10 and was later pronounced dead. The Associated Press reported last week that N’Diaye was to be transferred despite multiple active investigations into Epstein’s death. The agency’s backtracking came after Attorney General William Barr stepped in and told officials at the Bureau of Prisons to reverse course given the active investigations, a person familiar with the matter told the AP.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nApex: A man who survived an attempted lynching in 1952 was helped by hundreds of people to move to a new home Tuesday so a highway can be expanded. Lynn Council, 87, planned to move into a new house in Apex after living in his current home for more than 60 years, news outlets report. Council was accused decades ago of a robbery he didn’t commit. Two deputies hanged him from a tree to try to get him to confess. When he didn’t, the deputies took him down. Council later settled into a home just outside Apex. About 20 years ago, he took out a $20,000 federal home repair loan. One condition of the loan was that the full amount must be paid if he moved out or died. The state recently bought Council’s home so the Department of Transportation can expand the NC-540 highway. That meant he needed to pay back the $20,000 loan. Garrett Raczek learned about Council’s story and launched an online fundraiser that by early Thursday had exceeded $24,000.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: City leaders are considering a change to an ordinance that restricts selling firearms and ammunition from home. City Commissioner Tony Gehring says the state has no restrictions on it, and if there is no good reason for the law enacted in 2001, it should be fixed. Duane Spooner, owner of Duane’s Gun Repair, tells KVLY-TV he welcomes the potential change and doesn’t think it would have a negative impact on his business. “I think from the city standpoint, it’s a positive thing to look at,” Spooner said. “Why would you want to do something that stops commerce in your city?” Fargo commissioners have sent the law to the city planning staff and law enforcement so they can research and review it and provide a recommendation.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: Nearly halfway into a 10-year pledge to combat the toxic algae that turns Lake Erie a ghastly shade of green, the state has made little progress. Its patchwork of mostly voluntary efforts hasn’t slowed the farm fertilizers that feed algae blooms, leading to contaminated drinking water and dead fish. Ohio’s governor has authorized an ambitious plan that this year will begin offering farmers financial incentives to adopt new agriculture practices and will create a network of wetlands to capture and filter runoff from fields. The broad approach is being watched closely by states struggling with an increasing number of algae outbreaks. Some environmental groups are skeptical, but others that have been at odds with the farming industry are hopeful. While there are no guarantees the strategy will revive the shallowest of the Great Lakes, there are potential pitfalls, including a lawsuit calling for tougher regulations, that could upend the state’s goal of drastically reducing nutrient pollution entering the lake’s western end by 2025.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The state’s prison population has dropped below 25,000 for the first time in more than a decade, but the system is still overcrowded. The Oklahoma Department of Corrections’ weekly population count for Jan. 21 was 24,992, Tulsa World reports. The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ year-end data shows that the state’s prison population hadn’t been below 25,000 since 2009. Adam Luck, a member of the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, credited positive changes to significant justice reform measures. But he said the state would benefit from engaging in a tough conversation about prison population goals. “It’s often overlooked, but there’s a deeper conversation we need to have – how over capacity we are even including all of the bunk beds we’ve added,” Luck said. The system is at 101% capacity, with state institutions at 109% and contracted private prisons at 93%, according to corrections department data.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Rockslides triggered by unrelenting rain have closed local roads and highways around the state, including a highway near Crater Lake National Park that was closed for hours Tuesday after two boulders the size of a small living room crashed down, narrowly missing a passing car. The giant boulders fell from a hillside that has endured pounding rain and repeated freezing and thawing of the rock because of harsh winter conditions, said Gary Leaming, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Transportation. The driver of the Toyota SUV came around a curve on the windy and rural highway near Prospect, Oregon, and swerved to miss the first boulder but crashed into the second. The boulders are about 15 feet by 15 feet, he said, and dwarfed the large SUV in size.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPunxsutawney: Every Feb. 2 for more than 130 years, Punxsutawney Phil and his handlers have trekked to Gobbler’s Knob, where the groundhog is tasked with predicting the remaining winter season. This year, however, animal rights organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wants the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club to break from tradition, calling for the replacement of Punxsutawney Phil with an animatronic groundhog. In a Tuesday letter to club President Bill Deeley, PETA President Ingrid Newkirk said it is “long overdue for Phil to be retired.” She cited the “great stress” groundhogs feel when in “close proximity to the public.” Newkirk proposed a replacement for the live groundhog: an animatronic animal with artificial intelligence “that could actually predict the weather.” She said using animatronics in lieu of live animals is now “more popular than ever.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The new superintendent for the struggling Providence Public School District says he’ll work with a sense of urgency to unleash “hope and opportunity” for students. Harrison Peters was introduced this week as the superintendent charged with turning the district around. Peters, the outgoing chief of schools for Hillsborough County Public Schools in Florida, said that while he believes genius and talent is distributed equally across zip codes, he has found that opportunity is not. He said he will be a superintendent who moves with a sense of urgency, passion, purpose and respect. Rhode Island took control of Providence’s schools Nov. 1. It’s expected to take at least five years to turn around a district that has been beleaguered by low test scores, crumbling infrastructure and widespread dysfunction.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Dozens of teachers returned to the Statehouse on Wednesday to remind lawmakers they have their own ideas about how to reform education, a debate that continues to drag on in the Legislature. The teacher-led organization SC for Ed, which organized a rally of more than 10,000 people in support of teachers last year, prompting several school districts to close, has said its only planned actions so far this year are to talk to lawmakers and attend meetings. But the grassroots group’s social media hashtag #ScforEdDressRehearsal was a reminder of its March 17 deadline for lawmakers to set their goals. If they don’t meet the deadline, the group said, it will consider another walkout. The teachers who showed up Wednesday wore red, the color the organization adopted as its symbol for action.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nOglala: Oglala Sioux Tribe members will vote in March on whether marijuana should be legalized on the Pine Ridge Reservation and whether alcohol should be served in its casinos. Voters will answer three separate questions March 10: Should medical marijuana be available on the reservation? What about recreational marijuana? Also, should alcohol be sold at Prairie Wind Casino near Oglala and East Wind Casino near Martin? The referendums requite a majority of votes to pass, and the decisions would be binding, meaning the tribal council must implement them, according to Elections Commission executive Sandra Old Horse. The Rapid City Journal reports eligible voters are enrolled members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe who are at least 18 years old and have lived on the reservation for at least one year.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two East Tennessee legislators are attempting to place a long-awaited statue of David Crockett outside the state Capitol in place of a controversial former lawmaker and newspaper publisher who was a prohibitionist leader and espoused racist views. Rep. David Hawk, R-Greeneville, and Sen. Steve Southerland, R-Morristown, are introducing a bill to move the statue of Edward Carmack, currently on display along Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard above the Motlow Tunnel entrance to the Capitol, and replace it with one of Crockett. The Carmack statue would be moved to a new spot on the grounds, the bill says. Crockett, a pioneer and Tennessee politician who became a folk legend, has had a bust on display since 2016 on the second floor of the Capitol, outside the House of Representatives’ chamber.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: More than 20 police officers have been suspended without pay after an internal investigation found they failed to account for money won in gambling stings, document their use of police funds and properly place seized property into evidence, among other policy violations, officials announced Wednesday. None of the detectives and supervisors, who previously served on the city’s vice squad, will face criminal charges because prosecutors determined the nearly three-year investigation found “insufficient evidence” that the law was broken, the police department said. The group acknowledged some policy violations, but poor documentation prevented investigators from determining what happened to some of the funds and seized gambling machines, according to the department. Some officers were accused of giving internal affairs detectives false or misleading statements.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s new medical marijuana program will launch on time in the coming weeks, though health officials said Wednesday that it will start small. One or two dispensaries are expected to open the first week of March, when people can begin getting patient cards that will allow them to legally buy the drug in the state. To get the cards, they will need a recommendation from a doctor, which may be a challenge because the number of medical providers interested in recommending the drug has been “very limited,” said Marc Babitz, deputy director with the Utah Department of Health. Some medical providers may be hesitant because it remains illegal on a federal level, he said. But Utah is the 33rd state to legalize medical cannabis, and no doctors have been prosecuted. “I think this is actually much safer than a lot of the medications that we use,” he told a panel of lawmakers.\n\nVermont\n\nQuechee: A bird rehabilitation center treated a record number of wild birds last year, staff with the institute say. The Vermont Institute of Natural Science says staffers treated a record total of 705 wild birds in 2019 at the institute’s Center for Wild Bird Rehabilitation, and 77 of those were barred owls. In 2018, the institute treated 45 barred owls, out of 652 birds total, Valley News reports. The weather and an increase in public awareness contributed to the higher numbers, said Grae O’Toole, the lead wildlife keeper at the institute. “We weren’t expecting the influx that we received (last) winter,” she said. “They’re just not able to punch through the ice to get to prey on their own.” In addition to the barred owls, staff also treated a pine grosbeak and a Bohemian waxwing, songbird species that are typically found farther north in Vermont.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state’s attorney general, who has vowed to go to court if needed to see the Equal Rights Amendment adopted, plans to announce “landmark civil rights litigation” dealing with the proposed constitutional amendment, his office announced Wednesday. Attorney General Mark Herring is partnering on the lawsuit with fellow Democratic attorneys general Kwame Raoul of Illinois and Aaron Ford of Nevada, Herring’s office said in a news release. A news conference to discuss it is planned for Thursday. The announcement came two days after Virginia became the critical 38th state to ratify the measure, which would prohibit discrimination based on sex. Nevada and Illinois were the next-most recent states to ratify the ERA – Nevada in 2017 and Illinois in 2018. The ERA’s future is uncertain, in part because of a 1982 deadline for ratification that Congress enacted decades ago.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Another endangered orca is missing and presumed dead in the Pacific Northwest, a large male who had fathered many of the population’s calves in the past three decades. The whale, born in 1977 and known as L41 or by the nickname Mega, was not with his family when researchers encountered them last Friday, the Center for Whale Research said. He was last seen last summer, and he appeared thin then. Shari Tarantino, president of the Orca Conservancy, said L41’s death would leave just 72 animals in the “southern resident” population of orcas that frequents the waters between Washington and Canada. That’s the fewest since the mid-1970s, after more than 50 were captured for aquarium display or killed in the process. The whales have struggled with pollution, vessel noise and most significantly a dearth of their preferred prey, Chinook salmon. Researchers say they are on the brink of extinction.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A federal agency has proposed designating habitat areas for two protected crayfish species in coalfield regions. The proposal announced in a statement this week by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would protect 362 stream miles for the Big Sandy crayfish and 83 miles for the Guyandotte River crayfish. The Guyandotte crayfish is listed as an endangered species and the Big Sandy crayfish as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the Guyandotte River crayfish has lost more than 90% of its range and is now only found in two streams in Wyoming County, West Virginia. The Big Sandy crayfish, whose range has been reduced by more than 60%, is found in the upper Big Sandy watershed in southern West Virginia, southwestern Virginia and eastern Kentucky. The environmental group alleged in a 2018 lawsuit that the species were being harmed by sediment from coal mining operations that disturbed their stream habitat.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSpring Green: The School of Architecture at Taliesin, which architect Frank Lloyd Wright opened in 1932, will close in June, the school announced Tuesday. Approximately 30 students are currently enrolled at the school, splitting their time between Taliesin West, Wright’s winter home in north Scottsdale, Arizona, and Taliesin in Wisconsin. The school’s governing board made the decision to close Saturday, after the school was unable to reach an agreement with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation to keep the school open, according to the announcement. The foundation issued a statement saying the school’s governing board “had communicated unequivocally to the Foundation that the School did not have a sustainable business model that would allow it to maintain its operation as an accredited program.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: An annual sled dog race through Wyoming and Idaho begins Friday. The first day of the 25th annual Pedigree Stage Stop Sled Dog Race is for show. Teams will run through downtown Jackson and finish at a park on the south side of town. From there, racers go to Alpine, Pinedale, Kemmerer, Big Piney/Marbleton, Lander and Driggs, Idaho, before finishing near Lower Slide Lake northeast of Jackson on Feb. 8. The racers will compete for $165,000 in prize money. This year’s race will discontinue eight-dog teams and feature only traditional 10-dog teams, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Canadian musher Anny Malo won the 10-dog race in 2019. She completed her first appearance in the event in a cumulative time of 14 hours, 34 minutes and 2 seconds.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/05/stolen-turtle-bald-eagles-peregrine-falcons-amazing-avalanche-survivor-news-around-states/111397766/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:The Xscape Tapas Grille has been fined nearly $25,000 by the city following a Valentines Day record-release party for a local rapper that violated occupancy limits. The club has a maximum occupancy rating of 99. The party for rapper D-Aye packed the club with 342 people, meaning it was 243 over the rated capacity. Because of this, the city fined the club $100 per person over the limit for a total of $24,300. Xscape owner Frank Walker appeared in front of the City Council on Tuesday to review the violation. Walker asked the Council to reduce what his attorney called an excessive fine, but was told he would need to appeal the fine to city administration. He argued he was bringing people together for a positive event to celebrate a rare success in Montgomery, but more people showed up than expected. Walker’s attorney, Preston Presley, said Walker was looking into installing a $30,000 sprinkler system that would allow him to expand capacity of the club. Councilwoman Audrey Graham brought up a past violation in March 2019 when Xscape was 42 people over capacity. “The first time there was a small amount and you paid the fine and we are here again,” Graham said. Graham did ask if the Council could reduce the fine. Councilman CC Calhoun said the fine was set by ordinance and the only way it could be reduced was by an administrative process through the mayor’s office. When asked if the mayor’s administration would appeal the fine, Director of Public Information Michael Briddell said he didn’t know what the mayor’s response would be, but other mayors have been reluctant to throw out a fine.\n\nAlaska\n\nGalena: A dog musher participating in an event near Galena was injured when she was struck by a snowmobile. Kirsten Bey, 64, of Nome was flown from Galena to Fairbanks with what Alaska State Troopers called “significant” injuries. Bey on Sunday night was participating in the Serum Run. After leaving Ruby, she was hit about 5 miles outside of Galena. Another participant in the Serum Run transported her to Galena by snowmobile. Troopers received word of the crash Monday. The driver of the snowmobile who struck Bey later contacted troopers and is cooperating with the investigation, troopers said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:K-12 public district school spending increased in the state by $475million from 2018 to 2019, but the boost to teacher salaries promised by Gov. Doug Ducey fell short, according to a new report. The state Auditor General’s annual report examining classroom spending found that school districts spent 54.7% of their funding in the classroom in fiscal year 2019, a slight increase from 54% in 2018. It’s the third year in a row that classroom spending rose. The report also examined Arizona teacher salaries. Ducey in 2018 promised a 20% teacher raise by 2020. According to Ducey’s plan, about 10% of that raise would have been sent to schools by July 2019 to distribute. But during that period, according to the report, the average teacher salary actually went up 8.4%. The report does not include classroom spending data on public charter schools.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he will commute the life sentence of a woman convicted more than three decades ago of fatally shooting her husband, who had physically abused her. Hutchinson announced his intent to make Willie Mae Harris, 72, immediately eligible for parole, citing the physical abuse Harris suffered. Harris was convicted of first-degree murder in 1985. Harris admitted to shooting her husband, Clyde, but said it was an accident related to self-defense. Harris is legally blind and the state Parole Board several times over the years has recommended she receive clemency. Her case has gained renewed attention in recent months following columns by Arkansas Democrat-Gazette columnist Mike Masterson and a story by The Appeal, a website focused on criminal justice issues. In her most recent application for clemency, Harris said she did not receive a fair trial because none of the evidence of the abuse she suffered was presented. She included an affidavit from her aunt, who said Clyde Harris once broke Willie Mae’s hand with a universal joint from a car. Hutchinson also said planned to commute the sentence of Robert R. Johnson Jr., 36, who was sentenced in 2008 to 86 years in prison on multiple nonviolent drug offenses.\n\nCalifornia\n\nTemecula:A man who became wedged deep inside a narrow storm drain was extricated Tuesday following an hours-long rescue operation mounted by firefighters. The man, whose name was not released, was discovered about 1 a.m. about 270 feet inside the tunnel in the 31000 block of Hickory Place, near Aspen Way, according to the Riverside County Fire Department. There was no immediate word on how or why he got into the drain. A half-dozen engine crews and three truck companies, as well as a hazardous material unit, were sent to the location and initiated attempts to pull the man out of the 18-inch diameter passage, but he was uncooperative for unspecified reasons, and personnel had to switch strategies, according to the fire department. The ensuing technical rescue using industrial equipment, and relying on assistance from the Eastern Municipal Water District and the Temecula Department of Public Works, succeeded in removing him from the drain shortly after 9 a.m., according to the fire department. The man was taken to Inland Valley Medical Center in Wildomar for treatment of what were described as moderate injuries.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The city has reached a $325,000 settlement with a woman who said she was beaten by a police officer in 2018 while being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting at a Target store, attorneys said. Natasha Patnode has said former police officer Todd Hopkins struck her with his fist and baton 50 times, sat on her and tased her, the Coloradoan reported Tuesday. Patnode reached the settlement with the city on Feb. 13, defense attorney David Lane said. City attorney Carrie Daggett confirmed the agreement. Hopkins responded to a shoplifting call from Target, authorities said. He was not wearing a body-mounted camera because his shift had just ended, but Target surveillance footage showed Hopkins grabbed Patnode by the collar, took her to the ground, used pepper spray and sat on Patnode as he tried to handcuff her, the newspaper said. Then-interim Police Chief Terry Jones requested an investigation of Hopkins, who resigned after it determined he should be fired. Patnode pleaded guilty to assault and resisting arrest. A shoplifting charge was dismissed.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The largest organization of cities and towns in Connecticut has called on the state and businesses to provide them with more help in addressing the expensive environmental fallout from chemicals in firefighting foam and similar products. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities said the $2 million in borrowing Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont proposed in his budget is good but not enough. The funding is supposed to help cities and towns get rid of the foam, which contains toxins often called “forever chemicals,” and replace it with different firefighting products through a new buy-back program. There’s also more than $857,000 proposed in Lamont’s budget for things like replacing firefighting foam used by state agencies and to plan and test for the chemicals in statewide surface water and sediment. High levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively called PFAS, have been found in drinking water systems in Greenwich, Willimantic and Enfield, the Hartford Courant reported in February. There were also multiple spills of thousands of gallons of firefighting foam containing the chemicals that entered the Farmington River last year.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A Muslim cemetery that failed a code inspection and was ordered closed was granted special permission to bury a 1-year-old child, officials said. The Muslim Cemetery of Delaware in New Castle County was issued the permit this week, and will be able to continue burying people regularly once safety concerns are met, County Executive Matt Meyer said at a news conference Wednesday. The county closed the cemetery last week after learning it did not meet state code because it failed to provide designated parking spaces or paved paths through the grass, The Delaware News Journal reported. Officials were alerted to the problems after a rainy day this winter when visitors were seen placing wood planks over the ground to avoid mud, said Imam Muhammad Salaam of the Muslim Center of Wilmington. The Islamic Cemetery of Delaware remains registered with the state Department of Health and Social Service to have a cemetery on the property, and is legally permitted to perform funerals there once the safety issues are addressed. The county granted the cemetery a special permit for the Friday burial of infant Ja-Ziyah Gordon, who was set to be taken off life support after a battle with a terminal lung condition, the newspaper reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Librarians at some district public schools could see cuts in their positions next year, according to the Washington Teachers’ Union, WUSA-TV reported. The school district confirmed that it received “some” petitions regarding librarians in the budget submissions, but could not confirm the number. According to DCPS policy, librarians are classified as a “Level 2 staff member,” which means “flexible with petition.” Essentially, schools are not required to maintain the position if they state a case for the reallocation of that money to other needs. The union tweeted that 25 petitions have been submitted to get rid of librarians, saying the announcement came at a meeting with librarians Tuesday night. DCPS confirmed 25 petitions have been submitted to get rid of librarians. All but three came from East of River. The union and librarians said they’re concerned that increased budget cuts could cost them their jobs, and cost children the access to resources that Boyd said they will need to succeed.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Fears of the new coronavirus have led to postponement of the three-day Ultra electronic dance music festival, city officials said. The festival that draws thousands of people from around the world was set to begin March 20 at Miami’s downtown Bayfront Park. Steven Ferreiro, chief of staff for City Commissioner Manolo Reyes, said the event will be postponed, with an official announcement expected Friday. It’s likely Ultra could be postponed until 2021, meaning there would be no festival this year, officials said. Mayor Francis Suarez had said at an earlier news conference that Ultra should not go forward because of the coronavirus concerns. It wasn’t immediately clear how the postponement will affect people who bought tickets or whether other satellite events would still take place. Among the acts scheduled to perform at the main event are David Guetta, The Chainsmokers, Afrojack, Cash Cash, Martin Garrix and Galantis, according to the Ultra website.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state Senate unanimously passed legislation to restrict practices by pharmacy benefit managers – companies that run prescription drug coverage for insurers and other groups – just a day after the state House took similar action. The bill would require pharmacy benefit managers, called PBMs, to pass along discounts they receive from drug manufacturers for a particular medication to consumers. It would also subject PBMs to surcharges for ordering patients to use an affiliated pharmacy and require them to cover the cost of prescriptions at other pharmacies, among other provisions. It passed the Senate by a vote of 52-0, after the House passed a companion bill 165-1 on Wednesday. Supporters of the measure are concerned that PBMs – viewed as middlemen by critics – are overcharging patients, squeezing pharmacies and stifling competition that could bring down drug costs. PBMs argue that drug makers are responsible for setting initial prices, and they use their purchasing power to achieve savings.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A councilman accused of leading a methamphetamine ring must be held without bail, a U.S. judge ruled Wednesday. Arthur Brun led a major drug-trafficking conspiracy involving 11 other defendants since at least June 2019, while serving as an elected member of the Kauai County Council, prosecutors said after his arrest last week. Brun, vice chair of the council’s Public Safety and Human Services Committee, has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors argued in court documents that Brun must be denied bail because in allegedly leading the meth ring, he supplied guns, conspired with a gang leader, requested sexual favors for drugs and assaulted a law enforcement officer. Brun obtained meth from a leader of the United Samoan Organization gang and had the drugs mailed to Hawaii from California, prosecutors said. Another co-defendant is a convicted felon whom Brun used for protection, prosecutors said. Crystal meth is the drug of choice in Hawaii, where it’s known locally as “batu” or “ice.” Mailing or shipping drugs to Hawaii became more common with increased airport security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when it got more difficult to smuggle drugs through air travel.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Legislation significantly increasing what it will cost nonresidents to hunt deer and elk in Idaho has been signed into law by Gov. Brad Little. The Republican governor signed the measure Tuesday that the Idaho Department of Fish and Game said resident hunters asked for so there will be less overcrowding in the field. Fish and Game is doing that by capping how many nonresidents can hunt deer and elk. But that will result in reducing Fish and Game revenue with fewer nonresident hunters. Estimates put the loss at $5.4 million and $9 million a year. To make up for that, Fish and Game is increasing hunting and fishing costs for nonresidents. Most notably, the costs for elk and deer hunting are going up dramatically, which are the two most profitable areas for Idaho Fish and Game. An elk tag for a nonresident hunter would cost $650. A fishing license would cost about $106. The increases will go into effect on Dec. 1. Fish and Game officials said the increases are the first in 10 years for nonresidents and put the state more in line with what neighboring states charge nonresidents for hunting and fishing. About 39,000 nonresidents bought elk and deer tags in 2019.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Casey Urlacher, a brother of Chicago Bears Hall of Fame linebacker Brian Urlacher, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges alleging he was part of an offshore sports gambling business. Urlacher, the mayor of the suburban Chicago village of Mettawa, entered his plea with nine others in U.S. District Court. He is charged with conspiracy and running an illegal gambling business. Prosecutors alleged Urlacher and the others were part of a ring that raked in millions of dollars. Urlacher, 40, acted as an agent for the gambling ring. He is accused of recruiting bettors in exchange for a cut of their eventual losses. acting with Urlacher as an agent was Nicholas Stella, 42, a Chicago police officer, prosecutors said. Stella has been stripped of his police powers. Among the other “agents” charged were Matthew Knight, 46, of Mokena; Justin Hines, 40, of Algonquin; Todd Blanken, 43, of Cary; Matthew Namoff, 23, of Midlothian; Vasilios Prassas, 37, of Chicago; and Keith Benson, 49, of Lombard. The ring was headed by 54-year-old Vincent DelGiudice of Orland Park, who paid a Costa Rica-based sportsbook a service fee to use its online platform and recruited gamblers to place wagers on the website, according to prosecutors. DelGiudice pleaded not guilty during Wednesday’s hearing and was released on his own recognizance. DelGiudice’s father, Eugene, 84, was also charged. Urlacher was elected mayor of Mettawa in 2013 and re-elected four years later. He said at a village meeting this week he intended to stay on as mayor while he fights the charges. However, he did resign from his position on the Illinois Civil Service Commission, to which he was appointed in 2013 by then-Gov. Pat Quinn.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel:Hamilton County Parks officials believe a 10-year-old turtle named Sputnik was stolen from Cool Creek Nature Center and are appealing to his abductor to return him, no questions asked. “Don’t just release him in the wild, he wouldn’t be able to survive,” said Parks and Recreation Director Al Patterson. “Our only goal here is to get Sputnik safely back in his enclosure.” Authorities said Sputnik was last seen during feeding time on Feb. 15 but was not discovered missing until Feb. 18 after President’s Day. He lived in a 50-gallon glass case on a stand, about eye level for small children, and was apparently lifted out and smuggled through the doors. “Unfortunately, we can’t keep our eyes on everyone at all times,” Patterson said. Sputnik is described as 8 inches tall and 6 inches wide, weighing 11/ 2 pounds with a ruddy brown shell, four claws and a happy disposition. He needs vegetables daily and sunlight and is accustomed to regular veterinarian care. There are no security cameras at the center and leads about Sputnik’s whereabouts have been few, Patterson said. Anyone with information about the tortoise can call Cool Creek Nature Center at (317) 774-2500 or the county parks offices at (317) 770-4400.\n\nIowa\n\nDecorah:A bald eagle known as Mrs. North laid her third egg on March 4, according to a livestream by the Raptor Resource Project. The Project estimated that Mrs. North would lay her first egg between Feb. 17 and Feb. 23, and she ended up laying her first egg on Feb. 21 and the second on Feb. 24 – just as she did in 2019. The nest is high in a white oak tree on private property near a stream. Another bald eagle named Mom Decorah laid her first egg on Feb. 26 and second on Feb. 29. According to the Project, this likely will be Mom Decorah’s last egg of the 2020 season. She is almost 17 years old and has now laid 36 eggs on the property, the project said in a Facebook post. Mom Decorah is mated to Decorah Male Two. Her original mate disappeared in April 2018. Their nest is settled in a tree near a trout hatchery. According to the project, eggs typically hatch in about 35 days, so viewers could be seeing at least one eaglet from either Mrs. North or Mom Decorah by late March or early April. A livestream of the Decorah eagle nest, which began last June for this mating season and has been following the eagles for 10 years, is consistently watched by more than 1,000 people. To view the livestream, visit www.raptorresource.org/birdcams/decorah-eagles.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A private school was closed Thursday after thieves broke in and stole technology, sports uniforms and damaged at least 10 rooms. Police said thieves broke into Topeka Lutheran School early Thursday. The damage was discovered when teachers and staff arrived to work, WIBW reported. More than 20 laptops and Chromebooks, several iPads, food, a document camera, cash, a security storage system and sports uniforms were taken, police said. The school canceled classes Thursday so teachers and staff could clean up the damage.\n\nKentucky\n\nWhitesburg: Letcher County Schools has removed a Bible verse from an athletic locker room after receiving a complaint from the Freedom from Religion Foundation. The decision came after the organization sent a letter to the district stating that the message violated the Constitution, schools Superintendent Denise Yonts told WYMT-TV on Wednesday. Yonts said officials decided to paint over the verse after consulting with the school board attorney becuase it was not a student-generated display. Freedom from Religion Foundation co-president Annie Laurie Gaylor said in a statement that she applauded the action.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport:Bossier Parish deputy Verdis Walker was promoted to Command Sergeant Major of the Louisiana National Guard. “It’s been a long time in the making. This is my 30th year as a guardsman and I’ve reached the pinnacle in the enlisted ranks,” Walker said. The ceremony was held at the Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Training Academy because Walker is going through police training at the academy. He is set to graduate from the academy on April 24.During the ceremony, Walker expressed this thanks and appreciation to multiple people in the audience, including his mother and father, who sat in the front row. Walker graduated from Haughton High School in 1984 and enlisted in the Louisiana National Guard a few years later. He started in the Army band in Bossier City and then moved into the Recruit Sustainment Program to help recruits prepare for basic training. Later, he deployed to Baghdad, Iraq, with the 39th Military Police of Camp Minden. For his service there, Walker was awarded a Bronze Star. He was sworn into the Bossier Sheriff’s Office by Sheriff Julian Whittington in March 2019. As of August 2019, Walker was assigned to the Bossier Maximum Security Facility.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A proposal to beef up health insurance benefits for retired emergency responders has received the approval of a state legislative committee. The bill from Democratic Sen. Nate Libby is designed to make stronger the state’s law about the health insurance program for retired firefighters and law enforcement officers. The Labor and Housing Committee unanimously approved the proposal on Wednesday. A previous law sponsored by Libby created a change in which counties and municipalities that employ first responders must notify them of the Retired County and Municipal Law Enforcement Officers and Municipal Firefighters Health Insurance Program less than two months after they are hired. Libby’s new proposal makes changes such as removing the requirement of five years of contributions by enrollees. It also changes the percentage of gross wages for contributions. The bill must pass the full House of Representatives and Senate to become law.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A measure to extend the state’s sales tax to most professional services has been rejected by a House subcommittee on Wednesday night. The measure would have raised an estimated $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2025. It was proposed to pay the state’s share of a major education funding plan that is advancing in the legislature. However, the extension of the tax was widely opposed by Maryland business groups. Del. Eric Luedtke sponsored the bill. He said a House subcommittee has advanced a smaller package of revenue measures for the education proposal, which would be phased in over 10 years. The Montgomery County Democrat said on Twitter that officials will have more work to do in the future to fund later years in the education measure.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city’s first recreational marijuana shop – and the state’s first black-owned one – is set to open next week. The Cannabis Control Commission on Thursday authorized Pure Oasis to begin operations in three calendar days or later. The “commence operations” notice was the last administrative step needed after regulators awarded it a final license last month. Owners Kobie Evans and Kevin Hart said they plan to welcome the first customers to their storefront in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood at 11 a.m. Monday. Pure Oasis is the first store to open after participating in the state’s “equity” programs to help black, Latino and other businesses owners from communities impacted by the war on drugs enter the legal marijuana industry. Massachusetts has nearly 40 retail marijuana locations, but only one is in Greater Boston: New England Treatment Access, in the affluent suburb of Brookline. Black and Latino groups have voiced their frustration for months at the slow pace of approvals for minority-owned businesses in Massachusetts and nationwide. And in Boston, Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh has faced criticism for his city’s particularly slow rollout of pot shops since voters approved legalizing marijuana in 2016. On Wednesday, Walsh announced he had appointed five people to a new Cannabis Board meant to oversee the local approval process.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:Art Van Furniture, the metro Detroit-based company and the Midwest’s top furniture and mattress retailer, said it is shutting down and will begin liquidation sales at all of its company-owned stores in Michigan, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio. The shock announcement comes just three years after the company’s sale by the Van Elslander family to a private equity firm. Boston-based private-equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners bought a majority stake in Art Van Furniture in early 2017, about a year before the death of company founder Archie Van Elslander at age 87. Art Van is expected to declare bankruptcy early next week. The filing would be a Chapter 11 reorganization, yet could potentially result in the permanent closure and liquidation of all Art Van Furniture stores – unless one or more buyers step forward to rescue the retailer. The liquidation sales will begin Friday at all Art Van Furniture, Art Van PureSleep and Scott Shuptrine Interiors in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri, as well as select Levin & Wolf stores in Maryland and Virginia. The Art Van stores are to close in 60 days. Art Van has about 190 stores and about 3,100 employees. Twenty of the stores are franchise locations, situated in the company’s “outmarkets” including the Upper Peninsula, Alpena, Mount Pleasant and Owosso in Michigan and in Indiana.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSartell:Riders of the Metro Bus ConneX on-demand ride service could see fares double for the remainder of the program’s pilot phase this year. The Metro Bus Board of Commissioners will hold a public hearing on the proposed change at 3:30 p.m. March 17 at Sartell City Hall, according to a release from Metro Bus on Tuesday. After a period of public comment, the board will vote whether to increase the fare for a single ride from $1.25 to $2.50, effective April 1. Fares for regular bus routes and Dial-a-Ride service will remain unchanged, and the increase wouldn’t affect free transfers. The service began its pilot program in January 2019, and was originally scheduled to last six months. It has been extended twice and ran through the end of December. Beginning February, the service began reduced hours and expanded its service area into the portion of Sartell east of the Mississippi River. Riders on the ConneX service can call to request pickup, after which a bus picks them up and anyone else requesting the service along the way. The service drops off at destinations or connects to regular bus lines. The service replaced most of Route 32 to cut down on expenses from constantly moving empty buses. The pilot program will end Dec. 31, after which the board will decide whether to make it a permanent service.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: A man sentenced to 120 years in prison on a drug charge will soon be free. Circuit Judge Lee Howard freed 66-year-old Felix Wynn of Starkville during a hearing Tuesday at the Oktibbeha County Courthouse based on new sentencing guidelines, news outlets reported. Wynne was convicted in 2006 on two counts of selling cocaine. As a habitual offender, he was given 60 years for each count and a $2 million fine. Howard resentenced Wynne for the time he has served, 13 years and 10 months, and dropped the fine. Wynne will be held in the county jail until the Mississippi Department of Corrections processes his paperwork. His attorney, Roy A. Perkins, and the judge believe the paperwork process should take about four days. Perkins argued that the 120-year sentence was a misinterpretation of the law. Howard initially sentenced Wynn under a statute that orders the maximum sentence with no parole and no chance of early release, according to circuit court documents. Perkins said Howard was wrong to believe the maximum sentence was the only option, and he cited state Supreme Court precedent from 2017 that a person can, but does not have to, receive a double prison sentence for a second charge, the Commercial Dispatch reported. Wynne briefly spoke before the court during Tuesday’s hearing, during which he apologized and took full responsibility for the crime, WTVA-TV reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nUniversity City: A suburban St. Louis man accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people in a bustling entertainment district while dressed as the Batman villain the Joker has been charged with terrorism. Jeremy Garnier, 48, of University City was charged Tuesday with a felony count of making a terrorist threat. A judge ordered Garnier held without bail, with court documents noting that he was a “danger to the community.” Court records did not list an attorney who can speak on his behalf. The charging document doesn’t indicate whether he was in possession of any explosives or was otherwise armed. Police responded Monday night to the Blueberry Hill restaurant and music club in the Delmar Loop neighborhood in University City after receiving a call about an active shooter, according to the charging document. The charges said Garnier had made threats while dressed as the Joker. A nearly hourlong livestream posted to the Facebook account for a Jeremy Joseph Garnier showed a man dressed as the Joker, complete with makeup, talking to the camera in a bedroom where he is putting on a costume. He’s later seen driving in his car, smoking a pipe and going to the St. Louis Galleria shopping mall in Richmond Heights, where he’s stopped by security and asked to leave. The video then shows him talking about ending the country’s opioid epidemic before he enters the venue where he orders a soda, saying: “I can’t be inebriated when I’m planning on, you know, killing a bunch of people.” Within minutes, the man was handcuffed with the livestream still rolling. Garnier has eight burglary and stealing convictions dating to 1990.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman:A snowmobile trail groomer survived after accidentally triggering an avalanche on Feb. 27 and being swept in his vehicle about 165 feet downhill. Daniel Kristensen, 30, of Belgrade, president of the Gallatin Valley Snowmobile Association, was working his way up an old logging road in the Gallatin Canyon that climbs out of Storm Castle Creek up and over the divide to Swan Creek. At about 8 p.m., he was about 3 to 5 miles from finishing when he encountered a large drift across the road. Using the PistenBully snow groomer’s front blade, he began breaking up the drift, pushing the snow off the road on the downhill edge. It was a route he had driven once earlier this winter. While grading the ,snow Kristensen triggered an avalanche on the slope above him. It broke 2 to 3 feet deep and 100 feet wide before crashing downhill on a 38-degree slope. In the 470 feet before reaching the road, the snow picked up speed and grew larger before striking the groomer on the driver’s side. When the machine came to a stop against some pine trees, it was right-side up and still running. Snow filled three-quarters of the cab because all of the windows had been broken out. Kristensen said he took about 30 seconds to assess the situation: he was alive, no limbs seemed broken and there was no blood gushing. Yet his mind was still in disbelief about what had happened. If the avalanche had been larger, if logs or rocks had been tossed into the cab as it rolled, or if his arm had been thrust out the window when the machine tumbled, the situation could have been much worse. “I got so lucky,” Kristensen said. “It’s a blessing for me.” He said he has a sore neck from the crash and scratched up his hands digging through the glass-filled snow in search of his gloves, but other than that, he’s OK. The club will now reasses where they groom because the route he was on doesn’t get a lot of traffic.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Dangerous weather conditions for brush fires were forecast Thursday for much of the state, meteorologists said. A red flag warning from the National Weather Service said low humidity and wind gusts up to 45 mph were expected. Brush fires have blackened thousands of acres across Nebraska this week, officials said. Regional 26 emergency manager Alma Beland estimated that firefighters battled flames Monday on between 1,500 and 2,000 acres between Thedford and Stapleton. A blaze north of Lodgepole forced closure of U.S. Highway 30 for a time Wednesday. It was contained by 6 p.m., officials said. It’s not clear how many acres were charred.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Firefighters contained a blaze in an apartment building where two people were rescued by firefighters on ladders and a young child was dropped to safety from a third-floor window and caught by a passer-by Thursday. No injuries were reported. There was no immediate word on cause of the fire. Battalion Chief John McNamara said a fire truck on a nonemergency call diverted to the apartment building after firefighters spotted a large smoke column. Once there, they saw heavy smoke coming from second- and third-floor apartments. Arriving firefighters saw a crowd outside the building and a child being dangled out of a window, McNamara said. “Before they could stop them, the child was dropped and was caught. Then we threw some ground ladders up to the third floor windows and assisted the two residents out the windows,” he said. Other residents were evacuated without incident. Regarding possible injuries, it“made a huge difference” that the child was caught and that firefighters quickly rescued the two other people, he said. Firefighters quickly contained the fire but at least 12 units suffered damage, McNamara said. “It could have been a lot worse,” he said. Twelve fire trucks with approximately 50 firefighters responded to the three-alarm fire.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A female bear who journeyed thousands of miles to return home after being saved and relocated by Gov. Chris Sununu is preparing to emerge from her den with three new cubs. Sununu joined Fish and Game officials on Wednesday to check on “Mink,” who was set to be euthanized along with three of her offspring in 2017 after repeated problems with them feeding from trash and bird feeders culminated with two bears entering a home in Hanover. Sununu instead ordered them to be moved to far northern New Hampshire, but by last spring, Mink had found her way back to her preferred home near Dartmouth College. The bear is hibernating in a den in the same area. Sununu said her three male cubs weigh just over 6 pounds each and are all in good health. Mink’s three yearlings were moved soon after the public outcry over the euthanasia plan in 2017, but one was killed within weeks by a hunter in Quebec, Canada. Mink wasn’t captured then because she left town to mate and later returned with four cubs in 2018. She was fitted with a tracking collar in June of that year and moved about 120 miles north, but returned to Hanover last May after traveling thousands of miles in a looping route through New Hampshire and Vermont. Officials favoring euthanasia had argued the animals were no longer afraid of humans and likely would find new neighborhoods to frequent if moved, or would eventually find their way back to Hanover.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBridgewater Township:Two state troopers pulled a trucker to safety just seconds before his burning tractor-trailer exploded. Trooper Robert Tarleton had stopped a vehicle on Interstate 287 on Monday when he saw the truck become engulfed in flames after it hit a guardrail and bridge abutment, state police said. “He immediately returned the driver’s credentials and ran back to his troop car to request for fire and emergency medical services personnel to respond to the crash,” state police said. Tarleton drove to the scene of the crash, where State Police Lt. Edward Ryer, who was headed home from work, was trying to rescue the driver. Police body camera video showed the two troopers worked together to drag the trucker from the cab to safety seconds before it exploded. The driver sustained minor injuries. His name has not been released. The cause of the crash was under investigation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCuyamungue: A woman is facing a larceny charge after authorities said she stole a neighbor’s anatomical skeleton model that allegedly was making an offensive gesture toward her. Court documents filed Monday showed that Diana Hogrebe was charged with one count of larceny in connection with the skeleton heist, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. Hogrebe told Santa Fe County Sheriff’s deputies she was offended by the way the skeleton’s hand was posed – with the middle finger pointed up. Hogrebe told the Santa Fe New Mexican the episode was the culmination of a monthslong feud between her and neighbor Joseph Downs, who she said has hassled her family and other nearby residents. “I just, you know, had it,” Hogrebe said. “It was like the last straw that broke the camel’s back, and I don’t know what to do.” The skeleton has not been located, authorities said. According to the deputy’s statement of probable cause, the skeleton was a gift to Downs from a family member and was worth about $1,500.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A reptile breeder in upstate New York has paid a $500 fine related to the possession of more than 150 venomous snakes in his home, the state Department of Environmental Conservation said. The DEC said in a report that investigators got a warrant to search the Orange County home of Darren Paolini after the man was hospitalized for a venomous snake bite last June. He had been bitten by a Taiwanese pit viper at his home, where he had a sophisticated breeding operation in the basement. Officers seized 157 live venomous snakes and several years of breeding records from Paolini’s Newburgh home. The snakes, which included 29 species, were turned over to the Bronx Zoo. DEC said Paolini told an investigator he gets snakes from importers, breeds them and trades the babies for new snakes. Paolini pleaded guilty to misdemeanor commercialization of wildlife charges in February and agreed to pay a fine, DEC said. In June, Paolini told News12 Westchester that he had studied Asian pit vipers for 30 years and was an expert on breeding them. “It’s just been a love in my life. A passion since a young child,” he said. He said he had believed reptile permits he obtained in 2005 were still valid.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHillsborough: A federal inmate has died from injuries sustained in a fight with at least one fellow prisoner, authorities said. A verbal altercation between Maurice Antoine King, of Durham and at least one other inmate escalated late Wednesday at the Orange County Detention Center, a county sheriff’s spokeswoman said in a statement. King, 35, was taken to a hospital following the fight and was pronounced dead, the statement said. The other inmates involved were not immediately identified. Sheriff’s officials didn’t comment on the circumstances leading to the fight or the nature of King’s injuries. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office was continuing to investigate.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: State regulators voted Wednesday to reject a permit for a proposed wind farm in Ward and McLean counties. The Public Service Commission denied the permit for Southern Power’s Ruso Wind project by a 2-1 vote, the Bismarck Tribune reported. But the commission left open the possibility of reconsidering the project. The project had difficulties complying with a 2017 state law requiring new technology to stop lights atop the turbines from blinking red all night. Southern Power planned to use radar-based light-mitigating technology, which would have turned off the lights at night except for when aircraft pass in the vicinity of the turbines. But the Minot Airforce Base raised concerns that the blinking lights could tip off an enemy to a helicopter’s location – the Air Force flies hundreds of helicopter missions annually to intercontinental ballistic missile sites, some near the proposed turbines. Others complained that flashing red lights would ruin the dark night sky. A message left with Southern Power was not immediately returned to the Associated Press.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The city’s police chief will not discipline a police supervisor who detained a 12-year-old black youth’s sister the day the youth was fatally shot by a white police officer while playing with a pellet gun. Cleveland.com reported that Chief Calvin Williams dismissed the civilian complaint against Sgt. Janell Rutherford on Monday. Cleveland police Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said the decision would not become official until the end of a 30-day period during which an appeal can be made to the city’s Public Safety Director. The city’s Civilian Police Review Board had recommended in November that Rutherford receive an unpaid suspension of six to 10 days for keeping Tamir Rice’s 14-year-old sister, in the back of a police cruiser for over an hour after Tamir was shot in November 2014. Rice’s sister filed the complaint against Rutherford in 2015. Subodh Chandra, an attorney for the Rice family, issued a statement that said the children’s mother, Samira, “is no longer shocked by the unwillingness of the police chief to hold anyone accountable, but she is disappointed.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Voters rejected a citizens’ initiative for a dedicated parks sales tax largely on the strength of voters’ opposition in Cleveland and Canadian counties, The Oklahoman reported. The loss was a blow to former Ward 2 Councilman Ed Shadid, who promoted the initiative campaign that collected nearly 8,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot. Former Ward 4 Councilman Pete White ran a shoestring campaign to pass the initiative. The campaign was a rare case of citizen legislating in Oklahoma City. Only five previous citizens’ initiatives had made it to the ballot since 1930. All five were approved. Two of those, in 1989 and 1990, created dedicated sales tax revenue streams for public safety and for the Oklahoma City Zoo.\n\nOregon\n\nKlamath Falls: Because of low snow pack and precipitation, Gov. Kate Brown signed an executive order this week declaring a drought in Klamath County. Brown issued a drought declaration saying that the extremely low water supply is causing natural and economic disaster conditions heading into spring and summer, the Capital Press reported. The declaration gives state agencies the ability to expedite water management tools such as emergency water permits, exchanges, substitutions and in-stream leases to mitigate conditions on the ground. Snowpack is 35% below normal in the Klamath Basin as of March 4, according to the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. Mountain snow is crucial because it acts as a natural reservoir, replenishing streams and lakes during the irrigation season. Neighboring Rogue and Umpqua basins in Southern Oregon are also lagging behind typical nowpack , as are the Lake County and Goose Lake areas. Ken Stahr, surface water hydrology manager at the Oregon Water Resources Department, serves as co-chair of the state’s Drought Readiness Council, which considers requests from counties for drought aid. He said no other counties have filed applications yet, though now is the time of year when communities might begin to sense the impacts of drought.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State troopers will now be allowed to have tattoos on their arms, but those who do will have to wear long-sleeved uniform shirts that conceal them when they are on duty, the agency announced Wednesday. In a statement, Col. Robert Evanchick, the state police commissioner, said the policy change reflects an “evolving public perception” about tattoos. The agency hopes the new policy will widen its field of potential recruits. Before Wednesday’s announcement, troopers could have tattoos, as long as they were not visible to the public. Troopers still cannot have tattoos that are above their neckline or below their wrist, the state police said. Tattoos that could be seen as hateful or discriminatory toward any race, national origin, gender, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity are prohibited. A committee will review tattoos on prospective cadets during the hiring process.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A man authorities have said is the leader of the Rhode Island chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club will remain behind bars after failing to “keep the peace” while out on bail. Superior Court Magistrate Richard Raspallo ordered Joseph Lancia, 28, of Smithfield to be locked up after being arrested over the weekend for a scuffle at a strip club, WPRI reported Wednesday. He was charged with disorderly conduct and simple assault in connection with a fight late Saturday night outside the Cadillac Lounge after a Providence police officer said he witnessed Lancia punch someone, knocking him unconscious. At the time, he was out on a $100,000 bail in a separate case after he was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly firing a gun at a truck as the driver was passing by the Hells Angels headquarters. Prosecutors at Tuesday’s hearing said that the Saturday night brawl broke the terms of his bail and asked that he remain in custody. His attorney, Joseph Voccola, said security video showed his client was coming to the defense of his fellow club members when he punched the off-duty member of the strip club’s security team. The judge ordered Lancia to be held without bail. He is due back in court on March 10.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLancaster: Two people were accused of having 10 dead dogs and 26 malnourished animals on their property. Steppes Stagvelt Starwolf, 62, and Stevie Jenna Starwolf, 53, have been charged with ill treatment of animals, news outlets reported. The relationship between the pair was not stated. The dead and sick animals were found Friday during a welfare check at a home in Lancaster, according to a news release from the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office. Ten dog carcasses were found in a trash bag outside the house, the sheriff’s office said. No one answered the front door when officers arrived, but officials obtained a search warrant and entered the home. Authorities said 25 huskies and a cat were inside the house, some in cages. “None of the animals had accessible food or water, and all appeared to be malnourished and in ill health,” the release stated. Both suspects returned to the home Friday night with another dog in their vehicle. They appeared before a magistrate on Saturday. Both were released after posting $10,000 bond. It was unclear whether they had attorneys to comment on their behalf. The sheriff’s office said all of the animals were taken to a shelter for treatment.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A proposal to give South Dakotans the option to take the written portion of driver’s license examinations in Spanish is headed to a final vote in the House after a committee approved it Thursday. Proponents from the Latino community in South Dakota told lawmakers it would empower them to get to work, take their kids to school and participate in community events. A similar proposals died last year, but the measure this year appears to have broad support, including from business groups. It has passed in the Senate. Alex Ramirez, a member of the Hispanic Business Network in Sioux Falls, said South Dakota is one of three states that does not allow driver’s license exams to be taken in Spanish. It has sent a message to Latinos that they are not welcome in the state, he said. Sen. V.J. Smith, a Brookings Republican who introduced the bill, said he has had to overcome attitudes from constituents and some lawmakers that people should only speak English. He pointed out that there are German-speaking communities in the state. The House Transportation committee passed the bill on an 8-3 vote. Lawmakers opposed to the measure said drivers should be able to read road signs in English.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two mobile units have been deployed to help residents who lost state driver’s licenses or photo identification in severe storms that ravaged Tennessee counties this week. Tennessee’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security said Wednesday that mobile units that can issue duplicate licenses or photo IDs have been sent to Nashville in Davidson County and Cookeville in Putnam County.Fees for duplicate licenses or IDs will be waived, officials said. Meanwhile, Tennessee’s Department of Commerce and Insurance has set up a facility at Centennial SportsPlex in Nashville to answer questions about insurance policies and storm coverage. Major insurance carriers will be in attendance also for people to make claims in person, officials said. Officials are also helping residents with insurance questions at the Wilson County Emergency Management Center in Lebanon and the Putnam County 911 Center in Cookeville. State emergency officials said 24 people died when fast-moving storms crossed Tennessee early Tuesday. Eighteen of them, including five preteen children, died in Putnam County, some 80 miles east of Nashville. Eighty-eight more were injured in the county.\n\nTexas\n\nPort Arthur: A 24-year-old man was sentenced Wednesday to 30 days in jail for posting on social media a video last August of himself removing an ice cream container from a Texas market freezer, licking the contents and returning the container to the freezer. D’Adrien Anderson, 24, also was sentenced to an additional six-month jail term probated for two years and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $1,565 in restitution to Blue Bell Creameries, which had to replace all of its products in the freezer. Anderson began serving his jail term immediately after sentencing. The incident happened Aug. 26 at a Walmart in Port Arthur. Store surveillance cameras showed that he finally took the Blue Bell ice cream from the freezer and bought it, which wasn’t captured in the social media video, authorities said. Anderson could have been sentenced to up to a year in jail and fined $4,000 for misdemeanor criminal mischief. Port Arthur is about 85 miles east of Houston.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Brigham Young University reiterated Wednesday that “same-sex romantic behavior” is not allowed on campus – dashing the hopes of LGTBTQ students who thought they could be more open after the college previously revised its code of conduct. The university, owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, posted a letter online, saying it was clarifying a misinterpretation after it dropped a section of the code banning behavior that reflected “homosexual feelings.” A college administrator wrote that the recent revision doesn’t change the “moral standards” of the church or the faith’s opposition to same-sex marriage. The letter and an accompanying Q&A posted online don’t provide details about what romantic behaviors are and aren’t allowed, but seem to shut the door on the notion that gay and lesbian couples will be allowed to kiss and hold hands on campus like their heterosexual classmates. “Same-sex romantic behavior cannot lead to eternal marriage and is therefore not compatible with the principles included in the honor code,” wrote Paul V. Johnson, commissioner of the church education system. BYU officials said on Feb. 19 that questions about permitted behaviors by same-sex couples would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but the issue hadn’t been addressed again until the letter was released Wednesday. The clarification letter caused fury and heartbreak among LGBTQ students and allies, said former BYU student Addison Jenkins, a past president of a campus support group for gay and lesbian students. He called it “cruel” to dash the hopes of LGBTQ students who felt the campus climate would become more welcoming, and then two weeks later issue this new letter that shows “anti-queer rules” remain.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: Twelve towns have voted to become founding members of a regional communications group to spread high-speed internet to underserved neighborhoods. Residents approved their town’s participation in the Southern Vermont Communications Union District this week, the Bennington Banner reported Wednesday. Tim Scoggins, the head of the task force that worked to create the group, said the new internet system will likely be in place within three to five years. The group plans to form a governing board made up of representatives from each member town. The board is expected to meet in April. The towns included in the group are Arlington, Bennington, Dorset, Landgrove, Manchester, Peru, Pownal, Rupert, Sandgate, Shaftsbury, Sunderland and Woodford.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: For the fourth year in a row, nature lovers will be able to watch a livestream of a peregrine falcon nest in downtown Richmond. The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries has set up a live video feed of the nest on the 21st floor of the Riverfront Plaza building. The feed is available for viewing online at www.dgif.virginia.gov/falcon-cam. The department said in a news release that wildlife officials have confirmed that last year’s new male – identifiable by his bands – is back again with an unbanded female. In the past two years, there has been a lot of turnover in falcons at the site and no nesting, although the birds have appeared on camera. Officials said the return of the male falcon is a sign of some stability, and they are optimistic that the pair will breed successfully. The department, which manages the threatened birds, has collaborated for the last four years with Comcast Business to provide connectivity for the live broadcast. March is typically a busy month as falcons tend to nest during this time following a period of courtship, with the first egg laid around mid- to late-March. The falcon cam will remain live until July.\n\nWashington\n\nMoses Lake: A police dog had his left removed during surgery after being shot while chasing a suspect, authorities said. The suspect led police officers on a car chase for several miles Feb. 28 before getting out of the vehicle and running away, KING-TV reported. The suspect was pursued by an officer and his police dog partner, Chief, authorities said. The suspect shot Chief in the eye during the pursuit before officers returned fire, fatally shooting the suspect, police said. Chief initially needed a breathing tube, but was stabilized and treated over a few days by veterinarians at Washington State University. The bullet destroyed Chief’s eye and broke his jaw, but did not cause other permanent damage, health officials said. Chief had eye-removal surgery Wednesday before going home to recover, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State officials announced a restoration project was underway to bring back bobwhite quail, which disappeared from the state in the late 1970s because of habitat destruction and harsh winters. The five-year plan launched last week when 48 of the birds were captured in Texas and released at the Tomblin Wildlife Management Area, news outlets reported. The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources was working with the Texas Parks and Wildlife agency on the plan, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Transmitters have been placed on some of the quail for monitoring. The goal is to create “a self-sustaining population” of quail, said Michael Peters, DNR Game Bird and Small Game Project Leader, in the release. The restoration effort has been underway for the past several years. The state DNR acquired the Tomblin WMA, a 32,000-acre tract of former surface-mined land in Logan and Mingo counties, in 2015.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Part of a city-owned closed landfill at 1600 E. College Ave. near Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport will be dedicated to generating solar power, under a resolution adopted by the Common Council. Aldermen on Tuesday unanimously approved leasing to We Energies about 8 acres, where the company will build and operate a 2.25-megawatt solar array through its Solar Now pilot program. The lease lasts 20 years. The resolution states that revenue from the lease “is intended” to be put toward other climate action initiatives. The lease payments will depend on what’s generated, but they’re estimated to be between $90,000 and $100,000 each year, Ald. Scott Spiker said. The city won’t pay anything to build or maintain the solar array, he said. It will be built next to the 128th Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard, and in an emergency, the solar field would provide a source of energy for the base should something happen to the electrical grid.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Actor Harrison Ford and rapper Kanye West will take part in a celebrity softball game for charity in Wyoming. The game June 13 in Cody will raise money for cancer research, organizer Ryan Brown told the Casper Star-Tribune. Other confirmed players include former Denver Broncos football players Byron Chamberlain, Spencer Larsen and Shawn Moore, said Brown, athletics director for the city of Cody and host of a local radio show. “The crazy thing is they don’t know who I am,” Brown said. “They’re just like, ‘Yeah, I’m in.’ It’s just amazing how people jump on stuff like this.” Tickets for the game and related events can be purchased online for as low as $2.24. Sponsorships range from $50 to $5,000. Ford is best known for his roles in the “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” movie franchises. He has a home in Jackson.

The Alabama Historical Association has elected Wetumpka native Frazine Taylor as president for the upcoming year. Taylor, who works in the archives department at Alabama State University in Montgomery, was also presented with an award recognizing her contributions to Alabama history. Taylor, chair of the Black Heritage Council of the Alabama Historical Commission is known for her expertise in genealogical research and African American history. She was elected during the association’s recent statewide meeting in Tuscaloosa. The organization publishes a quarterly review and oversees a program of roadside historical markers.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State environmental officials have launched the first ambient air quality study in the capital city in more than a decade to determine if air is being affected by cruise ships or other sources. The state will collect data from 21 monitors installed in late April around downtown Juneau, the Juneau Empire reports. The devices use lasers to measure particulate and report online in near-real time. They will remain in place through October. Fine particulate is tiny particles that can be inhaled and at high levels can cause health problems including respiratory illness, aggravated asthma, heart attacks and premature death. In the Fairbanks North Star Borough, where people burn wood as an alternative to expensive fuel oil, fine particulate is a perennial winter problem.\n\nArizona\n\nGrand Canyon National Park: Scenic State Route 67 will reopen Wednesday in time for the summer season of hikers, backpackers, and tourists visiting the remote North Rim of the Grand Canyon. The area closes from mid-October through mid-May each year because of heavy snowfall, more than 9 feet during an average winter, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. When the national park lodge, campground, visitor center and restaurants reopen toward the end of spring, so does SR 67, the winding 31-mile road lined by pines and aspens that connects Jacobs Lake to the Kaibab Plateau. Only about 10% of Grand Canyon visitors go to the North Rim, but enthusiasts willing to make the extra travel are rewarded with a more intimate experience, says Grand Canyon National Park spokesperson Kris Fister.\n\nArkansas\n\nPonca: For the fourth year in a row, the Buffalo National River will host a free concert by band National Park Radio, on June 15 at Steel Creek Campground. The modern folk band from Harrison, Arkansas, is known for its hopeful, heartfelt lyrics with themes about life, love and difficult choices, echoing the band’s deep-seated roots in the Ozark Mountains. Music will begin at 6 p.m. near the boat launch at Steel Creek Campground. Free parking is available on site, but National Park Service officials advise concertgoers to carpool to minimize traffic and associated resource impacts. The annual event is sponsored by the Buffalo National River Partners, a nonprofit dedicated to the promotion, appreciation, preservation and protection of America’s first national river.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Officials say a planned subway project that will connect three rail lines downtown has been delayed again. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority says the new completion date for the Regional Connector is mid-March 2022. Rail service is scheduled to begin five months after that. The agency’s initial target date was December 2020, but that was delayed by a year in 2017 as officials increased the budget to $1.75 billion. The Los Angeles Times reports Sunday that the latest delay comes as the contractor grapples with labor shortages. The project requires nearly 4 miles of excavation for two tunnels and three subway stations. The twin tunnels are designed to connect three lines into two mega-routes that will allow passengers to ride long distances without changing trains.\n\nColorado\n\nBreckenridge: A huge wooden troll has found a new home in this ski town. The Summit Daily reports that the troll has been relocated to a spot behind an ice arena in the south end of Breckenridge. The troll’s creator, Danish artist Thomas Dambo, visited the location Friday to affix a heart-shaped stone to the troll’s wooden body. It was originally assembled beside a trail last summer for a festival, but it was so popular with visitors that nearby homeowners complained about the crowds. It was taken down in November. The troll, named Isak Heartstone, stands 15 feet high. The site is not open to the public yet. The town is building a trail and surrounding amenities, which are expected to open by early June.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation that could lead to the production of industrial hemp in the state. The Democrat says the new law will provide farmers an opportunity to “bolster their profits with hemp.” He says it will also attract veteran and first-time farmers to a new and growing market. The legislation passed both the state House of Representatives and Senate by unanimous votes. Under the new law, the Connecticut Department of Agriculture is required to establish a pilot program for growing or cultivating industrial hemp. The federal government recently allowed states to grow, use or sell the product, which proponents say has thousands of uses. Connecticut’s regulations will ultimately need federal approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state House is set to vote on a bill that largely prohibits retailers from providing single-use carryout plastic bags to customers. The bill slated for a vote Tuesday is aimed at cutting down on the amount of plastic bags cluttering landfills, littering roadways and clogging stormwater systems. The bill applies to stores with more than 7,000 square feet of sales space and chain stores with three or more locations having at least 3,000 square feet of sales space. Restaurants are excluded from the bag ban, which also allows exceptions for bags used to wrap meat, fish, flowers or plants or that contain unwrapped food items. You could also still carry a goldfish home from a pet store or your laundry from the dry cleaners in plastic bags.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The nation’s capital has the highest use of drugs in the entire country, according to a new report from the personal finance website Wallethub, WUSA-TV reports. The district scored a 59.95 on a 100-point scale by Wallethub’s metrics, ranking as No. 1 for the highest use of drugs and addiction. According to the findings of the report, the District of Columbia also ranked in the top five for highest use of drugs by adults and teenagers. In order to determine which states have the biggest drug problems, WalletHub compared the 50 states and D.C. in three categories: drug use and addiction, law enforcement, and drug health issues and rehab.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A quiet South Beach neighborhood has become a battleground between preservationists and homeowners who want more freedom over their properties. Residents of leafy Palm View are divided over a push to repeal the area’s historic designation, which protects the neighborhood’s Mediterranean Revival homes and low-rise apartment buildings from demolition. But it also limits property owners’ ability to build more resilient structures, and residents say flooding in the area is getting worse. South Florida is expected to see 1 to 2 feet of sea level rise by 2060, according to a projection from the Southeast Florida Climate Compact. In Palm View, some residents say being able to build newer, more resilient structures has become increasingly important. The neighborhood borders the Collins Canal.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group of students from Spelman and Morehouse colleges who’ve been studying Michelle Obama’s memoir, “Becoming,” had a surprise visitor to discuss the work – the former first lady herself. Obama came to Spelman to talk with the students Saturday about the best-selling book ahead of her sold-out appearance Saturday night at State Farm Arena in downtown Atlanta. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Obama encouraged the 18 students to have faith in themselves, saying she learned through her eight years in the White House and elsewhere that she is as smart and capable as the well-educated and famous leaders she encountered.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: U.S. lawmakers representing the state want a large-scale study conducted on the impact sunscreen chemicals have on humans and coral reefs around the world. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono, along with Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., last week introduced the Oxybenzone and Octinoxate Impact Study Act of 2019, which would require the Environmental Protection Agency to study the impacts of the chemicals on human and the environment. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard also introduced the act along with the Reef Safe Act of 2019 that would require the Food and Drug Administration to develop standards for the “Reef Safe” designation in over-the-counter sunscreens. Last year, Hawaii enacted a law banning the sale or distribution of over-the-counter sunscreens containing oxybenzone and octinoxate.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Two city parks are being renamed to honor Native Americans from the local past. Idaho Press reports the Boise City Council voted unanimously on the name changes last week. Now Quarry View Park will be renamed Eagle Rock Park, and Castle Rock Reserve will be renamed Chief Eagle Eye Reserve. The council also voted unanimously on a resolution that reasserts the city’s directives to honor contributing contributions to the area by indigenous people. Eagle Rock is the traditional name of a balancing rock above Quarry View Park, and it’s a significant site for tribes in what is now Treasure Valley. Eagle Eye was chief of a band of 70 Weiser Shoshone who moved to the mountains of Idaho secretly in 1878 instead of relocating to a reservation.\n\nIllinois\n\nUrbana: The University of Illinois is planning to name its Micro and Nanotechnology Lab after an engineering visionary who created the first practical LED. Professor emeritus Nick Holonyak Jr., a UI engineering alumnus, found a new alloy in 1962 that would emit light in the red segment of the visible spectrum. Energy-saving LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, are now universal and used in everything from flashlights and electronics to spacecraft. UI trustees will vote this week on whether to name the UI Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory in Holonyak’s honor, the News-Gazette reports. UI College of Engineering officials say very few graduates in UI’s 152-year history have had as much influence as the Franklin County native.\n\nIndiana\n\nPorter: Indiana Dunes National Park says visitors can reserve campsites, beginning Wednesday. In past years, all 66 sites at Dunewood campground were available on a first-come, first-served basis. Under the new system, 34 sites can be reserved up to six months in advance. The remaining 32 sites will remain first-come, first-served. The price is $25 per night. The campground is open April through October. An online reservation system goes live at 9 a.m. CDT Wednesday. For more information, contact the park’s information desk at (219) 395-1882, or visit its website. The park covers 15,000 acres along the southern shore of Lake Michigan in northwestern Indiana.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Officials say a dog disease that can be passed to humans has been confirmed in the state. The state veterinarian, Dr. Jeff Kaisand, says several cases of canine brucellosis have been confirmed at a commercial breeding facility for small dogs in Marion County. The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship says it is notifying people who have custody of the exposed dogs. Both the animals and the facilities are quarantined while the dogs undergo testing. Signs of the disease in a dog include infertility, spontaneous abortions and stillbirths. State health officials say symptoms for humans include fever, sweats, headache, joint pain and weakness. The department says the threat to most pet owners is very low. Dog breeders and veterinary staff may be at higher risk.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: Nurse practitioners are fighting to get rid of the state requirement that they get permission to work from a physician. KCUR-FM reports Kansas is one of the few states that still make advanced practice nurses sign contracts with doctors. Physicians argue the contracts are to protect patients by ensuring that nurses collaborate with their more educated colleagues. But nurses are fighting back against the contracts, which they say limit patient options and can even give doctors a cut of their earnings for little to no work. A bill seeking to drop the collaborative contract requirement died in a legislative maneuver this year. But nurse practitioners hope to try again, offering to make new nurse practitioners work a few years before dropping their contracts with doctors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: In the past three years, the state has made great strides toward addressing food insecurity in distressed rural communities – and it’s become a model for other states looking to try new solutions. Earlier this year, Kentucky hosted the first-ever Summit on Rural Child Hunger, organized by the national No Kid Hungry campaign. The state was selected in part because of its Hunger Initiative, launched by Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles in 2016. Since it began, the initiative has donated more than 150 refrigerated coolers and freezers to dozens of food pantries statewide; created an economic incentive for summer meal programs, encouraging the purchase of more fruits and vegetables from local farmers; and advocated for the continued funding of the Farm to Food Banks Trust Fund, which awards grants to eligible nonprofit organizations that provide food to low-income Kentuckians.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A federal judge has conditionally dismissed a lawsuit that claimed three ailing death row inmates in the state were being subjected to cruel and unusual punishment through high heat indexes. The Advocate reports attorneys for the inmates and the state Department of Corrections jointly requested to dismiss the 2013 civil rights lawsuit. U.S. District Judge Brian Jackson ruled in 2016 that cell heat indexes exceeding 88 degrees constitute cruel and unusual punishment, but the ruling was overturned because it defined a maximum heat index. The conditional dismissal requires Louisiana to remain in “substantial compliance” with an agreement it signed last year. That agreement requires the inmates to have daily showers, individual ice containers and fans, water faucets in their cells and other cooling techniques.\n\nMaine\n\nSaint George: A state agency has been awarded $1 million to help acquire an island in the state’s midcoast area for conservation. The U.S. Department of the Interior’s National Coastal Wetland Conservation Grants program is making the money available to help preserve Clark Island in the Saint George area. Democratic Rep. Chellie Pingree says the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife will work with Maine Coast Heritage Trust on the conservation project. Pingree says the money will be used to buy 168 acres of Clark Island. The acres abut an existing 250-acre state conservation easement in Saint George. Pingree says the preservation of the site will protect habitat for birds and allow for recreational opportunities.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan signed a first-in-the-nation measure Monday to make it easier for people without health insurance to find out if they qualify for low-cost insurance after they file their taxes. The new law will create a box for people to check on state income tax returns. If it’s checked, the state’s health care exchange will see if the person qualifies for Medicaid, based on information in the tax return, and those who are eligible will be enrolled automatically. The exchange will reach out to people who qualify for private coverage. Hogan, a Republican, highlighted bipartisan work in the Democrat-controlled General Assembly on other health-related measures he signed Monday. One of them raises the smoking age from 18 to 21 and includes vaping in the definition of tobacco products.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A proposed $2 billion wind farm planned for federal waters off Martha’s Vineyard has been awarded a key permit by a state board responsible for reviewing proposed large energy facilities. The Massachusetts Energy Facilities Siting Board last week approved requests filed by Vineyard Wind for the construction and operation of the 84-turbine, 800-megawatt wind farm about 14 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard off the Massachusetts Coast. Project officials call the permit approval a significant milestone toward the wind farm’s construction. In February the project also received a key approval from Rhode Island regulators after the state’s Coastal Resources Management Council determined the project is consistent with state policies.\n\nMichigan\n\nDearborn: An exhibition at the Henry Ford Museum of American Innovation in suburban Detroit is offering a glimpse into the world of “Star Trek.” Titled “Star Trek: Exploring New Worlds,” the exhibition runs through Sept. 2 at the museum in Dearborn. It offers a look at more than 100 artifacts and props from the original TV series and its spinoffs. It also explores its enduring impact on culture, from arts and technology to fashion and literature. The traveling exhibition from Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture includes a tricorder, communicator and phaser from the original series. It also features artifacts from the “Star Trek” films and original set pieces, including a navigation console and costumes. The exhibition is a collaboration involving CBS Consumer Products, which manages licensing and merchandizing for the network.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBrainerd: A University of Minnesota study links the decline of walleye in Mille Lacs Lake to a loss of habitat resulting from clearer water. Minnesota Public Radio reports the study was published in the journal Ecosphere. Lead author Gretchen Hansen says researchers used 30 years of data on the lake’s water clarity and temperature to estimate how walleye habitat has changed. Walleye prefer low light and cooler water. But in recent decades, Mille Lacs’ water clarity has increased, most likely due to septic system improvements around the lake and the invasion of zebra mussels. Hansen says that has reduced walleye habitat. The study suggests that altering annual harvest levels based on changing water clarity and temperature could help sustain the walleye population. State officials currently base limits on the estimated number of fish in the lake.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A local chef has won a major culinary award after five previous nominations. The James Beard Foundation last week named Vishwesh Bhatt of Snackbar in Oxford as its 2019 winner for best chef in the foundation’s South region. Bhatt tells The Oxford Eagle winning was “just an incredible feeling.” He’s thanking Oxford restauranteur John Currence, whose City Grocery Restaurant Group owns Snackbar, City Grocery and other restaurants in Oxford. Bhatt also attributes his success to the restaurant’s staff. Bhatt has been the lead chef at Snackbar since it opened in 2009.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A popular animal at the St. Louis Zoo is celebrating a milestone birthday: Merah the Sumatran orangutan is 50 years old. Merah reached the half-century mark Monday. She was born May 13, 1969, at a zoo in the Netherlands. She came to St. Louis in 1992. Merah is a five-time mother, the grandmother of two and great-grandmother of one. The zoo says that when Merah gave birth to Ginger in 2014 at age 45, she became the oldest Sumatran orangutan in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Orangutan Species Survival Plan to give birth and rear her offspring. Sumatran, Bornean and Tapanuli orangutan species are classified as critically endangered due to habitat loss. The zoo says fewer than 125,000 orangutans remain in the wild.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A vintage plane restored by volunteers has lifted off for the first time in nearly 20 years. The Missoulian reports that the 75-year-old Dakota DC-3 known as Miss Montana flew over Missoula on a test flight Sunday. It was the first time it was airborne since arriving in 2001. Volunteers have been working hard to get the former firefighting plane ready to travel to France for the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Miss Montana is scheduled to participate in a re-enactment of the invasion, including dropping jumpers from Montana. A send-off gala Saturday night raised money to cover its fuel costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Landowners are seeking new solutions for a phenomenon millions of years old. Tons of sand, sediment and silt – some in dunes as high as 10 feet – have been scattered across the eastern half to two-thirds of the state by flooding in March. In some areas, washed-out cornstalks are 3 to 4 feet deep. Tree limbs are in piles, and topsoil has been washed away. “We have a mountain of sand piled up,” Valley farmer Ryan Ueberrhein told the Omaha World-Herald. Sediment from Nebraska’s rivers and streams has been deposited on nearby flooded land for millions of years. Now U.S. Department of Agriculture officials, University of Nebraska-Lincoln Extension specialists and extension educators are trying to figure out what to do with it. They’re racing against the clock because farmers need to plant, and ranchers need grass pastures to graze their cattle.\n\nNevada\n\nElko: Dozens of volunteers in the state’s northeast plan to return to an 80-year-old youth camp site next month to begin a $1 million rebuilding effort in the wake of an explosive wildfire. Elko Lions Club members who’ve launched a fundraising drive for Camp Lamoille hope to reopen it next year in the rugged Ruby Mountains, where the camp was established by the Boy Scouts of America southeast of Elko in 1939. Ten of the 16 buildings were lost in the fire last fall, including the historic lodge, six A-frame cabins and three storage units. So far, the Lions Club has raised about $343,000 of the estimated total cost of rebuilding through fundraisers, insurance proceeds, and other individual and corporate donations.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The schedule is set for a weeklong celebration of the Statehouse’s bicentennial. While various events have been held in recent years, the formal celebration starts Sunday, June 2, with an opening ceremony, re-enactments of the first Statehouse session in 1819 and tours of the building. On Monday, there will be special roundtable discussions featuring former governors and executive councilors. Tuesday’s schedule features the state Supreme Court hearing oral arguments in Representative’s Hall and an event highlighting the history of the Statehouse press corps. Wednesday is devoted to the state’s cultural heritage and arts, while Thursday will be Homecoming Day for former lawmakers. A “New Hampshire Made” street market Friday and closing ceremonies Saturday round out the celebrations the first week in June.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPalmyra: The sighting of an invasive spotted lanternfly at Palmyra Cove in Burlington County has brought attention from the state and U.S. agriculture departments. After one of the insects was spotted in November, the U.S. Department of Agriculture followed up with an inspection, finding and removing a spotted lanterfly egg mass on a perimeter trail, says Kristina Merola, director of natural sciences and park manager at Palmyra Cove. This month, as the insects’ hatching season approaches, crews from the NJDA began working in Palmyra Cove, the vast labyrinth of wetlands and woodlands beneath the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge. They’re marking Ailanthus trees, which are a crucial host for the spotted lanterfly species. State crews are then treating the trees with herbicide, Merola says. The intruding bugs pose a threat to entire agricultural industries.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: School districts have become increasingly reliant on substitutes as they contend with a growing number vacant teaching positions in the state. Districts needing to fill vacancies have turned to hiring substitute teachers, particularly long-term substitutes. Some of those substitutes have spent years in a classroom as temporary educators. School district leaders say it’s a necessary step as they deal with hundreds of vacant positions across the state. Still, they express concerns about the challenges that come with hiring substitute teachers who typically are not certified and do not build lesson plans or meet with parents. A New Mexico State University report says the state had about 740 vacant teaching positions last year, more than double the 300 vacancies reported in 2017.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Lady Liberty is ready to reveal the biggest upgrade to her island home since she first raised her torch in 1886. More than two years after breaking ground, and funded by a $100 million public campaign, the new Statue of Liberty Museum opens Thursday. The 26,000-square-foot museum, loaded with historic relics and interactive exhibits, rises uphill from the central pedestrian mall on Liberty Island, which receives some 4.5 million visitors annually. Built on the New Jersey-facing side of the island, terraced steps, made of the same Stony Creek granite used to build the statue base, lead to a 14,000-square-foot green roof, seeded with native grasses. From there, visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the Upper Bay between New York and New Jersey and, of course, Lady Liberty herself.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Carolina Hurricanes have been rolling at home ever since their newly acquired grunter named Hamilton started hogging the corner. Not defenseman Dougie Hamilton – Hamilton the pig. The 90-pound Juliana potbelly who catches games from behind the boards in a personalized wagon has shown plenty of chops during his three-week run as the team’s unofficial good-luck charm. In the land of pulled pork barbecue, this pig pulls for the Hurricanes. “He’s like this little internet sensation that caught on,” says his owner, Raleigh real estate broker Kyle Eckenrode. “People just love it when we bring him out. It’s really crazy to watch it all unfold.” The Hurricanes can’t argue with the results: Ever since Hamilton began hanging out, the players haven’t lost with their prized pig in the building.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Capitol will soon welcome its visitors with a new public entrance. The Bismarck Tribune reports that state lawmakers have approved $2 million to remodel the Capitol building’s only public entrance before the next legislative session in January 2021. The entrance is accessed through a tunnel that’s long been closed to vehicle traffic. Sen. Ray Holmberg says the tunnel would cause winter winds and extreme cold to seep into the Capitol’s ground floor. The state’s facilities management director, John Boyle, says the plan calls for enclosing the tunnel and converting drive lanes into sidewalks with landscaping. Boyle says the remodel would also improve handicapped accessibility. Boyle says the changes will make it an “easier, user-friendly experience for people coming to the Capitol.”\n\nOhio\n\nNew Concord: The John and Annie Glenn Museum will be dedicated as a site on the National Register of Historic Places this month in the late astronaut’s hometown of New Concord. The museum, which was John Glenn’s boyhood home, will be dedicated in a ceremony Sunday in the Muskingum County village roughly 70 miles east of Columbus. The Glenns’ daughter, Lyn, will help dedicate the property. The former U.S. senator was born in Cambridge and moved to New Concord with his family in 1923. He was the first American to orbit the Earth and served 24 years as a Democrat in the Senate. The museum has also been designated an Ohio historic site and is on the National Park Service’s Register of Historic Places.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state investigator says cattle rustling is on the rise. The lead agent for the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture’s criminal investigation unit tells The Journal Record that the number of cattle reported stolen through March has already surpassed all of 2018. That comes to 1,210 stolen in the first three months of the year compared to 975 in 2018. Investigator Jerry Flowers says the state often works with federal agencies. In a recent case, that has included the FBI and the Bureau of Indian Affairs because the stolen cattle was on property north of El Reno that is under the jurisdiction of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribal Nations.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The sergeant at arms of the state Senate had a new regular duty in recent days: searching the Capitol for Republican senators who have been staying away and brought the legislative body’s business to a halt. The tactic by the minority party is rare in Oregon but has been used throughout history, sometimes creating comical scenes. In Washington three decades ago, U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., was carried feet-first into the Senate chamber after Democrats ordered the arrest of Republican senators who were denying a quorum. The Oregon standoff ended on its fifth day Monday. It had been caused by GOP senators’ anger at a bill that raises taxes on some businesses to fund education. After the Senate finally convened Monday afternoon, it passed the measure. To get the Republicans to return, Democrats, who hold a supermajority, agreed not to advance a measure requiring vaccinations for children to attend public schools. They also agreed to drop gun-control legislation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: For 20 years, visitors to Eastern State Penitentiary got a glimpse of how Al Capone may have lived while incarcerated there in 1929. But a new installation at the former prison, now a historic museum, reveals something new – that Capone had a cellmate. Capone’s solo cell was for decades based on a newspaper account in the Public Ledger that described a “beautiful rug of soft colors,” refined wood furniture, “tasteful paintings” and a cabinet-style radio that played waltzes. The exact cell to house America’s most famous gangster, in what was once the world’s most famous prison, remains a guess. As part of ongoing preservation, the history museum “moved” Capone one cell over, giving the bootlegger a more historically accurate exhibit that finds him in less fancy digs, which he shares with a cellmate. The original cell on exhibit is left empty. Visitors can tour both spaces.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers are considering a bill to waive state college application fees for veterans. Democratic state Sen. Walter Felag introduced the measure, which passed the Senate Wednesday and was referred to the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. It would authorize state higher education institutions to waive application and transcript fees for veterans. It states that the Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education should encourage the presidents of the Community College of Rhode Island, Rhode Island College and University of Rhode Island to do so. Felag says it’s just one way to express gratitude for veterans’ service to the country and make their lives easier after they return home.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A program to prevent former inmates from returning to prison has launched in the Lowcountry. WCIV-TV reports Project Evolution Inc. kicked off Friday. The program helps teach former inmates basic technology and job skills and also helps them build resumes and train for job interviews. The program begin in 2015 in Washington, D.C. Founder Barbara Magwood says she’s helped about 200 former inmates readjust to life without bars and to stay out of jail. South Carolina Department of Corrections data from 2015 shows 22.3% of inmates return to jail within three years. Magwood says through encouragement, the program is able to show ex-inmates that there’s hope after prison. Elder Walter Jackson, pastor of Greater Refuge Temple in Charleston, says his church is providing program volunteers to facilitate skills training.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSpearfish: A study shows that the population of a bird listed as a threatened species in the state is stable in the Spearfish and Whitewood creek watersheds but not expanding. American dippers can be found throughout the West, but the Black Hills is the farthest east the species is located, and that population also is genetically different from others. The Black Hills Pioneer reports Bird Conservancy of the Rockies biologist Nancy Drilling last year surveyed the Bear Butte, Elk, Box Elder, French and Rapid creeks. She says the results are similar to what was found in the early 2000s. The American dipper has been listed as threatened in South Dakota since 1996. The state wants a self-sustaining population in a third watershed before the bird is removed from the list.\n\nTennessee\n\nPigeon Forge: Dollywood has expanded with a newly opened land inspired by the magic of nature. Wildwood Grove, the largest expansion yet of Dolly Parton’s amusement park, opened its gates to guests for the first time Friday. The $37 million area has 11 themed attractions and sits adjacent to the Pigeon Forge theme park’s Timber Canyon area. Wildwood Grove features trees and plants native to East Tennessee. The new land’s story also connects to the area and features a young girl who discovers and touches the Wildwood Tree, and it opens her eyes and mind to everything around her. Wildwood Grove’s 11 themed attractions range from a new roller coaster to a restaurant with Southwestern cuisine. Butterflies, dragonflies, frogs and fireflies factor heavily into the imagery of the rides and decor.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: The Texas Historical Commission has approved $150,000 to help with the “stabilization and ultimate reuse” of a historic 1914 courthouse. The commission awarded Nueces County funding for the project through a National Park Service grant, according to a release from the commission. The $12.3 million grant is meant to help historic properties in areas affected by Hurricane Harvey. Nueces County leaders have long grappled with how to save the historic building that sits in downtown Corpus Christi. In March, commissioners voted to reject an offer from the Ed Rachal Foundation to purchase the building and the property on which it sits.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Federal officials and environmentalists are joining efforts to boost protection for a rare poppy that is only found in southern Utah. The Spectrum & Daily News reports that the U.S. forest Service, Utah Valley University and The Nature Conservancy are examining how to manage the dwarf bear-poppy or bearclaw poppy, which has been on the decline for the past 40 years. The flower was first put on the federally endangered species list in 1979. Experts say it can only blossom in specific geological conditions. Those conditions, which include gypsum soil, can be found in the St. George area. The Nature Conservancy established the 800-acre White Dome Nature Preserve that protects most of the habitat occupied by the poppy. Researchers have been using a drone to study the flowers.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has joined a handful of counterparts in renaming Columbus Day to honor Native Americans. Republican Gov. Phil Scott signed a bill May 6 recognizing the second Monday in October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. A half-dozen states and several cities have made the change. Native American tribes and others say celebrating Italian explorer Christopher Columbus ignores the effect that the European arrival in the Americas had on the native peoples. They suffered violence, disease, enslavement, racism and exploitation at the hands of the settlers. Vermont’s law states that “Vermont was founded and built upon lands whose original inhabitants were Abenaki people and honors them and their ancestors.”\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: A new walking and bicycle trail connecting Chincoteague and Assateague islands will be named after former longtime Mayor Jack Tarr. The trail will connect downtown Chincoteague with the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge on Assateague. The Chincoteague Town Council voted last week to name the new trail network the “John H. Tarr Bay to the Beach Trail.” Councilman Eddie Lewis suggested naming the trail after Tarr, and Councilwoman Ellen Richardson recommended “Bay to the Beach.” Lewis made a motion combining the two ideas, which was seconded by Denise Bowden and approved unanimously. Earlier this year, the town solicited ideas for naming the trail via the town’s website and Facebook page. More than 40 potential names were submitted for consideration.\n\nWashington\n\nWestport: A big rebound in the sea lion population along the West Coast in recent years has created a constant battle to wrangle the protected animals. They’re smart and fun to watch from a safe distance – but also noisy, smelly and proving to be a headache for some coastal marinas. “It’s a free zoo, kind of; just don’t pet ’em!” said Dennis Craig of Olympia as he watched a pier at Westport Marina nearly sink under the weight of dozens of burly bulls jostling and snoozing in the sun. The flip side of these flippered fish fiends can be seen in the mounting bill to the marina, including the cost of busted docks, broken electric stanchions and lost business. “Nearly all of our net revenue was used to repair damage caused by sea lions this year,” Westport Marina business manager Molly Bold said in an email.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A West Virginia University researcher is seeking funding to study whether using fentanyl testing strips changes the behavior of drug users, The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid increasingly involved in drug-related deaths. Some harm reduction programs use the strips to warn drug users of the presence of fentanyl in other illicit substances. Dr. Judith Feinberg, a professor at the WVU School of Medicine, told the paper people might be safer knowing there is fentanyl in their drugs. But people could also use the strips to seek out dangerous drug doses. Feinberg and researcher Jon Zibbel are asking the National Institute on Drug Abuse to fund the research. They plan to study harm reduction programs at Milan Puskar Health Right, in Morgantown, and a program in North Carolina.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: More people are dying in Wisconsin, but the state’s growing elderly population is living longer. Those are two findings of the annual death report from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. The latest report released Monday looks at deaths in 2017. It found that deaths were up 15% compared with a decade ago. But the death rate for people age 65 and older decreased by 10% over 10 years. The top three causes of death in 2017 were heart disease, cancer and unintentional injury. Overall, the rates of death from cancer and heart disease both declined. But deaths from falls were up 3%, and poisonings were up 13%. Poisoning accounts for 30% of all unintentional injuries, second only to falls at 42%.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: A noisy geyser in Yellowstone National Park has roared back to life after three years of quiet. Ledge Geyser is one of the biggest in Yellowstone’s Norris Geyser Basin. The Billings Gazette reports the geyser shoots hot water at an angle up to 125 feet high and a distance of 220 feet. Yellowstone geologist Jeff Hungerford says Ledge Geyser is noisy because its water and steam must pass through a narrow opening in the ground. Yellowstone has 1,300 thermal features and 500 geysers, more than anywhere else on Earth. Some geysers such as Old Faithful are predictable, but most, like Ledge Geyser, erupt erratically.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/14"}]}

The trials for Beverly Roberts, 85, and Mary Alston, 60, were set in Wetumpka Municipal Court for Thursday. The trials have been continued and a new date has not been set, said Terry Luck, one of the women’s defense attorneys. Luck and the women’s other attorney, retired Montgomery County Circuit Judge William Shashy, have scheduling conflicts, he said. The defense also asked city prosecutor Kenny James to recuse himself; he has a potential conflict of interest since he represented Roberts in a divorce case, Luck said. James has recused himself. Roberts faces charges of criminal trespassing and disorderly conduct, and Alston faces charges of criminal trespassing and interfering with governmental operations, records show. In June both women were arrested on public property in downtown Wetumpka while they were attempting to feed and trap stray cats. Once the cats are trapped, the women pay to have them neutered and either work to get them adopted to return them to the stray colony. Officers arrived and arrested them, saying they had been previously trespassed and were told not to feed animals. Wetumpka Police Chief Greg Benton says the feeding of the animals created a nuisance because it attracts more cats to the area. Benton said both women were “repeatedly” warned not to feed the cats and could have prevented the arrests by heeding those warnings. Luck says the arrests are baseless and that the women were performing a service by working to neuter the animals and prevent the stay cat population from growing.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola reported raising $2.3 million in just over three weeks in September, leaving the Democrat with a large cash advantage over Republican rivals Sarah Palin and Nick Begich heading into the Nov. 8 election. Meanwhile, Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Kelly Tshibaka, a Republican challenger backed by former President Donald Trump, each raised just over $1 million from late July to Sept. 30, though Murkowski had about three times more cash available at the end of the period. The filings Saturday with the Federal Election Commission for the House race cover Sept. 6 through Sept. 30. Filings in the Senate race covered July 28 through Sept. 30. Peltola on Aug. 31 won a special election to fill Alaska’s House seat until January in a race that also included Palin and Begich. Next month’s election will decide who holds the seat for a two-year term, starting in January. Peltola, in the latest filings, reported having nearly $2.3 million available at the end of September. Palin, a former Alaska governor and the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, reported bringing in about $230,000 during the latest period and having about $195,000 available. Begich reported raising about $57,500 and having just over $545,000 available. Begich loaned his campaign $650,000 earlier in the cycle.\n\nArizona\n\nSun City West: A father’s quick reaction kept a 12-year-old girl breathing after she was struck by lightning. Her father performed CPR three times after she was struck during Saturday’s storms in Sun City West. The girl, Ella, had stepped outside of her grandparent’s house to play with a friend when her father Steven Jorgensen heard loud thunder, saw a bright flash and saw her collapse. Jorgensen said he saw his daughter fall and immediately started performing CPR, which he learned while serving in the Marine Corps. “I got her heart back going, I got her breathing, and it was only for a short amount of time until I lost her again,” Jorgensen said. Jorgensen restarted CPR, got her heart to beat again and brought her inside the home while his parents were calling 911. While he was talking to the dispatcher, Ella’s heart stopped again. As Jorgensen started performing CPR for a third time, he said he was trying to remain calm and remembered a scene from the TV show “The Office” where they learn how to perform CPR. “You could hear me singing the Bee Gee’s ‘Staying Alive’ as I was giving her a resuscitation and then finally I got her going,” Jorgensen said. About three minutes later, emergency responders showed up and took over. Ella was taken to Banner Thunderbird Medical Center, and then she was flown to Valleywise Health Medical Center where she has been recovering “very well,” said Dr. Kevin Foster, Director of the Arizona Burn Center at Valleywise Health.\n\nArkansas\n\nVan Buren: A man who had been booked into the Crawford County Jail on Friday died in custody Saturday, an attorney representing his family said. Jacob Allen Jones, 26, was booked at the jail by Van Buren police on a complaint of failure to appear on prior drug charges at 4:12 p.m. Friday, jail records show. Attorney David Powell of Fort Smith said Jones died Saturday. He said Jones overdosed at the jail. He said Jones was in a cell for several hours without medical care. “I’m trying to get all of the information I can,” Powell said Sunday night. Efforts to reach Crawford County Sheriff Jimmy Damante Sunday were unsuccessful. Jones’ body was taken to the state medical examiner’s office in Little Rock where the cause and the manner of death will be determined, the Crawford County Coroner’s office reported Monday. Powell said Jones suffered a medical episode at the jail. Other inmates stated they called for help from detention officers. Four detention officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation, Powell said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: California’s coronavirus emergency will officially end in February, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday, nearly three years after the state’s first confirmed death from the disease prompted a raft of restrictions that upended public life. The decision will have little practical impact on most people’s lives, as most of the nearly 600 pandemic-related orders Newsom has issued since the start of the pandemic have already been lifted. And it won’t affect public health orders – including a pending statewide vaccine mandate for schoolchildren that could take effect next summer. But it does signal a symbolic end for some of the most restrictive elements of the pandemic, as it will dissolve Newsom’s authority to alter or change laws to make it easier for the government to quickly respond to the public health crisis. “The State of Emergency was an effective and necessary tool that we utilized to protect our state, and we wouldn’t have gotten to this point without it,” Newsom said in a news release, adding that the declaration will formally end on Feb. 28. Newsom declared a state of emergency for the coronavirus on March 4, 2020, shortly after an elderly patient was the first confirmed death from the disease in California. At the time, there were just 53 cases of COVID-19 in California, and state officials were holding a cruise ship off the coast so it could test passengers before allowing them to disembark in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo County: Nearly 110,000 voters in a southern Colorado county will be receiving general election ballots that were mistakenly labeled as primary election ballots, a blunder that has led the state’s secretary of state to appoint a supervisor to oversee November’s vote in a county that also had issues with ballots in its primary election. The misprint on ballots that are being sent out to voters in Pueblo County was on a tear-off tab and does not effect the “legal validity” or accuracy of the rest of the ballot, Secretary of State Jena Griswold’s office said in a news release Monday. For that reason and because of the short time frame before the ballots were mailed, they will not be reprinted. It is the second time this year that the county has had problems with ballots.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: A commuter train struck a tractor trailer in Connecticut on Monday, authorities said. Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said a Metro-North train headed to Bridgeport hit a tractor trailer at a railroad crossing in Waterbury shortly before 11 a.m. The MTA did not provide any information about injuries, but Lt. Ryan Bessette of the Waturbury police said the tractor driver and at least two train passengers were treated for injuries that appeared to be minor. Train service in the area was halted while police and the MTA investigated the crash.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A 29-year-old man who was fatally shot early Sunday in Dover has been identified by police. Jesse Holley marks the city’s first homicide this year. Police were dispatched to the 100 block of S. Bradford St. just after 1:10 a.m. Sunday after receiving a call for a shooting. Arriving officers found Holley there. Dover Police Master Cpl. Ryan Schmid said Holley had a gunshot wound to his lower body. Holley was taken to an area hospital, where he died. This is Dover’s first homicide since June 30, 2021, when 19-year-old Tysean Nelson was one of four people shot in the capital city’s 100 block of S. New St. So far this year, 14 people have been shot in Dover – one fatally. Last year at the same time, 36 people had been shot in Dover – three of them fatally. Holley’s fatal shooting investigation is ongoing and anyone with information should contact the Dover police.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Authorities said a maintenance worker brought a registered gun into a high school, WUSA-TV reports. The worker showed up to Anacostia High School with the gun in his bag after the school requested a worker for repairs, and the man was arrested. Police didn’t say if the gun was loaded, according to the news outlet. Having a firearm on school property is not allowed at any D.C. Public Schools campus. No injuries were reported. “Please be assured that no one was harmed, and the incident was promptly handled according to our security procedures,” DCPS Press Secretary Deborah Isaac said. “All students and staff remained safe and supervised during this incident.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: A winning lottery ticket worth a share of a $494 million Mega Millions jackpot was purchased in a city hammered by Hurricane Ian late last month. State lottery officials on Monday said one of the two winning tickets was purchased at a 7-Eleven in Fort Myers. The other winning ticket was bought in California. Hurricane Ian made landfall in southwest Florida as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 28 and has been blamed for more than 100 fatalities in the state. It was the third-deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland this century. More than half of the storm-related deaths in Florida were reported in Lee County, which includes Fort Myers. Lottery winners in the state have 180 days to claim their prize. Under a new state law, lottery winners can remain anonymous for 90 days from the day they claim the winnings, if their prize is worth $250,000 or more. Past winners have also set up legal trusts as a way to keep their identities anonymous.\n\nGeorgia\n\nTown: A college student died after being struck by the propeller of a small plane as he disembarked at an airport in southeast Georgia, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Board are investigating the death Sunday night at Statesboro-Bulloch County Airport, FAA spokesman Steve Kulm said. Sani Aliyu, of Atlanta, and a young woman had flown on the single-engine Cessna to nearby Savannah and back on a date, Bulloch County Coroner Jake Futch told the Statesboro Herald. He said the plane landed safely on the return trip to Statesboro. The woman “got off the plane and walked toward the back of the plane,” Futch said, “and he got off the airplane and walked toward the front of the plane, and when he did, the propeller hit him.” Aliyu was a sophomore enrolled at Georgia Southern University, school spokeswoman Melanie Simon said. A pilot and co-pilot had flown the couple, said Capt. Todd Hutchens of the Bulloch County Sheriff’s Office. He said deputies were sharing information they gathered with the FAA and NTSB. “Nobody is really at fault or anything,” Hutchens said. “It was an accident.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A former building plans examiner pleaded guilty Monday to all charges in an indictment accusing him of participating in a scheme to take bribes in exchange for expediting projects. Wayne Inouye pleaded guilty to six counts of honest services wire fraud and one count of making a false statement. He did not have an agreement with U.S. prosecutors about what sentence they will seek. Prosecutors say Inouye took at least $89,000 in bribes from an architect and several thousand dollars from others to approve and expedite their projects ahead of others. Inouye lied to an FBI agent and federal prosecutor when he told them an architect loaned him $100,000, Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Nolan said. When asked by the judge at Monday’s hearing to describe what he did, Inouye didn’t use the words bribe or bribery. He said an architect offered to compensate him to review plans before submitting them so that he could ensure they were code-compliant. “These plans would have been approved anyway,” he said, but added that they were expedited. He also said he received compensation from a signage contractor to help them submit their application to the department. He said he made a misleading statement to an FBI agent and a federal prosecutor when he told them the compensation was a loan. Honest services wire fraud carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison, while the false statement charge has a maximum sentences of up to five years.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State revenue from tax collections was $50 million below expectations for the first three months of the current fiscal year, but the state still has a $1.5 billion budget surplus, officials said Monday. The Legislative Services Office said September’s revenue was down about $11 million, with sales and corporate income taxes below predictions. That follows similar misses by small amounts on projections for July and August. Despite the $50 million drop, about 3.6%, in projected revenue for the first three months of this fiscal year, the state is still seeing revenue growth and bringing in more money compared to the same period last year – about $94 million more, or 7.5%. The Division of Financial Management also released a report earlier this month providing a snapshot of the state’s finances. Both reports include a $500 million income tax rebate this year approved by lawmakers in a special session in September, as well as an ongoing income and corporate tax cut that takes effect Jan. 1. The ongoing cut comes from creating a 5.8% flat tax that is expected to cut more than $100 million from revenue for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. Those tax cuts came out of a budget surplus then estimated at about $2 billion.\n\nIllinois\n\nSycamore: A mountain lion that was struck and killed last weekend along a highway will be analyzed by biologists seeking to uncover the rare animal’s origins, state wildlife officials said. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources said Monday the mountain lion died Sunday after being hit by a vehicle along Interstate 88 in DeKalb County. Illinois State Police recovered the carcass, which will undergo a necropsy and DNA analysis at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana. The DNR said that analysis will provide insight “about the animal, its place of origin, and exploratory movements across the Midwest.” DNR experts believe the mountain lion may be the same one recorded in late September by a trail camera on private property in northwestern Illinois’ Whiteside County, which abuts Iowa. Mountain lions were eliminated from Illinois prior to the 1870s due to habitat loss and hunting. They have been a protected species in Illinois since 2015.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch tested positive for COVID-19 after experiencing cold-like symptoms on Monday, according to her office. Crouch said in a Twitter post that she had “mild symptoms and will continue to work for Hoosiers from home while following all of Indiana’s COVID guidelines.” Crouch was at her home in Evansville after testing positive with the COVID-19 virus for the first time, said her office spokesman, Ron Green. Crouch, 70, received two initial doses of a COVID-19 vaccine in February 2021 and has since gotten a booster shot, Green said. Crouch has been lieutenant governor since 2017 as Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s running mate in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. She previously was state auditor for three years after serving nine years as a state legislator from Evansville.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson was released Tuesday morning from a Cedar Rapids hospital where she was being treated for a kidney infection, her office said. Hinson spent two nights in UnityPoint St. Luke’s Hospital after being admitted Sunday evening, according to her office. “I am feeling much better, will continue resting at home, and look forward to getting out on the road to be with Iowans soon,” Hinson said in a statement Tuesday morning. A debate scheduled for Tuesday night between Hinson, a Republican, and her Democratic challenger, Liz Mathis, was canceled in light of Hinson’s medical emergency. Iowa PBS, which was hosting the debate, said there are no plans to reschedule the debate.\n\nKansas\n\nFairway: The grounds of a former Native American boarding school will be searched to determine if any Indigenous children were buried there, state officials said. The Kansas Historical Society, which owns the site in Fairway, is contracting with the University of Kansas Center for Research to conduct a ground-penetrating radar survey of the 12 acres to search for unmarked graves, The Kansas City Star reported. The current Shawnee Indian Mission historical site was one of hundreds of schools run by the government and religious groups in the 1800s and 1900s. Thousands of Native American children were forcibly taken from their homes and placed in such schools, with a goal of assimilating them into white American culture and Christianity. Leaders of the Shawnee Tribe and other tribes had requested a search of the Fairway site. But tribal officials said in a statement that they were not consulted about the Historical Society’s project proposal before it was announced. “We have requested formal consultation to address serious concerns about the motives of this project, potential deficiencies in the process that may render incomplete findings, and what plans may be for utilizing any results from the project,” the tribe said. Patrick Zollner, executive director of the historical society, responded that the Shawnee Tribe was the “first to know” about the project proposal. He said the society also contacted other tribes, including the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes, Kaw Nation, Osage Nation and others. Zollner and Erinn Barcomb-Peterson, a spokeswoman with the University of Kansas, emphasized that consultation with the tribes is ongoing and that work will not proceed until that process is completed.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Education in Kentucky faces its own difficult recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, a grim fact revealed Tuesday by statewide test scores showing that many students from elementary to high school struggled across a span of core subjects. Fewer than half of students tested statewide were reading at grade level, with even lower across-the-board scores posted in math, science and social studies. Education Commissioner Jason Glass acknowledged there’s “no quick fix” to overcome challenges caused by the pandemic, when schools shifted to virtual learning and staff shortages were common. The recovery in education will take “time and resources,” he stressed. “As expected, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our students and our schools as they continue to recover from the interrupted learning that occurred over the past two years,” Glass said in a news release. “These assessment results will serve as the baseline from which we will move forward as we look to new and innovative learning opportunities for all of Kentucky’s students.” Kentucky has received more than $2 billion in federal funding through the Democratic-backed American Rescue Plan passed by Congress last year. The funding aims to help accelerate learning and provide additional support to districts and the students who need it the most. Kentucky’s results are consistent with what many other states are experiencing, Glass said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A shipwreck has emerged along the banks of the Mississippi River in Baton Rouge as water levels plummet – threatening to reach record lows in some areas. The ship, which archaeologists believe to be a ferry that sunk in the late 1800s to early 1900s, was spotted by a Baton Rouge resident walking along the shore earlier this month. The discovery is the latest to surface from ebbing waters caused by drought. During the summer, receding waters in the Lake Mead National Recreation Area revealed several skeletal remains, countless desiccated fish, a graveyard of forgotten boats and even a sunken World War II-era craft that once surveyed the lake. “Eventually the river will come back up and (the ship) will go back underwater,” said Chip McGimsey, the Louisiana state archeologist, who has been surveying the wreck during the past two weeks. “That’s part of the reason for making the big effort to document it this time – cause she may not be there the next time.” McGimsey believes that the ship may be the Brookhill Ferry, which likely carried people and horse-drawn wagons from one-side of the river to the other – before major bridges spanned the mighty Mississippi. Newspaper archives indicate that the ship sank in 1915 during a major storm. But this is not the first time the low water levels have revealed the ship. McGimsey said that tiny parts of the vessel were exposed in 1990s.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: A police officer was justified in shooting a man in Bangor, despite a review of evidence that showed the officer was farther away from the man than previously thought, the state’s attorney general said. Attorney General Aaron Frey conducted a second review of the shooting of Brian Barker, who was shot three times and survived in 2018. Frey said Friday that his office determined that the officer was more than 37 feet away from Barker and not about 15 feet as it initially stated. Frey said Barker’s movements leading up to the shooting still represented enough of a threat to justify the use of deadly force, the Bangor Daily News reported. Bangor police officers were checking on Barker and saw that he had a knife, which they repeatedly asked him to put down. Frey said Barker’s movements before the shooting made it unclear if he was going to attempt to attack one of the officers on the scene, the Daily News reported. The 21-foot distance marker between officers and a suspect is sometimes referred to as “kill zone” because officers are taught that at that distance an armed person can quickly close the distance.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan announced an investment of $77 million on Monday for realignment and upgrades to the state’s section of U.S. 219 in Garrett County. Hogan said Monday that the plan advances his pledge to address Maryland’s portion of the U.S. 219 corridor between Interstate 68 and Meyerdale, Pennsylvania, to improve safety, expand economic opportunity, and reinforce the regional supply chain. Hogan also officially dedicated the portion of U.S. 219 in Maryland to retiring state Sen. George Edwards. He cited the senator’s support for improvements that benefit the region. The latest improvements to Maryland’s portion of U.S. 219 will renovate and expand the 1-mile segment between Old Salisbury Road and the Pennsylvania state line. In 2021, the Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration completed the first phase, which included nearly $65 million of upgrades along U.S. 219 between I-68 and Old Salisbury Road. Finishing the second phase has been identified as Garrett County’s top transportation priority.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlympton: Striking truckers used tractor-trailers to block the exits at New England’s largest wholesale food distributor Monday and prevented some employees from leaving, resulting in as many as 20 arrests, police said. More than 400 Teamster union members arrived at the Sysco facility in Plympton, Massachusetts, in the early morning and stopped about 100 employees from leaving, Police Chief Matthew Ahl said in a statement. Police spent two hours negotiating with picketers. “After the attempted negotiation to move union members out of the roadway to create a safe passable environment, unfortunately we had to respond by removing members of the crowd who were inciting a hostile picket line,” the chief said. Sixteen to 20 people were arrested on charges including disorderly conduct and assault and battery, he said. After the arrests, traffic started to flow safely. About 300 Sysco drivers represented by the Teamsters Local 653 started their strike Oct. 1 seeking better pay and benefits. Voicemails seeking comment were left with union representatives.\n\nMichigan\n\nSturgis: The U.S. Supreme Court has said it would hear arguments brought by a deaf Michigan man who wants to sue his former school district for failing to provide him a suitable teacher who knew sign language for more than a decade and inflating his grades when he could neither read nor write. Miguel Perez, an immigrant who moved to the U.S. with his family as a child and is now in his 20s, has been trying for years to press a claim for compensatory damages under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) against the Sturgis Public School District in southwest Michigan. But lower courts, including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit in Cincinnati, have rejected that claim, saying Perez never exhausted the administrative review required first under another federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). No date has been set for oral arguments before the Supreme Court.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Enbridge Energy, the owner and operator of the Line 3 pipeline project in northern Minnesota, will pay more than $11 million after investigations identified water quality violations and three aquifer breaches related to the pipeline’s construction, state regulators said Monday. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and Department of Natural Resources announced the results from investigations of water quality violations and aquifer breaches related to the construction project. Combined with the previous DNR actions, and in partnership with Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, the investigations have resulted in more than $11 million in payments, environmental projects, and financial assurances from Enbridge, according to the state agencies. The Minnesota agency investigation found that Enbridge violated regulations when it discharged construction storm water into wetlands and inadvertently releasing drilling mud into surface water at 12 locations in June and August of 2021. The DNR also finalized agreements with Enbridge to address three aquifer breaches related to Line 3 construction.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Congress is investigating the crisis that left 150,000 people in the capital city without running water for several days in late summer, according to a letter sent to Gov. Tate Reeves by two Democratic officials. Reps. Bennie Thompson, of Mississippi, and Carolyn Maloney, of New York, sent the letter Monday requesting information on how Mississippi plans to spend $10 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act and from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and $429 million “specifically allotted to enhance the state’s water infrastructure.” The letter indicates “the start of a joint investigation” by the House Homeland Security and the Oversight and Reform committees into a crisis that deprived Jackson’s 150,000 residents of running water for several days in late August and early September, Adam Comis, a staffer for the committee, told The Associated Press. Thompson’s district includes most of Jackson, and he chairs the Homeland Security Committee. Maloney chairs the Oversight and Reform Committee. Jackson has had water problems for years, and the latest troubles began in late August after heavy rainfall exacerbated problems in the city’s main treatment plant, leaving many customers without running water. Jackson had already been under a boil-water notice since late July because the state health department found cloudy water that could make people ill. Running water was restored within days, and a boil-water notice was lifted in mid-September, but the letter to Reeves says “water plant infrastructure in the city remains precarious, and risks to Jackson’s residents persist.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Libraries receiving state funds would be required to determine what material is “age-appropriate” and restrict minors from accessing some books under a proposed rule submitted by the secretary of state Monday. The proposed rule, submitted by Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, would also allow parents to challenge a library’s “age-appropriate” designation, and ban state funds from being used to “purchase or acquire materials in any form that appeal to the prurient interest of any minor.” Libraries that receive state funds could see them cut off if they violate the proposed rule. “When state dollars are involved, we want to bring back local control and parental involvement in determining what children are exposed to,” Ashcroft, a Republican, said in a statement. “Foremost, we want to protect our children.” After the rule is formally published in the state register on Nov. 15, residents will be able to submit public comment on it for 30 days. Ashcroft cited state laws that gives his office authority for rulemaking over library funds when he filed the rule. Under the rule, libraries will have to adopt a “written, publicly-accessible” policy determining “how selections are made in considering the appropriateness for the age and maturity level of any minor ... who accesses any material in any form.” That policy will also allow parents and guardians to know what materials are available, and bans library employees from allowing minors to access those materials without a parent or guardian’s permission.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A federal administrative law judge has denied a request to block permits that expand bison grazing in north-central Montana while several parties challenge them. Gov. Greg Gianforte, Attorney General Austin Knudsen and the Montana Stockgrowers Association asked the U.S. Interior Department’s hearing division in August to reverse the the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s granting of the permits. Administrative Law Judge Veronica Larvie ruled on Oct. 13 that while there were several concerns about the permits, the parties failed to show that the expanded bison grazing would cause immediate and irreparable harm and she declined to block them while the case moves forward. The Stockgrowers argue additional bison grazing will harm the cattle industry and the local economy. The conservation group American Prairie sought the 10-year permits to remove some fences so bison could roam more freely in Phillips County south of Malta. The grazing area in dispute covers about 108 square miles. It will allow American Prairie to increase the size of its bison herd from about 800 animals to 1,000 bison by 2025, the group said.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: The body of a Texas woman found in the trunk of a car that crashed in south-central Nebraska during a police chase was the mother of the teenage driver, police have confirmed. The crash happened Friday along Interstate 80 near Grand Island, shortly after authorities were alerted to be on the lookout for a vehicle out of Texas believed to be involved in a possible homicide there, the Nebraska State Patrol said. A trooper spotted the car minutes later and attempted to stop it, but the driver refused to pull over and a chase ensued reaching speeds of more than 110 mph, the patrol said. The car soon crashed, and the 17-year-old driver suffered serious but non-lethal injuries, police said. Police also found the body of a woman in the car’s trunk. The following day, the patrol identified the woman as 49-year-old Michelle Roenz, of Harris County, Texas. The Harris County Sheriff’s Office confirmed Monday she is the mother of the 17-year-old boy who was driving the car. No charges against the teen appeared Monday in Nebraska online court records.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A 47-year-old man will spend up to 15 years in prison for sending death threats to a half-dozen Nevada elected officials in messages citing false conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen. Matthew Carter was found guilty in September of three felony counts of aggravated talking and one count of misdemeanor harassment. Washoe County District Judge Egan Walker sentenced him last week to two to five years for each felony, to be served consecutively. Walker also sentenced Carter to six months for the misdemeanor but said it can be served concurrently, meaning at the same time as the other sentences. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said Monday that Carter sent multiple racist and threatening messages to U.S. Attorney Jason Frierson, state Treasurer Zach Conine, three members of the Nevada Assembly and Gov. Steve Sisolak’s chief of staff Yvanna Cancela. Frierson previously served as speaker of the Assembly and Cancela previously served as a state senator. The others targeted were Assembly members Steve Yeager, Lesley Cohen and Brittney Miller. Ford said the threats, which included racial slurs and references toward lynching, cited passage of expanded mail-in voting ahead of the election as a reason for his promised violence toward the officials.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nAtkinson: A laboratory equipment distributor has been fined $140,000 on 14 felony counts of failing to file export information on shipments to Russia and Ukraine between 2015 and 2019. Intertech Trading Corporation, in Atkinson, pleaded guilty to falsely describing the nature and value of the exported items on commercial invoices and shipping forms, the U.S. attorney’s office in New Hampshire said. In its plea agreement filed in July, Intertech said that it used false descriptions such as “lamp for aquarium” or “spares for welding system,” rather than accurately identifying the sophisticated scientific equipment actually contained in the shipments. Intertech, which was sentenced in federal court Monday, admitted that it drastically undervalued the shipments, thereby evading the requirement to file Electronic Export Information, which would have been reported to the departments of Commerce and Homeland Security, the U.S. attorney’s office said. The company’s actions jeopardized national security, said Joseph Bonavolonta, special agent in charge of the FBI Boston Division. Intertech “had an unblemished record in the industry for more than 30 years and has been devastated financially” by the government’s investigation and the resulting plea agreement, its attorney said in a court document.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state Supreme Court got two new members Monday. The Democrat-led state Senate confirmed Rachel Wainer Apter and Douglas Fasciale to fill two of three vacancies on the state’s highest court. Wainer Apter is currently the head of the civil rights division within the state attorney general’s office and previously served as counsel to the attorney general. Fasciale has been serving a temporary assignment on the high court since mandatory retirements left openings. He served as a judge on the Appellate Division since 2010 and was a state Superior Court judge from 2004 to 2010. Murphy appointed Wainer Apter, a Democrat, in 2021, but her nomination was held up as state senators vetted her appointment. Murphy appointed Fasciale, a Republican, last month. Their appointments track with a New Jersey tradition of governors appointing no more than four members from their own party. “This prevents the Court from lurching too far in one direction or the other. It forces Governors to select nominees from among the best lawyers and judges in the state, regardless of party,” Murphy said when he appointed Fasciale. The seven-member court still has one more vacancy, which Murphy must fill and the Senate confirm.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The New Mexico Civil Guard has been barred from publicly acting as a military unit without authorization or assuming the role of law enforcement by using organized force at public protests or gathering, according to a newspaper. The Albuquerque Journal reported Tuesday that District Court Judge Elaine Lujan also has banned such activity by the group’s directors, officers, agents, employees, members and any of their successor organizations and members. Lujan granting a motion by Bernalillo County District Attorney Raúl Torrez, who told the Journal that the decision, “fundamentally represents a victory for the rule of law….We’re trying to prevent violent extremism.”A lawsuit alleged members of the New Mexico Civil Guard violated state law by exercising or attempting to exercise the functions of a peace officer without authority and have organized and operated as a military unit without having been called to military service by the governor, according to the Journal. The newspaper said the governor has exclusive authority under the state Constitution to call on the militia to keep the public peace.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Thieves stole 20 cars from a dealership and will likely use the vechicles to commit other crimes, a top police official said. The car thieves hit a Mistubishi dealership over the weekend, broke open a lock box that held keys and drove off with late-model cars, NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig said Monday. While some stolen cars are sold overseas, Essig said investigators believe the cars stolen from the Mitsubishi lot will be used to carry out other crimes. “Our feeling is just based on the way crime is going, people taking these cars, they will use these 20 cars in multiple robberies and burglaries throughout the city, switching plates on and off and on and off,” Essig told reporters. Employees did not realize the cars were gone until they came in Monday morning, the chief said. One of the stolen cars was recovered in Brooklyn, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: With abortions in the state and the number of out-of-state clinic patients soaring after Roe v. Wade was struck down, judges should permit more trained health professionals to prescribe pills for medication-induced abortions, plaintiffs in a lawsuit wrote on Monday. Abortion providers, medical workers and an abortion-rights group awaiting trial next year in their 2020 lawsuit challenging many state abortion rules asked a three-judge panel to act now and block a law limiting who can provide such medication from just certain licensed physicians. Allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives who work at certified abortion clinics to prescribe these pills would immediately expand access to abortion in North Carolina, the plaintiffs said. These “advanced practice clinicians” already can prescribe the same two medicines used in medication-induced abortions for managing a patient’s miscarriage, according to a memo describing the legal grounds for a preliminary injunction. The court should remove “an unnecessary barrier to care so that more North Carolinians can access a full range of reproductive health services, including time-sensitive abortion care, in their own state,” Anne Logan Bass, a nurse practitioner at Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, and a plaintiff, said in a news release. North Carolina abortion clinic operators have said they’ve seen a marked increase in the number of women coming from other states that now have more severe abortion limitations following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nAlmont: A UPS driver came to the rescue of two people who crashed their vehicle in a rural area of Morton County, the Bismarck Tribune reports. According to the shipping company, Ken Oakes was making deliveries Sept. 20 when he came upon a crashed car on a bridge east of Almont. Oakes, an Army veteran with medical training, helped a female passenger and a male passenger out of the vehicle and continued to help when paramedics arrived, according to the news outlet. “He was amazingly helpful,” said Frank Melchior, an emergency medical technician with the Almont Ambulance Service.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Patrol Superintendent Charles Jones announced Friday that the Ohio State Highway Patrol would permit troopers to have tattoos on their arms but they’ll have to wear long-sleeve uniforms − even in the heat of summer − to cover the ink. The patrol’s policy still prohibits tattoos above the neckline or below the wrist. Exceptions may be allowed for “a conservative wedding band/civil union tattoo, brand or body art” on the ring finger, the policy states. Police departments across the state and the nation are relaxing their grooming rules in an effort to recruit employees. Columbus, Akron and Cleveland police departments recently announced new policies. Patrol Academy Commandant Major John Altman, who declined to disclose whether he has tattoos, said the new tattoo policy means the patrol can reach out to several hundred potential recruits who expressed interest but also said they have visible tattoos. Altman noted that there are no current plans to change the patrol’s policy that prohibits facial hair.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPauls Valley: A politically connected attorney who served as Gov. Kevin Stitt’s hospital surge plan adviser during the pandemic was accused Monday in a drug trafficking charge of illegal involvement in marijuana businesses. Matt Stacy, 43, became the latest attorney to be accused of helping out-of-state clients establish marijuana grow operations by finding them “ghost” owners in Oklahoma. Stitt on Monday said he will be donating Stacy’s contribution to his reelection campaign to charity. Stacy, a lieutenant colonel in the Oklahoma Army National Guard, donated $2,900 to Stitt last year. Stacy was charged Monday in Garvin County District Court with 13 felony counts after being indicted last month by the state’s multicounty grand jury. Stacy “has acted as a consigliere to international drug trafficking organizations engaged in industrial-scale black-market marijuana manufacturing and trafficking,” a state narcotics investigator alleged in an affidavit filed with the charge. The illegal conduct included “structuring fraudulent ‘straw’ ownership schemes to circumvent Oklahoma ownership disclosure and structure requirements for medical marijuana businesses,” the agent with the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Control alleged. State law requires a licensed grow operation to be at least 75% owned by Oklahoma residents. “On multiple occasions, Stacy created and/or facilitated the creation of business entities through the use or recruitment of Oklahoma residents to operate as ‘straw owners’ to facially satisfy the Oklahoma residency requirements.” the agent alleged. One grower reported paying Stacy $60,000, according to the affidavit.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two people have together been awarded $10.4 million at trial after a jury found they suffered hearing loss and emotional trauma when they narrowly escaped a natural gas explosion in Portland. Lawyers for gas leak investigator Eric Rader and stylist Kristen Prentice said both suffered life-altering changes, including post-traumatic stress disorder, after an excavator hit a buried gas pipeline Oct. 19, 2016. Rader had found high levels of gas inside a corner bagel shop and warned firefighters to flee shortly before the blast obliterated the three-story commercial building and gutted a neighboring structure. “The reading on his gas meter indicated extreme risk,” said Greg Kafoury, the attorney for Rader and Prentice. “Rader notified nearby first responders, saving many.” Prentice was about to enter the salon next door when firefighters alerted her to the danger. Both took shelter nearby. Rader and Prentice are now permanently afflicted with hearing loss and painful sensitivity to loud noises, Kafoury said. Their lawsuits were tried jointly in Multnomah County Circuit Court. On Thursday, a jury awarded $6.5 million to Prentice and $3.9 million to Rader – the largest payout to date over the blast. Jurors found contractor Loy Clark Pipeline Co. liable for both of the workers’ medical expenses and lost earnings. Each award included $2.3 million in punitive damages, though about 70% of that money will be directed to a state crime victims fund under Oregon law.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNewtown: Political signs in southeastern Pennsylvania have been found booby-trapped with razor blades, which resulted in sliced fingers for one resident, police said. Upper Makefield Township police said Sunday that a campaign sign for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro was placed without permission on someone’s property, and while trying to remove it the resident found that razor blades had been “placed around the perimeter of the sign.” “Obviously, this was designed to inflict punishment on anyone who attempted to remove the sign,” police said in a social media post. Police said they inspected all campaign signs and found razor blades placed around the perimeter of signs for two other Democratic candidates, John Fetterman and Ashley Ehasz. Fetterman is running for U.S. Senate and Ehasz for U.S. House. Police said their investigation continues and warned residents to exercise caution in removing signs placed on their property without permission, and to call them if “any implements” have been installed on the signs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A lawsuit brought by Rhode Island’s cities and towns against consulting giant McKinsey & Company over its alleged role in fueling the opioid crisis through deceptive marketing practices will be heard in federal court in Northern California. Towns across the state joined their brethren in Pennsylvania, Utah, Wisconsin and elsewhere in accusing McKinsey of engaging in a racketeering conspiracy by advising Purdue Pharma how to downplay the dangers of Oxycontin while maximizing sales of the prescription painkiller. The communities charge that McKinsey’s misconduct has perpetuated a serious public-health crisis that brought about significant economic damages, including spiking costs related to public health, opioid-related crimes, emergencies and public-safety challenges.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAnderson: Eight Starbucks employees, three of whom were fired by the company, have filed a defamation lawsuit against Starbucks and a former manager, Melissa Morris, who accused the employees of kidnapping and assault prior to the start of a shift in early August. A summons for the lawsuit was filed on Oct. 17 after the Anderson County Sheriff’s Office found that Morris’ criminal accusation was false, according to the summons. On Aug. 1, eight employees at a Starbucks in Anderson surrounded a store manager and presented a list of demands that included better pay, equipment upgrades and better staffing, according to Mya Ourada, a store barista at the time. On Aug. 3, Morris, the Starbucks store manager, in coordination with Starbucks management reported to police that the workers had assaulted and kidnapped the manager on Aug. 1, according to the summons. According to the summons, the Sheriff’s Office told a reporter, “None of the allegations were true... The employees did not stop her from leaving and did not put their hands on her, which is what the boss reported had happened.” “Starbucks knew exactly what they were doing when it smeared our reputation, painting us as criminals,” Aneil Tripathi, a former employee who was fired, said in a press release. “They abused the law enforcement process to intimidate us and keep us terrified that a knock on the door would be the Anderson police coming to take us away.” Starbucks and Morris have 30 days to answer the claims in the summons. “We are reviewing the details of this matter and look forward to defending the company against the allegations made,” a Starbucks spokesperson wrote in an email to the Independent Mail. “No Starbucks partner has been or will be disciplined for supporting or engaging in lawful union activity – but interests in a union does not exempt partners from following policies and procedures that apply to all partners.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The City Council passed a group of ordinances and resolutions Tuesday, approving a TIF district that a local developer hopes will aid in creating an affordable housing development in eastern Sioux Falls. The $2.14 million TIF agreement passed the council 7-1 at their meeting, alongside resolutions that formally set the boundaries of the district, as well as approving the project plan for the development.Developer Kelly Nielson told councilors last month he’d been trying to work on a project like this for years, and that his staff had recently “started designing the least expensive house we could come up with.” Each of the 65 homes in the 9.7-acre development must be priced at or below $340,000, with two-bedroom, one-bathroom houses set at a price goal of $232,000 or below, and two-bedroom, two-bathroom units in a twin home with an unfinished basement set at a price goal of $323,000 or below. All of the homes would all need to be constructed by May 1, 2028, Business Development Coordinator Dustin Powers told councilors at the meeting.\n\nTennessee\n\nBrentwood: A small plane crashed Tuesday on a road in a Nashville suburb, killing one person, authorities said. The pilot was the only person on board the single-engine plane that crashed in Brentwood at 7:30 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement. Brentwood police confirmed one fatality but didn’t immediately indicate whether the person who died was on the plane. Police said on Twitter that the two-lane road in the community just south of Nashville was closed afterward. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A man was convicted of capital murder on Monday in the 2019 shooting death of a law enforcement officer who was the first Sikh deputy in his agency. A jury took less than 30 minutes before finding Robert Solis, 50, guilty in the killing of Harris County Sheriff’s Deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal during a September 2019 traffic stop in a residential cul-de-sac 18 miles northwest of Houston. Authorities say the 42-year-old deputy was shot multiple times from behind after he stopped Solis and was walking back to his patrol car. The same jury in Houston that convicted Solis began hearing evidence late Monday afternoon in the trial’s punishment phase. Prosecutors are seeking a death sentence. Just before his trial began last week, Solis fired his court appointed attorneys and chose to represent himself. Solis testified in his own defense and told jurors he had accidentally shot Dhaliwal. Prosecutors argued Solis deliberately shot Dhaliwal because he didn’t want to go back to jail. At the time of the traffic stop, Solis had a warrant for violating parole. Dhaliwal was described by Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez as “a trailblazer” because he was the first Sikh deputy with the sheriff’s office when he joined the force around 2009. Gonzalez’s predecessor as sheriff, Adrian Garcia, implemented a religious accommodation policy that allowed Dhaliwal to wear the traditional turban and beard of the Sikh religion.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: U.S. Sen. Mike Lee of Utah worked to distinguish himself from former President Donald Trump in a contentious debate Monday evening. “I stood against my party time and time again to oppose reckless spending. I will do it again and again and again. We need people who say no,” the second-term Republican said. Lee repeatedly pointed to his voting record and twice told the audience at Utah Valley University that he voted less in line with Trump than all but two Republican senators – Rand Paul and Susan Collins. “To suggest that I’m beholden to either party, that I’ve been a bootlicker for either party is folly. And it’s contradicted by the plain facts,” Lee said. Lee faces a challenge from Evan McMullin, a former Republican known most for his long-shot bid for president six years ago, when as an independent he won 21.5% of voters in Utah, including Lee. McMullin has remained a pillar of the anti-Trump movement, attacking the former president as an authoritarian who poses a threat to democracy. Lee’s last minute efforts to put space between his voting record and Trump’s stances depart from his past messaging as Election Day nears.\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: A plan is being developed to turn part of the Winston Prouty Center for Child Family Development campus into as many as 300 housing units, the Brattleboro Reformer reports. “We’re pushing forward with it,” said Chloe Learey, executive director at the center. “Master planning is really that process of going through what are all the things we would want and what fits and what’s on the landscape and where are the wetlands and how much is it going to cost?” They hope to complete the plan in April, according to the news outlet. The design is intended “to build a neighborhood essentially,” Learey said. The planning process is estimated to cost $200,000. Grants and donations are being sought to assist with the project, the news outlet reports.\n\nVirginia\n\nWoodbridge: A couple, their 19-year-old daughter and a 36-year-old man were found dead in their home after a fellow resident, who is now charged with murder, called 911 to report a shooting, police said Tuesday. Prince William County Police officers responded to a Woodbridge home on Monday afternoon after a 911 caller reported that someone shot into the residence and people might be dead inside, Police Chief Peter Newsham said at a news conference near the home. When officers arrived, they found the door open and two men and two women dead in different parts of the home. “This is horrific,” Newsham said. “Every adjective that you can use to describe a tragedy, you can use to describe what happened here last night.” The evidence found on the scene didn’t match the details from the 911 caller, who turned out to be the suspect in the case, Newsham said. The caller – David Maine, 24, of Woodbridge – was found nearby. On Tuesday morning, Maine was charged with four counts of second-degree murder, Newsham said. Maine is being held without bond. The police chief identified the dead as Miguel Duran Flores, 44; Kelly Victoria Sotelo, 42; their daughter Karrie Ayline Sotelo, 19; and Richard Julio Jesus Revollar Corrales, 36, who lived in the basement of the home. Maine had a relationship with another resident, who was not at the home, Newsham said. That person has cooperated with police, providing valuable information, and is also upset about what happened at his home, he said.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: Bremerton Municipal Court has shut down some public access to the court through the end of the month and cases may be continued, citing employee turnover and the COVID-19 pandemic for the court's inability to keep regular hours. The restrictions for Bremerton’s court make it the only court of limited jurisdiction in Kitsap County to institute new public access restrictions. The city courthouse was closed to the public starting on Monday, with all court hearings being held on Zoom. Court hearings will be limited, and cases will be continued as courtroom staffing allows, according to the emergency administrative order. The new restrictions could be updated or amended. Judge Tracy Flood, who took office in January, issued the emergency administrative order Sunday, citing “constantly changing issues” starting with the onset of pandemic restrictions and accommodations in March 2020.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Appalachian Regional Commission is granting $47 million to 52 projects aimed at economic diversification in communities affected by job losses in the coal industry. The funding, which comes from the commission’s POWER Initiative, will reach 181 counties. The funding is the largest to date since the initiative was launched in 2015, the commission said Monday in a statement. It is aimed at creating jobs, expanding skills training and attracting private investments to support industries such as agriculture, food and tourism. “Our coal-impacted communities are a vital part of Appalachia’s 13 states and 423 counties – when our coal communities thrive, our entire region is uplifted,” said ARC Federal Co-Chair Gayle Manchin. The POWER Initiative is funded by Congress and has invested $367 million in 447 projects throughout Appalachia, according to the commission. Hundreds of coal-fired power plants have shuttered over the last decade.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMaple Grove: Sheriff’s investigators are willing to forgo any possible underage drinking violations in order to get more information about a bonfire explosion that injured more than a dozen people, including some critically, officials said Tuesday. The Shawano County Sheriff’s Office says as many as 40 current and former Pulaski High School students were at the bonfire Friday night in the Town of Maple Grove, which is about 25 miles south of Green Bay. The sheriff’s office believes the explosion was triggered when someone pushed a 55-gallon drum containing diesel fuel into the fire. Investigators say 17 people injured were privately transported to hospitals after the explosion. Seven of those were transferred to Ascension Columbia St. Mary’s Hospital in Milwaukee to have their burns treated, WLUK-TV reported. Authorities say a number of the injured remain hospitalized, some in critical condition. “We understand there may be some apprehension for some to meet with us based on the evidence of underage drinking, and although underage drinking is something law enforcement agencies take seriously, we can assure those who were there, that our detectives do not have intentions on issuing citations for this, as our main focus and concern is gathering the facts of this tragic event,” the sheriff’s office said. A number of people have come forward with information, investigators said, but there are other witnesses to the explosion who have not.\n\nWyoming\n\nShoshone National Forest: A grizzly bear attacked and injured two men who apparently surprised the bruin while they were recreating in northwestern Wyoming, state wildlife officials said Monday. The encounter happened Saturday while the men were off a trail and searching for antlers shed by deer and elk in the forest southeast of Yellowstone National Park, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department said. The antlers can be sold for taxidermy and craft purposes and for dog chews. The men were able to call 911 from near the scene and other recreationists in the area were able to get them to the trailhead, where they met search and rescue teams. One man was flown to the hospital by helicopter while the other was taken by ambulance. Their conditions were not known on Monday, wildlife officials said. Game and Fish personnel were still investigating the attack. Reports from hunters and landowners in the area where the attack occurred indicate there may be six to 10 bears moving between agricultural fields and low elevation slopes, Dan Smith, a regional wildlife supervisor, said in a statement. The agency will continue to monitor bear activity in the area and work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make management decisions in the best interest of public safety, Smith said. Grizzly bears are protected under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/23/debate-transcript-trump-biden-final-presidential-debate-nashville/3740152001/", "title": "Debate transcript: Trump, Biden final presidential debate in Nashville", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nHere is the full transcript of the final presidential debate between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, moderated by Kristen Welker in Nashville on Oct. 22, 2020. Headers have been added for ease of reading.\n\n[0:00] Welker: A very good evening to both of you. This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I'm going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you're ready, let's start.\n\nAnd we will begin with the fight against the coronavirus. President Trump, the first question is for you. The country is heading into a dangerous new phase. More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID. So please be specific: how would you leave the country during this next stage of the coronavirus crisis? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\nTrump and Biden on COVID-19\n\n[1:03] Trump: So, as you know, more 2.2 million people, modeled out, were expected to die. We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It's a worldwide pandemic. It’s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we're fighting it and we're fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it's now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it's now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that's coming, it's ready. It's going to be announced within weeks, and it's going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me — a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn't be here tonight. And now they say I'm immune. Whether it's four months or a lifetime, nobody's been able to say that, but I'm immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that's a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I've been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we've been able to do with the — if you take a look at what we've done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We're now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we're rounding the turn, we're rounding the corner, it's going away.\n\n[3:05] Welker: OK, former Vice President Biden, to you, how would you lead the country out of this crisis? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[3:12] Biden: 220,000 Americans dead. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who's responsible for not taking control — in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially — anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We're in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what's going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they're starting from a very low rate. We're starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we'll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks — the President's own advisors told them — we could save 100,000 lives. And we're in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We're in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal — one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world — said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan.\n\n[5:00] Welker: President Trump, I'd like to follow up with you and your comments. You talked about taking a therapeutic. I assume you're referencing Regeneron. You also said a vaccine will be coming within weeks. Is that a guarantee?\n\n[5:12] Trump: It is not a guarantee but it will be by the end of the year, but I think it has a good chance. One or two companies, I think, within a matter of weeks, and it will be distributed very quickly.\n\n[5:21] Welker: Can you tell us what companies?\n\nTrump: Johnson and Johnson is doing very well. Moderna is doing very well. Pfizer is doing very well, and we have numerous others. And then we also have others that we're working on very closely with other countries, in particular Europe.\n\n[5:34] Welker: Let me follow up with you, and because this is new information — You have said a vaccine is coming soon, within weeks now. Your own officials say it could take well into 2021 at the earliest for enough Americans to get vaccinated, and even then they say the country will be wearing masks and distancing into 2022. Is your timeline realistic?\n\n[5:52] Trump: No, I think my timeline is going to be more accurate. I don't know that they're counting on the military the way I do, but we have our generals lined up, one in particular, that's the head of logistics. And this is a very easy distribution for him. He's ready to go as soon as we have the vaccine, and we expect to have 100 million vials as soon as we have the vaccine, he's ready to go.\n\n[6:12] Welker: Vice President Biden, your reaction? Just 40% of Americans say they would definitely agree to take a coronavirus vaccine if it was approved by the government. What steps would you take to give Americans confidence in a vaccine if it were approved?\n\n[6:25] Biden: Make sure it's totally transparent. Have the scientific world see, know, look at it, go through all the processes. And by the way, this is the same fellow who told you this is going to end by Easter last time. This the same fellow who told you that, don't worry, we're going to end this by the summer. We're about to go into a dark winter, a dark winter, and he has no clear plan and there's no prospect that there's going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.\n\n[6:53] Welker: President Trump, your reaction? He says you have no plan.\n\n[6:55] Trump: I don’t think it’s going to be a dark winter at all. We're opening up our country. We've learned and studied and understand the disease, which we didn't know at the beginning. When I closed and banned China from coming in heavily infected, and then ultimately Europe, but China was in January — months later he was saying I was xenophobic, I did it too soon. Now he's saying, ‘Oh, I should have, I should have, you know, moved quicker.’ But he didn't move quicker; he was months behind me, many months behind me. And frankly, he ran the H1N1 swine flu, and it was a total disaster. Far less lethal. But it was a total disaster. Had that had this kind of numbers, 700,000 people would be dead right now, but it was a far less lethal disease. Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said ‘It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn't know what we were doing.’ Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this. Also everything that he said about the way — every single move that he said we should make — that's what we've done, we've done all of it, but he was way behind us.\n\n[8:09] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response?\n\n[8:10] Biden: My responses is, he is xenophobic but not because he shut down access from China. And he did it late, after 40 countries had already done that. In addition to that, what he did, he made sure that we had 44 people that were in there, in China, trying to get to Wuhan to determine what exactly the source was. What did the President say in January? He said no, he said, this is — he's being transparent, the president of China is being transparent. We owe hkim a debt of gratitude. We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people. And again, I go back to this, he had nothing. He did virtually nothing. And then he gets out of the hospital, and he talks about we're, this is, ‘Oh, don't worry. This is all going to be over soon.’ Come on, there's not another serious scientist in the world who thinks it’s going to be over soon.\n\n[9:02] Welker: President Trump, your reaction?\n\n[9:03] Trump: I did not say over soon. I say we're learning to live with it. We have no choice. We can't lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does. He has the ability to lock himself up. I don’t know, he's obviously made a lot of money, someplace, but he has this thing about living in a basement. People can’t do that. By the way, I, as the president, couldn't do that. I'd love to put myself in the basement or in a beautiful room in the White House and go away for a year and a half until it disappears. I can't do that. And here’s — every, every meeting I had — every meeting I had — and I meet a lot of families, including Gold Star families and military families, every meeting I had — and I had to meet them, I had to, it would be horrible to have canceled everything. I said, you know, this is dangerous. And you catch it. And you know, I caught it. I learned a lot. I learned a lot, great doctors, great hospitals. And now, I recovered. 99.9 of young people recover. 99% of people recover. We have to recover. We can't close up our nation, we have to open our school, and we can't close up our nation, or you're not going to have a nation.\n\n[10:09] Welker: And of course the CDC has said young people can get sick with COVID-19 and can pass it. Vice President Biden, I want to talk broadly about strategy, though.\n\n[10:19] Biden: Can I respond to that?\n\n[10:20] Welker: 30 seconds please, and then I have a question.\n\n[10:22] Biden: Number one. He says that we're, you know, we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it. You folks home will have an empty chair at the kitchen table this morning. That man or wife going to bed tonight and reaching over to try to touch their, out of habit, where their wife or husband was, is gone. Learning to live with it? Come on. We're dying with it, because he's never said — he said it's dangerous. When's the last time? Is it really dangerous, still? Are we dangerous? Tell the people, is it dangerous now? What should they do about the danger? And you say, I take no responsibility.\n\n[10:55] Welker: Let me talk about —\n\n[10:56] Trump: Excuse me.\n\n[10:57] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[10:58] Trump: I take full responsibility. It's not my fault that it came here. It's China's fault. You know what, it's not Joe's fault that it came here either. It's China's fault. They kept it from going into the rest of China, for the most part, but they didn't keep it from coming out to the world including Europe and ourselves\n\n[11:15] Welker: Vice President Biden. as tracked is that when we knew was coming, when it hit.\n\n[11:16] Biden: The fact is, when we knew it was coming, when it hit — What happened? What did the President say? He said don't worry, it's going to go away, it’s going to be gone by Easter. Don't worry, the warm weather. Don't worry, maybe inject bleach — he said he was kidding when he said that, but a lot of people thought it was serious. A whole range of things the President said. And even today, he thinks we are in control. We're about to lose 200,000 more people\n\n[11:42] Welker: President Trump.\n\n[11:43] Trump: Look, perhaps just to finish this, I was kidding on that but just to finish this. When I closed, he said, I shouldn't have closed. And that went on for months. What Nancy Pelosi said the same thing. She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown in San Francisco. But when I closed, he said, this is a terrible thing. You’re xenophobic. I think he called me racist, even, and because I was closing it to China. Now he says I should have closed it earlier. It just Joe, it doesn't —\n\n[12:12] Biden: I didn't say either of those things.\n\n[12:13] Trump: You certainly did.\n\n[12:16] Biden: I talked about his xenophobia in a different context. It wasn't about closing the border to Chinese coming to the United States.\n\n[12:23] Welker: All right, I want to talk about both of your different strategies to handling this.\n\n[12:26] Trump: He thought I shouldn't have closed the border. That’s obvious.\n\n[12:30] Welker: Do you wanna respond to that quickly, vice president?\n\n[12:33] Biden: No.\n\n[12:33] Welker: OK, let's talk about your different strategies toward dealing with this. Mr. Vice President, you suggested you would support new shutdowns if scientists recommended it. What do you say to Americans who are fearful that the cost of shutdowns, the impact on the economy, the higher rates of hunger depression, domestic and substance abuse, outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus?\n\n[12:51] Biden: What I would say is I'm going to shut down the virus, not the country. It’s his ineptitude that caused the country to have to shut down in large part — why businesses have gone under, why schools are closed, why so many people have lost their living and why they're concerned. Those other concerns are real. That's why he should have been — instead of in a sand trap at his golf course — he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.\n\n[13:21] Welker: You haven't ruled out more shutdowns\n\n[13:24] Biden: Oh no, I'm not shutting down the nation but there are, look, they need standards. The standard is, if you have a reproduction rate in a community that's above a certain level, everybody says, slow up. More social distancing. Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums. Do not open until you get this under control, under more control. But when you do open, give the people the capacity to be able to open and have the capacity to do it safely. For example schools — schools, they need a lot of money to open. They need to deal with ventilation systems, they need to deal with smaller classes, more teacher, more pods, and he's refused to support that money, or at least up to now\n\n[14:03] Welker: Let's talk about schools. President Trump —\n\n[14:05] Trump: Well, I think we have to respond, if I might.\n\n[14:07] Welker: Please, and then I have a follow up.\n\n[14:08] Trump: Thank you, and I appreciate that. Look, all he does is talk about shutdowns but forget about him. His democrat governors — Cuomo in New York, you look at what's going on in California, you look at Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Democrats, Democrats all — they are shut down so tight, and they're dying. They're dying. And he supports all these people. All he talks about is shutdowns No, we're not going to shut down, and we have to open our schools. And it's like, as an example, I have a young son. He also tested positive. By the time I spoke to the doctor, the second time, he was fine, it just went away. Young people, I guess it’s their immune system.\n\n[14:46] Welker: Let me follow up, President Trump. You've demanded schools open in person and insisted they can do it safely. But just yesterday, Boston became the latest city to move its public school system entirely online after a coronavirus spike. What is your message to parents who worry that sending their children to school will endanger not only their kids, but also their teachers and families?\n\n[15:04] Trump: I want to open the schools. The transmittal rate to the teachers is very small, but I want to open the schools. We have to open our country. We're not going to have a country. You can't do this, we can't keep this country closed. It is a massive country with a massive economy. People are losing their jobs, they're committing suicide. There's depression, alcohol, drugs at a level that nobody's ever seen before. There's abuse, tremendous abuse. We have to open our country. You know I've said it often — the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself, and that's what's happening, and he wants to close down. He'll close down the country if one person in our, in our massive bureaucracy says we should close it down.\n\n[15:49] Welker: Vice President Biden, your —\n\n[15:51] Biden: Simply not true. We're gonna be able to walk and chew gum at the same time. We ought to be able to safely open, but we need resources to open. You need to be able to, for example, if you're gonna open a business, have social distancing within the business. You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another. You need to be in a position where you can take testing rapidly and know whether a person is, in fact, infected. You need to be able to trace. You need to be able to provide all the resources that are needed to do this and that is not inconsistent with saying that we're going to make sure that we open safely. And by the way, all you teachers out there — not that many of you are going to die, so don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Come on.\n\n[16:37] Welker: President Trump, let me follow up with you quickly.\n\n[16:39] Trump: I will say this, if you go and look at what's happened to New York, ut's a ghost town. It's a ghost town. And when you talk about plexiglas — these are restaurants that are dying. These are businesses with no money. Putting the plexiglas is unbelievably expensive, and it's not the answer. I mean, you're going to sit there in a cubicle wrapped around with plastic? These are businesses that are dying, Joe, you can't do that to people, which again, take a look at New York and what's happened to my wonderful city. For so many years, I loved it. It was vibrant. It's dying. Everyone's leaving New York.\n\n[17:34] Welker: Vice President.\n\n[17:34] Biden: Take a look what New York has done in terms of turning the curve down, in terms of the number of people dying. And I don't look at this in terms of what he does, blue states and red states. They’re all the United States. And look at the states that are having such a spike in the coronavirus. They’re the red states. They are the states in the Midwest, they are the states in the upper Midwest, that's where the spike is occurring significantly, but they're all Americans. They're all Americans and what we have to do is say, wear these masks, number one, make sure we get the help that the businesses need. The money's already been passed to do that. It's been out there since the beginning of this summer and nothing's happened.\n\nTrump: New York has lost more than 40,000 people. 11,000 people in nursing.\n\n[18:00] Welker: President Trump, what about —\n\n[18:02] Trump: When you say spike, take a look at what's happening in Pennsylvania, where they've had it closed. Take a look at what's happening with your friend in Michigan, where her husband's the only one allowed to do anything. It's been like a prison. Now it was just ruled unconstitutional. Take a look at North Carolina. They're having spikes and they've been closed, and they're getting killed financially. We can't let that happen, Joe, you can't let that happen. We have to open up and we understand that disease, we have to protect our seniors, we have to protect our elderly, we have to protect, especially, our seniors with heart problems and diabetes problems, and we will protect them. We have the best testing in the world by far. That's why we have so many cases.\n\n[18:42] Welker: Let me follow up with you before we move on to our next section. President Trump, this week you called Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's best known infectious disease expert, “a disaster.” You described him and other medical experts as “idiots.” If you're not listening to them, who are you listening to?\n\n[18:58] Trump: I'm listening to all of them, including Anthony. I get along very well with Anthony. But he did say, ‘don't wear masks.’ He did say, as you know, ‘this is not going to be a problem.’ I think he's a Democrat, but that's okay. He said, ‘this is not going to be a problem. We are not going to have a problem at all.’ When Joe says that, I said — Anthony Fauci said and others and many others. And I'm not knocking him. Nobody knew. Look, nobody knew what this thing was, nobody knew where it was coming from, what it was. We've learned a lot, but Anthony said, ‘don't wear masks.’ Now he wants to wear masks. Anthony also said, if you look back, exact words, here’s his exact words: ‘This is no problem, this is going to go away soon.’ So he's allowed to make mistakes, he happens to be a good person.\n\n[19:43] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response, quickly and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\n[19:45] Biden: My response is think about what the President knew in January and didn't tell the American people. He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air, and it was much worse than — much worse — than the flu. He went on record and said to one of your colleagues, recorded, that in fact he knew how dangerous it was but he didn't want to tell us, didn't want to tell us because he didn't want us to panic. He didn't want us — Americans don't panic. He panicked. Well, guess what, in the meantime, we find out in the New York Times the other day that in fact, his folks went to Wall Street and said, ‘this is a really dangerous thing,’ and a memo out of that meeting — not from his administration, but from some of the brokers — had said, ‘sell short, because we gotta get moving. It's a dangerous problem.’\n\n[20:30] Trump: Well this is —\n\n[20:31] Welker: I’m going to give you 30 seconds to respond and then we're gonna move on.\n\n[20:33] Trump: I don't know if somebody went to Wall Street. You're the one that takes all the money from Wall Street. I don't take it. You have raised a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money. And every time you raise money, deals are made. I could raise so much more money. As president and as somebody that knows most of those people, I could call the heads of Wall Street, the heads of every company in America, I would blow away every record. But I don't want to do that because it puts me in a bad position. And then you bring up Wall Street? You shouldn't be bringing up Wall Street. Because you're the one that takes the money from Wall Street, not me. I could blow away your records like you wouldn't believe. We don't need money. We have plenty of money. In fact, we beat Hillary Clinton with a tiny fraction of the money that she was able to get. Don’t tell me about wall street.\n\n[21:15] Welker: All right, gentlemen, we're gonna move on.\n\n[21:17] Biden: Average contribution, $43.\n\nOn national security\n\n[21:18] Welker: All right, we're gonna move on to our next section which is national security. And I do want to start with the security of our elections and some breaking news from overnight. Just last night, top intelligence officials confirmed again that both Russia and Iran are working to influence this election. Both countries have obtained U.S. voter registration information, these officials say, and Iran sent intimidating messages to Florida voters. This question goes to you, Mr. Vice President, what would you do to put an end to this threat? You have two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[21:48] Biden: I made it clear. And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay the price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election — I won't even get into the last one — this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I'm elected. Interfering with American sovereignty. That's what's going on right now. They're interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don't think the President said anything to Putin about it. I don't think he's talking a lot. I don't think he said a word. I don't know why he hasn't said a word to Putin about it. And I don't know what he has recently said, if anything, to the Iranians. My guess is he’d probably be more outspoken with regard to the Iranians. But the point is this, folks. We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election. His own national security advisor told him that what is happening with his buddy — well, I won't, I shouldn't — I will — his buddy Rudy Giuliani. He's being used as a Russian pawn. He's being fed information that is Russian, that is not true. And then what happens? Nothing happens. And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don't understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he's actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he's engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don't know why he doesn't do it but it's worth asking the question. Why isn't that being done? Any country that interferes with us will, in fact, pay a price because they're affecting our sovereignty.\n\n[23:45] Welker: President Trump, same question to you. Let me, let me ask the question. You're gonna have two minutes to respond for two elections in a row now there has been substantial interference from foreign adversaries. What would you do in your next term to put an end to this? Two minutes, uninterrupted.\n\n[23:56] Trump: Well, let me respond to the first part, as Joe answered. Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow’s wife. He got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you're gonna have to explain — why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don't get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John — who is John Radcliffe, who is a fantastic DNI — he said, the one thing that's common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I've done with NATO. You know, I've got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that's to guard against Russia. I sold — while he was selling pillows and sheets — I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I'll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it's even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now.\n\n[26:01] Welker: Vice President Biden, you may respond to follow up on the election security.\n\n[26:06] Biden: I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life. We learn that this President paid 50 times the tax in China, as a secret bank account with China, does business in China, and in fact, is talking about me taking money? I have not taken a single penny from any country whatsoever, ever, number one. Number two, this is a president — I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. 22 years of my tax return. You have not released a single solitary year of your tax return. What are you hiding? Why are you unwilling? The foreign countries are paying you a lot. Russia is paying you a lot. China is paying a lot. And your hotels and all your businesses all around the country, all around the world. And China's building a new road to a new gas… a golf course you have overseas. So what's going on here? Why don't you release your tax return or stop talking about corruption?\n\n[27:04]Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\n[27:06] Trump: First of all, I called my accounts — under audit. I'm going to release them as soon as we can. I want to do it, and it will show how successful, how great this company is. But much more importantly than that, people were saying $750. I asked them a week ago, I said, what did I pay? They said, sir, you pre-paid tens of millions of dollars. I prepaid my tax. Tens. Over the last number of years. Tens of millions of dollars, I prepaid, because at some point, they think, it's an estimate. They think I may have to pay tax. So, I already prepaid it. Nobody told me that.\n\n[27:42] Welker: Did your accountant tell you —\n\n[27:44] Trump: Excuse me. And it wasn't written whenever they write this. They keep talking about $750, which I think is a filing fee. But let me just tell you, I prepaid millions and millions of dollars in taxes, number one. Number two, I don't make money from China, you do. I don't make money from Ukraine, you do. I don't make money from Russia. You made three and a half million dollars, Joe, and your son gave you. They even have a statement that we have to give 10% to the big man. You're the big man, I think. I don't know, maybe you're not. But you're the big man, I think. You son said that we have to give 10% to the big man. Joe, what's that all about? It's terrible.\n\n[28:22] Welker: All right, gentlemen, I want to ask you both some questions about all of this. I'm gonna let you both respond, very quickly. You just said you spoke to your accountant about potentially releasing your taxes. Did he tell you when you can release them? Do you have a deadline for when you're going to release them to the American people?\n\n[28:35] Trump: I get treated worse than the Tea Party got treated. A lot of people in there, deep down in the IRS, they treat me horribly. We made a deal, it was all settled, until I decided to run for president. I get treated very badly by the IRS, very unfairly, but we had a deal all done. As soon as we're completed with the deal, I want to release it. But I have paid millions and millions of dollars. And it's worse than paying. I paid in advance. It's called prepaying your taxes. I paid.\n\n[29:04] Welker: I want to ask you both about questions regarding your potential foreign entanglements and questions that have been raised to give you both a chance to talk about this more broadly.\n\n[29:12] Biden: At some point I want to respond.\n\n[29:13] Welker: Respond very quickly, and then I'll get to my question.\n\n[29:15] Biden: Why do he — He's been saying this for four years. Show us. Just show us. Stop playing around. You’ve been saying for four years you’re going to release your taxes. Nobody knows, Mr. President, they do know is you're not paying your taxes or you're paying taxes that are so low. When last time he said what he paid, he said, ‘I only pay that little because I'm smart. I know how to game the system.’ Come on, come on, folks.\n\n[29:42] Welker: Quickly, President Trump, and then I want to get to two questions to both of you.\n\n[29:46] Trump: I was put through a phony witch hunt for three years. It started before I even got elected. They spied on my campaign. No president should ever have to go through what I went through. Let me just say this. Mueller and 18 angry Democrats, and FBI agents all over the place spent, $48 million. They went through everything I had, including my tax returns, and they found absolutely no collusion and nothing wrong. $48 million. I guarantee you, if I spent 1 million on you Joe, I could find plenty wrong, because the kind of things that you've done and the kind of monies that your family has taken — I mean, your brother made money in Iraq, millions of dollars. Your other brother made a fortune, and it's all through you, Joe. And they say you get some of it. And you do live very well. You have houses all over the place. You live very well.\n\n[30:41] Welker: All right, gentlemen, let me just ask some questions about all of this broadly. Vice President Biden, there have been questions about the work your son has done in China, and for Ukrainian energy company when you were Vice President. In retrospect, was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical?\n\n[30:56] Biden: Nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal. With regard to Ukraine, we had this whole question about whether or not, because he was on the board, I later learned, of Burisma, a company, that somehow I had done something wrong. Yet every single solitary person, when he was going through his impeachment, testifying under oath who worked for him, said I did my job impeccably. I carried out US policy. Not one, single, solitary thing was out of line. Not a single thing, number one. Number two, the guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy, trying to bribe the Ukrainian government to say something negative about me, which they would not do, and did not do, because it never, ever, ever happened. My son has not made money in terms of this thing about — what are you talking about — China. I have not had it. The only guy that made money from China is this guy. He’s the only one. Nobody else has made money from China.\n\n[31:58] Welker: Let me ask my question to you.\n\n[32:00] Trump: Could I just — one thing.\n\n[32:01] Welker: Very quickly.\n\n[32:02] Trump: His son didn't have a job for a long time, was sadly no longer in the military service, I won't get into that. And he didn't have a job. As soon as he became vice president, Burisma — not the best, not the best reputation in the world — I hear they paid him 183,000 a month. Listen to this, 183, and they gave him a $3 million upfront payment, and he had no energy experience. That’s 100% dishonest.\n\n[32:27] Welker: I’m going to let the vice president respond to that quickly and then I have a question for you.\n\n[32:31] Biden: No basis for that. Everybody investigated that, no one said anything he did was wrong in Ukraine.\n\n[32:35] Welker: OK, President Trump, this is for you. Since you took office, you've never divested from your business. You've personally promoted your properties abroad. A report this week, which was referenced, does indicate that your company has a bank account in China. So how can voters know that you don't have any foreign conflicts of interest?\n\n[32:52] Trump: I have many bank accounts and they're all listed and they're all over the place. I mean, I was a businessman doing business. The bank account you're referring to — which is, everybody knows about it, it's listed — the bank account was in 2013. That's what it was. It was opened. It was closed in 2015, I believe, and then I decided, because I was going to do, I was thinking about doing a deal in China, like millions of other people, I was thinking about it. And I decided I'm not going to do it, didn't like it, I decided not to do it, had an account open and I closed it.\n\n[32:26] Welker: OK.\n\n[32:27] Trump: Excuse me, and then unlike him, where he's Vice President, and he does business, I then decided to run for president after that. That was before. So I closed it before I even ran for president, let alone became president, big difference. He is the Vice President of the United States, and his son, his brother and his other brother are getting rich, they're like a vacuum cleaner, there's something —\n\n[33:54] Welker: We do need to move on. I do want to ask you, Vice President Biden, about China. Let's talk about China more broadly. There have, of course, President Trump has said that they should pay for not being fully transparent in regards to the coronavirus. If you were president, would you make China pay and please be specific, what would that look like?\n\nBiden: What I’d make China do is play by the international rules, not like he has done. He has caused the deficit in China to go up not down — with China, go up not down. We are making sure that in order to do business in China, you have to give all your intellectual property. You have to get/have a partner in China, it is 51%. We would not do that at all, number one. Number two, we're in a situation where China would have to play by the rules internationally as well. When I met with Xi, and when I was still vice president, he said ‘we're setting up air identification zones in the South China Sea, you can't fly through them.’ I said, ‘we're gonna fly through them. We just flew B52/B1 bombers through it. We're not going to pay attention.’ They have to play by the rules, and what's he do? He embraces guys like the thugs like in North Korea, and, and, and the Chinese president and Putin and others, and he pokes his finger in the eye of all our friends, all of our allies. We make up only — we’ re 25%. 25% of the world's economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us, saying to China, these are the rules. You play by them or you're going to pay the price for not paying by them, economically. That's the way I will run it. And that's what we did and upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things when we were president and vice president.\n\n[35:33] Welker: All right, let's talk about North Korea.\n\n[35:35] Trump: Excuse me, no, I have to respond to this.\n\n[35:37] Welker: OK, very quickly and then we're gonna have...\n\n[35:39] Trump: His son walked out with a billion and a half dollars from China —\n\n[35:41] Biden: Not true.\n\n[35:42] Trump: — after spending 10 minutes in office and being an Air Force Two, number one. Number two, there's a very strong email, talking about your family wanting to make $10 million a year for introductions.\n\n[35:56] Biden: That is not true.\n\n[35:56] Welker: President Trump, on China policy, though. What are you gonna do? What specifically are you going to do to make China pay?\n\n[36:03] Trump: First of all, China is paying. They’re paying billions and billions of dollars. I just gave $28 billion.\n\n[36:07] Welker: Through sanctions?\n\n[36:08] Trump: I just gave $28 billion to our farmers.\n\n[36:12] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:14] Trump: It’s what?\n\n[36:15] Biden: Taxpayers money.\n\n[36:16] Trump: No, the taxpayers. It's called China.\n\n[36:20] Biden: Not true.\n\n[36:20] Trump: China pays for $28 billion and you know what they did to pay it, Joe? They devalued their currency and they also paid up, and you know who got the money? Our farmers. Our great farmers, because they would target it. You never charge them anything. Also, I charged them 25% on dumped steel, because they were killing our steel industry. We were not going to have a steel, and now we have a steel industry\n\n[36:42] Welker: OK, Vice President Biden, your response, please?\n\n[36:49] Biden: This isn't about me. There's a reason why he's bringing up all this malarkey. There's a reason for it. He doesn't want to talk about the substantive issues. It's not about his family and my family. It's about your family, and your family's hurting badly. If you're making less than, if you're a middle class family, you're getting hurt badly right now. You're sitting at the kitchen table this morning deciding, well, we can't get new tires, they’re bald, because we have to wait another month. Or, so are we going to be able to pay the mortgage? Who's going to tell her, she can't go back to community college? They're the decisions you're making in the middle class families like I grew up in Scranton and Claymot. They're in trouble. We should be talking about your families but that's the last thing he wants to talk about.\n\n[37:26] Welker: I wanted to say, I want to tell —\n\n[37:28] Trump: That is a typical statement. Just 10 seconds, please.\n\n[37:29] Welker: 10 seconds Mr President, 10 seconds.\n\n[37:31] Trump: Just a typical political statement. Let's get off this China thing, and then he looks — the family, around the table, everything. Just a typical politician when I see that.\n\n[37:40] Welker: All right, let’s talk —\n\n[37:40] Trump: I’m not a typical politician, that’s why I got elected.\n\n[37:44] Welker: Let’s talk about —\n\n[37:44] Trump: Let’s get off the subject of China, let's talk around sitting around the table. Come on, Joe, you can do better.\n\n[37:48] Welker: We're gonna talk about North Korea now. President Trump, you've met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's three times. You've talked about your beautiful letters with him, you've touted the fact that there hasn't been a war or a long range missile test, and yet North Korea recently rolled out its biggest ever intercontinental ballistic missile and continues to develop its nuclear arsenal. Do you see that as a betrayal of the relationship? Just 30 seconds here because we need to get on to the next topic.\n\n[38:12] Trump: When I met with Barack Obama, we sat in the White House, right at the beginning had a great conversation, was supposed to be 15 minutes and it was well over an hour. He said the biggest problem we have is North Korea. He indicated we will be in a war with North Korea. Guess what, it would be a nuclear war, and he does have plenty of nuclear capability. In the meantime, I have a very good relationship with him, different kind of a guy but he probably thinks the same thing about me. We have a different kind of relationship. We have a very good relationship, and there's no war. And you know, about two months ago, he broke into a certain area. They said, ‘oh there's going to be trouble.’ I said, ‘No, they're not. Because he's not going to do that.’ And I was right. :ook, instead of being in a war where millions of people — Seoul, you know, is 25 miles away, millions and millions, 32 million people in Seoul — millions of people would be dead right now. We don’t have a war, and I have a good relationship.\n\n[39:05] Welker: Vice President Biden, North Korea conducted four nuclear tests under the Obama administration. Why do you think you would be able to rein in this persistent threat?\n\n[39:15] Biden: Because I'd make it clear, which we were making clear to China, they had to be part of the deal, because here's the root. I made it clear, as a spokesperson for the administration when I went to China, they said, ‘Why are you moving your missile defense up so close? Why are you moving more forces? Why are you continuing to do military maneuvers with South Korea?’ I said, ‘Because North Korea is a problem. And we're going to continue to do it so we can control them. We're going to make sure we can control them and make sure they can not hurt us. And so if you want to do something about it, step up. And help if not, it's going to continue.’ What has he done? He's legitimized North Korea, he's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug, and he talks about how we're better off, and they have much more capable missiles, able to reach U.S. territory, much more easily than ever did before.\n\n[40:05] Welker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President Biden, you've said you wouldn't meet with Kim Jong Un without preconditions. Are there any conditions under which you would meet with him?\n\n[40:12] Biden: On the condition that he would agree that he would be drawing down his nuclear capacity to get there. The Korean Peninsula should be a nuclear free zone.\n\n[40:21] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families.\n\n[40:24] Trump: Kristen, they tried to meet with him.\n\n[40:24] Welker: Very quickly. 10 seconds, President Trump.\n\nTrump: They tried to meet with him, he wouldn’t do it. He didn’t like Obama. He didn’t like him. He wouldn’t do it.\n\n[40:32] Welker: OK, I’ve got to give him a chance to respond.\n\n[40:33] Trump: They tried, he wouldn’t do it. And that’s okay. You know what, North Korea, we’re not in a war. We have a good relationship. You know, people don’t understand — having a good relationship with leaders of other countries is a good thing.\n\n[40:43] Welker: President Trump, we have to move on. We have a lot of questions to get through.\n\n[40:43] Biden: We had a good relationship with Hitler before he in fact invaded Europe, the rest of Europe. Come on. The reason he would not meet with President Obama is because President Obama said we’re gonna talk about denuclearization, we’re not gonna legitimize you, we’re gonna continue to put stronger and stronger sanctions on you. That’s why he wouldn’t meet with us.\n\n[41:10] Trump: And it didn’t happen.\n\n[41:12] Welker: Let’s move on and talk about American families.\n\n[41:14] Trump: Excuse me, he left me a mess, Kristen. They left me a mess. North Korea was a mess.\n\n[41:18] Welker: We need to move on so that we have time to get to all our questions tonight, President Trump.\n\n[41:22] Trump: Remember the first two or three months. There was a very dangerous period in my first three months, before we sort of worked things out a little bit. They left us a mess, and Obama would be – I think, the first to say — it was the single biggest problem, he thought, that our country had.\n\nOn the economy\n\n[41:47] Welker: All right, let's move on to American families and the economy. One of the issues that's most important to them is health care, as you both know. Today, there was a key vote on a new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and healthcare is at the center of her confirmation fight. Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It's headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the supreme court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight. So what would you do if those people have their health insurance taken away? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nTrump: First of all, I've already done something that nobody thought was possible. Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate -- we have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminate it; it's gone. Now it's in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, ‘Run it as well as you can’ -- to my people, great people -- ‘Run it as well as you can.’ I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything's down. Here's the problem. No matter how well you run it, it's no good. What we'd like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don't know that it's going to work. If we don't win, we will have to run it and we'll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it is much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We’ll always protect people with pre existing -- so I'd like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there'll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House at that time. And I think we're going to win the House, okay? You'll see, but I think we're gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre existing conditions -- and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we're talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love the health care, people that have been successful -- middle income people -- been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won't even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job with health care. And we're going to do even better.\n\n45:12 Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, yes, this is for you. Your health care plan calls for building on Obamacare. So my question is, what is your plan if the law is ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court? You have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\nBiden: What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option -- become Bidencare. Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be -- if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That's what's going to happen. Secondly, we're going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there's competition that doesn't exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance -- the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That's why I did not -- not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we're going to make sure we're in a situation that we've actually protect pre existing -- there's no way he can protect pre existing conditions. None, zero, you can't do it in the ether. He's been talking about this for a long time. There is no -- he's never come up with a plan. I guess we're gonna get the pre existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact that -- I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you're getting anxious -- the fact is that he’s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre existing conditions. What are they going to do?\n\n47:20 Welker: I have a follow up for you, Vice President Biden, it relates to something that President Trump said. He's accusing you of wanting socialized medicine. What do you say to people who have concerns that your health care plan, which includes a government insurance option, takes the country one step closer to a health care system run entirely by the government?\n\nBiden: What he’s saying, it's ridiculous. It’s like saying that, you know, we're the idea that, the fact that there's a public option that people can choose, that makes the socialist plan? Look, the difference between the president -- I think health care is not a privilege, it's a right. Everyone should have the right to have affordable health care. And I am very proud of my plan. It's gotten endorsed by all the major labor unions as well as, as well as a whole range of other people who in fact, are concerned in the medical field. This is something that's going to save people's lives. And this is going to give some people an opportunity, an opportunity to have health care for their children, how many of you home are worried and rolling around in bed at night wondering what in God's name are you going to do if you get sick? Because you've lost your home insurance, your health insurance, your company's gone under. We have to provide health insurance for people at an affordable rate, and that's what I do.\n\nWelker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: Excuse me, he was there for 47 years -- he didn't do it. He was now there as Vice President for eight years. And it's not like it was 25 years ago, it was three and three quarters. It was just a little while ago, right? Less than four years ago. He didn't do anything. He didn't do it. He wants socialized medicine. And it's not that he wants it, his vice president -- I mean, she is more liberal than Bernie Sanders and wants it even more, Bernie Sanders wants it, the Democrats want it. You're going to have socialized medicine. Just like you went on with fracking -- ‘We're not going to have fracking, we're going to stop fracking, we're going to stop fracking.’ Then he goes to Pennsylvania after he gets the nomination -- well he got very lucky to get it. And he goes to Pennsylvania, and he says, ‘Oh, we're gonna have fracking.’ And you never asked a question. And by the way, so far, I respect very much the way you're handling this, I have to say. But by the way, somebody should ask the question. He goes for a year --\n\n49:24 Welker: We do have a number of -- we have a number of topics.\n\nTrump: No, no, but that's a question --\n\nWelker: We're gonna get to it --\n\nTrump: It’s the same thing with socialized medicine.\n\nWelker: Vice President, your response.\n\nBiden: My response is people deserve to have affordable health care -- period. Period, period, period. And the Bidencare proposal will, in fact, provide for that affordable health care, lower premiums. What we're going to do is going to cost some money; it's going to cost over $750 billion over 10 years to do it. And they're going to have lower premiums, you can buy into the better plans, the cheaper plans, lower your premiums, deal with unexpected billing, and have your drug prices drop significantly. He keeps talking about it. He hasn't done a thing for anybody on health care, not a thing.\n\nTrump: Kristen, when he says --\n\nWelker: Very quickly, then I want to talk about what’s happening on Capitol Hill\n\n50:08 Trump: When he says public health option, he is talking about socialized medicine and health care. When he talks about a public option, he's talking about destroying your Medicare, totally destroying -- he’s destroying your Social Security. And this whole country will come down. You know, Bernie Sanders tried it in his state. His governor was a very liberal governor, they wanted to make it work --\n\nWelker: Let's see if --\n\n50:31 Trump: -- it was impossible --\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\n50:34 Biden: He thinks he's running against someone else. He's running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them. Joe Biden, he's running against. And the idea that we're in a situation and want to destroy Medicare -- this is the guy that the actuary of Medicare said, ‘If in fact’ -- and, social security -- ‘If, in fact, he continues to withhold his plan to withhold the tax on Social Security, Social Security will be bankrupt by 2023, with no way to pay for it. This is a guy who's tried to cut Medicare. So I don't know. I mean, the idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.\n\nTrump: He tried to get rid of --\n\nWelker: Vice Presiden, Mr. President, I’m going to have to go on to another question --\n\nTrump: -- he tried to hurt Social Security years ago, years ago. Go back and look at the records. He tried to hurt Social Security you've got --\n\n51:28 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next question.\n\n51:31 Trump: They say the stock market will rule if I'm elected. If he's elected, the stock market will crash.\n\nWelker: OK, let's move on to the next question.\n\nBiden: May I respond?\n\nWelker: Very quickly.\n\n51:40 Biden: The idea that the stock market is booming is his only measure of what's happening. Where I come from, in Scranton and Claymont, the people don't live off of the stock market. Just in the last three, three years during this crisis, the billionaires in this country made, according to the Wall Street, $700 billion more dollars. $700 billion more dollars. Because that's his only measure. What happens to the ordinary people out there? What happens to them?\n\n52:11 Trump: 401k’s are through the roof. 401k --\n\nWelker: All right, let’s move on.\n\n52:14 Trump: -- are through the roof. And he doesn't come from Scranton. That's like, what -- he lived there for a short period of time before he even knew --\n\nWelker: We're gonna move on --\n\nTrump: And he left. And the people of Pennsylvania will tell you that.\n\nWelker: -- to my next question, gentlemen. As of tonight, more than 12 million people are out of work. And as of tonight, 8 million more homes have fallen into poverty, and more families are going hungry every day. Those hit hardest are women and people of color. They see Washington fighting over a relief bill. Mr. President, why haven't you been able to get them the help they need? 30 seconds here.\n\nTrump: Because Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve it. I do.\n\nWelker: But you're the president.\n\nTrump: I do. But I still have to get, unfortunate -- that's one of the reasons I think we're going to take over the House, because of her. Nancy Pelosi doesn't want to approve anything. She'd love to have some victories on a date called November 3. Nancy Pelosi does not want to approve it. We are ready, willing and able to do something. Don't forget, we've already approved three plans. And it's gone through, including the Democrats, in all fairness. This one she doesn't want. It's near the election, because she thinks it helps her politically. I think it hurts her politically.\n\nWelker: All right, Mr. Vice President --\n\nBiden: You know, the Republican leader in the United States Senate said he can't -- he will not pass it. He does not have Republican votes. Why isn’t he talking to his Republican friends?\n\nWelker: Let me follow up with you, Vice President\n\nTrump: If we made a deal, we’d have --\n\n53:32 Welker: Let me ask Vice President Biden the question. You are the leader of the Democratic Party. Why have you not [] Democrats to get a deal for the American people?\n\nBiden: Well, I have and they have pushed it. Look, they passed this act all the way back in the beginning of the summer. This is like -- it's not new. It's been out there. The HEROES Act has been sitting there. And look at what's happening. When I was in charge of the Recovery Act with $800 billion, I was able to get $145 billion to local communities that have to balance their budget to states that have to balance their budgets, so then they have to fire fire -- they have to fire firefighters, teachers, first responders, law enforcement officers, so they can keep their cities and counties running. He will not support that. They have not done a thing for them. And Mitch McConnell said, ‘Let him go bankrupt. Let him go bankrupt.’ Come on. What's the matter with these --\n\nTrump: The bill that was passed in the House was a bailout of badly run high crime, Democrat, all run by Democrats, cities and states. It was a way of getting a lot of money, billions and billions of dollars to these cities. It was also a way of getting a lot of money from our people's pockets to people that come into our country illegally. We were going to take care of everything for them. And what that does, and I'd love to do that, I'd love to help them. But what that does, everybody all over the world will start pouring into our country. We can't do it. This was a way of taking care of them. This was a way of sending them things that had nothing to do with COVID, as for your question, but it was really a big bailout for badly run Democrat cities and states.\n\nWelker: I want --\n\nBiden: All right, if I get elected, I'm not gonna -- I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I'm gonna be an American president. I don't see red states and blue states. What I see is American United States. And folks, every single state out there finds themselves in trouble. They're going to start laying off, whether they're red or blue. Cops, firefighters, first responders, teachers -- because they have to balance their budget. And the founders were smart. They allowed the federal government to deficit spend to compensate for the United States of America.\n\nWelker: I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen. Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners today. Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage? You, of course, support a $15 minimum wage.\n\nBiden: I do, because I think one of the things we’re gonna have to do is we're gonna have to bail them out, too. We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses. You’ve got one in six of them going under. They're not going to be able to make it back. They passed a package that allows us to be able to call PPP, money that’s supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they could deal with their businesses being open safely. Schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in. They need the help, the businesses, as well as the schools, need the help. But this, these guys will not help them. He is not giving them any of the money.\n\nWelker: We are going to move on --\n\n56:35 Trump: For small businesses -- by raising the minimum wage and helping, I think it should be a state option. Alabama is different than New York, New York is different from Vermont. Every state is different. It should be a state option. So it's very important. We have to help our small business --\n\nWelker: You said --\n\nTrump: How are you helping small businesses, when you're forcing wages. What's going to happen and what's been proven to happen is when you do that these firemen\n\n57:03 Welker: Well you said you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour --\n\nTrump: Say again?\n\nWelker: You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Is that still the case?\n\n57:10 Trump: What I’d really like, I would consider it to an extent. I really like what I -- in a second administration -- but not to a level that's going to put all these businesses out of business. It should be a state option. Look, I have a read on different places, I know different places. They’re all different. Some places, $15 is not so bad. In other places, other states, $15 --\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, thank you. Quick response, Vice President Biden\n\nBiden: Two jobs, one job below poverty. People are making 6, 7, 8 bucks an hour. These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street, because they've allowed us to make it. What's happening? They deserve a minimum wage of $15. Anything below that put you below the poverty level. And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, business has gone out of business. That is simply not true.\n\nOn immigration\n\nWelker: We're going to talk about immigration. We're going to talk about immigration, now, gentlemen, and we're going to talk about families within this context. Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4000 kids, You've since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can't locate the parents of more than 500 children. So how will these families ever be reunited?\n\nTrump: Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels, and they're brought here and it’s easy to use them to get into our country. We now have a stronger border as we've ever had. We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall, you see the numbers, and we let people in, but they have to come in legally.\n\nWelker: But how will you reunite these kids with their families?\n\n58:48 Trump: Let me just say. They built cages. You know, they used to say I built the cages. And then they had a picture in the newspaper. There was a picture of these horrible cages and they said, ‘Look at these cages, President Trump built them.’ And then it was determined they were built in 2014. That was him.\n\nWelker: Do you have a plan to reunite the kids?\n\n59:08 Trump: Yes, we're working on a very -- we're trying very hard. But a lot of these kids come up without the parents, they come over through cartels and the coyotes and through gangs.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation. Quick response and then another question to you.\n\nBiden: These 500 plus kids came with parents. They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with. Big real tough, really strong. And guess what? They cannot -- it’s not coyotes that bring them over, their parents were with them. They got separated from their parents. And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every judge of who we are as a nation.\n\nWelker: Let me ask you a follow up --\n\nTrump: Kristen, they did it, we changed the policy. They did it. We changed it. They set up the cages. They -- who built the cages?\n\nBiden: So let's talk about --\n\nTrump: Who built the cages, Joe?\n\n59:58 Biden: Let’s talk about what we’re talking about. What happened? Parents were ripped -- their kids were ripped from their arms and separated. And now they cannot find over 500 sets of those parents and those kids are alone. Nowhere to go, nowhere to go. It's criminal. It's criminal.\n\nWelker: Let me just --\n\nTrump: Let me say this. They worked it out, we brought reporters and everything. They are so well taken care of. They're in facilities that were so clean --\n\nWelker: But some of them haven’t been reunited --\n\nTrump: But just answer one question. Who built the cages? A big ask of that, who built the cages?\n\nWelker: Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President. The Obama administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration. It also presided over record deportations as well as family detentions at the border before changing course. So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?\n\nBiden: Because we made a mistake. It took too long to get it right. Too long to get it right. I'll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States. And the fact is, and I’ve made it very clear, within 100 days, I'm going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people. And all those so called Dreamers, those DACA kids, they're going to be legally certified again, to be able to stay in this country, and put on a path to citizenship. The idea that they are being sent home by this guy, and they want to do, that is they go to a country they've never seen before. I can imagine you're five years old, your parents are taking you across the Rio Grande River and it’s and it's illegal. You say ‘Oh, no, Mom, leave me here. I'm not gonna go with you.’ They’ve been here. Many of them are model citizens. 20,000 are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.\n\n1:01:51 Welker: President Trump, your response.\n\nTrump: He had eight years to do what he said he was going to do. And I've changed without having a specific -- we get rid of catch and release, got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they live with. But he had eight years he was vice president. He did nothing except build cages to keep children in.\n\nWelker: Vice President, what’s your response?\n\nBiden: The catch and release, you know what he's talking about there? If in fact, you had family, came across, they're arrested. They, in fact, were given a date to show up for their hearing. They were released. And guess what, they showed up for the hearing. This is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country. That's never happened before. That’s never happened before in our country. You come to the United States and you make your case. That’s how you seek asylum, based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law. They're sitting in squalor on the other side of the river.\n\n1:02:55 Welker: President Trump, there is --\n\nTrump: It’s so important. It shows that he has no understanding of immigration of the laws. Catch and release is a disaster. A murderer would come in, a rapist would come in, a very bad person would come in -- we would take their name, we have to release them into our country. And then you say they come back. Less than 1% of the people come back.\n\nBiden: Not true.\n\nTrump: We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them. We would say, ‘Come back in two years, three years -- we're going to give you a court case. You did Perry Mason, we're going to give you a court case. When you say they come back, they don't come back, Joe. They never come back. Only the really -- I hate to say this -- but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back.\n\nWelker: OK, President Trump, let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we're going to move on to the next section.\n\nTrump: You don’t know the law, Joe.\n\nWelker: Vice President Biden, your response.\n\nBiden: I know the law. What he's telling you is simply not true.\n\nTrump: They don’t come back.\n\nBiden: Check it out.\n\nWelker: All right, let's move on --\n\nTrump: But we don’t have to worry about it because I terminated it. So we don’t have to worry about it\n\n1:03:59 Welker: All right, let’s move on to the next section --\n\n1:04:04 Biden: You have 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents.\n\nTrump: Go ahead.\n\nOn race in America\n\nWelker: All right. Let's talk about our next section, which is race in America. And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country. Part of that experience is something called “the talk.” It happens regardless of class and income -- parents who feel they have no choice but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin. Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nBiden: I do. I do. You know, my daughter is a social worker. And she's written a lot about this. She's got a graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work. So, one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90 percent African American, was to learn more about what was going on. When I didn't -- I never had to tell my daughter if she's pulled over, make sure she puts, for traffic stop, puts both hands on top of the wheel. And don't reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you're walking down the street, don't have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, just Yes or No sir, just hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you're a person making 300,000 -- $300,000-a-year person, or someone who's on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said we've never lived up to it. Do we hold these truths to be sovereign, are all men and women are created equal? Guess what -- we have never ever lived up to it. We have constantly been moving the needle further and further between inclusion and exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that's the end of that. We're not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I've laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It's about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence.\n\n1:06:32 Welker: President Trump, same question to you. And let me remind you of the question, I would like you to speak directly to these families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\n\nTrump: Yes, I do. And again, he's been in government 47 years. He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators. And he said that, he said it -- super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators. Nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln--possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done. Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn't do it. I don't even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it. They might have wanted to do it. But if you had to see the arms I had a twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture. And everybody knows it including some very liberal people that cried in my office--they cried in the Oval Office. Two weeks later, they're out saying, ‘Gee, we have to defeat him.’ Criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, a great senator from South Carolina. He came in with this incredible idea for opportunity zones. It’s one of the most successful programs. People don't talk about it. Tremendous investment is being made. Biggest beneficiary, the Black and Hispanic communities and then historically Black colleges and universities. After three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great, they came into the office. And they said-- I said, ‘What are you doing after three years?’ I said, ‘Why do you keep coming back?’ ‘Because we have no funding’. I said, ‘You don't have to come back every year’, ‘We have to come back’, because President Obama would never give them long term funding. And I did. Ten-year, long term funding, and I give them more money than they asked for, because I said, ‘I think you need more’. And I said, ‘The only bad part about this is I may never see you again’, because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them. But I saved colleges and universities.\n\n[1:08:28] Welker: OK. And we're going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President?\n\n[1:08:33] Biden: My response to that is I never, ever said what he accused me of saying. The fact of the matter is, in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for a while, this is the guy who said, ‘The problem with the crime bill, there's not enough people in jail. There's not enough people in jail,’ and go on my website, get the quote the date when he said it, ‘not enough people’. He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, the people who are going to mauraud our cities. This is a guy who when the Central Park five, five innocent Black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty. None of them were-- none of them were guilty of what the crime, of the crimes that were suggested. Look, and talk about he, granted, he did in fact let 20 people-- he committed 20 people’s sentences. We committed over 1,000 people’s sentences. Over 1,000. The very law he's talking about is a law that, in fact, initiated by Barack Obama. And secondly, we're in a situation here where we-- the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration. And one of the things we should be doing is there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law. That's why I'm offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts. Nobody should be going to jail because they have a drug problem. They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail. We should fundamentally change the system and that's what I'm going to do.\n\n[1:10:04] Trump: But why didn't he do it four years ago? Why didn't you do that four years ago, even less than that? Why didn't you--\n\n[1:10:10] Biden: I am not--\n\n[1:10:10] Trump: You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing.\n\n[1:10:19] Biden: We did--\n\n[1:10:20] Trump: You know, Joe, I ran because of you. I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you.\n\n[1:10:34] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that? And then I do have some questions for both of you.\n\n[1:10:38] Biden: Well, I’ll tell you what, I hope he does look at me because what's happening here is you know who I am, you know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race. I'm anxious to see this take place. I am-- the character of the country is on the ballot. Our character is on the ballot. Look at us closely.\n\n[1:11:00] Welker: Let me ask them some follow--\n\n[1:11:01] Trump: Excuse me--\n\n[1:11:04] Welker: Please respond and then we’re gonna have follow up questions.\n\n[1:11:05] Trump: If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, a wreck-- If this is true, then he's a corrupt politician. So don't give me the stuff about how you're this innocent baby. Joe, they're calling you a corrupt politician--\n\n[1:11:19] Biden: Nobody says--\n\n[1:11:20] Welker: President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race. We're talking about the issue--\n\n[1:11:21] Trump: It’s the laptop from hell. The laptop from hell.\n\n[1:11:25] Welker: President Trump, we’re talking about race right now and I do want to speak on the issue of race. President Trump---\n\n[1:11:29] Biden: Nobody-- Kristen, I have to respond to that.\n\n[1:11:30] Welker: Please, very quickly.\n\n[1:11:32] Biden: Look, there are 50 former National Intelligence folks who said that what this, he's accusing me of is a Russian plan. They have said that this has all the characteristics-- four-- five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he's saying is a bunch of garbage. Nobody believes it except him, his, and his good friend Rudy Giuliani.\n\n[1:11:51] Trump: You mean, the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax? You gotta be--\n\n[1:11:58] Biden: That’s exactly what-- That’s exactly what--\n\n[1:12:00] Trump: Is this where you’re going? This is where he’s going. The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?\n\n[1:12:03] Welker: Gentleman, I want to stay on the issue of race, okay--\n\n[1:12:05] Trump: You have to be kidding here. Here we go again with Russia.\n\n[1:12:09] Welker: Mr. President, we're gonna continue on the issue of race. Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate. You've shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their first amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?\n\n[1:12:32] Trump: Well you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter they were chanting ‘Pigs in a blanket’, talking about police, ‘Pigs, Pigs’, talking about our police, ‘Pigs in a blanket, fry' em like bacon’. I said, ‘That's a horrible thing’. And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:03] Welker: What do you say to men who are concerned by that rhetoric?\n\n[1:12:06] Trump: I don't, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and opportunity zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. They can say anything. I mean, they can say anything. It's a very-- it makes me sad because I am the least racist person. I can't even see the audience because it's so dark, but I don't care who's in the audience. I’m the least racist person in this room.\n\n[1:13:35] Welker: OK. Vice President Biden, let me ask you, very quickly, and then I have a follow up question for you.\n\n[1:13:39] Biden: Abraham Lincoln. Here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. He started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s gonna get rid of those Mexican rapists. He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to them about the ‘Poor Boys’, last time we were on stage here. He said, ‘I told him to stand down and stand ready’. Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn.\n\n[1:14:12] Welker: President Trump, I'm going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then have a follow up question.\n\n[1:14:16] Trump: He made a reference to Abraham Lincoln. Where did that come in? I mean--\n\n[1:14:19] Biden: You said you were Abraham Lincoln.\n\n[1:14:21] Trump: No, no. I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the Black community. I didn’t say ‘I'm Abraham Lincoln’. I said, ‘Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the Black community’. Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put--\n\n[1:14:42] Biden: Oh, God.\n\n[1:14:42] Trump: Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail. And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly. Just take a look at what’s happening out there.\n\n[1:14:50] Welker: All right, let me-- Let me ask Vice President Biden about-- Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context. Crime bill that you supported in the 80s and 90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they’re uncles whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So speak to those families, why should they vote for you?\n\n[1:15:20] Biden: One of the things that is said, in the '80s, we passed 100%, all 100 senators voted for it, a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since then, particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem. They should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done because they may-- the American people have now seen that in fact, it was a mistake to pass those laws where they do the drug. But they were not in the crime bill.\n\n[1:16:12] Trump: But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk no action with these politicians. Why didn't he get it? ‘That's what I'm gonna do when I become president’. You were vice president, along with Obama as your President, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done? Now, you're saying you're gonna get it done because you're all talk and no action, Joe.\n\n[1:16:34] Biden: We got a lot of it done. We released 38,000-- We got 38,000 prisoners left from--\n\n[1:16:39] Trump: You got nothing done\n\n[1:16:40] Biden: 38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison. We have-- there were over 1000 people who were given clemency. We-- in fact, we’re the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern of practice of the police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on, but we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running to win back that election and change his terrible policy.\n\n[1:1:08] Trump: I just ask-- I just ask one question: why didn't you do it in the eight years, a short time ago? Why didn't you do it? You just said, ‘I'm going to do that. I'm going to do this.’ You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison. Now you're saying you're going to get-- you're going to undo that. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years with Obama? You know why, Joe, because you're all talk and no action.\n\n[1:17:29] Welker: All right, Vice President Biden and then we're gonna move on to the next section.\n\n[1:17:34] Biden: We had a Republican Congress. That’s the answer.\n\n[1:17:37] Welker: OK.\n\n[1:17:39] Trump: Well, you gotta talk-- you gotta talk 'em into it, Joe. Sometimes you gotta talk ‘em into it.\n\n[1:17:43] Welker: All right, we’re gonna move on to our next section which is climate change-\n\n[1:17:44] Trump: Like I did with criminal justice reform. I had to talk Democrats into it.\n\nOn climate change\n\n[1:17:48] Welker: Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we gotta get on to climate change, please. You both have very different visions on climate change. President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector. Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs. For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time? Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.\n\n[1:18:15] Trump: So we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs. I do love the environment, but what I want the cleanest, crystal clear water, the cleanest air. We have the best, lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time. Not Joe. I haven't heard him use the term because I'm not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it. And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we've had in 35 years. Under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but what we can’t do-- Look at China, how filthy it is. Look at Russia. Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy. The Paris Accord, I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly. When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice. They were going to take away our businesses. I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord. It was so unfair. China doesn't kick in until 2030. Russia goes back to a low standard and we kicked in right away. It would-- It would have been-- It would have destroyed our businesses. So, you ready? We have done an incredible job environmentally. We have the cleanest air, the cleanest water and the best carbon emission standards that we've seen in many, many years.\n\n[1:19:50] Welker: Vice President, Biden--\n\n[1:19:51] Trump: And we haven't destroyed our industries.\n\n[1:19:52] Welker: Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted.\n\n[1:19:55] Biden: Climate change, climate warming, global warming is an existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it. And we're told by all the leading scientists in the world that we don't have much time. We're going to pass the point of no return within the next eight to 10 years. Four years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up-- to limit the-- limit of admissions will put us in a position where we're going to be in real trouble. Here's where we have a great opportunity, I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as labor, people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan. Because what it does, it will create millions of new, good-paying jobs. We're going to invest in, for example, 500,000-- 50,000, excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market in the future. In the meantime, China's doing that. We're going to be in a position where we're going to see to it that we're going to take 4 million existing billion, buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don't leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating a significant number of jobs. And by the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it's going to create millions of jobs and it's going to clean the environment. Our health and our jobs are at stake. That's what's happening. And we-- right now, by the way, Wall Street firm has indicated that my plan-- My plan will, in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his. This from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does, not on climate just on the economy.\n\n[1:21:47] Trump: President Trump, your response --\n\n[1:21:48] Trump: They came out and said very strongly, ‘$6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan’, that his plan is an economic disaster. If you look at what he wants to do, you know if you look at his plan, you know, you know who developed it? AOC+3. They know nothing about the climate. I mean, she's got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate. And they're all hopping through hoops for AOC+3. Look, they’re real play costs $100 trillion. If we had the best year in the history of our country for 100 years, we would not even come close to a number like that. When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows. As far as they're concerned, if you had no window it would be a lovely thing. This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen. And this wasn't done by smart people. This wasn't done by anybody. Frankly, I don't even know how it can be good politically. They want to spend $100 trillion. That's their real number. He's trying to say it was six. It’s $100 trillion. They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little tiny, small windows and many other things. And many other things--\n\n[1:22:47] Welker: All right-- Okay, let me have the vice president respond and we're running out of time and we have a lot more questions. So let's hear from the Vice President. I have a number of more questions.\n\n[1:23:11] Biden: I don't know where he comes from. I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers. $100 trillion? Give me a break. This plan was-- This plan has been endorsed by every major-- every major environmental group and every labor group. Labor. Because they know the future lies, the future lies in us being able to breath. And they know they're good jobs in getting us there. And by the way, the fastest growing industry in America are--is, is, is the electric--excuse me, solar energy and wind. He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills. It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45-50 bucks an hour. We can grow and we can be cleaner, if we go the route I’m proposing.\n\n[1:24:00] Welker: President Trump-- Please respond and then I have a follow up.\n\n[1:24:00] Trump: Excuse me. We are energy independent for the first time. We don't need all of these countries that we had a fight war over because we needed their energy. We are energy independent. I know more about wind than you do. It’s extremely expensive, kills all the birds, it’s very intermittent. It's got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China. And the fumes coming up-- If you're a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make-- make these massive windmills is more than anything that we're talking about with natural gas, which is very clean. One other thing--\n\n[1:24:36] Biden: Find me a scientist that says that.\n\n[1:24:38] Trump: Solar. I love solar, but solar doesn't quite have it yet. It's not powerful enough yet to-- to really run our big beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world--\n\n[1:24:47] Biden: False.\n\n[1:24:47] Trump: So, it's all a pipe dream, but you know what we'll do? We're gonna have the greatest economy in the world. But if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry. You want-- And what about fracking?\n\n[1:25:01] Welker: All right. Let me allow Vice President Biden to respond--\n\n[1:25:04] Biden: I have never said I oppose fracking.\n\n[1:25:06] Trump: You said it on tape.\n\n[1:25:08] Biden: I did? Show the tape. Put it on your website.\n\n[1:25:10] Trump: I’ll put it on.\n\n[1:25:11] Biden: Put it on the website. The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying.\n\n[1:25:15] Welker: Would you rule out banning fracking?\n\n[1:25:17] Biden: I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need-- We need other industries to transition to get to, ultimately, a complete zero emissions by 2025. What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking. Capture the emissions from gas. We can do that and we can do that by investing money into-- It's a transition to that.\n\n[1:25:44] Welker: I have one more question--\n\n[1:25:48] Trump: Excuse me. He was against fracking. He said it. I will show that to you tomorrow. ‘I am against fracking’, until he got the nomination, went to Pennsylvania than he said-- You know what, Pennsylvania? He'll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it.\n\n[1:26:00] Biden: Fracking on federal Land, I said. No fracking or oil on federal land--\n\n[1:26:05] Welker: Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section. President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants. In Texas there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick. Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities. Why should these families give you another four years in office?\n\n[1:26:26] Trump: The families that we're talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they've ever made. If you look at the kind of numbers that we produce for Hispanic, or Black, or Asian, it's nice times greater, the percentage gain than it was under-- in three years-- than it was under eight years of the two of them, to put it nicely. Nine times more. Now, somebody lives-- I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you're saying-- But they're making a tremendous amount of money. Economically, we saved it. And I saved it again a number of months ago when oil was crashing because of the pandemic. We saved it. We got-- Say what you want of that relationship, we got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back. We saved our oil industry and now it's very vibrant and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline. Remember that.\n\n[1:27:22] Welker: Vice President Biden, your response and then we're going to have a final question for both of you.\n\n[1:27:26] Biden: My response is that those people live on what they call ‘Fence Lines’. He doesn't understand this. They live near chemical plants that, in fact, pollute. Chemical plants, and oil plants and refineries that pollute. I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claremont, Delaware. And all the more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is anyplace, including in Houston at the time. When my mom would get the car when they're first frost to drive me to school, turned on the windshield wipers there’d be oil slick in the window. That's why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer. The fact is those frontline communities, it doesn't matter what you're paying them. It matters how you keep them safe. What do you do? And you impose restrictions on the pollution, that the pollutants coming out of those fenceline communities.\n\n[1:28:12] Welker: OK, I have one final question--\n\n[1:28:14] Trump: Would you close down the-- Would you close down the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:17] Biden: I would transition from the oil industry. Yes.\n\n[1:28:19] Trump: Oh, transition.\n\n[1:28:21] Biden: It is a big statement because I would stop--\n\n[1:28:22] Welker: Why would you do that?\n\n[1:28:24] Biden: Because the oil industry significantly — but here's the deal —\n\n[1:28:27] Trump: That’s a big statement.\n\n[1:28:31] Biden: Well, if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time. Over time. And I’d stop giving to the oil industry-- I’d stop giving them federal subsidies. You won't give federal subsidies to the gas and, excuse me, to solar and wind. Why are we giving it to the oil industry?\n\n[1:28:52] Trump: We actually do give it to solar and wind--\n\n[1:28:54] Welker: All right, we have one final question--\n\n[1:28:56] Trump: That’s the biggest statement. In terms of business. that's the biggest statement.\n\n[1:28:59] Welker: All right, we have one final question-- Mr. President--\n\n[1:29:00] Trump: Because basically what he’s saying is he’s going to destroy the oil industry. Will you remember that Texas? Will you remember that Pennsylvania? Oklahoma? Ohio?\n\n[1:29:07] Welker: Vice President Biden, let me give you ten seconds to respond and then I have to get to the final question. Vice President Biden?\n\n[1:29:12] Biden: He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward a net zero emissions. The first place to do that by the year 2025 is in energy production. By 2050, totally.\n\n[1:29:25] Welker: All right. One final question--\n\n[1:29:26] Trump: Is he gonna get China to do it? Is he going to get China to do it?\n\n[1:29:27] Welker: No, we're finished with this. We have to move on to our final question.\n\n[1:29:30] Biden: No, I’m going to rejoin the Paris Accord and get China to abide by what they agreed to\n\n[1:29:33] Trump: But that’ll cost you $1 trillion.\n\nFinal question\n\n[1:29:34] Welker: This is about leadership, gentlemen, and this first question does go to you, President Trump.. Imagine this is your Inauguration Day.

Jurors found the Senate Majority PAC made false and defamatory statements against Moore in one ad that attempted to highlight the accusations against Moore. The verdict, returned by a jury after a brief trial in Anniston, Alabama, was a victory for Moore, who has lost other defamation lawsuits, including one against comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. “We’re very thankful to God for an opportunity to help restore my reputation, which was severely damaged by the 2017 election,” Moore said. Ben Stafford, an attorney representing Senate Majority PAC, said the group believed the ruling would be overturned on appeal. Moore, a former judge known for his hard-line stances opposing same-sex marriage and supporting the public display of Ten Commandments, lost the 2017 race after his campaign was rocked by misconduct allegations. Leigh Corfman told The Washington Post that Moore sexually touched her in 1979 when she was 14, and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. Moore denied the accusation. Other women said Moore dated them or asked them out when they were older teens.\n\nAlaska\n\nKetchikan: A cruise line, a floatplane operator and a pilot’s estate are all facing a lawsuit from the families of four people who died in a crash last year. The cruise passengers were on a floatplane tour when it crashed about 12 miles from Ketchikan, and the families claim in the suit that Holland America has a history of pressuring floatplane operators into unsafe operations, without warning passengers of associated risks, Alaska Public Media reports.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A ceremony at the Wesley Bolin Plaza on Sunday marked 80 years since the first Navajo Code Talkers joined the Marines, transmitting messages using a code based on their then-unwritten native language to confound Japanese military cryptologists during World War II. “It was the hardest thing to learn,” said Thomas H. Begay, 98, one of the last living members of the group. “But we were able to develop a code that couldn’t be broken by the enemy of the United States of America.” Hundreds of Navajos were recruited by the U.S. Marines to serve as Code Talkers during the war. Begay is one of just three who is still alive to talk about it. The Code Talkers participated in all assaults the Marines led in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, including Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Peleliu and Iwo Jima. They sent thousands of messages without error on Japanese troop movements, battlefield tactics and other communications crucial to the war’s ultimate outcome. President Ronald Reagan established Navajo Code Talkers Day in 1982, and the Aug. 14 holiday honors all the tribes associated with the war effort. It’s also an Arizona state holiday and Navajo Nation holiday on the vast reservation that occupies portions of northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State and local authorities are investigating after a series of weekend shootings left three people dead and three others injured in the Little Rock area. As many as 11 shootings happened Saturday and Sunday, and authorities are trying to determine whether they are connected, according to a joint press release from Arkansas State Police, the Little Rock Police Department and the Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office. One person was killed Saturday night, and two other shooting deaths happened Sunday, included one at a convenience store, authorities said. Gunfire was also reported Sunday afternoon along Interstate 630 and at a busy intersection in west Little Rock, though no injuries were reported, police said. So far, police have linked the west Little Rock intersection shooting and the convenience store killing, police said Monday. A 31-year-old man was detained Sunday in connection with those two shootings.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state should invest tens of billions of dollars in water recycling, storage and desalination over the next two decades to shore up its supply as California gets drier and hotter, Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a proposal released Thursday. It comes as drought continues to grip the U.S. West and as the state prepares to lose 10% of its water supply by 2040, according to projections by the Department of Water Resources. The Democratic governor discussed the proposal at the construction site of a plant to remove salts from river water that should be fresh – the type of project of which he said the state needs more in the coming years. Newsom’s proposed water recycling targets, which would make treated wastewater safe for drinking, would cost $27 billion by 2040, his proposal said. That was the biggest price tag associated with the plan, which also relies on billions in money already approved in past state budgets. The plan envisions that money coming from both state and federal sources. In total, he wants to boost annual water supply by nearly 3 million acre-feet each year; 1 acre-foot can supply about two households. The plan also calls to expand water storage, in above-ground reservoirs and underground aquifers, by about 4 million acre-feet – nearly enough water to fill Shasta Lake, the state’s largest reservoir.\n\nColorado\n\nWellington: Extra chairs and palpable tension filled the board room of the town’s community center last week as residents pushed for new restrictions on some books in the local library. The room quickly filled with roughly 40 people, many of whom were there to comment on a list of books some residents want banned from Wellington Public Library. Though a book ban wasn’t officially on the board’s agenda Tuesday, a list of public records requests from Wellington residents in recent months was made publicly available ahead of the meeting. Among those requests was an inquiry by Christine Gaiter – the wife of Trustee Jon Gaiter – asking when 14 book titles were purchased and made available for checkout. Some of the books on the list were popular titles like E.L. James’ “Fifty Shades of Grey,” Stephen Chbosky’s “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” and Toni Morrison’s “The Bluest Eye.” The request gained traction on a Facebook page where several residents speculated there would be an effort to ban books from the library. Their suspicions were confirmed at Tuesday’s meeting, where multiple people asked for several books to either be banned or made less accessible at the library.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: A federal judge has rejected the latest attempt by an ex-mayor to have his sentence on child-sex charges shortened. Former Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano, who has served 19 years of a 37-year sentence after being convicted of sexually abusing 9- and 11-year-old girls, had requested compassionate release, citing in part the threat to his health from the COVID-19 pandemic. Giordano, 59, who also said he suffers from chronic spinal pain, was convicted in 2003 of repeatedly abusing the daughter and niece of a girlfriend, including several times in his city hall office. He was charged after FBI agents overheard assaults taking place while conducting surveillance for a separate corruption investigation. In his request for early release, Giordano argued his health issues – combined with his cooperation in that federal corruption probe, his volunteer work in prison, and the harshness of his sentence – should lead to a new sentence of time served. U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill disagreed in a decision Friday, noting that Giordano “does not expressly address the conduct at issue in the underlying crimes in his litany of filings” and has never accepted full responsibility for his conduct.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Nearly a year after attorneys filed a lawsuit against Wilmington and the private towing companies with which it contracts, claiming the city’s towing practices are unconstitutional, a federal judge advised attorneys the case will move forward. “I don’t know when I’m going to get to this,” U.S. District Chief Judge Colm Connolly said last Tuesday, remarking on how busy the court is. “The case is going to go forward – I’ll tell you that. Some aspect of the case is going forward.” Last September, Wilmington residents Ameera Shaheed and Earl Dickerson filed a lawsuit saying the city is violating the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and 14th amendments. According to the suit, the city allows private companies to tow legally parked cars that have unpaid parking tickets totaling over $200. If the owners do not pay the outstanding debt within 30 days, the tow companies can scrap the vehicles and keep the proceeds. Attorneys from the Institute for Justice – a Virginia-based national law firm focused on limiting the size and scope of government power – representing Shaheed and Dickerson claim the city is violating the Takings Clause by allowing tow companies to sell or scrap a vehicle without the value being credited to the owners’ parking ticket debt, which, in turn, amounts to an excessive fine.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser is once again seeking National Guard assistance in helping aid migrants being bused to D.C. from Texas and Arizona, WUSA-TV reports. Earlier this month, the Pentagon rejected a request from Bowser for National Guard help in what the mayor has called a “growing humanitarian crisis” prompted by thousands of migrants being bused to the city from the two states. In July, Bowser formally asked for an open-ended deployment of 150 National Guard members per day as well as a “suitable federal location” for a mass housing and processing center, mentioning the D.C. Armory as a logical candidate. In a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Thursday, Bowser again requested Guard assistance to help “prevent a prolonged humanitarian crisis in our nation’s capital.” Austin originally declined to provide Guard personnel and the use of the D.C. Armory to assist with the reception of migrants into the city, according to U.S. defense officials. Bowser said the National Guard did not approve of the “open-ended nature” of the request. In the new request, Bowser sets an official timeline of aid requested. The letter says Guard assistance would be needed starting Aug. 22 and last for a period of 90 days, with a reevaluation of the mission on Dec. 1, 2022.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: The state’s primary energy provider is ready to launch a powerful new technology, just ahead of the busiest weeks of the Atlantic hurricane season: a fixed-wing drone designed fly into tropical storm-force winds and speed the restoration of electricity after severe weather. FPLAir One resembles a small plane and is remotely operated, enabling the utility to capture and deliver images and video of damaged electrical equipment in real time to its command center. It can fly up to 1,000 miles at a time – enough to cover the length of Florida twice in the immediate wake of the most damaging storms. It’s a vast improvement on bucket trucks and hand-held drones when it comes to learning what a storm did at the top of a power pole. “Rather than going out and try to figure out what’s going on, we’re able to save hours and days on getting the lights on,” Florida Power and Light Chairman and CEO Eric Silagy told the Associated Press. The drone can even be pre-deployed when a major storm hits, skirting around to its wake and following its path across the utility’s power grid. That data can then point ground crews exactly where they need to go, Silagy said. While satellites need sunny days to document damage, drones can fly under the cloud cover. And unlike handhelds, FPLAir One can fly in much rougher weather, remaining airborne for 22 hours without refueling.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPlains: Former first lady Rosalynn Carter has dedicated a sculpture of monarch butterflies in a garden named for her in her hometown – part of Carter’s continuing advocacy for butterflies and their habitat. Former President Jimmy Carter also attended the dedication ceremony Saturday. The statue, meant to honor Carter days before her 95th birthday Thursday, is in the Rosalynn Smith-Carter Childhood Garden, next to her childhood home. Plains resident Tim Buchannan told WRBL-TV that the sculpture by artist Peter Hazel aims to raise awareness of “what the monarch needs to survive because it was added to the endangered species list just recently.” The sculpture titled the “Monarch Tree” stands about 15 feet tall and 15 feet wide, with eight stumps and 18 butterflies. Organizers plan to add plants nearby to attract butterflies. It’s the flagship of the Rosalynn Carter Butterfly Trail, an effort to create and register public and private butterfly gardens around the world. More than 400 public and more than 1,000 private gardens have been registered so far, according to the trail’s website. That includes 21 in and around Plains, where the Carters still live.\n\nHawaii\n\nPahoa: A 16-year-old boy has died, and the search has ended for his missing 14-year-old brother, after they were swept away while swimming off a remote beach on the Big Island last week, according to police. Rescuers responded Thursday to a report of multiple swimmers in distress at Haena Beach, also known as Shipman Beach, in the Puna district. The brothers, their father and another adult were swept out by the current and high surf, police said. The two adults and the 16-year-old were rescued by a fire department helicopter. The older boy was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said. An autopsy was ordered. Rescue crews ended the search for the younger boy Sunday night, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is developing proposed aquatic life water quality standards for mercury pollution that could have statewide ramifications. The agency on Wednesday made public a proposed remedy resulting from a federal court’s 2021 ruling in a lawsuit by the Portland, Oregon-based Northwest Environmental Advocates and the Boise-based Idaho Conservation League. The court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2008 disapproval of Idaho’s mercury criteria created a mandatory duty for the EPA to develop criteria for the state that complies with the federal Clean Water Act. The agency is taking public comments through Sept. 9 on its plan to propose the mercury criteria within 18 months. After the proposal is finalized, the EPA within nine months will determine whether the Endangered Species Act applies to it. Idaho has runs of salmon and steelhead that are federally protected under the act. Several snail species plus bull trout and white sturgeon are also federally protected in the state. If the Endangered Species Act does apply, the EPA will begin consultation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s fisheries division and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Those agencies about eight years ago said Idaho’s allowable mercury standards were not stringent enough.\n\nIllinois\n\nGurnee: Three people were injured in a shooting outside a Chicago-area amusement park’s entrance that sent visitors scrambling for safety and prompted the park to close early, authorities said. Officers responded about 7:50 p.m. Sunday after 911 calls reporting shots fired at Six Flags Great America, about 45 miles north of Chicago, the Gurnee Police Department said. “The shooting … was not a random act, and appeared to be a targeted incident that occurred outside the park,” police said in a statement posted to Facebook. According to an initial investigation, police said a white sedan entered the parking lot and drove toward the park’s front entrance. People got out of the car and shot at another person in the parking lot before driving away, police said. Additional details about the suspects, including the number of people who fired shots, wasn’t immediately released. Police were investigating. A 17-year-old boy from Aurora, Illinois, had a thigh wound, and a 19-year-old woman from Appleton, Wisconsin, had a leg wound, police said. They were taken to a hospital, and their wounds were described as non-life-threatening. A third victim had a shoulder injury and declined to be taken to a hospital.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The 2022 IndyFringe Festival opens Thursday, with a lineup including a comedy called “QAnon the Musical.” Co-written starting early in the pandemic by Joe Cameron, a member of Indianapolis-based comedy boy-band Un5gettable, and Zach Harris, the musical started as a series of short songs posted to TikTok about the baseless conspiracy theory that claims there is a “deep state” apparatus working against ex-President Donald Trump. “It’s just a silly, irreverent take on kind of right-wing conspiracies that are, you know, flooding people’s everyday lives,” Cameron said. “I mean, it’s ruined some friendships and some families and/or at least put some serious strain on them, and my way of dealing with it was with humor.” The show’s cast and crew includes five people, three of whom are members of Un5gettable. Brendan Hawkins, also a part of both groups, said he knows everyone has their own views pertaining to QAnon, as it’s a difficult, sometimes confusing topic. Hawkins said he was a little hesitant about the material of the show and whether the group should actively pursue producing the musical, but once he began reading the script, he knew they had something special. Cameron and Hawkins said the show is meant to resemble an educational children’s program. The IndyFringe Festival runs through Sept. 4.\n\nIowa\n\nWinterset: A suspect in a Nebraska double homicide was arrested after barricading himself inside an Iowa church alone Sunday. West Des Moines Police Sgt. Jason Heintz said 27-year-old Gage Walter, of Omaha, ultimately surrendered and was arrested after several hours of negotiating with authorities from inside the church in Winterset. Heintz said Walter fled when police tried to pull him over in West Des Moines on Sunday morning and led officers on a chase for about 45 minutes before abandoning his vehicle and entering St. Paul Lutheran Church. Walter is a suspect in the deaths of Marceline Teeters, 93, and Linda Walter, 70, whose bodies were found Saturday inside an Omaha home. Police called their deaths suspicious but didn’t release details of how they died. Investigators were searching for a car stolen from the home where the bodies were found. Heintz said Walter faces charges of possession of a stolen vehicle and fleeing from police. He could also be charged with burglary for entering the church. Detectives from Omaha planned to visit Iowa to investigate, Heintz said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A statewide hand recount of this month’s decisive vote in favor of abortion rights had yet to begin Monday because the abortion opponents seeking it hadn’t shown they could cover the costs of an effort that wouldn’t change the outcome. The state’s elections director gave a western Kansas woman until 5 p.m. Monday to provide cash, a valid check or a credit card with a sufficient balance to cover the $229,000 in expected costs for the state’s 105 counties. The recount request came Friday from Melissa Leavitt, an election conspiracy promoter from Colby, but Mark Gietzen, a hard-right anti-abortion activist from Wichita, pledged to help pay for the recount. Voters on Aug. 2 overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to further restrict abortion or ban it. The “no” side prevailed by 18 percentage points, or 165,000 votes. There has been no evidence of significant problems with the election. Baseless election conspiracies have circulated widely in the U.S., particularly among supporters of ex-President Donald Trump, who has repeated false claims that he lost the 2020 election through fraud.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: New FEMA mobile disaster recovery centers opened Sunday to assist eastern Kentucky flood survivors. The new centers are at the Magoffin County Health Department in Salyersville and the Owsley Recreation Center in Booneville. The centers will be open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. They will reopen Aug. 21 from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. and Aug. 22-23 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fixed centers are also at the Breathitt Library in Jackson, the Clay County Community Center in Manchester, the Knott County Sport Plex in Leburn, the Letcher County Recreation Center in Whitesburg, Hazard Community College in Perry County, and the Dorton Community Center in Jenkins in Pike County. Survivors in Breathitt, Clay, Floyd, Knott, Leslie, Letcher, Magoffin, Martin, Owsley, Perry, Pike and Whitley counties can go to any center for help. They can also request assistance online at disasterassistance.gov, by calling 800-621-3362 or by using the FEMA mobile app.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBogalusa: The home that served as the base of operations for the Bogalusa Civil Rights Movement is now recognized with a marker along the Louisiana Civil Rights Trail. Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser and the Louisiana Office of Tourism on Thursday dedicated the seventh marker on the trail at the Robert “Bob” Hicks House in Bogalusa. “We are proud to tell the extraordinary story of Robert ‘Bob’ Hicks and the importance of his house,” Nungesser said. “It’s a privilege to honor Mr. Hicks, his family and all those from Bogalusa who strived to make rights real in Louisiana.” The house was a regular meeting place for the officers of the Bogalusa Civic and Voters League and the local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, Nungesser’s office said in a news release. “The house was a safe place for civil rights workers and served as an emergency triage station. The breakfast room became the communications center for the Bogalusa chapter of the Deacons of Defense and Justice, an armed self-defense group who protected civil rights workers from violence,” the news release said. Hicks founded the Deacons of Defense and Justice chapter in Bogalusa and later served as president of the BCVL. Hicks joined with civil rights activists A.Z. Young and Gayle Jenkins to help lead the Bogalusa-to Baton Rouge March in 1967.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A metal object believed to have fallen from a trans-Atlantic jet came crashing down outside the Maine State House, landing with a loud bang just feet from Capitol Police worker, officials said Monday. The Federal Aviation Administration was alerted Friday and returned to the State House on Monday as it investigated the incident, Capitol Police Chief Matthew Clancy said. The object hit with a loud bang on a slab of granite lining a cobblestone walkaway about 6 to 8 feet from a security screener – and came close to hitting the building itself, he said. “It definitely shocked him,” the chief said. “He was walking back to the building and got quite a wake-up call.” The FAA believes the metal sleeve weighing 6 to 7 pounds came from a wing flap of a large passenger jet, he said. Airlines were notified, and all planes landed safely that day, he said. The situation could’ve ended in tragedy. The area where the airplane part crashed to the ground is usually busy when the Legislature is in session, and it’s routinely used for rallies, protests and press conferences, he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state raised a record $1.5 billion from gambling revenue in the last fiscal year, the lottery announced Monday. The new all-time state record includes money raised by the lottery, the state’s six casinos, sports betting and fantasy sports wagering. The revenue for the last fiscal year beat the amount raised in the previous one by $120 million, the lottery said. Maryland’s fiscal runs from July 1 to June 30. The lottery and casinos both contributed more than ever before to the state. Lottery profits totaled $673.7 million. Casinos contributed $832.3 million. The lottery’s profits to the state in the last fiscal year beat the record set in the previous year by $6.3 million. Sales totaled almost $2.67 billion, an increase of $51.5 million, compared to the prior record set in fiscal year 2021. Scratch-off tickets have boosted the lottery’s growth in recent years. John Martin, the Maryland lottery and gaming director, said the lottery, which will be 50 years old next year, has developed a variety of games to play over the years. “We have a fairly equal product mix,” Martin said. “We’re not overly dependent on any one thing.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A break in a 20-inch water main early Monday sent water rushing down a city street, formed a sinkhole that swallowed a vehicle, and flooded area basements, city officials said. The burst pipe in the city’s South End was reported about 3:30 a.m., according to the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. The water main is about 150 years old but was updated in the 1970s, the commission said. The flood also buckled the roadway, which was closed to traffic. “It was a significant amount of water over a short period of time,” commission spokesperon Dolores Randolph said. Service to area buildings was not affected, and no one was hurt. The vehicle, seen in television video tilting into the sinkhole, was removed later in the morning. Sarah Donner heard the pre-dawn commotion outside and looked out to see her vehicle in the sinkhole. “I saw the hole, and I was like, ‘Wait, wait, wait. My car is over there,’ ” she told WCVB-TV. “It was just kind of a gradual pre-coffee awareness that my car was in a sinkhole.” The water was shut off, and construction crews responded to the area to fix the roadway.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A man charged with conspiring to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was ecstatic and exclaimed, “That’s it!” as he rode past her vacation home in 2020 and told an ally to make a video, according to trial evidence presented Monday. Jurors heard from Dan Chappel, who was known as “Big Dan” to Adam Fox and a band of anti-government extremists. He was a crucial informant armed with recording devices to help the FBI build its case two years ago. Fox and Barry Croft Jr. are on trial for the second time on conspiracy charges. A jury in federal court in Grand Rapids couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict in April but acquitted two other men. Chappel, an Army veteran who hauls mail, explained to jurors how he joined a paramilitary group, the Wolverine Watchmen, early in 2020 to maintain his gun skills and meet people who supported gun rights. He said he turned to the FBI when talk turned to killing police. Fox wasn’t a member of the Wolverine Watchmen, but the group became his ally that summer. Chappel participated in firearm drills, met privately with Fox in the basement of a Grand Rapids-area vacuum shop and made two trips with him to see Whitmer’s property in Elk Rapids. On a recording, Fox said they would pose as tourists on the first ride, “just checkin’ out pure Michigan, bro,” a reference to a state tourism slogan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two former police officers charged in George Floyd’s killing told a judge Monday that they have rejected plea deals that would have resulted in three-year sentences, setting the stage for trial in October. Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. They and Thomas Lane were working with Derek Chauvin when he pinned Floyd’s neck with his knee for more than nine minutes as the 46-year-old Black man said he couldn’t breathe and eventually grew still. The killing, captured on bystander video, sparked protests worldwide and a reckoning on racial injustice. Chauvin, who is white, was convicted of second-degree murder last year and sentenced to 221/ 2 years on the state charge. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill had set a limited window for accepting a plea deal ahead of trial, and Monday’s brief hearing served to formalize the two ex-officers’ rejections of the state’s offers. “It would be lying for me to accept any plea offer,” said Thou, who held back concerned bystanders as Chauvin pinned Floyd. Kueng did not give his reasons for rejecting the state’s offer.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The church where William Faulkner was married nearly a century ago has been heavily damaged in a fire. College Hill Presbyterian Church, northwest of Oxford, caught fire Saturday night and burned for more than three hours, the Oxford Eagle reports. The congregation was founded in 1835, and the church was built in 1844. Faulkner and his wife, Estelle, married there in 1929 – two decades before the novelist received the Nobel Prize in literature. The pulpit and most of church’s red-brick exterior and white columns survived the fire, but the original stained-glass windows and pews were destroyed. A firefighter retrieved a Bible from the pulpit. “So many pastors from the 1800s had written into that Bible and preached from that Bible,” said Casey Rodgers, a church elder. “There’s a lot of history that was lost, so we’re thankful that it was able to be saved.” Lafayette County County Fire Chief Wes Anderson said authorities are investigating what caused the fire. The church will continue to hold worship services in the fellowship hall next to the main building. The church’s nursery coordinator, Debra Patterson, said people will sometimes sit inside or outside the building, even when services are not happening. “The doors are never locked, so you can always just come in and pray,” she said. “It truly is a sanctuary.”\n\nMissouri\n\nBranson: Operators at the Promised Land Zoo say a staff member’s failure to properly lock an enclosure allowed a pair of olive baboons to escape. Although one of the animals was recovered, another was shot and killed after it bit an employee. The monkey, a longtime fixture at the park, was deemed dangerous by zoo officials and was shot and killed by the wildlife park’s owner, Jeff Sanders, according to Branson police. Laura Sanders-Remenar, the zoo’s director, said the June 22 shooting was a lawful and humane safety measure, but she knows others may think otherwise. “Unfortunately, we expect some blowback from animal rights activists who are anti-zoo, anti-faith-based business, animal ownership and anti-Branson,” Sanders-Remenar said in a wrien statement. According to a police report written by police Sgt. Stanley Kaufman, Sanders-Remenar was also wary of the optics in the immediate aftermath of the shooting on zoo property. “I only obtained one picture of the baboon as Mrs. Sanders got upset with me photographing it and was afraid we would release it to the media,” Kaufman wrote. “I explained to her that this report is available to the public if requested and I had to document the incident due to Mr. Sanders discharging a firearm within the city limits.”\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: John Engen, the city’s longest-serving mayor, died Monday of pancreatic cancer, city officials said. He was 57. After winning his fifth term in November 2021, Engen announced in March that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and had a tumor on his liver. His death was announced in a news release by city spokesperson Ginny Merriam. Gwen Jones, president of the City Council, has been appointed interim mayor until a new mayor can be chosen, Merriam said. Engen led with humor, strength and grace, Jones told the Missoulian. He was “an amazing mayor who brought this town forward and turned into a city,” Jones said. “The creative, beautiful Missoula that we all know and love.” One of Engen’s major accomplishments was using the city’s power of eminent domain to acquire the water company that served the city. The years­long legal case cost the city millions of dollars, but Engen and the City Council said the long-term benefits of owning the water utility would outweigh the purchase price and legal costs. Engen won his fifth term last year in a campaign focused on the city’s affordable housing and homelessness challenges, the Missoulian reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The City Council will hear from residents Tuesday on city charter changes and the 2023 budget, the Omaha World-Herald reports. A council meeting and an evening hearing on the budget are slated for the legislative chambers of the City-County Building.\n\nNevada\n\nGardnerville: Standing in front of 1,500 Republicans on Saturday for the 7th annual Basque Fry, gubernatorial candidate Joe Lombardo referenced the “elephant in the room” without naming him. The second-place finisher in the gubernatorial primary, Reno attorney Joey Gilbert, has baselessly claimed the mathematical counting was off and has continued to attack Lombardo. The GOP primary winner to this point hasn’t directly addressed Gilbert, who requested a statewide recount of the results and later filed a lawsuit that was thrown out last week. “No matter who you voted for, we’ve got to get past that,” Lombardo said. What has become a yearly tradition held in rural Douglas County, at a rural ranch backdropped by the Sierra Nevada mountains, includes live music, an inflatable rodeo ride and Basque cuisine. It’s modeled after Adam Laxalt’s grandfather and former Gov. Paul Laxalt’s cookouts. The elder Laxalt was the son of Basque immigrants, and Adam now hosts the event with the Morning in Nevada PAC. Several speakers, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Laxalt condemned the search of ex-President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home. Laxalt called it an example of “weaponizing the FBI” – a rally cry that many Republican lawmakers have made in the past week to tap into voter outrage.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: James Duggan, who expanded access to justice from the bench of the New Hampshire Supreme Court and as founder of the state’s appellate office for indigent defendants, has died. He was 79. Duggan died Saturday at his home in Amherst after a period of declining health, according to his family. He was nominated for a seat on the state Supreme Court in 2001 by then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen after a screening committee praised his “unusual combination of scholarliness and pragmatism” and ability to work “tirelessly, wisely and courageously for the people of New Hampshire.” When he retired in 2011, former state Chief Justice Linda Dalianis called him the court’s “intellectual anchor” and praised his efforts to expand access to justice for citizens of limited means. That work began decades earlier when Duggan was recruited by his friend Paul Semple, the state’s first full-time public defender, to open an office in Manchester. He began teaching at what was then Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord in 1977, helped expand the public defender’s office statewide and founded the Appellate Defender Office to represent those appealing their convictions to the state’s highest court. Shaheen, now a U.S. senator, said Monday that she was deeply saddened by Duggan’s death.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Teachers and day care workers who are not vaccinated for COVID-19 will no longer be required to get tested regularly for the virus under an executive order signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on Monday. Testing requirements for unvaccinated state contractors and state workers, including state police, will also come to an end, Murphy said in a statement. But covered workers in congregate care, health care and correctional facility settings will still be required to be up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations, including the first booster dose, Murphy said. The change applies to school districts and child care settings immediately and to state contractors as of Sept. 1. The move comes a year after Murphy mandated the testing program that, he said at the time, was key to stopping the virus from spreading rapidly as most students returned to school in-person for the first time in more than a year. The recent expansion of vaccines to toddlers is part of the reason for the change in policy, Murphy said in the statement. But children have some of the lowest vaccination rates in New Jersey. As of Monday, only 4.8% of those ages 6 months to 2 years had received at least one shot, while 9.2% of children 3 to 4 years had received a first dose, according to state Health Department data.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An investigation has determined that a tree falling in power lines started a fatal fire that also destroyed more than 200 homes in the Ruidoso area four months ago. A report issued by the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department says wind gusts of up to 80 mph toppled a 49-foot-tall, drought-stressed tree April 12, causing electrical lines to arc and ignite the fire, according to the Albuquerque Journal. The following day, authorities reported finding the remains of an elderly couple who died while trying to evacuate their burning home. The fire has spawned two lawsuits filed on behalf of dozens of Ruidoso property owners. The suit alleges that Public Service Company of New Mexico and a contractor caused the fire by failing to properly maintain trees and vegetation near its power lines. PNM has denied any fault or wrongdoing, saying the tree that struck the electrical lines was located outside the company’s right-of-way.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: As part of an effort to keep illegal drugs and other contraband out of state prisons, New York is taking away one of the few pleasures of life behind bars: It will no longer let people send inmates care packages from home. Under the new policy, which the state began phasing in last month, friends and family aren’t allowed to deliver packages in person during prison visits. They also won’t be allowed to mail boxes of goodies unless those come directly from third-party vendors. While the rule won’t stop prisoners from getting items that can be ordered online, like a Snickers bar or a bag of Doritos, they will lose access to foods like home-cooked meals or grandma’s cookies. That’s a letdown for people like Caroline Hansen, who for 10 years hand-delivered packages filled with fresh vegetables, fruits and meats to her husband, who is serving a life sentence. “When I first started bringing him packages, he said he loved avocados. He hadn’t had them in about 20 years,” said Hansen, a single mother of two who works as a waitress in Long Island. “What breaks my heart is, I take for granted having a banana with my yogurt. Imagine never being able to eat a banana?” New York had been one of the few states in the nation that still allowed families to send packages to inmates from home.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A $100,000 reward is being offered in the case of a sheriff’s deputy found fatally shot along a dark stretch of road last week. “Horrified” by a string of shootings that have injured and killed several deputies in the state in recent weeks, the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association announced the reward Monday for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for the killing of Wake County Sheriff’s Deputy Ned Byrd. The 48-year-old K-9 officer had been with the office for 13 years. Byrd joined the sheriff’s office as a detention officer in 2009 and was sworn in as a deputy in 2018, according to the sheriff’s office. Byrd was fatally shot late Thursday on a dark section of Battle Bridge Road, but it was not immediately clear why he stopped there, sheriff’s office spokesperson Eric Curry said last week. Byrd had responded to a domestic call less than a mile away earlier in the night, then entered his notes into the system, he said. There was no radio traffic to indicate he was making a traffic stop, but it appears something caught his attention along the road, since his vehicle was positioned as if to illuminate something, he said. When Byrd did not respond to several attempts to contact him, another deputy found Byrd shot outside his vehicle with his K-9 still inside the vehicle, Curry said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Supporters of legalizing recreational marijuana in the state have succeeded in bringing the matter to a public vote in November. The group, New Approach North Dakota, submitted more than the required 15,582 valid petition signatures to get a measure on the November general election ballot, Secretary of State Al Jaeger announced Monday. Supporters submitted 26,048 signatures, and 23,368 were deemed valid, he said. The organization’s campaign manager, David Owen, has said the extra signatures show broad support for legalization. The New Approach initiative would allow people 21 and older to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts of cannabis. Public consumption of marijuana would not be allowed under the proposed provision. The measure would also establish policies to regulate retail stores, cultivators and other types of marijuana businesses. A similar effort failed in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hampered the group’s effort at gathering signatures. Marijuana was a major topic in the Republican-controlled Legislature last year. State representatives brought bills to legalize and tax the drug, but the Senate killed the bills that were passed by the House.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: After narrowing down the choice to two finalists and holding a public vote, the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden has decided to name the newest member of the hippo bloat Fritz. Fritz is Bibi the hippo’s second calf and the younger brother to the world-famous Fiona. His name was narrowed down by the hippo care team to the choices Ferguson and Fritz and put to a public vote. Fritz was the winner, receiving 56% of the more than 220,000 votes cast. The initial callout to the public last week to help name Fritz received a huge response, with more than 90,000 suggestions from every U.S. state and more than 60 countries, according to the zoo. And the vote between Ferguson and Fritz was even bigger: 223,542 votes were received, with 125,183 in favor of Fritz. “We would have been happy with either name, but we really think the name Fritz fits this spunky little guy’s personality,” Wendy Rice, the zoo’s head hippo keeper, said in a release. “We also thought it was funny that it was suggested because Fritz is here due to Bibi’s birth control being ‘on the fritz.’ ” Zoo staff appeared on NBC’s “Today” show Monday morning to announce the name choice, after also revealing the sex and the final two name choices on the morning show last week.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: In a sworn statement sent to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, the first prison wife of death row inmate Richard Glossip wrote that she feels used and “did not get anything out of the relationship.” “Glossip, on the other hand, got exactly what he wanted, which was financing for himself while in prison,” Leigha Joy Jurasik said in the affidavit signed Wednesday. She revealed in the affidavit that she spent $7,000 on Glossip and another $1,000 on other death row inmates at his request. “He only thought of himself,” she wrote. “Glossip was controlling and manipulative and used me for financial gain.” Glossip, 59, is set to be executed Sept. 22 for the murder death of his boss, Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board meets Aug. 23 to decide whether to recommend Glossip for clemency. He claims he is innocent. That claim has received widespread support, most recently from conservative pro-death penalty legislators in Oklahoma. One outspoken supporter, state Rep. Kevin McDugle, R-Broken Arrow, has vowed to fight to abolish the death penalty in the state if Glossip is executed. Attorney General John O’Connor and his assistants included affidavits from Jurasik and another woman, along with graphic crime scene photos, in their packet to the parole board.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: New state regulations now allow recreational crabbers to catch triple the number of invasive green crabs from Oregon’s bays and inlets. The Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission increased the bag limit of European green crab from 10 to 35 per day. It’s part of a concerted effort to eradicate these invasive crustaceans, which are known to compete with native crabs for food. Green crabs themselves are fine to eat, and some recipes even call for them. They are much smaller than Dungeness or even red rock crabs, making them harder to clean. Mitch Vance is a Shellfish Project Leader with the Marine Resources Program at Oregon Fish and Wildlife. He wants people to know for certain it is a European green crab they are harvesting. “Key characteristics that really help in the identification – five spines on each side of the crab, and between the eyes there are three rounded bumps,” he told KLCC. “It also has a very fan-shaped shell.” Vance said green crabs cannot reproduce in cold temperatures, but since the ocean warming events of 2015, their numbers have dramatically increased. He reminded recreational fishers that green crabs aren’t always green when they come out of the water. And juvenile Dungeness and native shore crabs can look a lot like green crabs in the rocky intertidal.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The judge in a case brought by Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration against three counties that aren’t reporting mail-in ballots lacking handwritten dates on their return envelopes told lawyers Friday that she will rule as quickly as possible. Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer presided over an online conference in the litigation brought by the Department of State under Wolf, a Democrat, against three Republican-majority counties over about 800 mail-in ballots from the May primary. The counties argue the ballots shouldn’t be counted because of the legal requirement for the exterior envelope dates, which are not used to determine if voters are eligible or if the ballots are received in time. Wolf sued Berks, Fayette and Lancaster counties a month ago, seeking a court order to compel them to “certify” the mail-in votes in question. Cohn Jubelirer, an elected Republican jurist, said Friday she “will work very diligently” to issue an opinion. The dispute has stalled certifications of statewide results from the primary in the high-profile races for Pennsylvania governor and U.S. Senate, as well as results for congressional and state legislative contests involving the three counties.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza on Monday announced a six-month extension of the city’s guaranteed income program using $500,000 in American Rescue Plan Act dollars. The program, launched last year, offers $500 monthly payments to 110 randomly selected participants, all of whom were at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Those payments were set to end in October but will now be continued. Brandi Landry, a Providence resident who was homeless in the past but found an apartment using the income, called it “a blessing.” “It’s not just about the money,” she said. “It’s about what comes after that. Now I can kind of change my future around and make different decisions and go different directions.” The program’s extension means Landry can go “a little longer to get a little further,” she said. Elorza, reflecting on his own past growing up on Cranston Street, described his family as “very humble and incredibly poor,” though his parents together earned two incomes, and unlike other children in his neighborhood, Elorza had a father who was present in his life. “I was one of the fortunate ones,” the mayor said. “However, we know that being poor is not only difficult, but being poor is expensive.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBluffton: A woman was killed by an alligator Monday – the second such attack in the state this year, authorities said. The woman’s body was discovered at the edge of the water near a pond in a gated community in the town of Bluffton by a resident, who told deputies the reptile appeared to be guarding the body, The Island Packet quoted Beaufort County Sheriff’s Maj. Angela Viens as saying. Information about the size of the alligator and whether it would be euthanized or relocated was not immediately available. On June 24, the Horry County Police Department said an alligator dragged a man into a pond. Prior to those attacks, authorities said, the state had not recorded any in two years. In May 2020, a woman was attacked and killed by an alligator in the gated community where she’d gone to do a homeowner’s nails. A 90-year-old woman walked out of a Charleston nursing home in 2016 and was killed, while a 45-year-old woman walking her dog was fatally attacked on Hilton Head Island in August 2018. David Lucas, a spokesman for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, said then that the state had never recorded a person killed by an alligator before those attacks. Unprovoked attacks by alligators smaller than 5 feet long are rare, according to the National Wildlife Control Training Program.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Monday released a revised proposal for social studies standards in public schools that lays out a mostly shining vision of American history, after an initial draft of the standards came under heavy criticism last year from conservatives and Native American educators. The Republican governor claimed the new proposed standards are free from “political agendas” and include an increased focus on Native American history. But they received swift criticism from some educators as a thinly veiled political document. They emphasize the qualities of America’s founders and mimic language Noem has used as she jumped on the conservative cause of weeding certain “divisive” teachings on race from public schools. The 15-member standards workgroup, selected partially by the governor, included Noem’s chief of staff, two Republican lawmakers and the director of the South Dakota Catholic Conference but just three educators certified by the Department of Education. The group’s work was facilitated by William Morrisey, a former professor at Hillsdale College – a conservative institution in Michigan that has tried to remake education across the country.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A private prison company has agreed to settle a federal lawsuit over an inmate’s killing that got national attention after a judge ordered the plaintiff’s attorney to stop tweeting about it. Tennessee-based CoreCivic and attorney Daniel Horwitz, who represents the family of the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center inmate who died, noted the settlement Tuesday in a federal court filing in Nashville. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is G. Marie Newby, the mother of Terry Childress, who died in February 2021 after his cellmate assaulted him, court records show. The lawsuit, blaming low staffing levels, claimed correctional officers were not making timely rounds. It sought $10 million for Newby. CoreCivic spokesperson Matthew Davio said the settlement terms are confidential, and the company is “pleased to have reached a mutually agreeable resolution to this case.” Horwitz said he remains unable to comment due to last month’s gag order. A judge still needs to approve the settlement. The suit asked the judge to declare that CoreCivic failed to maintain a constitutionally required level of inmate safety at Trousdale. The facility, about 50 miles northeast of Nashville, houses about 2,500 inmates, the most of any Tennessee prison.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Firefighters in central Texas are gearing up for a run of several weeks that are expected to have the area’s greatest risk for widespread wildfires in a decade, with the peak of hurricane season in the next couple of months posing a major threat. Strong winds from Tropical Storm Lee, which made landfall along the coast of southern Louisiana over Labor Day weekend in 2011, amplified the most destructive wildfire in Texas history – the 34,000-acre Bastrop County Complex fire that burned for 55 days, destroyed 1,600 homes and killed two people. Randy Denzer, vice president of the Austin Firefighters Association, was one among hundreds of firefighters called to battle blazes in central Texas that 2011 weekend, including six in Travis County alone. The exceptional drought and low humidity, boosted by high winds from the tropical storm, created the ideal conditions for wildfires to ignite and spread rapidly. “This year looks like 2011 all over again,” Denzer said. The latest U.S Drought Monitor report released Thursday showed that drought conditions continue to intensify in Texas, with the two most severe levels of drought – extreme and exceptional – now covering 68.2% of the state. That’s the largest extent of extreme and exceptional drought since December 2011, when such conditions covered about 69.4% of the state.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Republican state lawmaker said Friday that he plans to introduce legislation that would require clergy to report child abuse to authorities, eliminating the clergy-penitent privilege in a state where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the predominant religion. Rep. Phil Lyman’s news release came a week after the Associated Press published an investigative story focusing on cases in Arizona and West Virginia that found the church’s abuse reporting system can be misused by church leaders to divert abuse accusations away from law enforcement and instead to church attorneys who may bury the problem, leaving victims in harm’s way. Lyman, a member of the faith who himself served six years as a bishop of a local congregation, said he had already been working for months on his legislation but called the AP story “powerful” and an example of the kinds of problems caused by delaying report of the abuse. He said he deeply values the repentance and confessional process. But he argued the clergy exception can delay intervention for victims and create uncertainty for clergy members. He would prefer to have clarity so clergy members could tell parishioners at the beginning of confessions that they are required to report abuse. The faith said in a statement issued one day after the AP story was published that the piece “seriously mischaracterized” the reporting systems and that a help line that local leaders are supposed to call to report abuse focuses on helping victims.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The federal government has awarded Burlington and Winooski $24.8 million to replace the 93-year old Winooski River Bridge. The cities, who are the joint owners of the bridge, applied for the highly competitive grant this year through the U.S. Department of Transportation with the help of the Vermont Agency of Transportation. Burlington, Winooski and the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission have been in discussions about the $31 million project for several years, and the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission published a scoping study about how best to replace the bridge in 2019 that greatly aided the grant application. If all goes as planned, and the cities are able to secure the remaining funding, they hope to start concept design in 2023, begin construction in 2027 and finish the bridge in 2030. Overdue for replacement, the bridge currently offers no bike lanes, four narrow vehicle lanes and crumbling sidewalks. The new bridge will feature widened lanes for cars and a mixed-use path for bikes and pedestrians on either side, protected by a wall.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state government failed to carry out numerous lessons from a 2018 snowstorm that caused highway gridlock, as exhibited by a similar event along Interstate 95 in January that left hundreds of motorists stranded, a state watchdog office concluded. The Office of the Inspector General report, released Friday, was critical of how the state transportation, police and emergency management agencies performed during the severe snowstorm that began Jan. 3, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. Logjams along a 40-mile stretch of I-95 in both directions not far from the nation’s capital led to outrage among motorists, some of whom were stuck in their vehicles overnight and pleaded on social media for help. In April, a state-commissioned report created by a nonprofit group didn’t place blame on any single person or agency. But it found state agencies collectively “lost situational awareness” and failed to keep up with growing gridlock through a confluence of heavy snowfall, abnormally high traffic and staffing shortages related to COVID-19. Up to 11 inches of snow fell in the area. Friday’s performance audit mentioned many of the same issues, but the I-95 mess could have been avoided if state officials had taken preventive measures recommended by Virginia DOT after a snowstorm in late 2018 blocked traffic on Interstate 81, in far southwest Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The same factors that produced a later and lighter cherry crop are affecting many Yakima Valley peach growers as well. Cold spring weather, a late April frost and their impact on pollination have delayed the peach harvesting season, usually at its peak by now, local growers and state agriculture officials say, according to the Yakima Herald-Republic. “Volume is down because of the cold conditions we saw this spring,” said James Michael, vice president of marketing for North America for the Washington State Fruit Commission. “Besides the severe cold and frost, we had a long, extended cool period that pushed everything back, including the peaches.” While there isn’t a formal Washington peach crop estimate, many of the state’s top peach areas were among the coldest points during the April freeze, Michael said. The consensus among growers is that there is about half a crop this season, he said. “We are getting into the peak of peaches now and will be transitioning through varieties until late September this year,” Michael said. “Traditionally, peach harvest begins in early July and lasts through mid-September, but the cool spring pushed most crops back by at least two weeks.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice scoffed Monday at a suggestion by Democratic lawmakers to let voters decide whether abortion should continue to be allowed in the state. The Republican governor said the state’s abortion law falls under the scrutiny of the Legislature and the attorney general. During a legislative special session initiated by Justice last month, majority Republicans failed to pass legislation criminalizing abortion. On Friday, top Democrats asked Justice and leading GOP lawmakers to bring the Legislature back to consider a resolution to allow voters to consider a constitutional amendment for “reproductive freedom.” Justice wanted no part of that. “Unfortunately, this place is surrounded with constant grandstanding,” he said at a news conference. Abortion had been banned after 20 weeks of pregnancy in West Virginia until the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. After that ruling, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said abortion was banned completely in the state because of an 1800s-era law that had been unenforceable while abortion was federally protected. But a Charleston judge barred the state from enforcing the ban, ruling it had been superseded by a slew of conflicting modern laws, including the 20-week ban. Morrisey has appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court, which is expected to take up the case this fall.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin System is launching a new tuition waiver at its 12 regional campuses. The program, dubbed the Wisconsin Tuition Promise, is modeled after the Bucky’s Tuition Promise program at UW-Madison. Beginning in fall 2023, Wisconsin residents who come from families making less than $62,000 a year will have any tuition and fees remaining after receiving financial aid waived. Undergraduates will be eligible for the waiver for eight semesters. Students seeking associate degrees and transfer students would be eligible for the waiver for four semesters. The discount works out to an average of $4,500 per student over four years. System officials plan to fund the program’s first year at $13.8 million and seek $24.5 million in additional state aid to cover the program in 2024-25. Students will be automatically considered for the Wisconsin Tuition Promise when they apply for federal financial aid.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A local man who taught hundreds of student pilots over a career spanning four decades will be added to the ranks of the Wyoming Aviation Hall of Fame, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. John B. Cooksey served in the Civil Air Patrol and helped people in rural areas through air drops of supplies during blizzards. He served in the Pacific theater during World War II and died in 1986, according to the newspaper. He’ll be inducted to the hall of fame Sept. 17 at the Newcastle Airport.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/05/26/ken-paxton-abortion-indiana-debt-ceiling-epa-covid/70259585007/", "title": "Texas AG Paxton, debt ceiling, Indiana abortion doctor, EPA ...", "text": "A Texas House committee has recommended to impeach embattled Attorney General Ken Paxton amid a series of allegations of abuse of office.

The charges were released Thursday night, hours after a Republican-led House investigative committee recommended impeaching the state’s top lawyer. The House could vote on the recommendation as soon as Friday. If it impeaches Paxton, he would be forced to leave office immediately.

During a disciplinary hearing, Dr. Caitlin Bernard said she followed state reporting requirements and hospital policy — which she has asserted repeatedly. But in a split decision, the board found that the doctor violated privacy laws in her handling of the patient’s information. While Bernard could have had her license revoked, the board found her fit to continue practicing medicine. Read more\n\nMore news to know now\n\nWhat's the weather today?

Unless a deal is reached Friday, negotiators are expected to continue to meet virtually over the Memorial Day weekend. House Republicans began departing the capital Thursday, but are on a 24-hour notice from McCarthy to reconvene at the Capitol if necessary. House Democrats tried to seize on Republicans' absence: With one side of the chamber empty, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries called the debt ceiling crisis \"manufactured, MAGA madness\" during remarks from the House floor.

In a new study funded by the National Institutes of Health, researchers identified symptoms that are the most distinctive to long COVID, including: fatigue, especially after exercise, brain fog and dizziness, among others. Researchers believe it's possible that long COVID has different causes in different people, or that some people are affected by a combination of factors.

There may be some differences between the audio and the text.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nGood morning. I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 19th of July 2023. Today, a closer look at severe summer heat. Plus, Trump could be indicted soon on charges related to efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, and an American soldier has been detained in North Korea.\n\n♦\n\nIt's not your imagination. This is not a typical summer. Heat records are being set around the world. And as USA TODAY National Correspondent Elizabeth Weise told me, this may be the new normal in the years to come. Thanks for hopping on, Beth.\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nHappy as always to be here.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo this summer heat has been particularly brutal in much of the Northern Hemisphere. What kinds of records have been broken this year so far?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nOh, it is so hot. It's just so hot. June was the hottest June in all of NOAA's climate records, which go back to the 20th century. They go back 174 years and it's the hottest June we've ever seen, and that probably means it's the hottest June it's been in a long time because only it's back as far as we've had records. Globally, it's 1.9 degrees above average. And that doesn't sound like a lot, but when you think globally, that means that a lot of places are super extra hot. It's also the 47th consecutive June and the 532nd consecutive month with temperatures over what they would've been in the 20th century. So anybody who was born in the 20th century, all of the averages that you were used to growing up, they're just gone.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo in the US, which specific regions or cities have gotten the worst of this heat?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nPhoenix is way hot. It is expected to hit probably 115 this week. It is the 19th consecutive day it's been over 110. Death Valley in California reached 128 on Sunday. That might go slightly higher later in the week. We don't know. In places that they're used to heat, these are temperatures that are just kind of knocking it out of the ballpark, and not in a good way.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo we've heard a lot in recent years about air quality, I feel like, increasingly so. What's the air quality like in US cities this summer?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nWell, so this summer it's been bad overall, and that's because of the Canadian wildfires. It was really bad a few weeks back. The Canadian wildfires have ramped up again in British Columbia, which is the province just over Washington state. And that smoke is starting to kind of drift across and more likely to start seeing poor air quality again, especially in the upper Midwestern states in the United States. And mind you, you got to remember that the California and Northwest fire seasons really haven't started yet. Canada is burning really early. We've always had forest fires on the West Coast. They won't start to hit hard until July, August, September. And so we don't even know what that's going to look like yet. I mean, maybe it'll be a low fire year and that would be a blessing.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd I want to just turn the page to Europe for a second where the heat has also been particularly rough. What's going on across the pond, Beth?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nYeah, poor Europe. So they had really, I mean for them, blazing hot temperatures. In May, especially in Spain and Portugal up above 100, which is very high for them. And then things cooled down a bit and that was good, but now they're getting another heat wave and it's impacting mostly Greece, Italy, and Spain. And the Italian weather forecasters, they've dubbed it Charon. And Charon, if you remember your Greek mythology, is the ferryman that would carry souls to the underworld. So they're starting to name their heat waves and this one is the one that carries you to the underworld.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBeth, I mean with these kinds of extreme temperatures, how are cities adapting to this heat?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nA lot of things are moving to the evenings when it's cooler. The good news is that the electric grid has managed to stay pretty stable. So we haven't seen widespread blackouts or brownouts, even though the demand is really high for air conditioning. In a lot of cities, especially Phoenix for example, we are seeing cooling stations for people who don't have access to air conditioners, or at least reliable air conditioners. This level of heat is dangerous. I mean, when you stay in 110 degree, 115 degree heat for any amount of time, your body starts to shut down. So people have to be careful. They have to stay hydrated, they have to stay out of the sun, and they have to find ways to cool off.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd globally, will this year be the warmest ever on record?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nThe current record for the warmest year was 2016 during the last El Niño, which is the cyclical weather pattern that tends to produce warmer, drier weather. And we've just shifted back into El Niño from La Niña and temperatures have risen globally since then. So it is very likely that 2023 will be the warmest on record. The terrifying thing about that is that although this may be the warmest year of your life, it's probably going to also be the coolest year of your life.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIs this the new normal going forward?\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nProbably for the foreseeable future, it's going to keep getting hotter until we lower CO2 concentrations, and then it's going to take a long time to go down. And as I always say to listeners, we have the technology to do that. We know how to do it. All we lack is the political will, but we could make the shift in a year or two if we chose to.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Elizabeth Weise, thanks as always.\n\nElizabeth Weise:\n\nYou're so welcome.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFormer President Donald Trump says he was informed Sunday that he's a target of a federal investigation into the events of January 6th, 2021. The investigation led by Special Counsel Jack Smith is looking into efforts to overturn Trump's loss in the 2020 election and whether the former president incited his supporters to storm the Capitol to stop the electoral college vote count. Trump said a letter from Smith gave him four days to report to the grand jury, which Trump believes will lead to an indictment and arrest. The two times Trump was indicted and arrested already earlier this year, he was the first to go public with the news of it on social media. Attorneys familiar with these types of cases said a target letter indicates charges are imminent.\n\nMeanwhile, in the classified documents case against Trump, US District Judge Aileen Cannon is considering his request to delay the trial. Defense attorneys are requesting time to gain security clearances to view the classified documents Trump is charged with keeping at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Judge Cannon said she'll issue a ruling shortly.\n\n♦\n\nIn Michigan, Attorney General Dana Nessel announced felony charges yesterday against a slate of so-called fake electors involved in an attempt to award the state's electoral college votes to Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Joe Biden won Michigan's 16 electoral votes by over 150,000 popular votes. But the 16 Republicans are charged with submitting full certificates, naming themselves as the state's legitimate electors. They're each charged with eight felony counts, including forgery and conspiracy to commit election forgery. The list of defendants includes the head of the Michigan chapter of the Republican National Committee and a former co-chair of the Michigan Republican Party. Multiple charges there carry up to 14 years in prison.\n\n♦\n\nIsrael's president, Isaac Herzog, will address US Congress today. His visit comes amid concerns over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's judicial overhaul and the ongoing protests there that have disrupted daily life. I spoke with USA TODAY World Affairs Correspondent Kim Hjelmgaard for the latest. Welcome back to 5 Things, Kim.\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo we know that legislative efforts have resumed on this overhaul to Israel's judicial system. Where do reforms stand this week, Kim?\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nWell, essentially, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, after pausing these reforms for a couple of months because of lots of protest, he decided to try to push through one particular law, which is related to what they call reasonableness. And essentially, this proposed law would grant lawmakers greater control over the appointment of judges and give the parliament the power to overturn high court decisions and basically make some of Israel's lawmakers impervious to judicial review. Netanyahu has brought one part of this legislation back and it's currently in its first reading in the Parliament there, which means that it's got to go through a few more readings before it technically becomes law.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Kim, protests appear to have again erupted in Israel alongside this. What's the latest there?\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nActually, for the last six months, the protests have not gone away. Israelis have done a remarkable job of going out day after day, week after week, month after month now to just express their dissatisfaction at these potential reforms. Before Prime Minister Netanyahu paused this legislation because the protests were getting so loud and problematic, we had things like the airports were about to get shut down, school teachers were going out on strike. Corporate CEOs were telling their employees not to show up for work. Israel's military, particularly its reserve forces, a lot of them were saying they were not going to show up for duty. But essentially, the protests have continued all the time. The Israeli public, by and large, has made it clear that they are not willing to just accept these proposed judicial reforms in the way that Netanyahu wants them.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd these reforms and protests come the same month as a renewed Israeli raid on the Jenin refugee camp. How does the situation in that camp reflect some of the broader tensions going on right now?\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nOver the last couple of years, there's been an uptick of terrorist attacks against Israelis by militant groups that are based in Palestinian areas. And Jenin is a refugee camp in the north of the West Bank. There's thousands of families that live there, but there's also militant groups that headquartered themselves there and hide weapons there. The Israeli government sort of watched these attacks take place over a number of months and basically decided that it needed to raid this camp because it was just the sort of center of where militant groups have been storing weapons and planning assaults and so on and so forth.\n\nThe issue here is that Israel is 75 years old as a country now, and it has long kind of described itself and thought of itself as the only democracy in the Middle East. And the way that it interacts with the given US administration revolves around this sort of idea of democracy and so on. But really, 20% of Israeli citizens are Arabs and they have some of the same rights, but they don't have all of the rights that Jewish Israelis have. Therefore, when these reforms were proposed, a lot of people were kind of pointing out well, there might be a public opinion saying these reforms are anti-democratic. But there's a lot of Arab Israelis who don't feel the full impact of Israel's democracy.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Kim, the situation in Israel has seeped over into American political discourse, especially this month. How important of a player is the US here, Kim, in terms of what these reforms and the next few months look like in Israel?\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nWell, I mean the US and Israel consider themselves to be extremely close strategic partners. There's no question about that. American historic support for Israel is strong, it always has been. Israel is the recipient of the largest amount of US military aid since its existence in 1948, cumulatively amounts to about $160 billion. And that money really has helped transform Israel. The two countries cooperate extremely closely on intelligence and technology research. The sort of trajectories of the two countries are intertwined. And part of the frustration, I think, from the White House perspective is that these reforms that Prime Minister Netanyahu seems hell-bent on pushing through, they don't quite sit well with the White House that is also keen to kind of promote ideas of democracy and so on and so forth.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKim Hjelmgaard, great insight for us as always. Thanks, Kim.\n\nKim Hjelmgaard:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAn American soldier has been detained in North Korea after he willfully crossed into the country's territory. The army identified the soldier as Private Travis King. He was stationed in South Korea and recently finished a 47-day jail sentence there for kicking a police car. The soldier was being processed to return to the United States, but left the airport before his scheduled flight on Monday. He would've flown to Fort Bliss, Texas where he faced possible discharge. But instead of boarding the plane, King joined a tour of a Korean border village. And once there, he bolted across the guarded border. An army spokesperson confirmed yesterday that a US service member willfully, and without authorization, crossed into North Korea. US authorities are working to resolve the incident. At a Pentagon Press conference yesterday, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed that King was likely now in North Korean custody.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

The bronze bust likenesses of Amelia Boynton Robinson, a civil rights pioneer, and Pattie Ruffner Jacobs, the state’s leading suffrage activist in the early twentieth century, were unveiled Monday. Gov. Kay Ivey said the trailblazers worked to bring about “real and lasting change both in Alabama and in the nation. The statues are located at one of the entrances to the state archives and are passed by visitors, researchers and hundreds of students on field trips each year. A longtime civil rights activist, Boynton Robinson is perhaps best known as a leader in the movement in Selma. She was among those beaten during the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma in March 1965 that became known as “Bloody Sunday.” State troopers tear-gased and clubbed marchers. A newspaper photo featuring an unconscious Boynton Robinson drew wide attention to the movement. When the Voting Rights Act was signed into law on Aug. 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson invited Robinson to attend the signing as a guest of honor. Ruffner was the founder of the Alabama Equal Suffrage Association and a board member for Susan B. Anthony’s National American Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A federal report aimed at improving aviation safety in Alaska recommended improvements in providing weather information to pilots and continued work to update maps with information on mountain passes, among other steps. The Federal Aviation Administration, which released the report Thursday, said it will establish a team to outline plans for implementing the proposals. Several of the recommendations are underway, the agency said. The report came after the National Transportation Safety Board in early 2020 called for a comprehensive review to improve aviation safety in Alaska, citing a fatal and non-fatal accident rates far higher than the national average. Board Chair Jennifer L. Homendy in a statement called the FAA report “a step forward in addressing Alaska’s unique place in aviation safety. But more needs to be done to ensure air transportation is as safe in Alaska as in the rest of the nation. We look forward to reviewing the recommendations.” Matt Atkinson, president of Alaska Air Carriers Association, said despite progress that has been made, “there’s roughly 100 communities, numerous tour routes, mountain pass routes that lack basic aviation weather reporting, adequate communications infrastructure and other aspects that are necessary for safe operations in Alaska,” Alaska’s News Source reported.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: An equipment failure caused a power outage at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on Monday morning, impacting a significant amount of flights. Shortly after 8 a.m., Arizona Public Service notified the airport about a partial power outage that affected systems in several terminals, according to Eric Everts, spokesperson for Sky Harbor. Power was restored to Terminal 3 at 9 a.m. Monday but power was still out in Terminal 4 and a nearby checkpoint was closed, he said. The power was fully restored to the airport about 1:45 p.m., according to Everts. “All systems are quickly returning to regular operation. Passengers should continue to check flight status with their airline before coming to Sky Harbor. Delays are likely into the evening,” Everts said. “Sky Harbor had more than 200 delays, more than 90 cancellations and more than 15 inbound flights diverted to other airports. American and Southwest, our two busiest airlines, were the most severely impacted,” Everts said.\n\nArkansas\n\nFlippin: A $4.2\n\nmillion expansion at a northern Arkansas boat manufacturing operation is expected to add 50 jobs, officials said. Vexus Boats said it would add 30% more square footage to its operation in Flippin, about 105 miles north of Little Rock near the Missouri border. The company makes fishing boats. “Arkansans take pride in our state’s stunning scenery and its access to outdoor recreation, and we are excited to have a company like Vexus that exemplifies our passions and values here in the Natural State,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. “These 50 additional jobs will go a long way in improving the quality of life for families in Flippin.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Two California couples gave birth to each others’ babies after a mix-up at a fertility clinic and spent months raising children that weren’t theirs before swapping the infants, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles. Daphna Cardinale said she and her husband, Alexander, had immediate suspicions that the girl she gave birth to in late 2019 wasn’t theirs because the child had a darker complexion than they do. They suppressed their doubts because they fell in love with the baby and trusted the in vitro fertilization process and their doctors, Daphna said. Learning months later that she had been pregnant with another couple’s baby, and that another woman had been carrying her child, caused enduring trauma, she said. The Cardinales’ complaint accuses the Los Angeles-based California Center for Reproductive Health and its owner, Dr. Eliran Mor, of medical malpractice, breach of contract, negligence and fraud. It demands a jury trial and seeks unspecified damages. Yvonne Telles, the office administrator for the center, declined to comment on Monday. Mor could not be reached for comment. The two other parents involved in the alleged mix-up wish to remain anonymous and plan a similar lawsuit in the coming days, according to attorney Adam Wolf, who represents all four parents.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Police tweeted just after 6 a.m. Monday that a mountain lion was sighted in the vicinity of Mathews Street and Tulane Drive in central Fort Collins. An officer spotted the mountain lion crossing a road in the area at 3 a.m., according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. It is unknown if the mountain lion remains in the area. Mathews and Tulane run parallel to each other a couple blocks east of College Avenue and near Drake Road. O’Dea Elementary School, located at Tulane Drive and Princeton Road, and Morning Glory Preschool at Christ United Methodist Church, between Mathews Street and Tulane Drive south of Drake Road, are located in the area where the mountain lion was seen. Poudre School District schools did not have class Monday because of a teacher work day. Police advised people in the area to keep watch for children and small pets. Anyone who sees the mountain lion is asked to contact the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Northeast Region office at (970) 472-4300.\n\nConnecticut\n\nAnsonia: Gov. Ned Lamont said he has filed the necessary paperwork to begin the process of possibly running for a second term in the 2022 election. “I’ve got to make up my mind formally in the months to come, but I figure, let’s be prepared. Let’s file the paperwork. Let’s get this thing going,” Lamont said following a news conference about improvements to the Waterbury Branch of the Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line. Although Lamont, 67, said he wasn’t ready to make a formal announcement, the Democrat sounded a lot like a candidate who will be on the 2022 ballot. “Look I love the job, I think we’re making a difference, I think the state is much better off today than it was four years ago,” Lamont said. His running mate, Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, said she also filed the necessary paperwork to form a candidate committee for reelection. Much of Lamont’s time as Connecticut’s 89th governor has been spent dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. The state’s first positive case was announced on March 8, 2020, a little more than a year after he had begun his first term on Jan. 9, 2019.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: David Mann, board president of the Rehoboth Beach Museum, said at a city workshop meeting that the board would be willing to mount the iconic Dolle’s Candyland sign on the side of the museum. The future of the sign sparked an emotionally charged debate over the last several months after Dolle’s Candyland owner Tom Ibach moved his business from its original spot to a smaller shop a few doors down. Visitors to Rehoboth Beach would see the sign on the façade of the museum building as they head east into the city on Rehoboth Avenue. The museum ruled out placing the sign on top of its roof, largely because of concerns about the weight of the sign and a desire to have the sign facing west toward incoming traffic, according to Mann. The proposed solution came after Ibach offered to donate the sign to the city in September. Mayor Stan Mills clarified that Ibach was willing to donate the sign either to the city or the Rehoboth Beach Museum, but not to any other organizations or businesses. Before accepting Ibach’s donation though, the city agreed to conduct a feasibility study to determine the logistics and cost of moving the sign.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: For the first time in 16 years, Smithsonian’s National Zoo is celebrating the birth of golden-headed lion tamarin twins, WUSA-TV reported. Small Mammal House keepers reported for duty Oct. 7 and observed that 4-year-old mother Lola had given birth overnight and was caring for two infants. These babies are the first offspring for Lola and her partner Coco. Zoo visitors can view the golden-headed lion tamarin family at the Small Mammal House. Animal care staff closely monitor the family visually but leave Lola and Coco to bond with and care for their infants without interference. Keepers have observed Lola carrying and nursing the babies, which appear to be healthy and strong as they hold on to Lola as she explores their habitat. Because Lola is cradling the infants close to her body, it might be some time before keepers can determine their sexes. Native to the southern part of the state of Bahia, Brazil, golden-headed lion tamarins live in the tall evergreen broadleaf tropical forests and semi-deciduous forests along the Atlantic coast, the zoo said. The greatest threat facing this species is deforestation; they spend the majority of their time from 10 to 33 feet in the forest canopy. Much of their habitat has been cleared for agricultural use, including cattle ranching and cocoa plantations. Conservation scientists estimated only 6,000 golden-headed lion tamarins are left in the wild.\n\nFlorida\n\nPompano Beach: A Brightline commuter train hit a car carrying a woman and her grandchild Monday on the higher-speed line’s first day back in operation since the coronavirus pandemic began. The 71-year-old woman suffered some broken bones and the child did not appear to be seriously injured, Pompano Beach Fire and Rescue spokeswoman Sandra King told news outlets. They were both taken to a hospital. Television stations showed images of the woman’s crushed car at the intersection in Pompano Beach, which is north of Fort Lauderdale. The woman had made a right turn was was trying to cross the train tracks when the crash happened, King said. The train was heading south from West Palm Beach to the Fort Lauderdale station with Brightline officials, including President Patrick Goddard. He was scheduled to appear at an event in Fort Lauderdale marking the train’s return. The train travels at speeds of up to 79 mph through some of Florida’s most densely populated cities. The private company, which began operations in 2017 between West Palm Beach and Miami, suspended service in March 2020 shortly after the pandemic began. During the shutdown, Brightline has continued laying track for its planned expansion from South Florida to Orlando and its theme parks. That route is set to open in late 2022 or early 2023. Brightline then plans to open a line between Orlando and Tampa and one between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.\n\nGeorgia\n\nRinggold: A north Georgia county on Tuesday will recount election votes after a local city council member requested the review because he lost his reelection bid by just three votes. The Chattanooga Times Free Press reported that veteran Ringgold City Council member Randall Franks faced off against incumbent council member Kelly Bomar and former council member Earl Henderson to fill two city council seats in last week’s election. Bomar took the lead with 285 votes, and Henderson beat Franks, 220-217, for the second spot, according to the newspaper. Catoosa County Elections Director Tonya Moore confirmed that a recount will be held Tuesday morning at Franks’ request. Georgia state law said a candidate can request a recount if the margin of the election outcome was decided by less than or equal to 0.5%. That request has to be made within two business days of the results being certified. Moore said the recount will be done by machine and said any other kind of recount, such as a hand recount, would require a court order.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A Big Island County Council resolution is asking state lawmakers to restrict the use of Hawaii location names on coffee packaging. The resolution, which passed unanimously last week, called for laws that would require coffee blends be at least 51% Hawaii-grown to use local geographic names such as Kona in their labeling, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Monday. Currently, distributors can use Hawaii names on coffee that has only 10% of beans grown in the named region. Hawaii coffee farmers testified at a meeting on Wednesday that the use of their regional names is limiting profits and damaging their brand. Ten percent “blends take millions of dollars each year from Hawaii family coffee farms, and that money is sent as excess profits to the owners of the … blenders on the mainland,” said Big Island coffee farmer Bruce Corker. “When consumers are misled into believing that ‘Kona’ blends are (genuine) Kona coffee, and they are disappointed by the taste of those blends, our heritage coffees … are permanently damaged,” Corker said. Hundreds of Kona coffee farmers filed a class action lawsuit against major coffee sellers in 2019 for falsely advertising coffee blends. Some of those companies have offered preliminary settlements totaling more than $13\n\nmillion, the Tribune-Herald reported.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A first-term Republican representative is the only elected official from the Legislature in a reconfigured district in southwestern Idaho, and has announced he will run for a now-open Senate seat. Rep. Ben Adams of Nampa made the announcement on social media on Sunday. Adams is in District 13 but the legislative map approved last week by the six-person, bipartisan Idaho Commission for Reapportionment puts him in District 12 for the next election. Adams is among the more conservative lawmakers in the House, and if elected to the Senate would likely tilt the chamber to the right. The District 12 Senate seat is held by Republican Sen. Todd Lakey, who is in his fifth term. Lakey, who has been active in getting legislation through the Senate on everything from gun rights to a law shielding Idaho businesses, schools and government entities from lawsuits if someone catches COVID-19, didn’t immediately return a call from the Associated Press on Monday.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Federal agents have seized 220 pounds of cocaine in Chicago. Three people were arrested, and a private plane was seized as part of last Wednesday’s operation, the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Northern District of Illinois said Monday in a release. The cocaine was part of a suspected Mexico-to-Chicago drug pipeline. About 176 pounds were found in a vehicle in the city’s River North neighborhood, and another 44 pounds were taken from a hotel room along Chicago’s Gold Coast, according to criminal complaints filed in federal court. The drugs allegedly had been flown into an airport in Gary, Indiana, earlier Wednesday from Houston. The flight originated southwest of Mexico City in Toluca, Mexico. A 30-year-old man from Toluca and a 25-year-old man from Columbus, Indiana, were arrested Wednesday in downtown Chicago. A 39-year-old Indianapolis man was arrested Thursday. A warrant was obtained Monday to seize the plane, a Bombardier Challenger 600 business jet.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Initial testing has shown the presence of lead in debris samples collected following the controlled burn of a house during a firefighter training exercise in southern Indiana. The controlled burn was Friday in Bloomington and area residents noticed and collected what appeared to be pieces of paint debris during and after the burn, the city said Monday in a release. Bloomington fire crews have been going door-to-door surveying residents about the debris. The fire department was coordinating with the state’s Department of Environmental Management to implement remediation recommendations and was working to identify and contract a company to clean up the area. Owners of the house had secured a demolition permit and donated the structure for the firefighter training. It was reviewed and approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, according to the city. All utilities were disconnected and potentially toxic contents and components of the house, including furniture, carpeting, asphalt roofing shingles, roofing underlayment, and vinyl siding, were removed prior to the controlled burn, the city said. Children and pets should be kept away from the paint debris, according to local health officials.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: A Kansas woman was arrested on felony changes Sunday for allegedly driving over and ramming her former landlord’s downtown Sioux City property with a van. Valerie Marrero, 25, of Liberal, Kansas, is charged with two counts of second-degree criminal mischief, a class D felony, and eluding, a serious misdemeanor. She was held at Woodbury County jail on $7,500 bond. According to a criminal complaint filed in Woodbury County District Court, Marrero was upset with a landlord for not taking care of a property in the 800 block of Nebraska Street, where she had been staying. At 11:19 p.m., Marrero intentionally drove a white 1994 Ford Econoline van through yards in the area and struck fencing belonging to the landlord. Officers located the van traveling westbound in the 500 block of Ninth Street, where the landlord also owns property. Marrero drove over the north curb and struck a dumpster, backed up and drove north through a private drive. She struck a chain-link fence, running it over, and, then, struck a chain-link gate that blocks off the parking lot, according to the complaint. The damage is estimated at $5,000.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Shawnee County has 59 bridges in need of repair or corrective action, according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. None is designated unsafe. “If we had any bridges that were unsafe, the road would be closed,” Shawnee County Public Works director Curt Niehaus said. Bridges are flagged for needing to be repaired for two primary reasons: It is either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. A bridge is considered structurally deficient when it isn’t recommended to carry federal legal loads like box trucks, school buses, dump trucks and tractor trailers. “It does not mean that it (the bridge) is at risk of collapse or failure,” Niehaus said. “It’s not unsafe. It just means it’s not ideally suited to carry legal loads every day. Most of our bridges don’t carry loads that heavy every day.” Bridges are determined to be functionally obsolete by being too narrow along with having a high traffic count, and as a city’s population grows, more vehicles drive over the bridge each day than for which it was designed.\n\nKentucky\n\nRussell: A new bridge in northeastern Kentucky is expected to open this month, replacing a 1930s-era viaduct and easing congestion at the approach to an Ohio River bridge, the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet said. The new Kentucky 244 and “flyover” design bridge into downtown Russell are scheduled to be fully opened the week of Nov. 15. Gov. Andy Beshear ceremonially cut the ribbon last week. The project caps a $110\n\nmillion Ohio-Kentucky investment that began in 2012 when ground was broken on the $80\n\nmillion Ironton, Ohio-Russell bridge. That bridge opened five years ago\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Management of the nearly century-old Louisiana Old Governor’s Mansion in downtown Baton Rouge has been transferred to Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin’s office. The governor’s Division of Administration has entered into an agreement shifting control of the mansion to the secretary of state’s office, which already runs the Old State Capitol down the street, the State Archives and seven other museum facilities. “I am excited about the addition of the Old Governor’s Mansion, which complements and accentuates the mission of the Old State Capitol, providing visitors and event-goers a tangible opportunity to experience our history first hand,” Ardoin said in a statement. The Division of Administration previously had contracted with the Foundation for Historical Louisiana Inc. to manage the Old Governor’s Mansion, which has been rented out for weddings and other large events. The Advocate reported the former home for Louisiana’s governors was built by former Gov. Huey P. Long as a copy of the White House. Using inmate labor, Long tore down and replaced in 1929 the traditional homestead that had existed for the state’s chief executive since 1887. Nine governors and their families lived at the site until 1962, when Gov. Jimmie Davis moved into the current Governor’s Mansion near the state Capitol.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: M.J. “Sunny” Eberhart, 83, of Alabama strode into the record books Sunday as the oldest hiker to complete the 2,193-mile Appalachian Trail. Eberhart, known by the trail name Nimblewill Nomad, acknowledged that despite having tens of thousands of miles under his belt, the trail was tough going at his age, leading to quite a few spills on slippery rocks. “I’ve a got a couple of skid marks on me, but I’m OK,” he said in a recent interview. “You’ve got to have an incredible resolve to do this.” He hiked the trail out of order, in sections, to take advantage of optimal weather, and had completed northern sections, including Maine’s Mount Katahdin. He completed his final section in western Massachusetts, in the town of Dalton, in the same year in which a 5-year-old became among the youngest to complete the feat. Joining Eberhart for the finish was the former record-holder, Dale “Greybeard” Sanders, who lives outside Memphis, Tennessee. He completed the hike at age 82 in 2017. Jordan Bowman, of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, confirmed that Eberhart is the oldest to finish the trail, surpassing Sanders.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Baltimore County officials said hey expect their only active landfill will become inoperable within the decade – sooner than previously estimated – and the only way to expand the facility without wiping out scores of homes is to build upward. A work group has been meeting since last year to recommend changes to the county’s long-term solid waste strategy. Several options were laid out in the group’s September report, including a vertical expansion of the Eastern Sanitary Landfill in White Marsh. Expanding vertically could extend the life of the landfill by 11 to 48 years, but it comes with drawbacks. The work group recommends the county consider spending $750,000 in the coming years to study and plan the expansion, estimated to cost between $63\n\nmillion and $162\n\nmillion to build. Fourteen out of 17 work group members agreed the option should be a priority for the county. The site has grown “a couple of hundred feet in height” in the last four decades, said Stephen Simmons with the Virginia-based solid waste consulting firm Gershman, Brickner & Bratton. The work group did not recommend building a new landfill site elsewhere. The 375-acre landfill was built in the 1980s and includes two transfer stations and recycling drop-off. It has been penalized in the past been for long-standing water pollution and solid waste violations but is now up to code. When it was built, the expected life span of a landfill was around 30 years.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWinchendon: A veterans organization sold an original 1945 Norman Rockwell painting for $3.6 million at auction over the weekend in order to raise funds after years of dwindling revenue made worse by the pandemic. American Legion Post 193, located in Winchendon, acquired the painting through a donation in 1959 from a local priest’s art collection. Coral May Grout, a former Post president, said that after weighing whether to sell for nearly two decades, it was time, The Telegram & Gazette reported. “Home for Thanksgiving” depicts a soldier seated beside his mother, who looks at him lovingly while he peels potatoes. It was commissioned for the November 24, 1945, issue of The Saturday Evening Post. The auction listing described the painting as “the tale of the first Thanksgiving after the Allies’ victory.” The artwork hung near the Legion’s main door for years, with most members assuming it was a reproduction. They got the painting appraised in the early 1980s after someone offered to buy it for $500, the newspaper said. The Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge has since kept it safe, occasionally displaying it in special exhibits.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The annual observance of the Edmund Fitzgerald shipwreck will be held in-person and livestreamed from Mariners’ Church in downtown Detroit. The Great Lakes Memorial service starts at 3 p.m. Sunday and remembers the lives lost in the roughly 6,000 shipwrecks on record in lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario. It will be broadcast over YouTube for people unable to attend. Last year was the first time the service was livestreamed, and it attracted more than 1,200 viewers, organizers said. One of the most notable and tragic wrecks occurred on Nov. 10, 1975 when the S.S. Edmund Fitzgerald sank during a storm on Lake Superior. The vessel was carrying a load of iron ore pellets to a Detroit steel mill when it plunged to the bottom, 17 miles from Whitefish Point in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. All 29 crewmen were lost. Singer and songwriter Gordon Lightfoot’s “Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” tells the tale of the sinking and the power of the massive inland lake.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State pollution officials on Monday released a proposed impaired waters list for 2022, an update that included the addition of 15 northeastern and central Minnesota water bodies where fish have been contaminated with long-lasting chemicals. The 15 were added because of contamination with a family of widely used chemicals known as PFAS, sometimes called “forever chemicals” because of their inability to break down. It’s the first time water bodies outside the Minneapolis-St. Paul area have made the list because of PFAS contamination. A PFAS compound known as perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS, can accumulate in fish and potentially cause adverse health effects in people who consume them. The waters include several bodies east of the Twin Cities metro area where the chemicals – used by Maplewood-based 3M to make products resistant to heat, oil, stains, grease and water – entered the area’s groundwater after decades of dumping into landfills. Three lakes downstream from an active cleanup site at the Duluth International Airport were also found to have high levels of PFOS, which has been used in firefighting foam.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg: WDAM reported a mural commissioned by the Hattiesburg Alliance for Public Art has been unveiled in the city’s downtown. The mural, titled “Spread Your Wings,” features a green-and-blue hummingbird beating its wings. The bird was painted by Avery Orendorf of Austin, Texas, and was painted on the side of a building that houses the Fairley’s Wings restaurant. The owner of the restaurant, Nick Fairley, said the mural was a great addition to the downtown. The television station reported the hummingbird mural is the 30th to go up in the city and is one of 45 stops on the city’s public art trail. Orendorf it took three days to paint the mural.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The city’s Board of Education voted to approve a continuation of the mask requirement by a unanimous vote. With child vaccines scheduled to start, the mandate might end in January.” Good news is coming,” said Superintendent Brian Yearwood, who added he hopes the district will receive guidance to remove masking requirements after elementary students have an opportunity to receive the vaccine. Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt is suing the school district over its mask mandate, though he didn’t succeed in making it a class-action lawsuit with a ruling applying to all Missouri school districts.\n\nMontana\n\nFort Harrison: A Montana soldier is the first woman to graduate from the U.S. Army’s sniper course, the Montana National Guard announced. “We are extremely proud of this soldier’s achievement and recognize that this is a milestone for not only Montana, but the entire National Guard and Army,” Maj. Gen. J. Peter Hronek, the adjutant general for Montana, said in a statement Monday. The military is not identifying her at this time. The soldier enlisted in the Montana Army National Guard in December 2020 and underwent a 22-week training course at Fort Benning in Georgia that combines Army basic training with advanced individual training in infantry skills. Her training staff recommended she be given the opportunity to attend the sniper course after she qualified as an expert shooter, Hronek said. She began the U.S. Army sniper course in September and graduated on Nov. 5. The course trains soldiers to deliver long-range precision fire and to collect battlefield information. Now that her sniper training is completed, she will rejoin her Montana National Guard unit.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Five teenagers were arrested early Monday after shots were fired from their car at police during a chase from Omaha, east into Iowa and back into Omaha. Omaha police said that five people arrested were a woman who turned 19 on Monday, an 18-year-old man, two 17-year-old boys and a 15-year-old boy. One of the juvenile offenders was treated for a minor injury and released. No officers were injured, police said. Police said they were called to an area in north Omaha just after midnight by a report of shots being fired. An officer driving an unmarked car saw a vehicle driving erratically and attempted to follow it when someone in the vehicle fired at the officer, police said. A chase ensued, police said, with the Omaha police’s air unit and other area law enforcement agencies involved.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The Carson Ranger District and the Carson Valley Trails Association are planning just over 8 miles of new, nonmotorized trails for the Jacks Valley area. The trails will connect the Jacks Valley North Trailhead to James Lee County Park in the Indian Hills community in south Carson City. The trails will also include an optional loop through the southern part of the Jacks Valley Wildlife Management Area. Construction is set to start this year and wrap up in 2022. Plans for an expansion to the trail system in the Jacks Valley area – part of the Clear Creek Trail system – has been in the works for more than a decade. The 15-mile-long Clear Creek Trail connects Jacks Valley Trailhead to the Spooner South Trailhead. Opened in 2014, it traverses through Forest Service and private land and Douglas County and Nature Conservation easements.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State officials warned residents about reports of scammers sending out a fraudulent letter that appears to be from the attorney general’s office and claims that the recipient’s identity has been used by someone to buy products online. The letter also claimed the attorney general’s office is investigating the “unsanctioned transaction” and warned the recipient that accounts linked with their Social Security number will be shut down unless the recipient buys gift cards and sends cash, the attorney general’s office said. Attorney General John Formella said in a statement that his office will never send correspondence to identity fraud victims, or any other crime victims, threatening to shut down the victim’s accounts or demanding gift card purchases. The matter is being investigated by the office’s Consumer Protection and Antitrust Bureau.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Republican Jack Ciattarelli’s campaign denied there was fraud in this year’s governor’s election but his campaign’s attorney said the margin could shrink enough to warrant a recount. The statement from Ciattarelli’s campaign came after the Associated Press declared Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy the winner last week. Murphy’s lead has grown from less than a percentage point last week to about 2.6 points by Monday, as votes continue to be counted. The difference amounts to more than 65,000 votes. “Let me be clear, no one on this team is alleging fraud or malfeasance, as we have not seen any credible evidence of that,” said Ciattarelli’s legal counsel Mark Sheridan in a statement. But Sheridan added that this year’s new election law, which in part allowed early in-person voting for the first time, is also contributing to what he called “excruciatingly slow vote counting.” The campaign estimated there are about 70,000 provisional ballots – which only count after officials determine that the voter has not already cast another ballot – left to count, along with an unknown number of mail-in ballots. Each of New Jersey’s 21 counties are conducting their own count of any mail-in and provisional ballots left to be counted. The state Board of Canvassers doesn’t meet until Dec. 2 to certify the results.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: New Mexico State University and Bosque Brewing Company collaborated again to produce another university licensed alcoholic beverage. The 1888 Hard Seltzer is available in Bosque locations across the state. NMSU previously collaborated with Bosque Brewing Company on the popular Pistol Pete’s 1888 Ale, which was released in 2017. The beer is available at more than 300 locations statewide and won a bronze medal at the 2018 Great American Beer Festival. Following the ale, Aggie Athletics has licensed its wine, liquor and coffee, earning $36,000 from selling the products in the past fiscal year. NMSU is now the second university in the nation to feature a collegiately licensed hard seltzer, according to a news release. The 1888 Hard Seltzer is a cranberry tea-flavored hard seltzer which compliments Bosque Brewing Company’s line of New Leaf hard seltzers, according to the release.\n\nNew York\n\nUpper Nyack: A leading art historian diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease was found dead by police in the woods of Nyack Beach State park on Monday after having gone missing on Nov. 3. Neighbors, residents and police had been searching for Richard Kendall, 75, after he went missing from his home in Nyack, the Journal News reported. Orangetown Captain James Brown said Kendall’s body was found about 4:30 p.m. Monday. He thanked everyone who participated in the search. A statewide Silver Alert had been issued for him. Police said they were investigating the death but did not consider it suspicious. Kendall was a specialist in the impressionist movement and an expert on French artist Edgar Degas, most famous for his paintings of ballet dancers. He published multiple books on the movement with Yale University Press, according to its website. He had served as curator-at-large at Clark Art Institute in Massachusetts, and had worked on exhibits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as well as the Tate Gallery and the National Gallery in England, the newspaper reported. Multiple other local, county and state agencies had participated in the search for Kendall.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKinston: Two juveniles are facing criminal charges after one tried to back a vehicle over a police officer and led others on a chase before they were captured. The Kinston Police Department said in a news release that officers checked out what was described as a suspicious vehicle early Monday. When the officers tried to find out why they were there, the driver tried to back over one of the officers, who was able to get out of the way and avoid injury, police said. Officers attempted to the stop the vehicle as it went through several parking lots and headed east on U.S. Highway 70, police said, After the chase reached speeds of 120 mph, the supervisor called it off. Deputies from Lenoir and Jones counties spotted the vehicle but couldn’t stop it. Craven County sheriff’s deputies located the vehicle and stopped it approximately 35 miles away in New Bern when the driver lost control, the news release said. The juveniles were returned to Kinston, and the police department said they face charges including assault with a deadly weapon, felony flee to elude and a number of motor vehicle violations.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A $500,000 federal grant will help farmers in North Dakota cope with stress brought on by drought conditions, reduced commodity prices and other difficulties. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture is providing the grant money for North Dakota’s effort through the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network. “Creating and expanding a network to assist farmers and ranchers in times of stress can increase behavioral health awareness, literacy, and positive outcomes for agricultural producers, workers and their families,” institute Director Carrie Castille said in a statement. The state Agriculture Department plans to partner with North Dakota State University and the North Dakota Department of Career and Technical Education on programs dealing with behavioral health counseling and referral for other forms of assistance, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The USDA is providing nearly $25\n\nmillion nationwide in 50 grants supporting network projects.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Ohio Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to decide whether Gov. Mike DeWine had the legal ability to end the state’s participation in a federal pandemic unemployment aid program ahead of a government deadline for stopping the payments. At issue before the court is a weekly $300 federal payment for Ohioans to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government ended that program Sept. 6, but DeWine stopped the payments June 26, saying the need for the payments had ended. DeWine, a Republican, followed the position of business groups that said the weekly payment was making it difficult to recruit employees. Critics of ending the payments said workers had multiple reasons why they might not be returning to jobs. A county judge rejected a lawsuit’s claimed DeWine didn’t have the authority to stop the payments, but the 10th Ohio District Court of Appeals reversed that ruling. Ending the program early stopped about $900\n\nmillion in Ohio payments. The two parties disagree on whether that money could still be paid, should the court rule against DeWine. The Ohio Supreme Court voted 4-2 to take the case, with Justice Patrick DeWine, the governor’s son, recusing himself to avoid the appearance of impropriety “that might result from my father’s public involvement in this case.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma County Commissioner Kevin Calvey said he is running for district attorney. Calvey, 55, is the fourth Republican to announce for the 2022 race to become the county’s top prosecutor. He vowed, if elected, to drop “bogus” criminal cases against police officers involved in fatal incidents. He directly criticized retiring DA David Prater . “Unlike our current DA leadership, I will support the police, not persecute them,” Calvey said. Calvey also addressed a pending first-degree manslaughter charge against five Oklahoma City police officers. The officers are charged in the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old robbery suspect last year. The suspect, Stavian Rodriguez, was shot about 7 p.m. Nov. 23 after he had dropped a gun outside Okie Gas Express in south Oklahoma City. An autopsy found he had been hit by gunfire 13 times, according to affidavits filed with the charge. “That case ... is a wrongful and malicious prosecution of police officers who defended each other and the public from a violent thug,” Calvey said. “My first day in office, I will dismiss those charges and other wrongful charges against law enforcement, and open an investigation as to how such bogus charges could have happened. The current DA’s hand-picked successor, Gayland Gieger, lacks the moral courage to stand up to his boss on this malicious prosecution of police officers.”\n\nOregon\n\nMonmouth: Three gravestones were placed near Bellamy Hall on Western Oregon University’s main campus over the weekend to memorialize the termination of three traditional majors – anthropology, geography and philosophy. This time last year, the university’s board of trustees approved an adjusted 2021 budget, which required an update on fall 2020 enrollment numbers. Several positions and programs at Western were to be reduced and eliminated to curb a growing concern for the institution’s financial stability. Western is the state’s oldest public university and serves nearly 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The university opened its new Salem campus in September. The institution’s original budget for this academic year, initially adopted at the board’s June 2020 meeting, was based on a projected enrollment decrease of 2.5%, officials said. But because of the COVID-19 pandemic and “many other factors,” officials reported enrollment was actually down by 7.9%, resulting in a decrease in revenue. School leaders decided cuts in spending, salaries and other expenses would be used to cover the deficit. The university planned to reduce or eliminate nearly three dozen full-time equivalent positions and programs, including the elimination of a major or minor in anthropology, a major in philosophy and the entire master’s in music and master’s in information technology programs.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMcCandless: When the monks of the Pittsburgh Buddhist Center needed a major restoration of its outdoor statue of the Buddha, they turned to an auto restoration shop specializing in classic cars. This partnership of ancient Asian spirituality and modern American craftsmanship came to fruition recently with the reinstallation of the newly refurbished, gleaming white statue at the center’s temple. Eyes closed and sitting in the lotus position, the Buddha underwent weeks of painstaking work at Exoticars in the town of McCandless, north of Pittsburgh. The statue sat amid an array of vintage vehicles from Bentleys and Corvettes to Porsches and a 1951 Ford pickup. Workers stripped multiple coats of deteriorating paint and primer – a task that required precision tools as they worked on the Buddha’s hair, depicted in detailed curls. They also repaired cracks in the fiberglass, added a metal strip to strengthen the statue’s base and put on a new coat of white auto body paint, giving it a glasslike sparkle in the sunshine. The repair job fascinated customers and also the classic car enthusiasts who bring old hot rods and sports cars of their own to Friday evening happy hours hosted by the shop, according to Exoticars co-owner Dave Ley.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island is getting a $10.6 million boost from the federal government to help the state’s tourism and hospitality industry recover from the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Daniel McKee said. The grant from the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration will be used to support projects, businesses and jobs in the travel, tourism, and outdoor recreation sectors, he said in a statement. “This sector has been severely impacted by the pandemic, and these funds will go a long way in ensuring this sector not only bounces back but is even stronger going forward,” McKee said. More than 26\n\nmillion people visited the state in 2019, pumping $7\n\nbillion into the economy and generating $843\n\nmillion in state and local tax revenue. That fell to 21.6\n\nmillion visitors in 2020, spending $4.9\n\nbillion and generating $597\n\nmillion in state and local taxes, according to the state’s tourism agency. The state’s grant proposal included boosting advertising and marketing to attract new overnight visitors, and development of new attractions and events to boost visitation.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: The city said a city-owned waste barrel had made a 3,500-mile trek across the Atlantic Ocean and washed up in County Mayo on Ireland’s northwestern coast. According to the city, Keith McGreal of Ireland wrote them and shared pictures of the bright blue barrel with city stickers on it. “I wanted to share some images of a Blue Trash barrel that has been washed up on our local beach on the West Coast of Ireland, Mulranny, County Mayo,” McGreal wrote, according to an exchange the city posted online. “We spotted the stickers and thought it would make a good news story.” The city posted the photos online, showing that the barrel’s Atlantic crossing took enough time for it to be encrusted with shells. City officials also wrote McGreal, saying the barrel must have been carried away in the Gulf Stream during a major wind or storm event.“We typically remove trash containers from the beach before a hurricane, but this one apparently had a mind of its own,” they said, adding that they “already had a city employee volunteer to come fetch it.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state House launched an investigation Tuesday into whether the state’s attorney general should be impeached for his conduct surrounding a car crash last year that killed a pedestrian. A sizable majority of the Republican-dominated House voted to have a committee prepare a report and recommend whether Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg should be impeached. It could take weeks for the committee of seven Republicans and two Democrats to delve into the crash investigation. The committee is a mix of Ravnsborg’s political allies and those who have called for his ouster. Ravnsborg, a Republican who was elected to his first term in 2018, pleaded no contest in August to two misdemeanors in the crash that killed 55-year-old Joseph Boever, who was walking along a rural stretch of highway when Ravnsborg struck him with his car. Ravnsborg has insisted that he did not realize he killed a man until he returned to the scene the next day and discovered his body. House lawmakers said they first wanted to know whether Ravnsborg could be impeached for his misdemeanor convictions, the fact that he killed a man, or that law enforcement associations have said they no longer have confidence in his office.The state constitution stipulates that officials such as the attorney general can be impeached for “corrupt conduct, malfeasance or misdemeanor in office.” But a state official has never been impeached in South Dakota. Gov. Kristi Noem, who has called for Ravnsborg to resign, has delivered a hard drive containing the crash investigation to Gosch, but he said the committee would subpoena the crash investigation from the Department of Public Safety “just to ensure accuracy.” Ravnsborg’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the House’s move.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A judge on Tuesday resentenced a death row inmate to life in prison for the second time in two years, after finding the man’s trial was marred by racism during jury selection. In his order, Judge Monte Watkins vacated the conviction of Abu-Ali Abdur’Rahman after finding his Constitutional right to a fair trial had been violated. Then the trial court judge accepted a plea agreement in which Abdur’Rahman pleaded guilty to charges of murder, attempted murder and armed robbery for which he received three consecutive life sentences, according to the court order. If the resentencing is not challenged, Abdur’Rahman will spend the rest of his life in prison but without the threat of execution. Abdur’Rahman was originally sentenced to die in 1987 for the murder of Patrick Daniels, who was stabbed to death. Norma Jean Norman was also stabbed but survived. The stabbing took place in Norman’s house while her two young daughters, Katrina and Shawanna, huddled in a back bedroom. The state Attorney General’s Office could still appeal Abdur’Rahman’s resentencing. That’s what happened in 2019, the first time Watkins threw out Abdur’Rahman’s death sentence. The 2019 resentencing came after Abdur’Rahman, who is Black, petitioned to reopen his case, presenting evidence that prosecutors at his trial treated Black potential jurors differently from white potential jurors.\n\nTexas\n\nEl Paso: Project Bravo is providing funding for people who are behind on natural gas and energy bills, but the deadline to apply is Friday. The funds are available through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a federally funded program that helps households pay a portion of their home energy costs, according to a Project Bravo news release. “The funding can pay more than just your natural gas bill, and it is not a loan, rather money dedicated for utility assistance,” said Elizabeth O’Hara, Texas Gas Service community relations manager. Texas Gas Service is promoting the program. The funds can be used to pay energy bills for up to 12 months, up to a maximum household benefit of $1,600.

Many speakers argued the lawmaker-drawn maps were aimed at further diluting the political voice of those who live in and around the state capital, a process known broadly as gerrymandering. Lawmakers, though, said their districts are aimed at reflecting the state as a whole by including urban and rural voters. Many people speaking at a legislative hearing, though, said putting Salt Lake County into four districts rather than the three it’s currently in would further drown out dissenting voices. Utah is overall a reliably Republican state, but its 4th Congressional district has flipped between Republicans and Democrats. The lawmaker-drawn maps are generally considered to make that district more reliably conservative.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: The explosives license for the owner of a Castleton quarry has been revoked after blasting this summer ejected rocks onto adjacent properties, risking public safety, the Vermont Department of Public Safety said. An investigation by the department, police and the State Fire Marshal’s Office, found that nearby residents were not given adequate advance notice about the July 16 blasting and no blasting mat was used, the department said. Public Safety Commissioner Michael Schirling sent a letter to the quarry owner on Oct. 29, revoking his explosives license. The quarry owner could pursue a future license if he undergoes agreed-upon training and an examination demonstrating his competency to safely handle and use explosives, Schirling wrote. The quarry owner has 15 days to appeal the decision, the department said. He could not be reached for comment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Days after Democrats conceded control of the Virginia House of Delegates to Republicans, they walked back that concession as two key races in which the GOP holds razor-thin leads appeared headed for recounts. As of Tuesday, vote counts showed Republicans with 50 seats and holding slight leads in two additional seats that have still not been called by the Associated Press. Democrats have 47 seats and are leading in one other district that has not been called. In both districts where Republicans are leading, the margins are below 0.5%, which allows candidates to request state-funded recounts. In District 91, Democrat incumbent Del. Martha Mugler conceded to Republican challenger A.C. Cordoza on Friday. Mugler’s concession was quickly followed by a statement from Democratic House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn, who acknowledged that with Mugler’s concession, the Republicans had control of the House, with 51 seats. But Mugler walked back her concession over the weekend after final absentee and provisional ballots were totaled and Cordoza’s lead shrunk to just 94 votes out of 27,388 counted. In House District 85, Republican challenger Karen Greenhalgh’s lead over Democratic incumbent Del. Alex Askew narrowed to just 127 votes out of 28,413 counted after final absentee and provisional ballots were totaled.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A metallurgist pleaded guilty to fraud Monday after she spent decades faking the results of strength tests on steel that was being used to make U.S. Navy submarines. Elaine Marie Thomas, 67, of Auburn, Washington, was the director of metallurgy at a foundry in Tacoma that supplied steel castings used by Navy contractors Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding to make submarine hulls. From 1985 through 2017, Thomas falsified the results of strength and toughness tests for at least 240 productions of steel – about half the steel the foundry produced for the Navy, according to her plea agreement, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Tacoma. The tests were intended to show that the steel would not fail in a collision or in certain “wartime scenarios,” the Justice Department said. There was no allegation that any submarine hulls failed, but authorities said the Navy had incurred increased costs and maintenance to ensure they remain seaworthy. The government did not disclose which subs were affected. Thomas faces up to 10 years in prison and a $1\n\nmillion fine when she is sentenced in February. However, the Justice Department said it would recommend a prison term at the low end of whatever the court determines is the standard sentencing range in her case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican Delegate Josh Higginbotham has resigned from his seat after moving to Kanawha County. Higginbotham, 25, submitted a resignation letter Friday to House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, saying he no longer lives in the district he was elected to represent, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported. He represented House District 13, which includes portions of Putnam, Mason and Jackson counties. First elected in 2016, Higginbotham said in September that he would run for a Senate seat. Under the district map adopted last month by the Legislature, his new residence would put him in Senate District 8. “From Day One, my goal has been to make West Virginia a place where young adults can find jobs that affords them a chance to stay in West Virginia and raise their families,” Higginbotham said in the letter. “While there is still more work to be done, I truly believe over the last six years West Virginia has made great progress toward that goal.” Gov. Jim Justice will appoint a delegate from a list of recommendations to fill the rest of Higginbotham’s term, which ends next year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nCamp Douglas: Col. Leslie Zyzda-Martin has been relieved of her duties as commander of Volk Field Air National Guard Base at Camp Douglas. The National Guard said in a statement that Brig. Gen. David W. May ended Zyzda-Martin’s command Monday because of “lost confidence in her ability to lead.” “This is a very difficult decision, but it is the right thing to do in the best interest of Volk Field,” May said. “The men and women that make up Volk Field are extraordinary at what they do. It is my obligation to ensure they have the type of leadership that will meet the unique needs and challenges of our state and federal missions.” The guard’s statement said the decision was made following investigations that revealed issues concerning command climate and alleged misconduct. Additional investigations are ongoing. The move is in sharp contrast to the welcoming speech May gave for the commander in September 2020 when he said Zyzda-Martin had “the passion, the drive, and the heart to get the job done with integrity and decisiveness. In other words, you’re the right officer for the right command at the right time.” Lt. Col. Tom Bauer, who serves as the vice commander at Volk Field, will act as interim commander until a new commander is selected. A phone number for Zyza-Martin was not immediately available.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Longtime Jackson resident Paul Bruun was among the latest inductees into the Fly Fishing Hall of Fame, joining a 2021 class that also features baseball Hall of Famer Ted Williams, Dave Brandt, a longtime fly-fishing instructor and Trout Unlimited leader, and William Taylor, a bamboo rod maker and legendary caster. Bruun is the only living inductee this year; the others will receive the honor posthumously. Bruun, 77, started the Snake River Fund, which works to protect and preserve the Snake River watershed in Wyoming. He also launched the Jackson Hole Daily, and has written outdoors columns for various Jackson newspapers for a half-century. He’s a lifetime member of Trout Unlimited and the Coastal Conservation Association. Bruun, who has guided anglers for more than 35 years, is also a master of gear. He has consulted Patagonia on its fly-fishing line dating to the 1980s. He co-created the South Fork Skiff, the first fiberglass, low-profile drift boat. The expertise became well-recognized within the fly-fishing industry, and Bruun went on to consult for rod manufacturers such as Sage, Winston, Orvis and Scott and for fly-line makers, including Rio and the Cortland Line Company.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2022/11/10/best-funny-christmas-jokes/8295727001/", "title": "160 funny Christmas jokes for the most pun-derful time of the year", "text": "It's officially the holiday season, with reminders of the most wonderful time of the year: Christmas lights, holiday greetings and carols heard from nearly every street.\n\nIt's also a time to celebrate with a little good old fashioned consumerism and pick out the perfect gifts for your mother, significant other or childhood friend.

The exhausted crew dragged ashore an hour later and hid in the jungle, fearful they would be captured by Japanese soldiers. The next night, an American PT boat retrieved all 10 men.\n\nAs Conter told it, the story wasn't about punching sharks, or skulking in the jungle or chasing shadows to the waiting rescue boat. Conter was talking about survival, about coming back alive.\n\nHis time in the war started that way.\n\nHe was 20 when he escaped the burning wreckage of the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor. He tried to save as many injured crewmen as he could, but when the sun set on Dec. 7, 1941, he was one of just 335 sailors who did not perish.\n\nConter fought on through World War II, scraped past a lot of close calls, then went to Korea. After that, he started teaching U.S. troops the skills of survival, evasion, resistance and escape. He wrote a training manual whose precepts the Navy still follows. Today, he tries to pass on what he knows to students of history.\n\nAt 93, he is one of the last survivors of the attack on the Arizona. He endured what he did, he says, because that was his job. And that's what he told every soldier and airman who took his courses.\n\nWhatever happens, find a way to survive.\n\nConter was stationed on the Arizona at Pearl Harbor in September 1941, when he turned 20. He and a buddy had been talking about their future in the Navy.\n\n\"Lou, let's go to flight school,\" Conter's buddy said one day.\n\n\"We won't get in,\" Conter said. \"We're right-arm rates.\" At the time, sailors wore patches designating their rates, the enlisted expression of rank, on the right or left sleeve, depending on their assignment. Aviators most often arose from left-arm rates.\n\nConter had made friends with a young lady in Honolulu. Her father was an engineer and a top executive for a dredging company with a big Navy contract. Conter was at the young lady's house one day when her father received an important visitor: Admiral William Calhoun, the commander of base force for the Pacific Fleet.\n\nCalhoun quizzed Conter about his posting, his job on the ship. Conter told the admiral he was interested in flight school, but doubted he would earn admission.\n\nCalhoun told Conter to put in for the assignment. A few weeks later, Conter and his buddy passed a flight test at sea and on Nov. 1, they got their orders: Report to Navy flight school in Pensacola, Fla.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Arizona's captain called the two sailors in and told them the ship was headed back to Long Beach in early December. They could ride to the mainland then and leave for Florida.\n\nTheir orders were lost on the Arizona when the battleship sank on Dec. 7. Conter and his buddy waited for new instructions, but heard nothing.\n\nIn early January, Conter visited his young lady friend again and again, Admiral Calhoun was there.\n\n\"I thought you'd be in flight school,\" he said.\n\nConter told him about the lost orders. Three days later, he and his buddy were on a ship to San Francisco and then a train to Pensacola.\n\nConter got his wings in November 1942. He was soon flying one of the Navy's Black Cats, a squadron of long-range patrol bombers painted black for night missions.\n\nThe Black Cats flew surveillance, search and rescue, sea patrol, but they proved especially valuable for nighttime assaults and nuisance raids on Japanese submarines and ships. The planes could fly at low altitudes, then buzz upward for a bombing run, confounding enemy gunners trying to calculate speed and distance.\n\nThe crews were based on tender ships moored in secluded harbors. Conter served on the San Pablo and Half Moon. The planes took off and landed on the water; the pilots tied up to buoys near the ship.\n\n\"We'd leave at 5:30 in the evening and stay out 12 or 14 hours, then return in the morning,\" Conter said. \"Sometimes, we'd come back, eat, then sleep on the beach.\"\n\nConter's crews flew missions across the South Pacific: New Guinea, Borneo, New Britain, the coast off Perth, Australia.\n\nThe crews learned the routines of the Japanese ships. The best time for a bombing raid was after 1 a.m., when the ship was quiet.\n\n\"We wouldn't get much fire back and by the time they sounded general quarters, we were on our way,\" Conter said. \"Sometimes they'd get shooting at you and you'd look at the shells and they looked like they were going to hit you. Then they'd go by.\"\n\nConter's plane hadn't been out long in September 1943 when enemy bullets pierced one of their rear hatches and hit a parachute flare. The flare exploded and started a fire, which forced the plane into the water.\n\n\"Say your prayers, men, we're seven miles off shore and we're in 10, 15-foot swells,\" one of the officers said as the crew abandoned the plane. \"I don't think we'll ever be able to swim to shore.\"\n\n\"Baloney,\" Conter replied. \"Knock it off. Just stay together, hold hands and kick slowly 'cause there'll be sharks around. If a shark comes too close, hit it in the nose with your fist as hard as you can.\"\n\nThe men helped one another, holding up anyone who weakened. Not long after, a second plane dropped a life raft and all 10 of the crew made to shore and, the next night, back to the base.\n\nIn late 1943, Conter flew a mission to rescue more than 200 coast watchers in New Guinea. Coast watchers were military intelligence operatives who gathered information about enemy activities on islands across the South Pacific.\n\nThe planes flew up the Sepik River from the northern coast of New Guinea. The river wound through dense vegetation, leaving 15 or 20 feet of clearance on each side of the plane. If a plane crashed, crocodiles awaited in the river.\n\n\"In three days, we rescued 219 coast watchers without losing anybody,\" Conter said. \"The Japanese were only a mile away. It was one of the biggest rescues in World War II, but no one knew about it because everything was top secret in those days.\"\n\nIn Korea, Conter flew 29 missions, but his work in Naval intelligence left him vulnerable if the North Koreans captured him, so he was shipped to Washington, D.C.\n\nHe was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in February 1954, the rank he held until he retired. His work turned toward survival training in a new military program called SERE, for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape.\n\nConter helped establish training bases in Florida and California and in 1965, he returned to Pearl Harbor to write training materials for troops headed to Vietnam.\n\nHe had stopped at Pearl Harbor more than a decade earlier, on his way to a posting in Korea. A platform marked the wreckage of the USS Arizona. Conter and others in his group boarded a boat to go out to the platform and see his old ship.\n\n\"We got halfway there and I told them to turn around,\" Conter said. \"I wasn't going out there. I couldn't.\"\n\nIn 1967, Conter retired from the Navy. More than 20 years earlier, he had earned his real estate license in California and had maintained it. He settled in Palm Springs and built a career as a real estate developer, buying up land for commercial and residential projects.\n\nThat same year, he met his wife, Valerie, in Palm Springs. Her sister knew Jack Warner, the film studio mogul, and invited Valerie to a movie premiere party Warner was hosting in Palm Springs for his latest project, \"Camelot\".\n\nConter attended the same event and was seated next to Valerie. They struck up a conversation and, after a brief courtship, married.\n\nToday, Lou and Valerie Conter live in a two-level house at the end of a winding road on a golf course in Grass Valley, a mountain town about 60 miles outside Sacramento.\n\nTall pines tower over the house. Deer and rabbits wander the hillside. Golfers play through 50 yards from Conter's driveway.\n\n\"I'm going to be back out there one of these days,\" Conter said, his voice wistful as he watches a foursome trying to stay on the greens. Conter's doctor has sidelined him for now for health reasons, but he is certain he will return soon.\n\nHe took up golf seriously in Palm Springs and played in the Bob Hope Classic six times, once on a team with crooner Johnny Mathis. He keeps a photo from that tournament on a bookshelf in an alcove off the kitchen.\n\nOn the same bookshelf sit mementos from his time on the Arizona. Medals. Photographs. A painting of the Arizona hangs on the wall of a sitting room. He keeps a folder of newspaper clippings, magazine stories and copies of a telegram.\n\n\"Here's the one that told my mother I was missing in action on the Arizona,\" he says. It is dated Dec. 21, 1941.\n\n\"The Navy Department deeply regrets to inform you that your son Louis Anthony Counter quartermaster third class US Navy is missing following action in the performance of his duty.\"\n\nThe telegram, which misspelled Conter's last name, promises further information and asks his family not to divulge Conter's posting.\n\nA second telegram, dated Jan. 6 reported that Conter was alive and would contact his family.\n\n\"I'd already sent word, even before the first one got there,\" he says. \"So they knew.\"\n\nThough Conter turned around the first time he ventured toward the sunken Arizona, he has been back since, to see it with other survivors.\n\nHe joined the USS Arizona Reunion Association and stays in touch with a few of the remaining survivors. One, Joe Langdell, lives about 40 miles away in Yuba City.\n\nHe keeps up with what the military does, and some of it irritates him. Discipline seems less important than it was in his day. Too many strategic decisions come down from Washington instead of from the commanders on the ground.\n\nAnd he has watched with dismay the changes in survival training. He once helped design programs that sent soldiers into the wilds for days or weeks at a time. Now, some courses require less than a week of field time.\n\n\"You can't get a guy hungry in three or four days,\" Conter says.\n\nBut there are moments when he knows what he did meant something. His old co-pilot in the New Guinea days was asked once if he'd had survival training for the war.\n\n\"He said, 'I had survival training in the ocean. We had survival training on the job. And my co-pilot, Lou Conter, saved my life.'\"\n\nConter stares at his hands.\n\n\"Some things,\" he says, \"you don't know about what they'll mean until years later.\"\n\nLAS VEGAS\n\nOnce a month or so, Clarendon Hetrick's phone rings with a call from Utah. On the other end of the line is an old shipmate from the USS Saratoga, the aircraft carrier where Hetrick worked as a mechanic through most of World War II.\n\nFor an hour or so, the two men talk. They catch up. They trade stories. Not war stories, usually, not unless one of them has had it out with a doctor or a pushy clerk. Just stories, the kind buddies tell each other.\n\n\"He's there anytime I call him,\" Hetrick says. \"He's there for me. I guess he'd do anything he could for me. He's more like family than just a friend.\"\n\nHetrick, who is 91, has outlived most of the men he knew on the Saratoga. He is one of nine living survivors from the attack on the USS Arizona, the battleship he boarded in 1941 when he was 17.\n\nHe will answer questions about that December day when he escaped the burning wreckage of the Arizona, reciting as many of the details as he can remember. The new shoes he left on the deck of the sinking ship, the ones he intended to retrieve later. The shock of jumping into a harbor knowing he couldn't swim.\n\nBut he kept most of it to himself until he started meeting up with other survivors, years after he retired from the military.\n\n\"I was always wanting to learn more when I was younger,\" says Hetrick's younger son, Robert, who lives not far from his dad in Las Vegas. \"But I had a brother in Vietnam who didn't want to talk about it at all, so I guess I realized if they want to talk, they'll talk. That was the way it was.\"\n\nHetrick shrugs, trying to get comfortable in the recliner. \"It just didn't appeal to me to bring it up,\" he says.\n\nFires still burned on the broken USS Arizona the morning after the Japanese ambush. Hetrick slept on the battleship USS Tennessee, which had been moored just ahead of the Arizona along Ford Island.\n\nThe Tennessee took hits in the attack, but two of the armor piercing bombs, the kind that sunk the Arizona, failed to detonate. Debris from the Arizona showered the Tennessee's stern and started fires, but the vessel stayed afloat.\n\nHetrick took a motor launch to the receiving station on shore, where he and other survivors were allowed to shower and given a change of clothes. The men followed orders in a fog of wonderment and confusion.\n\n\"We didn't hear much from the outside at first,\" Hetrick said. \"It hadn't really sunk in what had happened.\"\n\nThe Navy began assigning sailors to new postings. Hetrick was sent to the USS Lexington, an aircraft carrier. The ship remained anchored outside Pearl Harbor for most of a month as U.S. commanders planned their next move against the Japanese in the South Pacific.\n\nOne day, a Navy officer came on board and asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for an assignment in the aviation section. Hetrick thought about it. He liked the idea of working as an aircraft mechanic, so he volunteered.\n\n\"They gave me 30 minutes to get off the ship and catch a transport to San Diego for training,\" he said. \"It didn't take me that long. I had one pair of dungarees and that was it, that and a towel and shaving gear.\"\n\nThe Lexington sailed out of Pearl Harbor not long after. It never returned, crippled in the Battle of the Coral Sea and scuttled by the Navy to keep the enemy from salvaging her.\n\nAfter about six months of training in San Diego, Hetrick returned to Honolulu and joined the USS Saratoga, the sister ship of the Lexington. He worked on board as a mechanic for a torpedo squadron and ended up in charge of the hydraulic shop.\n\nThe Saratoga sailed across the South Pacific, to Guam, the Philippines, around New Guinea. Hetrick was on board during battles at Midway and Wake Island and for the U.S. invasion of Iwo Jima early in 1945. The Saratoga was attacked by six Japanese suicide bombers within about 24 hours.\n\n\"I put on two life jackets,\" Hetrick said. \"I told another kid if they come back again tonight, I'm leaving.\"\n\nHetrick earned a Purple Heart for wounds during one of the bombing raids.\n\nThe Saratoga had returned to Pearl Harbor by the time the Japanese surrendered. The Navy loaded 5,000 bunks on board, along with a row of portable latrines, and the Saratoga sailed to San Francisco, passing under the Golden Gate Bridge with toilet paper streamers and thousands of sailors who needed something to do.\n\nHetrick was still just 21 by then, but a seasoned sailor who shared little in common with the 17-year-old kid who left high school and joined the Navy on his parents' signature.\n\n\"I didn't have the slightest idea what would happen when I signed up,\" he said. \"I decided I'd do whatever they told me to. When they said, 'grab your sea bags and let's go,' I did.\"\n\nWhen he first arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hetrick wasn't even old enough to buy a beer until he found a place where they didn't ask questions if a guy was in a service uniform.\n\nNow, stateside again, Hetrick reported to a Navy station in San Diego, where he met the woman who would become his wife, Jeanne. As his stint was about to end, the Navy decided to transfer him back to Pearl Harbor. He asked if Jeanne could come with him.\n\n\"They said, 'If you re-enlist, we'll send her over.' I said, 'You send her over, I'll re-enlist.' I'd been told things like that before. They wouldn't send her over so I didn't re-enlist.\"\n\nBut Hetrick couldn't find work, so inside of six months, he signed up for the Navy Reserve. He was sent to the Los Alamitos Naval Air Station up the coast in Orange County.\n\nIn 1949, the newly created U.S. Air Force was trying to fill it out its ranks with experienced support crews, almost begging for mechanics who knew the aircraft. Hetrick saw a new opportunity and joined.\n\n\"On the day I swore into the Air Force, I was still in my Navy uniform,\" he said. \"Three months later, I was in Korea.\"\n\nHe worked his way up to crew chief on a squadron of B-26 bombers,\n\nAfter 18 months overseas, he returned to Langley Field in Virginia. (\"Two of us with the same rank were up for the same kind of job,\" he said. \"He wanted the east coast, I wanted the west coast. He got the west coast and I got the east coast. So you see how that works.\")\n\nFrom Virginia, he went to Utah, to France and then to Albuquerque, where he retired in November 1961.\n\nHe was on his own once again, he and his young family. They moved to Modesto, Calif., where he got a job driving a produce truck in the fruit orchards.\n\n\"They paid me by the day,\" he said. \"After 36 hours, I still hadn't put in a day. I asked the boss, 'how many hours is in a day for you?' He said, 'whatever I can get out of you.' I quit. I wasn't working for nothing.\"\n\nHe hired on with a farm labor contractor and within a year, he and a guy he worked with started their own business, contracting with the orchard owners to harvest crops. They covered the growing seasons: cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, grapes.\n\nThe venture was working out well. Until his partner ran off with all the money.\n\nHetrick recovered. He built a reputation as a guy who could bring in the harvest on time.\n\nAround 2005, he and Jeanne moved to Bullhead City. A few years after that, they left for Las Vegas, where their son, Bob, and his family help them get around.\n\nLas Vegas seems to like Hetrick. He was at a restaurant last summer and someone noticed his USS Arizona cap. He didn't have to pay for dinner.\n\nHetrick turns a rusted chunk of metal over in his hands, running his fingers along the curves and edges. It is a piece of rigging used to secure a mooring line from a ship.\n\nFrom the USS Arizona.\n\nHe first visited the Arizona memorial in Pearl Harbor on the 50th anniversary of the attack and has returned since.\n\n\"It gets your breath when you first see it,\" he says. \"It's hard to explain.\" He thinks back. \"You know, you can see where I came out of, the hatchway. There's a little air bubble. It's the same place where the oil is leaking\" — oil stores aboard the ship that, even today, still seep to the surface — \"that's where I got out from below.\"\n\nIn 2006, Hetrick returned to Pearl Harbor for the 65th anniversary of the Japanese attack. He had visited before, but this trip meant more. He brought all of his family: his wife Jeanne, his three sons and their families. And he was allowed to visit a part of the Arizona few people ever see.\n\nDuring construction of the memorial, the Navy sliced off pieces of the Arizona's wreckage to make room for the structure that sits above the sunken ship today. The pieces – the largest is about as long as a bus – sit in a salvage yard on the Waipi'o Peninsula on Oahu. The Navy occasionally cuts away small bits of the wreckage for memorials.\n\nFor Hetrick, the section of mooring line links him to those final moments of the Arizona. He will tell his story if he's asked and he will remember details along the way.\n\n\"I remember hearing explosions at first,\" he says. \"It sounded like someone shooting guns. You don't fire guns in port, so I ran out real quick to see what was happening. I saw one airplane, with a big red meatball on the side. Nobody could debate what that was, no question about it.\"\n\nHe remembers the crewman trying to climb a ladder to escape through a hatchway on the deck. The man told him later he had broken both his hips in one of the explosions and had survived only because Hetrick was there to urge him on.\n\nHetrick still likes to talk about the new shoes he bought the day before the attack in Honolulu. As he prepared to jump off the burning ship, he took the shoes off and set them on the quarterdeck.\n\n\"I left them there and hoped to get them back,\" he says. \"I ain't seen 'em since.\"\n\nHe remembers when the order was given to abandon ship. He jumped into the harbor, even though he had never passed his swimming test.\n\n\"When somebody says get out of here and you're on a hundred tons of ammunition, well, you don't question it,\" he says. \"If somebody in authority said do something back then, you didn't question it. I think that's what kept me living to this day.\"\n\nHe's not sure he'd have learned that lesson if he hadn't enlisted in the Navy. He says that decision was the best thing he could have done.\n\n\"I'd do it a hundred times more,\" he says.\n\nPROVO, Utah\n\nKen Potts eases around the side of the pool table, waving toward items like a museum tour guide in a back room.\n\n\"This shows where all the ships were,\" he says, pointing at a map depicting Pearl Harbor on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. \"There's the battleships … there's the Nevada, the Arizona, the Tennessee, the West Virginia, Maryland, the Oklahoma. The California was way down here.\"\n\nHe stops in front of a newspaper, the front page of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin with the headline: \"WAR! OAHU BOMBED BY JAPANESE PLANES\"\n\n\"That's one of the first extras that was put out that day,\" Potts says. \"I bought it at the receiving station in Pearl Harbor. It's in good shape for a paper.\"\n\nFarther down the paneled wall hangs a painting of the USS Arizona, the battleship Navy recruit Potts boarded in December 1939. By 1941, he worked the cranes on the ship, a job that entailed retrieving the Arizona's small seaplanes after they landed on the water.\n\nHe points out the cranes and the locations along the ship where he would tie up the motor boats he piloted to fetch supplies and ferry sailors to and from shore. He gazes at the picture.\n\n\"They were saying, when it first started, some of the ones whose station was up here – \"\n\nHe traces his finger up onto the main forward mast, to the crow's nest and the bridge. He clears his throat. \"They tried to jump off. Some of 'em made it, some of 'em landed on the deck. That was the end of it.\"\n\nA moment passes. He returns his attention to the cranes and the catapults that flung the seaplanes into flight.\n\n\"Once after we crossed the equator, one of the planes came back,\" he says. \"The sea was real rough when it came in and the sharks started gathering around. They called the Marines out with rifles to protect the plane and the guys while we hauled it in.\"\n\nPotts was returning to the Arizona with fresh produce when the first Japanese bombers dove into Pearl Harbor. He climbed aboard the ship, ducking to avoid bullets from the gunner planes. He helped rescue some of his shipmates. Seventy-three years later, he is one of just nine survivors of the attack on the Arizona.\n\nHe keeps the mementos from his experience – the maps, the photos, the clippings, the medals, the painting – in a room behind a door on the side wall of the living room in the house where he has lived for 54 years. He doesn't like to talk about the attack. Sometimes he can't control his emotions, so he declines speaking requests.\n\nBut he is proud of his service, of the other sailors on the Arizona. And there's a trophy in the corner the paneled room that means as much as anything else there.\n\nA few weeks after the war started, sometime in early 1942, Potts opened a letter from his mother. Why is the FBI checking up on you, she wanted to know. Someone from the bureau had been asking questions. He heard the same stories from his grandmother and his aunts.\n\nHe didn't know what to tell them. It scared him a little. Potts was working aboard an oil tanker, making short runs out of the harbor to refuel ships anchored off the coast. In the chaotic days following the Dec. 7 ambush, the Navy wasn't letting ships into the harbor, fearful the Japanese might send in more bombers.\n\nFinally, after a few weeks on the tanker, Potts was handed a new assignment. He would work in the port director's office, delivering sealed packets to the captains of Navy ships. Inside the packets were the captains' new orders, military secrets, classified information that required clearance to handle.\n\nThat's why the FBI was nosing around me, Potts thought.\n\n\"These captains of the ships, when they left the states, they had no idea where they were going, just that they're going via Pearl Harbor,\" Potts said.\n\nHe resumed one of his old jobs from the Arizona, piloting motor launches from the receiving station out to the Navy ships.\n\nPotts was based out of the port director's office – there were two, one at the harbor, one on the ninth floor of the Aloha Tower in downtown Honolulu – but he logged most of his hours at the controls of the motor boat, a Jeep or a station wagon.\n\n\"The station wagon was for the captains of some of the ships that would come in,\" he said. \"Not Navy ships, other ships. The Navy captain who lived on Waikiki Beach gave a lot of parties and invited these guys. I had to take them to the parties and sit there until it was over.\"\n\nThe parties sometimes dragged into the early morning hours.\n\n\"It was boring,\" Potts says. \"But it was a lot better than being shot at.\"\n\nHe tried to keep his thoughts on the work in the office. He tried not to remember the days after the attack. The day when they assigned him and a crew of divers to a motor launch and sent them to the Arizona to remove bodies of dead sailors.\n\n\"When they dropped that bomb that made our ammunition explode, it dang near broke the ship in two, so we couldn't go anywhere forward of that,\" he says. \"We took all the bodies we could find.\"\n\nWhen he reaches that part of his story, he stops. He can't relive those images anymore. He describes the store of booze they pulled out of safe and the money.\n\n\"One day our boat was stacked with two dollar bills,\" he said. \"They paid everybody in two dollar bills back then. We hauled it all back in.\"\n\nPotts stayed in Honolulu until the end of the war. He finally received his orders to return to the states. He would sail to San Francisco on one of the cruise ships refitted to move troops, the Lurline, or maybe the Matsonia.\n\nAs he was packing, a buddy warned him that his possessions would be searched at the port in San Francisco. If they found anything that belonged to the Navy or hadn't been approved, they'd take it.\n\nPotts picked up the Colt 45 he'd found on Ford Island on Dec. 7, 1941. The gun took away some of the terror he had felt from the moment he saw the first bomber, the panic he felt when he found the armories on board the ship locked. With a gun, he could defend himself. He had held on to it through the war.\n\nBut he didn't want to start his civilian life in the brig, so he left it in Honolulu.\n\n\"We got into San Francisco,\" he says, \"and they never even opened my bags. Never would've found it.\"\n\nHe bought another gun in the states and he is never far from it. A pistol sits on top of his television at home. He keeps it with him when he travels. And he keeps it loaded.\n\n\"It ain't worth a damn if it ain't loaded,\" he says.\n\nPotts returned to Illinois in late 1945 to await his formal discharge, hanging out in Chicago. He was still active, so would report to the Navy Pier each morning to check a list for the names of sailors who had been given duties for the day. His name never appeared and he would leave for the day.\n\n\"I came back to the pier one morning and my name was on the list to do KP work,\" he says. Kitchen patrol. Mess hall duty. Peeling potatoes.\n\n\"I went and found the head guy and by the time I got through explaining things to him,\" Potts says, \"my name was never on that list again.\"\n\nHis mother had moved to Decatur, Ill., by then, so he followed and took a job at a hardware store. He started chatting up a regular customer, a contractor, and got a job building houses.\n\n\"What houses they built!\" Potts says, shaking his head. \"That lumber was so damn green then, we used to kid we had to shoot the squirrels out of it.\"\n\nHe wasn't happy where he was, so he loaded up his big 12-cylinder Lincoln Zephyr and headed west. He stopped in the small town of Payson, Utah.\n\n\"They said what a wonderful place it was to live, with jobs and everything, so I bought a little place up in Spanish Fork,\" he says, \"I'm still looking for that easy money.\"\n\nWith his experience running cranes on the Arizona, Potts figures he could have landed a decent job at the Geneva Steel operation, but he didn't want to work shifts, so he worked as a carpenter again and eventually went into the used car business with a friend.\n\nHe moved to Provo and sold cars until 1990. He and his wife, Doris, have lived in the same house for 54 years.\n\nThe paneled room behind the door in the living room of the Provo house is filled with trophies of almost any imaginable sort. Two deer racks (his wife shot one, his son the other). Guns. Knives. A bow. An impressive collection of restaurant menus from 30 years of cross-country searches for used cars.\n\nAnd in the back corner, a real trophy. It sits a little higher than most items, but not necessarily on a platform. It fit in that location. And it holds deep meaning for Potts, even though he did nothing to win it.\n\nPotts had not returned to Honolulu in the decades since he left for San Francisco in 1945. He wasn't ready to see it all again, to sharpen the memories he'd tried to dull.\n\nIn 2006, one of his sons offered to take Potts to Hawaii for the 65th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. He stayed on the 17th floor of a hotel on Waikiki Beach. He visited the memorial and was relieved to see the builders got it right.\n\n\"It's one of the best actual memorials I've seen,\" he says. \"It's where the war started.\"\n\nFive years later, in 2011, he got a call from the band director at Timpview High School in Provo. The marching band had been invited to fly to Pearl Harbor and perform at activities commemorating the 70th anniversary of the attack.\n\nThe band members had decided they wanted to honor survivors from that day. Would Ken be willing to go as a guest of honor? The band would cover all expenses for him and Doris.\n\nPotts was touched. He could see the band was sincere. To prepare for the trip, they were studying World War II history, attending lectures, writing research papers. They offered to perform at a gathering of Utah survivors. How could he say no?\n\n\"Talk about treating you like royalty,\" he says. He was able to visit the national cemetery at an area called the Punch Bowl. He watched the band perform and stood as a survivor of the Arizona, one of the sailors who lived. He went out to the floating memorial.\n\n\"I got the lay a wreath in front of the names of the fallen,\" he says quietly.\n\nWhen he returned home, he got another call from the band director. The band had won a trophy in one of the competitions during their stay in Honolulu. They had voted. They were dedicating it to Potts and wanted him to have it.\n\nHe squeezes past the pool table, past the photos and the maps and the medals. Here is a story he will tell, a memory he will keep.\n\nThe trophy sits on a small white base that raises it above other items on a shelf. It is about three feet tall, with a carved island figure on top and the silhouette of a Hawaiian warrior on a plaque. The inscription reads \"Spirit of Aloha Award, Timpview High School Marching Band.\"\n\nHe touches the trophy.\n\n\"It's my pride and joy.\"\n\nLA MIRADA, Calif.\n\nFor 30 years, Lauren Bruner punched a clock at a manufacturing plant south of Los Angeles, a World War II veteran in a landscape crawling with them.\n\nNo one knew much about Bruner's years in the Navy, not the early years anyway. The easy stories he'd tell. The ones that gave him nightmares, the stories from the day he nearly burned to death, he kept to himself.\n\nYet in a place where you couldn't cross the street without running into a war vet, Bruner was not just another ex-sailor who made it home. Only 335 men survived the bombing of the USS Arizona, the mighty battleship whose loss at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, inspired a nation to go to war.\n\nBruner was one of them.\n\nBy 1991, the 50th anniversary of the attack, the number of living Arizona crewmen had shrunk. Survivors' groups wanted to find all of them so their stories would not be lost.\n\nA woman from Illinois drew Bruner's name. No one among the groups knew where he was or what he was doing, but the woman persisted. She tracked him to the Los Angeles area, then started a phone search.\n\nFinally, she located some of Bruner's tax records and found his address and telephone number.\n\n\"No one knew where the hell I was,\" Bruner says. \"I was here all the time. When they sent me my discharge, I just stayed here.\"\n\nThe woman helped connect Bruner with other survivors from the Arizona and Pearl Harbor. He finally found people who understood his experience.\n\n\"I never talked about it much then,\" he says. \"I just didn't want to. I still get to the point when I'm talking about it, first thing you know, I go to bed at night, wake up and can't sleep for a week.\"\n\nBruner, who turned 94 in November, is now one of nine living USS Arizona crewmen who survived the ship's sinking. He has been telling his story to an author, Ed McGrath, who is working on a book and a film about Bruner's escape from a collapsing tower on the ship.\n\nThe survivors' group that found him was right, he has concluded: The stories of the Arizona should not die with the men who lived them.\n\n\"The kids coming up now have never heard of it,\" he says, his voice tinged with sadness and dismay. \"Never heard of it.\"\n\nBruner was at his battle station in an anti-aircraft gun director, a metal box on the forward mast of the Arizona, when an armor-piercing bomb ignited the ship's powder magazine. The fireball from the explosion engulfed the six men in the box and trapped them.\n\nA sailor on the deck of the repair ship Vestal spotted the men and threw a line across. Their skin charred and falling off, the men crawled down the line to the Vestal. Bruner was the second-to-last man to leave the sinking ship.\n\nHe won't talk much about the escape, or about the men who didn't make it across. Nightmares invade his sleep when he remembers those final moments.\n\nFrom the Vestal, Bruner was taken to the USS Solace, a hospital ship in the harbor. The Solace dispatched motor boats to the Arizona to rescue wounded sailors and her crew pulled others from the water.\n\nBruner was burned over more than two-thirds of his body. He had taken a bullet to the back of his leg as he was climbing the tower, but the burns were far worse. He stayed aboard the Solace about a month. In January, another ship took him to San Francisco to the Navy hospital on Treasure Island.\n\nHe was treated there for four months. Before the war started, a hospital stay that long would have earned a sailor a discharge, but not anymore. He knew he was near release the day an officer came by and launched into a pep talk about the war and the Navy's role in it.\n\n\"I got another ship for you,\" the officer said at last.\n\n\"OK,\" Bruner said. \"What's up with this one?\"\n\n\"It's a brand new destroyer, the Coghlan, DD-606,\" he said, \"built right here in 'Frisco.\"\n\nAs the war with Japan intensified, the Navy was building new warships as fast as it could. And the ships needed experienced sailors.\n\nBruner was put in charge of the gun batteries. The ship carried four 5-inch anti-aircraft guns and six half-inch machine guns, and, initially, five 21-inch torpedo tubes. The guns used the same type of control mechanisms Bruner had mastered on the Arizona. Sight-setters and pointers would locate targets visually and determine their distance and range. An electro-mechanical computer would aim the guns.\n\n\"I had to start training the new recruits on every machine,\" Bruner said. \"The new ones, they didn't know beans.\"\n\nBruner looked each recruit in the eyes to determine the right job, but he wasn't testing their mettle, not yet. He wanted men with eyes set in the right place on their face. He looked for what he called medium spacing. With eyes too close or two far apart, a crewman could deliver faulty readings.\n\nThe Coghlan left San Francisco in September 1942 and sailed toward Pearl Harbor for an assignment. The ship was still a day away from Honolulu when the captain received new orders. The ship was to turn around and steam toward Alaska.\n\nThe Japanese military had established strategic outposts in the Aleutian Islands and had its eye on Alaska. Japan wanted the northern Pacific to control its shipping routes and block U.S. attacks from that direction.\n\nThe Coghlan approached the Aleutians in October, as winter was pushing fall aside. The sea turned rough, tossing the ship with 40-foot swells, bouncing the vessel like a rubber ball in a washing machine.\n\n\"When we got up into the Aleutians, we started banging on the Japanese that had already landed,\" Bruner said. \"We'd patrol at night. They were trying to replenish submarines or send smaller ships in. We'd go out and blow them up.\"\n\nBy winter, temperatures plunged below zero. The Coghlan's crew battled just to keep the guns free of ice as they headed toward their next target.\n\n\"We had to have two crews, a regular crew and a stand-by crew lined up waiting,\" Bruner said. \"We'd send two guys out to knock the icicles off the guns, then they'd high-tail it back in. By the time they were back, the icicles were forming again and two more guys would go out.\"\n\nThe Coghlan supported Army landings and Navy bombing runs. In March, the crew turned back Japanese forces in the Battle of Komandorski.\n\nLate in the year, after an overhaul in San Francisco, the Coghlan returned to patrol duty off the Aleutians with a half dozen other U.S. vessels. The ships encountered a Japanese fleet, two big cruisers, six destroyers, some troop ships, and engaged.\n\n\"We lit into them, started firing on them,\" Bruner said. \"This went on for four straight hours. We got into a run-and-gun battle. One of our cruisers, the heavy cruiser, got hit and water got into the oil. They were dead in the water.\"\n\nFinally, the four U.S. destroyers were ordered to mount a torpedo run.\n\n\"We took off,\" Bruner said, \"firing just as fast as we could. We got as close as 5,000 yards, which was point-blank for those ships. We cut the torpedoes loose.\"\n\nThe Americans stopped the Japanese ships and wiped out some of the top officers. The Coghlan turned back, almost spent. Another five minutes, Bruner figured, and they'd have run out of ammunition.\n\nBruner and the Coghlan returned to Honolulu and finished out the war in the South Pacific. The ship accompanied General Douglas MacArthur to the Philippines and was anchored in the harbor off Nagasaki, Japan, when the second atomic bomb exploded.\n\nBruner toured Nagasaki in a Jeep with other Navy officers and chief mates. A few days later, the drove through the crumbling streets of Hiroshima. The cities were in ruins. But the war was over.\n\n\"When I got back home, my doctors here wanted to know about my medical background,\" Bruner said. \"I would tell them. They said, 'You should have been dead a long time ago.'\"\n\nHe finished his stint in the Navy in Shanghai, working shore patrol the way he did back in Honolulu. He was cut loose in San Francisco and returned to Los Angeles, where he had married a girl back in late 1942.\n\nOne day, a young fellow knocked on his door.\n\n\"Hi,\" he said, introducing himself. \"I'm planning to marry your wife's sister, but I've got to have somebody take my place at work. I wanted to know if you could do it for a couple of weeks.\"\n\nBruner thought it an odd request. He asked what the fellow did.\n\n\"I'm a painter,\" he said. \"A brush painter.\"\n\nBruner laughs as he remembers the conversation.\n\n\"Well, I'd brushed enough paint on that damn ship, I figured I could do it,\" he says. \"I said, 'sure, I'll take it.' I still had to wait 29 years for that guy to come back and take his brush back.\"\n\nHis new employer manufactured industrial refrigeration units. Bruner started as a painter, trained as a carpenter, then helped start a new sheet-metal department. Almost three decades later, he was the plant manager, second-in-command.\n\nThree months before he would mark 30 years with the company, he was let go, bought out like a lot other older workers in those days.\n\nBy the time the woman from Illinois found him, he was ready to face his past.\n\nBruner lives alone , in a post-war neighborhood in the far northern edges of Orange County. Trains run close enough to hear the horns during the day, but not close enough to make them a nuisance.\n\nAn avocado tree grows in the backyard. Bruner's neighbor, who has become a close friend and a source of transportation, picks the fruit to keep it from rotting on the ground. Long a bachelor again, Bruner has also entertained lady friends from time to time.\n\nBruner keeps mementos of his time on the Arizona in the sitting room. Framed medals. Photos of the ship and other survivors at reunions in Honolulu. A sign over the arched door marks the room as \"Captain's Quarters.\"\n\nFor a long time, he didn't think he would ever return to Pearl Harbor.\n\nNow, Bruner prepares for his next trip in the Captain's Quarters. He will meet three other survivors in Hawaii for their last reunion. He looks forward to his time with the guys from his years in the Navy.\n\nThe first couple of trips back to Hawaii were difficult. The ones after that were, too.\n\n\"It never gets easy to go back,\" he says.\n\nSo why go back?\n\n\"To see the people I knew back in those days,\" he says. \"They were very good days before the war. I even had a couple of dates with girls.\"\n\nHis mouth quirks into a smile.\n\n\"I was on a date on that Saturday night with a gal I'd been running around with,\" he says. He doesn't need to say which Saturday night by now. \"We're were out and around. We were going to have a date the next day.\n\n\"The next day never came.\"\n\nMORRIS, Okla.\n\n\n\nLonnie Cook was born in this rural town south of Tulsa, not long after it was founded as a stop on the Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway. Only a few hundred people lived there then. Today, the population can almost reach 1,500 when everyone is home.\n\nCook enlisted in the Navy in 1940 and was assigned to the USS Arizona, one of the largest battleships in the fleet with a crew that, at full complement, numbered more than 1,500.\n\nAbout a year after he boarded the ship, he ran into a young recruit named Clyde Williams, a fellow from Okmulgee, Okla., a few miles down the road from Morris. All those sailors from all those places and here was a guy who was practically a neighbor.\n\n\"I was back here on leave before the war started and he was here too,\" Cook says. \"We picked up a couple of girls and made the rounds. Then we had to go back.\"\n\nCook was a gunner's mate on the Arizona. Williams was in the Arizona's band.\n\nOn the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, Cook was changing clothes at his locker, savoring the thought of a day in Honolulu with the $60 he'd won in a craps game the night before. Williams was on deck, tuning up to play for colors, an early call after the previous day's fleet Battle of the Bands on shore.\n\nMinutes later, the Japanese attacked and the Arizona was on fire, sinking beneath the surface.\n\nCook made it off alive. He returned after the war to his home along the railway in eastern Oklahoma. By then, he'd seen the world, witnessed history before it was history. His ships steamed across the Pacific, through the Panama Canal to Africa. He fought with other sailors in the Battle of Midway and watched the Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.\n\nBack on land, Cook followed welding jobs from Kentucky and Pennsylvania to New Jersey and Long Island, west to North Dakota and Wisconsin and finally to a ranch house in Salinas, Calif., where he raised a family and stayed put for almost 30 years.\n\nBut one day and one place in Cook's 94 years seem to embody all the rest, the day in December 1941 when the young sailor from Oklahoma escaped the ship that sent America to war.\n\nSeven decades later, he is one of nine living survivors from the Arizona. His story is always in demand, though he'd just as soon not tell it in front of a lot of people. He remembers all the details and most of what happened later.\n\nAnd he still likes to talk about that other young fellow from Oklahoma, the one who didn't make it home.\n\nWhen he left Morris the first time in 1939 after high school, Cook wasn't sure where he'd end up. Jobs were few, so he set off for Warner, Okla, with the idea of playing football at Connors State Agricultural College.\n\n\"They told me the team was already picked,\" he said. \"I said goodbye and left.\"\n\nHis mother suggested Hills Business College in Oklahoma City. He enrolled, but after a couple of weeks, the noisy streetcars and the police sirens kept him up all night.\n\n\"I went back and told my mother I wasn't going up there anymore,\" he said.\n\nBy April 1940, the Navy seemed like a good idea and by summer, he was on board the Arizona, stationed at Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.\n\nHe was assigned a battle station in the No. 3 gun turret. His job was to put the primer in the big 14-inch gun. Other crewmen would roll out the shell, use a mechanical device to ram it in, then load four bags of powder behind it. The primer went in last, before the end of the gun was sealed shut.\n\n\"From down inside, it wasn't too bad when they fired it,\" Cook said. \"It was like a hard jolt.\"\n\nCook made it to his battle station on Dec. 7, 1941, but the Arizona was moored in a cramped harbor and couldn't have fired the big guns even in a prolonged assault. Cook and the other men stayed below deck until the smoke from a fire forced them to leave.\n\nThe bomb that shattered the Arizona's bow exploded as Cook and the others climbed out of the turret. He stepped off the deck into a motor launch as the ship was sinking.\n\nThe next morning, the Arizona was still burning as oil flowed out of her full tanks. No one seemed to be in charge on Ford Island, where Cook had spent the night. He met up with some of the guys from the turret crew and they hopped a boat to shore, where there was a call for volunteers to join the Navy's destroyers.\n\n\"We said we'd volunteer if they'd put two or three of us together on the same ship,\" he said. \"They agreed.\"\n\nCook was assigned to the USS Patterson, then two months later, transferred to the Aylwin, a destroyer that had been moored at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 and engaged the bombers as the attack began.\n\nIn February, the Aylwin was part of a U.S. task force preparing for a raid on a Japanese base at Raubal, on the island of New Britain near Australia. Enemy patrol planes spotted the ships and the raid was canceled. As the ships turned around, a squadron of enemy bombers appeared. The ships sent up their own planes and turned back the assault.\n\nIn May 1942, the Aylwin joined a task force in the Coral Sea with the USS Lexington, one of the Navy's early aircraft carriers. On the morning of May 8, the fighting intensified as American aircraft tried to turn back the enemy planes.\n\nJapanese torpedo bombers hit the Lexington and crippled the big ship. Explosions rocked the vessel and fires burned into the evening. The crew was evacuated and another U.S. destroyer scuttled the Lexington to keep the Japanese from capturing her.\n\nYears later, at a reunion in Tucson, Cook learned that one of his buddies from the Arizona had been sent to the Lexington and was in the Coral Sea when the carrier was attacked. He had settled in New Mexico with his family.\n\nCook got the buddy's telephone number and tried to call him. The buddy wasn't home, but his son-in-law answered.\n\n\"Can you tell me what ship did he go on after the Arizona?\" Cook asked.\n\n\"The Lexington,\" the son-in-law said.\n\n\"Was he on it when it sunk?\" Cook asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir, he was.\"\n\nCook never got a chance to catch up with his buddy, but marveled at the connections he seemed to make from his short stint aboard the Arizona.\n\nA month after the Coral Sea battle, Cook's ship was part of the American forces in the critical Battle of Midway. After that, he steamed north to Kodiak, Alaska, where other Navy ships were trying to turn back Japanese inroads throughout the strategically important Aleutian Islands.\n\nBefore the year was out, Cook was sent to gunnery school in Washington, D.C., and to the South Boston Navy Yard, where he joined the new destroyer Pringle on its shakedown cruise.\n\nAbout halfway through the cruise, the Pringle was ordered to accompany the battleship Iowa to Africa, where President Roosevelt was to attend a conference with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Morocco.\n\nDuring the conference, the Pringle sailed into the Mediterranean Sea and anchored in a river. One day, some smaller boats sailed past. One of the men started yelling.\n\n\"Is there anybody there from Oklahoma?\"\n\nThere were: Cook and another crewman. The man in the boat was from Muskogee, a town about 40 miles east of Morris.\n\nLonnie and Marietta Cook met in Morris after the war, but the road to their home here today winds thousands of miles across the country.\n\nCook was discharged in 1948 in San Diego and stuck around California, where he worked as a metal finisher at Van Nuys manufacturing plant. That didn't last long and he headed back to Morris, where he met Marietta.\n\nShe likes the story of how they tied the knot. He tries to abbreviate it: \"We went to California and got married.\"\n\n\"Tell them the rest,\" Marietta prompts.\n\n\"She went to California and I followed her,\" Lonnie says.\n\nMarietta shakes her head. \"He called me one night and said if you won't let me come to California, I found a lady who's got a new black Buick and I'm going to move to Texas.\"\n\n\"It was a new Mercury,\" Lonnie says.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, come on, then,'\" Marietta says, and in 1950, they wed.\n\nThat's where the cross-country adventures begin. Cook worked in California, mostly welding jobs, until the union he belonged to called a strike. He headed east and landed in Paducah, Ky. From there, he worked jobs in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and back to New York, where he welded 20-inch gas lines going through Brooklyn.\n\nHe returned to Oklahoma again and started his own business, outfitting a one-ton Ford pickup with a winch and other equipment that let him work the oil fields. A while later, he and Marietta were on the road again, to a missile base in Sturgess, S.D., to gas lines in Wisconsin and North Dakota.\n\nFinally, they made their way to Salinas, Calif., just inland from Monterey on the central coast. They bought a small ranch and, while Lonnie continued to work welding jobs, they grew walnuts, almonds, peaches, apples, nectarines, cherries and grapes.\n\n\"I canned 500 quarts of fruit one year,\" Marietta says. \"I really miss it.\"\n\nLonnie finally retired from welding in 1982 and in 1994, the Cooks moved back to Morris. Lonnie had taken up trap shooting and hoped to do a little hunting back home. It turned out little was the right word. He hasn't hunted in a while, though he still reloads his own ammunition on a garage workbench.\n\nAfter so many years of travel, the Cooks have settled into a more tranquil pace. They spoil their granddaughters and can now move on to a new great-granddaughter. Once a week, they motor on into Tulsa, where Marietta takes a china painting class and Lonnie wanders the aisles of sporting-goods stores.\n\nOccasionally, they head into Okmulgee for an evening out at the One Fire, a casino operated by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\n\nCook has returned to Pearl Harbor three times and he likes the Arizona memorial. It is respectful. He's not so fond of the crowds around Honolulu and doesn't plan to go back.\n\nAs he talks about Pearl Harbor again, other memories surface.\n\nCook was the gun captain on the Pringle at the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. The ship provided fire support for the Marines going ashore. Cook stood on a shelf in the gun mount with his big binoculars and watched the Marines raise the flag to mark the U.S. victory.\n\nAbout a month later, Japanese suicide bombers sunk the Pringle near Okinawa.\n\nDuring his voyage to Alaska, Cook remembers the flying fish, which stirred up the water like a torpedo wake. That was enough to rattle nerves on board the ship, which was at general quarters every day an hour before sundown and an hour before sunrise.\n\n\"The nights up there were already short, so I didn't get much sleep,\" Cook says. \"That's what I'm catching up now. When she says anything, I tell her I'm catching up from the war.\"\n\nA few years ago, the Cooks attended a fund-raising dinner at a local American Legion post. Cook is invited to such events occasionally and sometimes introduced as an Arizona survivor.\n\nAt this one, he was looking around the room and he saw a picture of a sailor way back in the back, in a setting arranged like a memorial. He squinted and thought about where he was.\n\n\"That must be old Clyde Williams,\" he thought, the Arizona band member killed at Pearl Harbor.\n\nHe walked back there. Sure enough.\n\nIt was Clyde.\n\nROSWELL, N.M.\n\nHis name was Cactus Jack and to his fans in southeastern New Mexico, he was the dulcet-voiced host of Sagebrush Serenade, a program of country music on KSWS radio.\n\nHe was in the studio on Valentine's Day 1955 when a nervous young man walked in. He was the opening act for country superstar Hank Snow that night at the North High School auditorium. He had a record, a new song he was trying out.\n\n\"Would you like to listen to it?\" the young man asked.\n\nJack shrugged. \"Sure, let's see it.\" He put the disc on a turntable and dropped the needle.\n\nWhat he heard wasn't quite country music, but he liked it and he told the kid. Song's got some zip to it, he said. He agreed to play it on his show.\n\nThe song, \"Hound Dog\" and the singer, Elvis Presley, both went over pretty well, the way Cactus Jack remembers it.\n\nFor a lot of people, meeting Elvis and playing one of his first records on the air might sound like one of life's truly unforgettable days. But John Anderson, the Navy chief petty officer who called himself Cactus Jack on the air, had a good head start already.\n\nHe had chased Japanese soldiers along the coast of China three years before America declared war on Japan. In World War II, he fought at Guadalcanal, in the battle of the Coral Sea, at Okinawa and Iwo Jima. He fought cold and hunger on a ship nearly dead in the ocean off Alaska.\n\nAfter the war, he worked as a stuntman for Orson Welles and John Wayne and helped build Alan Ladd's house in the hills outside Hollywood.\n\nAnd he was aboard on Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese bombed the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, a pivotal moment in history, but one that struck Anderson to his core. There, he lost his twin brother\n\n\"It was a bloody catastrophe, a bloody mess,\" he says. \"I don't think I'll ever forget what I saw that day.\"\n\nAnderson always talks about his brother, Delbert \"Jake\" Anderson, when he tells the story of his own escape from the burning ship.\n\nHe is one of nine living survivors of the Arizona and, at 97, he has amassed a lifetime of unforgettable days.\n\nAnderson grew up in the Red River Valley of northern Minnesota, the son of a prominent local judge. He had five brothers, including Jake, and four sisters, all grouped so close in age that paying for college wasn't practical for their folks.\n\nAs a youngster, Anderson heard stories about the Navy from his uncle, a man named Ray Stokes. Uncle Ray was nearing the end of his career in 1937 when John and Jake both decided to enlist.\n\nJohn was sent from training camp in Illinois to Bremerton, Wash. He was assigned briefly to the Arizona, then to the Saratoga, an aircraft carrier, then, as the Navy tinkered once more with its troop alignment, back to the Arizona.\n\nBefore the big battleship could leave Puget Sound, Anderson volunteered for another mission, joining the small Asiatic Fleet along the coast of China.\n\nAnderson went aboard the USS Edsall, a destroyer that supported various military action at sea and ashore. Japan and China were at war again and America was trying to protect its interests without getting involved in the conflict.\n\n\"We saved people on commercial ships on the seas, we rescued missionaries in the interior of China, we shot up a bunch of pirates,\" Anderson said.\n\nAt Kulangsu, an international settlement on an island off the southern Chinese coast, Anderson's unit ran into the French Foreign Legion, who had been cornered by Japanese soldiers on a high ridge.\n\n\"I'd never seen so many guys with so much guts,\" he said. \"They were holed up behind sandbags, but they never got hit.\"\n\nThe Edsall sailed farther north, then headed to the Philippines, where they played baseball with a group of indigenous Moros, who had fought the United States more than 20 years earlier.\n\n\"We were told to watch out for them, these guys were assassins,\" Anderson said. \"We made friends. We left and never fired a shot at them.\"\n\nIn 1940, Anderson reported to the Arizona once more, joining his brother for the first time since they had enlisted. They would serve together for a little over a year.\n\nThe day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Anderson volunteered for duty on the Macdonough, a destroyer that downed at least one of the Japanese attack planes on Dec. 7.\n\nThe ship steamed toward the Asiatic Pacific and soon Anderson was chasing Japanese forces again, only this time the United States was at war. This time the objective was clear.\n\nThat summer, the ship joined others for the invasion at Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, one of the first major assaults against Japan by the Americans. The Macdonough stayed until September, then sailed back on patrol in the Pacific.\n\nIn the spring of 1943, the Macdonough headed north toward the Aleutian Islands, where Japan was trying to establish strategic strongholds that could control shipping lanes and thwart allied attacks on the Japanese islands.\n\n\"It was rough weather, foggy, raining cold,\" Anderson said. \"Here we are, we can't see the enemy. We can't see our own ships. Then we got hit.\"\n\nThe Macdonough had collided with another destroyer, the Sicard. The ship was dead in the water. The crew unloaded anything they could do without, to keep the damaged hull above the water line. They knew the oil tanker Tippecanoe was out there, but couldn't see her.\n\nFinally, the tanker spotted the destroyer. Anderson spoke to one of the tanker's crew about towing the Macdonough. The fellow he was talking with recognized Anderson's voice and they realized they had served together on the Yangtze Patrol before Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe tanker towed them to Adak, Alaska, and from there, another ship took the crippled destroyer to San Francisco for repairs.\n\nOver the next year, Anderson would sail across the South Pacific, joining other ships in the American assault on the Marshall Islands, Parry Island and the Palau Islands. The Macdonough pulled picket patrol often, protecting other troops and guarding against kamikaze attacks by Japanese planes.\n\n\"We made so many landings,\" Anderson said. \"We would go in with a landing party or we furnished artillery for the landing force. Sometimes we never landed, but we kept the line, always watching out for kamikazes.\"\n\nOn a fall day in 1945, John Anderson teetered on the base of a church steeple 110 feet above the ground. The steeple clock chimed and a statue of an angel wielding a sword emerged from an alcove and knocked Anderson off the steeple.\n\n\"Cut!\" a director yelled. A stunt coordinator helped pull Anderson from the pile of cigarette crates that had broken his fall. Anderson had finished his first day as a Hollywood stunt man.\n\nThe job wasn't what he expected in September, when he was discharged from the Navy. He had a ticket home to Minnesota, but decided to find a place to stay and come up with a plan.\n\nAs he walked past a bar, still in his Navy uniform, a fellow popped out the door and looked Anderson up and down, checking him out more closely someone would ordinarily.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Anderson demanded to know.\n\n\"You,\" the fellow said. \"Are you in the Navy?\"\n\n\"I was,\" Anderson said. \"I just got discharged. The war's over.\"\n\n\"Would you like a job?\" The fellow told him to report to the front gate of Sam Goldwyn's studio in Hollywood on Monday morning. He gave Anderson the name of a contact there.\n\nAnderson decided he had nothing to lose. After an initial run-in with the guard at the gate (\"Three weeks ago, I was shooting at people and killing them and I didn't even know who they were,\" he growled at the guard. \"You I know.\") he met his contact and not long after, he was standing in for Orson Welles in a scene from the movie \"The Stranger.\"\n\nIt turned out most of the regular stuntmen were still in the military. The studios needed tough men who could handle dangerous situations. The job paid $700.\n\n\"Next thing you know, I'm in a movie with John Wayne,\" Anderson says years later. \"I didn't have any speaking parts, but I was working for the studio and they paid me.\"\n\nHe got to know Alan Ladd, who had starred in a series of war movies. When the regular stuntmen returned and the studio cut loose the subs, Ladd hired some of them to work on his house in the Holmby Hills above Los Angeles.\n\nAt nights, Anderson was taking classes in meteorology and electronics, trying to learn skills that could help him stand out among all the returning servicemen and women.\n\nOne day, he stopped for coffee at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood. He felt a tap on his shoulder. He saw Gene LaRocque, a man he'd served with aboard the Macdonough.\n\n\"Are you out of the Navy, Andy?\" LaRocque asked. When Anderson said he was, his old friend was incredulous. \"Andy, you had 12 years of the damnedest fighting I ever saw. You're the bravest man I ever know. You can't leave the Navy.\"\n\nLaRocque took Anderson to San Pedro, where his current ship was anchored. He introduced him to other officers. By the end of the day, had persuaded Anderson to sign up for the Navy Reserve. Put in eight years at least and you'll have a pension, he promised.\n\nAnderson would serve another 23 years before finally retiring once more.\n\nAnderson's road to the radio booth started in Hollywood, with a screen test at a studio where he had worked. He waited for the result. You have a great voice, he was told. Why not try radio?\n\nSo he did. He started on a small station, playing organ music. An administrator at Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, N.M., heard Anderson and talked him into joining the school to help improve its radio station and start a television station.\n\nAnderson picked up and moved to New Mexico. He clashed with the station manager of the radio station and finally quit. Or got fired. Or both. That led to a job in Roswell, the Sagebrush Serenade and Elvis Presley.\n\n\"They played country music because the people here loved that,\" Anderson says. \"Some of the ships I was on had guys who liked to play the guitar, so I knew something about it. The owner said, 'give it a name and say who are. Anything you choose is fine. You're on your own, every day.'\"\n\nAs Cactus Jack, Anderson made a few concessions to his seagoing past.\n\n\"I cleaned up my language,\" he says, admitting he deployed a salty vocabulary, even after leaving active duty. \"In the service, if you didn't use nasty words, you weren't a good sailor.\"\n\nA few years later, a new station owner showed Anderson his plans to start a TV station. He said he wanted Anderson to join the on-air staff. Did he know anything about meteorology?\n\nAnderson smiled. Did he ever. Soon, he became one of the earliest TV weathermen and an evening fixture in Roswell homes, or at least those with televisions.\n\nNot long after he returned to Pearl Harbor near the end of the war, Anderson searched out some of the battle reports from Dec. 7, 1941. He knew his brother hadn't made it off the Arizona alive, but he didn't know much else.\n\nHe found a report by a gunner's mate. The report said most of the guys in the anti-aircraft batteries, where Jake fought, were shot down early in the assault. When the fourth bomb detonated in the powder magazine, anyone left was blown over the side.\n\nAnderson has returned to the Arizona memorial often and has taken his family there. He has met many of his old friends and shipmates. Many have since died.\n\n\"It's always a great thing for me to see them,\" he says. \"That's what I want to remember. The things I don't want to remember was the blood.\"\n\nAlthough he is 97, he decided he couldn't miss a final reunion this year and he bought his tickets early. He wanted one last unforgettable day.\n\nUPDATE: John Anderson died in November 2015, less than a year after this report.\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.\n\n\n\nDonald Stratton completed the paperwork for a concealed weapons permit at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office and approached the counter to submit fingerprints.\n\nHe was still adjusting to his new life in Colorado, hundreds of miles inland from his old home in coastal California and more than a mile higher in elevation. He had turned 90 and was starting over again.\n\nAs he waited, he had a feeling he knew what would happen, but he didn't say anything. A clerk tried to complete the process, normally a routine, if messy, step to secure the permit. She returned, puzzled.\n\nThey were having trouble reading his prints, she told Stratton. It was as if he had none.\n\nStratton hesitated, then confirmed her suspicion. His fingers were almost smooth, lacking all but a few of the swirls that create an identity.\n\nStratton told her why: He had been aboard the USS Arizona when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec 7, 1941. He survived, but was burned badly over two-thirds of his body. Doctors treated him and he recovered, but the his fingers never healed properly.\n\nThe clerks decided they could not send Stratton away without his permit. They found a way to take prints from the edges of his fingers, enough to satisfy the law.\n\nAs he recounts the experience, he rubs his hands together, then holds them out, turning them over. He pushes his shirtsleeves up to show his arms. He motions toward his gnarled ear. He catalogs the scars and their origin.\n\nThey are the marks of a survivor, 73 years on. They are reminders of a moment in time he can never escape, a moment he sees again and again.\n\n\"Through all that, I never did lose consciousness,\" he says. \"I knew everything that was going on.\"\n\nAs the USS Arizona burned and sunk into the harbor, Stratton and five other men had been trapped on an anti-aircraft gun control platform on the ship's foremast, burned in a fireball when below-deck ammunition exploded.\n\nA sailor on the repair ship Vestal, tied up nearby, spotted them and threw them a line. The men, their charred skin peeling away, climbed hand-over-hand across the line to safety.\n\nStratton and other men climbed into a small boat that took them ashore. They still had to climb onto the dock and then into a truck for a short ride to a Navy hospital. The burn ward filled with the injured. The smell of burned skin filled the air. Doctors and nurses wove among gurneys, administering morphine shots and looking for the victims most in need.\n\nWithin a day or two, someone came into the ward and said a few of the wounded would be sent to California. He asked for volunteers.\n\n\"I'll go,\" Stratton said.\n\n\"No,\" the worker said. \"We don't think you'd make it. Maybe next time.\"\n\n\"I want to go anyway,\" Stratton said.\n\n\"Fine,\" the worker said. \"If you can stand up and stay up while we change the linen on this bed, we'll see about it.\"\n\nStratton climbed to his feet and, biting back the pain, he stood and when his bed was ready, he collapsed back into it. By Christmas, he was in a hospital at Mare Island near San Francisco. He stayed there for months. He weighed 92 pounds by the time he was sent to rehabilitation in Corona, Calif. Finally, the Navy gave him a medical discharge.\n\nA year later, he felt better, so he re-enlisted. The Navy wanted to keep him in Idaho, working with new recruits at a boot camp, but he pushed for a seagoing assignment and wound up on the destroyer USS Stack as a gunner's mate.\n\nHe saw action across the South Pacific, patrolled areas where suicide bombers were attacking American destroyers. Once he was awakened by a loud noise and a flash and thought his ship was under attack.\n\nIt wasn't, but the flash was a reminder, as if he needed anything more.\n\nBefore the end of the war, he went to San Diego for gunner's mate school. He finished his training and was discharged in December 1945.\n\nStratton grew up in the tiny prairie town of Red Cloud, Neb., about as far away from an ocean as any place in the country. He joined the Navy because it seemed like a better environment.\n\n\"You either had a nice place aboard a ship and were high and dry or you didn't have anything,\" he reasoned. \"In the Army you were crawling around in the mud and everything else and I didn't want to do that.\"\n\nAfter his second discharge, he knocked around Nebraska again, working in his dad's tavern, then on a beer truck, but he grew bored. He decided to head back to the water. In California, he earned his naval seaman's license and went to work on a drilling rig offshore near Santa Barbara.\n\nHe made bargemaster on a huge drilling rig, but yearned for something more interesting, so he got a job as a tender with a commercial deep sea diving business. As a tender, he stayed on the surface, monitoring the divers working on rigs, piers, pipelines, any piece of seaside or seagoing equipment.\n\nStratton logged thousands of miles of travel. Nicaragua. Chile. Colombia. Kuwait. In Alaska, he helped set up platforms that could keep up with tides that rose and fell as much as 32 feet.\n\nIn his dining room in Colorado Springs, he keeps a replica of a hard diving helmet, the kind his divers used. The face plate is glass and around the bottom are screws that would secure it to the diving suit. Stratton falls easily into the memories of his years on diving boats.\n\n\"We worked with a crane barge capable of lifting 700 tons,\" he sys. \"I motioned to crane operator what we needed, what tools to send down.\" He touches the diving helmet. \"I ran the decompression chamber on jobs. Once, I made a dive in a two-man submarine, down in over 1,200 feet of water off Santa Barbara coast. One of the first people to do that.\"\n\nFor years, Stratton wore the scars from the Arizona without talking about them much. Lots of men brought home scars from World War II and Korea. The offshore diving business could leave its own kind of scars.\n\nIn 1966, 25 years after the attack, Stratton returned to Pearl Harbor with his family. In the waters off Honolulu, he confronted his memories. It was the first time Randy, his son, had seen his father cry.\n\nIn the years after, he became active in survivors' groups and started going back to Pearl Harbor more often. At the USS Arizona memorial, he became friends with a National Park Service historian and inspired a Pearl Harbor action figure that the service sold at the gift shop.\n\nIn time, he felt no anger toward the Japanese, but he couldn't forget what they did. Sometimes, Japanese pilots attended memorial ceremonies and some of the other survivors would shake their hands. Stratton could not.\n\n\"Listen, all those men down there on that ship, a thousand of them, they wouldn't do it and I don't think they'd want me to do it,\" he says. \"We can't forget what happened there that day. We can't let it happen again.\"\n\nA while back, Stratton and his wife Velma retired to Yuma and lived there about 15 years. He played a lot of golf, but missed California. They moved to Santa Maria, not far from Santa Barbara, to be near their oldest son, then to Colorado Springs to be near Randy. They will celebrate 65 years of marriage in April.\n\nThe Stratton men have taken up a more personal cause. He wants to secure a proper medal for Joe George, the sailor from the Vestal who helped rescue the six men from the gunner's control tower.\n\nA lot of people agree that what George did was heroic, but the Navy balks at every step, in part because George disobeyed a direct order.\n\n\"He should have the Navy Cross,\" Stratton says. \"He saved six people's lives. Joe saved six lives and he didn't get crap. He refused to cut the line no matter what. As far he was concerned he was saving lives.\"\n\nIn 1971, Stratton was working long hours with a diving outfit on a nuclear power plant project not far from Santa Barbara. He needed a truck to carry equipment back and forth, so he scouted out a car lot and bought a 1965 Chevrolet pickup.\n\nHe kept the truck, held on to it through repairs, engine overhauls, new paint jobs. It sits today in the carport outside his home. He still tools around town in the truck, but it's a classic now, so he drives it almost as often to car shows.\n\nHe can tell stories about his years with the diving crews, but the truck has evolved into a reminder of another time. The license plate reads USS ARIZ. A mural on a white bed cover depicts the USS Arizona and the memorial that floats above it in Pearl Harbor. It identifies Stratton as a survivor of the attack that sank the ship.\n\nWherever he goes on the pickup, people ask him about his experience. Yes, he'll say, he was on the Arizona and he survived. Yes, a lot of brave men died. Yes, some of them were his friends.\n\nHe still remembers the day he saw the Arizona in dry dock at Bremerton, Wash.\n\n\"It was quite a sight for an old flatlander like me to see a 35,000-ton battleship out of the water,\" he says. \"It was a big ship with a lot of metal, I'll tell you.\" He owns a chunk of the ship's burned deck, a reminder he keeps in a box with a few other items.\n\nOn a recent fall afternoon, Stratton ambles down the driveway and fires up the engine. He eases the truck out of the carport, far enough to show it off. He fiddles with the radio.\n\n\"Randy, come and turn on the music box.\" His son reaches in the cab and queues up one of the hundreds of songs he and his daughter downloaded onto the new MP3 player.\n\n\"Lots of big band songs,\" Randy says, as the first bars of a brass line pour from the speakers. \"The stuff he likes.\"\n\nHow lucky can one guy be?\n\nI kissed her and she kissed me\n\nStratton's eyes brighten. A smile spreads across his face as Dean Martin's voice fills the cab.\n\nLike a fella once said\n\nAin't that a kick in the head?\n\nThe smile widens. Almost imperceptibly, he sways.\n\nWEST WARWICK, R.I.\n\n\n\nThe six men stared straight ahead, almost as if they were back in line, at attention. They listened for their names and their service branch. They stayed composed as their stories were told, stories of bravery, of quick thinking. Stories of survival.\n\nEach of the six men were at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, when Japanese planes swarmed the Navy fleet in an ambush that would provoke war. On the 70th anniversary of the attack, the men had been brought to the state capitol to receive new honors.\n\nAs each name was read, Rhode Island National Guard Maj. Gen. Kevin McBride presented the man with the Rhode Island Star, one of the state's highest military honors.\n\nWorld War II veterans are a special breed, Lt. Col. Denis Riel said as the men accepted the medals. Without them, Riel said, who knows where we'd be today.\n\nMcBride reached the last man, Raymond Haerry, a 20-year-old coxswain on the day of the assault. Haerry straightened in his seat as his story was told. He had escaped the USS Arizona, the battleship whose losses surpassed any other.\n\nFor Haerry, McBride had a the state's highest military honor, the Rhode Island Cross. Haerry accepted the medal, but found he could not speak. He handed the microphone to his son, Raymond Haerry, Jr., who spoke of his father's courage and resilience.\n\nThree years later, Ray Haerry Jr. holds the cross in his hand, fighting back tears.\n\n\"I hadn't told him he was going to be individually honored that day,\" he says. \"I had to help my father out of his seat. He stood strong and tall right in front of this general. I heard the general say, 'You're a remarkable guy.' I think it was one of the proudest days of my father's life.\"\n\nHis dad has never sought recognition for his service on the Arizona and barely talks about the day of the attack. He will tell his story to people he knows well and trusts, but he is 93 and the details are fading from his memory.\n\nIn 2011, he was one of six Rhode Islanders who had lived through the attack on Pearl Harbor, the only one from the Arizona. Today, he is one of nine remaining survivors from the mighty battleship.\n\n\"I do as much as I can to keep his story alive,\" his son says. \"It's always been my fear that people are going to forget that day, that people are going to forget the sacrifice that was made that day.\"\n\nHaerry ran away from home to join the Navy. He grew up in New Jersey and after high school, enrolled at MIT in Boston. He was smart enough to excel, but started cutting classes not long after the start of his first semester.\n\nHe and a buddy would sneak off campus and hop freight trains to see how far they could get. He missed enough of his classes that he was finally asked to leave. As soon as he turned 18, he enlisted in the Navy.\n\nOn the Arizona, he worked on the deck crew. He cleaned and painted day after day, but he also operated the motor boats used to ferry crew members to shore, a job that let him leave the ship periodically.\n\nHaerry had made two runs to shore on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. It was Sunday and some of the crewmen with liberty wanted an early start. He was eating breakfast when he heard the first pops of the attack planes strafing Battleship Row.\n\nHe ran to the anti-aircraft battery, his battle station, but there was no ammunition ready. He could see the planes were flying too low for his guns anyway, but before his crew could figure out their next move, an armor-piercing bomb detonated near the powder magazine beneath the No. 2 gun turret.\n\nHaerry felt the entire ship life out of the water. As it fell, he was thrown from the ship into the harbor. He half-swam, half-walked the 70 yards to Ford Island and manned a mounted machine gun. He spent the rest of the day retrieving bodies from the harbor.\n\n\"He remembers body parts in the water, charred burned bodies that he swam by,\" his son Ray, Jr., says. \"Something had happened that no one could comprehend.\"\n\nHaerry sailed on Navy ships through World War II and again during the Korean conflict. He spent long months on a tender, a vessel that carries equipment, parts and other supplies for ships at sea.\n\nOn one mission, Haerry's tender was tied to a larger ship as the crew delivered supplies and completed maintenance tasks. The sky began to darken and the wind grew. A storm was approaching, a big one by the looks of it.\n\nThe tender didn't want to be tied to the larger ship when the worst of the storm blew through. High winds could slam one ship into the other and sink one or both of the vessels.\n\nHaerry held the rope that connected the ships as another crewman swung an ax to cut it. As the boat heaved, the man with the ax missed and hit Haerry's hand, nearly severing it from his wrist. He did not reach a hospital for several days, but doctors still saved his hand.\n\nA year after World War II ended, Haerry went home for a while and married a girl he'd met not long before. He and Evelyn had their first son, Ray, Jr., in 1947.\n\nFor a while, the young family lived in Puerto Rico as Haerry, now a chief boatswain's mate, drew new assignments aboard his tender.\n\n\"He was out to sea nine months out of the year, only home for three months,\" Ray Jr. says. \"He was very military by then, very disciplined.\"\n\nAfter he returned from Korea, Haerry was promoted to master chief petty officer, signifying his experience and level of service. He had turned down a promotion to ensign, preferring the camaraderie of the enlisted ranks.\n\nAt his request, he was assigned to the officer candidate school in Newport, R.I. He left home at 5 every morning and took a ferry from Jamestown to the Navy base. He liked teaching and liked the chance to instill discipline.\n\n\"I've gotten letters from some of the officer candidates who had my father as an instructor,\" Ray Jr. says. \"They said he was a tough bastard, but that's exactly what they needed.\"\n\nHis service on the Arizona also seemed to give him added credibility among the young sailors. They respected a guy who survived such a horrific attack.\n\nThere was a tradition at the end of training that the graduates would give the chief a silver dollar. Haerry would come home on those days with cigar boxes full of the coins.\n\nFor a long time, Haerry never talked about his experiences at Pearl Harbor. He displayed no pictures, kept no mementos that his family knew about. He would answer questions, but in short bursts of description, with no emotion.\n\n\"The only people he would talk to were either very close friends or relatives,\" his son says. \"He'd always have to be prompted.\"\n\nIt took Ray Jr. years, decades to piece together his father's story. He would draw out snippets and stash them away, collecting them until he would weave the barest narrative.\n\nAs anniversaries of the attack passed, Ray Jr. would asked his dad if he wanted to visit the USS Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor.\n\nNope. He wanted to part of it. He's never been back.\n\n\"I can understand that,\" Ray Jr. says. \"To go through that to me is incomprehensible. Nobody was expecting anything like that.\"\n\nHis dad will return finally at his death. Ray Jr. has arranged for his father's remains to be interred in the sunken Arizona, an honor accorded any of the sailors or Marines who survived the attack.\n\nThree years ago, Ray Jr. received a call from a lieutenant colonel in the Rhode Island National Guard. He told Ray about the plans to honor Pearl Harbor survivors at the statehouse. One of the survivors would receive the Rhode Island Cross.\n\nAs they talked, Ray mentioned that his dad had been aboard the Arizona. That caught the lieutenant colonel's interest. He called back a few days later.\n\n\"We found our guy,\" he told Ray Jr.\n\nFive years ago, Haerry moved into a nursing home, He stays in a room on the second floor. Thickets of tangled shrubs and rows of trees are visible from his window.\n\nThe nurse who checks in on him regularly likes Haerry. She prods him to move around more and to leave the room for meals. He has told her about his escape from the Arizona.\n\nRay Jr. seems surprised. \"He told you the story?\" She nods and smiles.\n\nHaerry accepts the chocolate bars his son has brought him. He likes chocolate and is disappointed if Ray Jr. forgets it. There are a few personal photos on the table, but nothing from his years in the Navy.\n\nExcept the cap. The USS Arizona ballcap that almost every survivor owns and wears.\n\nHe doesn't want to answer questions about his war service, shrugging them off or insisting he can't remember the details anymore. But he clutches the cap and puts it on as he sits in an easy chair by the window.\n\n\"These guys were the first heroes of the war, even though the war hasn't been declared,\" Ray Jr. says. \"I think my dad was one of the first American heroes of World War II.\"\n\nHe and his father chat a little. Haerry says he wants lunch delivered to his room, but the nurse says no. You need the exercise. Haerry nods and like a good sailor taking orders from the chief, he pulls himself up with a walker and shuffles off to lunch.\n\nYUBA CITY, Calif.\n\nJoe Langdell found a table in the wardroom of one of the ships moored in Pearl Harbor and sat down with his breakfast.\n\nThree days had passed since Japanese bombers had punched a fiery hole in the Navy's Pacific fleet. Three days since the war started.\n\nCrippled ships still floated around the mooring posts along Ford Island. Repair crews were already at work on the battleships that had survived. Salvage work would begin soon on others. Sailors found food and shelter wherever they could.\n\nLangdell's ship, the USS Arizona, lay dead in the water where she sank 14 minutes into the attack. The mast and towers near the bow tilted at a sickening angle. Fire had blackened much of the structure still visible.\n\nLangdell heard someone enter the room.\n\n\"Are there any officers from the Arizona here?\" he said.\n\nLangdell was an ensign, an entry-level officer, not yet a year in the Navy. He was nervous about volunteering for anything, but he raised his hand.\n\nThe man walked over and looked at Langdell's name tag.\n\n\"Mr. Langdell,\" he said, \"when you're done with your breakfast, you'll report to the pier and you'll be met by a motor whale boat and a party of 20 enlisted men with sheets and pillow cases.\"\n\nWhat is this? Langdell thought.\n\n\"You will go to the Arizona and you will take off all the bodies and body parts above the water line,\" the man said. \"Cover the decks, anywhere you can find them up to the top of the masts.\"\n\n\"So that's what we did,\" he says, staring out at the harbor nearly seven decades later.\n\nLangdell is one of the last nine survivors from the Arizona. At 100, he is the oldest.\n\nHe was on Ford Island when the Japanese attacked, training for new assignment. His own battle station was beneath the gun turret shattered by the last bomb to hit the Arizona. From the shore, he helped wounded men from the water, men whose bodies had been torn apart by bombs and bullets and fire.\n\nBut he could not be prepared for what he found on the charred hulk of the battleship. He still will not talk about it. His younger son believes the experience changed his dad forever.\n\n\"How could it not?\" the son wonders.\n\nLangdell says only this: \"It took two days to take all the bodies. We carefully wrapped them in sheets. The body parts we put in pillow cases. We swept the decks and took the small bones. Everything was taken ashore and properly taken care of.\"\n\nLangdell arrived at Pearl Harbor along a different path than many of the young sailors, who signed up for the service because they were unable to find work as civilians.\n\nBorn in 1914, seven months after the first bolts were tightened on a new battleship in Brooklyn, Langdell grew up wooded agricultural area along the Souhegan River in southern New Hampshire.\n\nHis dad operated a livery stable and a small dairy and later earned money as an auctioneer. The family sold maple syrup distilled from the trees on their farm.\n\nAfter high school, Langdell enrolled at Boston University, working nights to pay for his classes, and in 1938, he earned a degree in business administration. He went to work as a junior accountant for a prominent Boston firm.\n\nBut he became restless. He signed up for a Navy program that allowed college graduates to attend officer candidate school and emerge as ensigns within three months. By early 1941, Langdell was one of the \"90-day wonders\" and drew his first assignment: The USS Arizona.\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Langdell asked for a posting on one of the new destroyers the Navy was set to launch. He was soon aboard the USS Frazier, which left the shipyard at San Francisco in July 1942.\n\nThe Frazier patrolled the South Pacific at first, but in early 1943, steamed northward toward Alaska, where Japan was trying to secure positions in the Aleutian Islands.\n\nOne day in May, crewmen spotted two periscopes in the water and the Frazier opened fire. The guns hit the periscope. Using its sonar equipment, the ship fired depth charges and eventually sank the enemy submarine.\n\nToward the end the war, Langdell was stationed in the Philippines, at a base in Manila. Among his responsibilities was overseeing the naval officers' clubs in the area.\n\nOne morning, he was at his desk, catching up on paperwork, when he heard a vehicle screech to a halt outside. A young sailor ran in, out of breath.\n\n\"Mr. Langdell, Mr. Langdell, you've got to come here quick,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it?\" Langdell asked.\n\n\"It's easier if you come see it,\" the sailor said.\n\nThey hopped in a Jeep and head up the hill toward one of the Quonset huts, the one where liquor for the officers' clubs was stored. As they walked toward it, Langdell reeled at an odor. Alcohol.\n\nInside, he found broken bottles scattered in a soggy soup of booze and cardboard. Someone had stacked the boxes too high and in the humid environment of the island, the cardboard had grown damp and weak.\n\nThe boxes had collapsed.\n\nLangdell was discharged at the war's end and returned to Massachusetts, where his wife, Libby, waited.\n\nJoe had met Elizabeth McGauhy in Chicago half a decade earlier. He was attending midshipman's school at Northwestern University. She was attending an art academy to learn dress designing. They met at a dance at the YWCA on North State Street.\n\nThey danced. They went out for coffee afterward. They continued to see each other and, when Langdell left for Hawaii, they corresponded, often.\n\nAs he prepared for his new posting on the Frazier, Langdell decided to make a move. He asked his brother, Ted, to visit Libby and see if she could cook. The report: Oh, yes, she can cook.\n\nJoe proposed and Libby accepted. They would be married in San Francisco, before the Frazier set sail. The only question was how Langdell would send Libby word about his arrival from Pearl Harbor. The Navy censors would never allow such information in a letter.\n\nLangdell knew Libby was friends with a skater in the Ice Follies, which was summering in San Francisco. He wrote Libby a letter and suggested it would be a good idea if Libby visited her friend on or about a particular date. Libby got the message.\n\nThey were married in an Episcopal Church on Van Ness Avenue. Langdell had borrowed a car, a Dusenburg, for the honeymoon. Libby had arranged stays north of the city. Friends told them when the left the church, keep the water on their left.\n\nWhat they didn't count on was the side-street parking. Langdell took a right turn instead of a left and the newlyweds didn't realize their mistake until they stopped for gas in Gilroy, about 80 miles south of San Francisco.\n\nThe Langdells ended up honeymooning in Monterey and Carmel on the central California coast.\n\nAfter the war, Langdell returned to the family auction business in Massachusetts, but after all those years in Hawaii, the Philippines and in the tropical South Seas, he couldn't readjust to the cold. He and Libby moved west to Walnut Creek east of San Francisco.\n\nThey eventually bought a home-furnishings outlet farther inland and finally built their own store in Yuba City, north of Sacramento. They ran Joe and Libby Langdell's Village Mart for more than 20 years until they retired.\n\nOccasionally, they would close the store and hook a 33-foot trailer to a pick-up truck. They traveled around the country, meeting up with other USS Arizona survivors, with shipmates from the Frazier. Keeping the memories alive.\n\nLangdell returned to Pearl Harbor in 1976. His oldest son had joined the Navy and his first posting was aboard the USS Ouellet, a frigate. The family visited the Arizona memorial and toured other sites near the harbor.\n\nBefore the trip, Langdell hadn't talked much about his years in the war, about his time on the Arizona. Afterward, Langdell sought out other survivors who had formed reunion organizations. He was active in those groups for many years, serving as president of one devoted to the Arizona.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of the attack neared, Langdell got a call from a documentary filmmaker. He wanted to interview Langdell for his project. He was also interviewing a Japanese pilot named Zenji Abe, a pilot who had taken part in the raid on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Would Langdell agree to meet Abe on film?\n\nThe two men not only met, they took a boat to the USS Arizona memorial and laid a wreath in front of the wall with the names of the crewmen who died on the ship.\n\nIn the documentary, \"The Life and Death of a Lady,\" Langdell and Abe speak, side by side on the memorial. Abe offered condolences and said he prayed that all their souls were at peace.\n\nLangdell said much more.\n\n\"It is only by the grace of God that I stand here today,\" he said. \"I witnessed your attack from Ford Island. Helpless, I watched your bomb sink the Arizona in nine minutes.\"\n\nSentiment ran high against the Japanese, he said, but also against U.S. leaders whose decisions many questioned in the aftermath. He acknowledged the wreath.\n\n\"I appreciate your thoughtfulness. It took more courage on your part to present this wreath than it did for me to accept it.\"\n\nIn 2006, Langdell walked along the steep shoreline of Ford Island, the Arizona memorial in the background. He told his story as his son, Ted, recorded it on video.\n\n\"The lesson I've learned from that experience is that the 1,177 men entombed on the ship right now will never know the love of a wife or the joy of grandchildren,\" he said. \"It's just not going to happen. We all have to remember that they did not die in vain.\"\n\nOn Oct. 12, Langdell celebrated his 100th birthday with with his older son, John, who flew in from Spearfish, S.D. On Veteran's Day, he participated once more in a parade through Marysville, the next town over from Yuba City. But he doesn't tell his story anymore, not on his own.\n\nLangdell lives now in a skilled nursing center. He has trouble remembering the past. He struggles to speak at times (though when he's feeling good, he likes to flirt with the nurses). He sits in his wheelchair as his son recites the narrative, keeping his father's story alive.\n\nPhotographs hang on the walls of his room. His wife, Libby, who died two years ago. His kids and grandkids. Pictures of past parades. A framed painting of the Arizona, the repair ship Vestal next to it.\n\nHe likes to wear a cap that identifies him as a veteran of the Arizona.\n\n\"Why do you like the hat, dad?\" Ted asks.\n\n\"It acknowledges to people that I'm a survivor,\" Joe replies, his voice soft. \"The hat represents the Arizona.\n\nTed asks him about the ship.\n\n\"The Arizona was a fighting battleship,\" Joe says. \"One of the last ones…\" He talks about going aboard the Frazier.\n\nLangdell will return to the Arizona once more. When he dies, his remains will be interred under the No. 4 gun turret, with the men who died there and survivors who had died since.\n\nA final tribute.\n\nUPDATE: Joe Langdell died in February 2015, months after this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/memphis200/2019/04/17/memphis-bicentennial-history-trivia/3301701002/", "title": "Memphis Bicentennial: Here are 200 Bluff City historical facts", "text": "Memphis — the city established on the bluffs of the Mississippi River and named after an ancient capital on the Nile delta — turns 200 this year.\n\nIn recognition of this bicentennial, here are 200 markers along the road of history that led to the present day.\n\nThe events cited range from the comic to the tragic, from the risible to the world-shaking, from the all-but-forgotten to the never-to-be-forgotten. But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T. Barnum.\n\n12. 1852: Construction of St. Peter's Catholic Church begins.\n\n13. 1853: The first synagogue in Tennessee, B'nai Israel, is established by Jewish German immigrants. In 1943 it adopts its current name: Temple Israel.\n\n14. July 15, 1853: Elmwood Cemetery opens for business, so to speak, when the late Mrs. R.B. Berry is laid to rest as its first occupant. The 75,000 interred since then have included slaves, suffragists, yellow fever victims and author Shelby Foote.\n\n15. \"May God bless Memphis, the noblest city on the face of the earth.” — Mark Twain, in an 1858 letter to his sister, after visiting the Memphis hospital where his brother Henry was taken after a steamboat explosion that took \"hundreds of lives.\"\n\n16. June 6, 1862: The Mississippi River churns as Union gunboats defeat Confederate naval forces at the first Battle of Memphis.\n\n17. Also June 6, 1862: To avoid \"Yankee\" takeover, the presses and plates of the pro-Confederacy newspaper, The Appeal, are loaded into a boxcar and moved to Grenada, Mississippi, where the newspaper resumes publication. Keeping one step ahead of Union confiscators, The Appeal later journeys to Jackson, Mississippi; Meridian, Mississippi; Atlanta; Montgomery, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia.\n\n18. Aug. 21, 1864: Nathan Bedford Forrest's troops raid the Union-occupied city but ultimately withdraw; this incursion becomes known as the second Battle of Memphis.\n\n19. Bright kid, promising future: In 1865, 18-year-old Thomas Edison works as a telegraph operator in Memphis.\n\n20. April 27, 1865: The greatest maritime disaster in U.S. history occurs on the Mississippi River at Memphis when the boilers of the overloaded Sultana explode. Close to 1,800 of the 2,400 people aboard the 260-foot wooden steamboat are killed or drowned (about 50 more than will be lost in the sinking of the Titanic). The boat's legal capacity was 376.\n\n21. Forty-six black people and two white people are killed when white civilians and police officers rampage through black neighborhoods for two days of mob violence, May 1-3, 1866. The event becomes known as the \"Memphis Massacre.\"\n\n22. 1869: The foundation stone is laid for Beale Street Baptist Church (also known as First Baptist Church — Beale Street), a congregation organized by freed slaves.\n\n23. The city's oldest degree-granting collegiate institution, Christian Brothers University, is established in 1871 (as Christian Brothers College) by members of a Catholic congregation founded by France's St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the patron saint for \"teachers of youth.\"\n\n24. 1875: Walter Burke Sr. opens the original Burke's Book Store at 180 N Main. Now located at 936 Cooper, the store has remained independent and Memphis-owned ever since.\n\n25. Jan. 15, 1877, becomes known as \"The Day It Rained Snakes.\" According to newspaper reports that inspired an investigation by Scientific American, a \"torrential downpour\" left behind great numbers of snakes in the area of Vance and Lauderdale. The Monthly Weather Review reported the snakes were dark brown or black and \"very thick in some places, being tangled together like a mass of thread or yarn.\" Whether the reptiles were driven from subterranean hiding places or deposited on the Bluff City via some sort of storm-driven snakenado remains a mystery.\n\n26. Aug. 13, 1878: Restaurant owner Kate Bionda becomes the city's first recorded victim of yellow fever, having contracted the disease from a man who had escaped a quarantined steamboat.

Wells moves to Memphis in 1882 at the age of 20. A few years later, she launches her anti-lynching campaign through her newspaper, the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight.\n\n28. Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl. She hails from Memphis, Tenn. She is not going back there just now, because the white people are anxious to hang her up by the neck in the market place, and burn the soles of her feet, and gouge her beautiful dark eyes out with red-hot irons.'' — The London Sun, 1894.\n\n29. An estimated 50 men, women and children, are killed on March 30, 1882, when a broken lantern causes a fire aboard the steamer Golden City, as the boat is about to dock.

On Oct. 15, 1887, Grover Cleveland becomes the first president to visit Memphis while in office. Thousands lined the streets (and were infiltrated by gangs of pickpockets, according to The Commercial Appeal), but the joy gives way to shock when a prominent local citizen, Judge Henry T. Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32. A Memphis community designed expressly for black residents, Orange Mound — named for the area's many Osage orange trees — begins to be developed in 1890, on former plantation property.

In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902. Although she \"dashed to the floor a glass of liquor just as a thirsty person was turning it down his throat,\" according to The Commercial Appeal, she delivered tongue-lashings and temperance lectures instead of her so-called \"hatchetations.\"\n\n39. 1906: One of Memphis' most influential citizens, Robert R.

It is 8 mph.\n\n43. Edward Hull Crump is elected mayor of Memphis in 1909.

May 8, 1925: Immortalized as \"a very worthy Negro\" on an obelisk in the park that bears his name, 39-year-old levee worker Tom Lee — who could not swim — makes four trips in his small skiff, the Zev, to rescue 32 of the 72 people in danger of drowning in the swift currents of the Mississippi after the 1925 sinking of the M.E. Norman, a steamboat. Lee's effort remains Memphis' most famous act of heroism.\n\n52. \"The Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel,\" journalist David Cohn wrote in 1935.

Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing. It is a barbaric symphony of passion and hatred, spilling from a blood-tinted screen. It is mental and physical putrefaction.\"\n\n57. Aviator Charles Lindbergh, 25, visits Memphis in October 1927, some five months after his solo flight across the Atlantic makes him one of the world's most celebrated men.

The city acquired the property after Saunders went bankrupt.\n\n62. Insurance statistician Frederick L. Hoffman on March 20, 1930, issues a report declaring Memphis the murder capital of America, based on the 1929 homicide rate. Memphians object, pointing out that Chicago, for example, had hosted the \"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\" that same year.\n\n63. 1932: Duck decoys placed in the ornate Italian marble fountain of The Peabody prove so popular that the hotel institutes a tradition of live ducks in the lobby. Edward D. Pembroke becomes \"duckmaster\" in 1940 and keeps the job until 1991, ensuring that the chatty mallards — who waddle the elevator-to-fountain red carpet twice daily — remain Memphis' most popular runway models.\n\n64. The bootlegging and kidnapping gangster career of former Central High School student George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly comes to an end when the FBI's first Public Enemy No. 1 is arrested on Sept. 26, 1933, at 1408 Rayner.

Ice Ice Baby: According to \"Memphis: A Folk History,\" by Linton Weeks, the \"first wedding between two people encased in ice'' occurs during the 1935 Cotton Carnival when a pair of circus performers — Freezo, the Human Polar Bear, and Ginger, the Guillotine Girl — are sealed in cakes of ice with microphones that allow them to broadcast \"I-I-I d-d-d-do.\"\n\n66. A globe-trotting Indiana Jones of the 1920s and '30s whose adventures spellbound millions of newspaper readers, Memphian Richard Halliburton (namesake of Halliburton Tower on the Rhodes College campus) disappears in 1939 while attempting to cross the Pacific Ocean in a Chinese junk.\n\n67. 1934: Written by local political leader George Washington Lee, \"Beale Street: Where the Blues Began\" becomes the first book by a black author to be a Book-of-the-Month Club selection.\n\n68. 1937: The Goldsmith's department store on Main Street becomes one of the first major Memphis stores to adopt \"all-the-year-round air-conditioning,\" in the form of an old-school refrigeration system installed by an ice company.\n\n69. 1939: Memphis Light, Gas and Water is born after the city purchases a private electrical system, to augment its 37-years-earlier purchase of a private water delivery system.\n\n70. 1940: Struggling entertainer Amos Muzyad Yakhoob Kairouz — known professionally as Danny Thomas — enters a church in Detroit, falls to his knees, and prays \"specifically\" to St. Jude Thaddeus. \"If he was supposed to be the saint of the hopeless, that certainly included me,\" Thomas wrote in his autobiography. \"I blurted out those words, 'Help me to find my way in life, and I'll build you a shrine.'\" Twenty-two years later, Thomas — by then a top TV and nightclub star — founds St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, which becomes the world's leading institute in the battle against childhood cancer.\n\n71. The notorious \"Goat Gland Doctor,\" John Romulus Brinkley, earns a fortune and international fame by transplanting the testicular glands of goats into the testicule sacs of men, to restore the recipient's \"potency.\" Buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Brinkley lives much of his life in Memphis, but performs most of his quackery in Kansas; he is bankrupted by lawsuits a few years before his 1941 death.\n\n72.

A decade after TV came to New York, it arrives in Memphis when WMC — then co-owned by The Commercial Appeal — signs on the air on Dec. 11, 1948. After an hour of test patterns, dedications, political proclamations and backstage tours, the \"entertainment\" programming begins with Santa Claus, live on the air, reading letters from kids.

A mere satellite compared to the nuclear furnace of Sun, Cordell Jackson's Moon Records label in 1956 releases Jackson's double-sided holiday single, \"Rock and Roll Christmas,\" backed by \"Beboppers' Christmas.\" The latter song contains perhaps the most memorable introduction of St. Nick since Clement Moore's: \"He had white fuzz all over his chin/ He came boppin' up and said, 'Give me some skin.'\"\n\n78. Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage? It is certainly smooth and damp-looking, but who ever heard of a 172-pound sausage, 6 feet tall? Is it a Walt Disney goldfish? It has the same sort of big, soft beautiful eyes and curly lashes, but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns?\"\n\n79. Known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip, movie cowboy Lash LaRue is arrested for buying and concealing stolen property — sewing machines — in connection with car thefts that occur while he is a \"Wild West\" performer at the 1956 Mid-South Fair. Acquitted of the charges, LaRue returns to Memphis frequently in the 1970s and '80s as a guest of the nostalgia-oriented Memphis Film Festival.

Sugarmon Jr., the future General Sessions judge. Sputnik was fined $26.\n\n82.

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins. During its late-1960s heyday, the Merrymobile company operates dozens of the iconic vehicles, which — with their striped canopy roofs — resemble circus tents or fairground carousels on wheels.\n\n90.

Opening night movies include \"The Glass Bottom Boat,\" with Doris Day, and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.\"\n\n97. 1967: Inspired by Oakland's Black Panthers, young Memphis militants organize a \"black power\" group called the Invaders.

About a dozen Memphis and Shelby County library titles — including \"Valley of the Dolls,\" \"Myra Breckenridge\" and \"Portnoy's Complaint\" — are placed off limits to readers under 18 in the summer of 1969 after Mayor Henry Loeb attended a library board meeting and \"shooed all women out of the room and read aloud passages he had underlined in red ink\" from \"Portnoy,\" according to The Commercial Appeal.

The controversial pedestrian-mall project is intended to restore Downtown's luster, but longtime merchants complain that the elimination of street parking kills their business.\n\n123. 1975: Through the coordination of Catholic Charities, refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos begin to resettle in Memphis in earnest, following the April \"fall of Saigon.\"\n\n124. In what comes to be regarded as a revolutionary moment in the history of photography, an exhibit of color work by William Eggleston goes on display on May 24, 1976, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, establishing the Memphis photographer as arguably the Bluff City's most influential artist outside the realm of music.\n\n125. Nov. 23, 1976: A pistol-toting and inebriated Jerry Lee Lewis is arrested after pulling up to the gates of Graceland in a new Lincoln Continental and demanding to see Elvis. Mugshots show an injury to the singer's nose that apparently resulted from a rebounding champagne bottle that Jerry Lee had tried to hurl out a rolled-up window.\n\n126. 1977: Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks of Memphis becomes national executive director of the NAACP.\n\n127. Jan. 15, 1977: Three months after hitting No. 1 with his novelty dance hit \"Disco Duck,\" Memphis deejay Rick Dees — recording as \"Rick Dees and His Cast of Idiots\" — releases a follow-up single, \"Dis-Gorilla.\" Even an appearance on \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" that finds Dees introduced by the kids from \"What's Happening!!\" and performing in front of a pair of swinging King Kong arms couldn't lift the song above No. 56 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\n128. The Memphis in May International Festival is organized in 1977. The first \"honored country\" is Japan.\n\n129. Out of office less than five months, former president Gerald Ford sinks a hole-in-one during the June 1977 pro-am portion of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic golf tournament at Colonial Country Club. (The shot made up for a past tournament, when one of Ford's errant balls beaned a spectator.)\n\n130. Aug. 16, 1977: Elvis Presley dies at 42.\n\n131. A trio of apparent would-be grave robbers said to be plotting to burgle Elvis' body from Forest Hill Cemetery are arrested on Aug. 29, 1977, when one of them turns FBI informant.

Nov. 15, 1977: Memphis-based \"Woolly Bully\" creator Sam the Sham releases \"The Wookie,\" a \"Star Wars\"-inspired would-be dance hit that celebrates Han Solo's furry sidekick, Chewbacca. Sample lyric: \"Not too many things can bend him out of shape/ His mama must have come from the Planet of the Apes.\"\n\n133. Hundreds of National Guardsmen are assigned to Memphis in the summer of 1978 after police officers and firefighters go on strike. On July 1, 1,400 firefighters walk off the job; that same day, 45 fires occur in four hours, inspiring a front-page editorial in The Commercial Appeal: \"The rash of vandalism and harassment that accompanied the strike is contrary to the public image of Memphis firemen. It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention. A charismatic and telegenic preacher, Rogers is a leader in the denomination's \"conservative resurgence,\" which emphasizes a fundamentalist interpretation of the Bible.\n\n135. Known for pastel-colored playful postmodern furniture and ceramics, an internationally influential affiliation of Italian designers in 1980 dubs itself \"The Memphis Group,\" in homage to the Bob Dylan song, \"Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again.\"\n\n136. July 13, 1980: Memphis experiences what remains its record high temperature: 108 degrees.\n\n137. After Mayor Wyeth Chandler resigns from office in 1982 to accept a Circuit Court judgeship, City Council member J.O. Patterson Jr. is named interim mayor — making him the city's first black mayor. (W.W. Herenton does not become the first elected black mayor until 10 years later.)\n\n138. Graceland opens to the public on July 7, 1982 — less than five years after Elvis' death. It is now the second most-visited home in the U.S., after the White House.\n\n139. Distraught over the death of his 8-year-old son, who had been treated for leukemia at the hospital, a marijuana-smoking and .357 Magnum-wielding French-Canadian, John Claude Goulet, 40, takes a pediatrician, a nurse, a psychiatrist and a psychologist hostage inside an office at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The 34-hour siege ends when police storm the office and kill Goulet on Feb. 5, 1982.\n\n140. St. Agnes student Leslie Marie Gattas, 15, is rescued March 18, 1982, from an attic hideaway at Christ United Methodist Church, where her kidnapper, Ernest Stubblefield, had kept her for 119 days.\n\n141. April 5, 1982: Wrestler Jerry Lawler \"injures\" comedian/wrestler Andy Kaufman with a \"piledriver\" move at the Mid-South Coliseum, a highlight of a still much talked-about feud that reaches its apex in July when Lawler slaps Kaufman's face on \"Late Night with David Letterman.\"\n\n142. January 1983: The \"Shannon Street\" tragedy leaves seven suspects dead after police storm a North Memphis house and kill all occupants, following the torture death of a police officer, Robert S. Hester, 34, who had been held hostage in the house.\n\n143. The city's daily evening newspaper, the distinctively named Memphis Press-Scimitar, publishes its final edition on Halloween 1983. The paper had operated as the Press-Scimitar since the 1926 merger of two competing evening dailies, The News Scimitar and the Memphis Press.\n\n144. Memphis State University football coach Rex Dockery, 41, and three others — freshman defensive back Charles Greenhill, offensive coordinator Chris Faros and booster Glenn Jones — are killed Dec. 12, 1983, in a small plane crash while en route to a speaking engagement in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee.\n\n145. Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance. When the witch appears onstage, MASH members in the audience — mostly dancers at \"adult\" nightclubs — remove their tops. The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club. Newspaper stories promise that the coinage \"will soon grace billboards, newspaper advertisements and possibly airwaves.\" Memphis boosters are asked to use the phrase as often as possible. It is never heard of again.\n\n149. Oct. 30, 1983: Founded in 1901, Bellevue Baptist Church votes to leave its longtime Midtown location and relocate to a Cordova campus, where it expands to \"megachurch\" proportions.\n\n150. \"While most of us were stuffing ourselves with turkey,\" The Commercial Appeal reports on Nov. 25, 1983, \"a pair of armed, Halloween-masked gunmen pulled off the largest robbery in Memphis history, stealing an estimated $2 million from the Wells Fargo building on Monroe.\"\n\n151. Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993. In The Commercial Appeal, critic Fredric Koeppel writes that the Arkansas-born Cloar \"drew on memories of rural life to compose canvases whose realism was tempered with touches of whimsy, folklore and mystery.\" Many of Cloar's paintings are on display at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.\n\n169. Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet. This is the humble origin of what is now the region's largest film event, the Indie Memphis Film Festival.\n\n174. Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals. Columnist Geoff Calkins calls it \"the first day of the rest of our baseball lives.\"\n\n175. 2001: A community gathering place and headquarters for the Memphis Public Libraries system, the new five-story $70 million \"main library\" opens at 3030 Poplar, replacing the old central library at Peabody and McLean. It is renamed the Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library in 2005.\n\n176. Ben Affleck, Michael Jordan and Donald Trump are among the 15,327 who reportedly attend the Mike Tyson-Lennox Lewis heavyweight boxing match at the Pyramid on June 8, 2002. Lewis knocks out Tyson in the 8th round in what at the time was the highest-grossing event in pay-per-view history.\n\n177. In 2002, former Shelby County Public Defender A C Wharton is elected the first black mayor of Shelby County. In 2009, he is elected the 63rd mayor of Memphis, but he loses his 2015 re-election bid to Jim Strickland.\n\n178. During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181. His fur was brown and shaggy, his belly was round and saggy: A slobby Everybear, the original version of Grizz, the Memphis Grizzlies mascot, is retired for the current blue-furred Superbear when the team moves from the Pyramid to FedExForum in 2004.\n\n182. A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184. March 5, 2006: Thirty-four years after Stax legend Isaac Hayes earned an Oscar in the same category for \"Theme from Shaft,\" Memphis hip-hop artists Jordan Houston (Juicy J), Paul Beauregard (DJ Paul) and Cedric Coleman (Frayser Boy) win the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" their contribution to writer-director Craig Brewer's made-in-Memphis \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n185. Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W. Bush. \"Hold me close, hold me tight,\" sang Koizumi, as he put his arm around Elvis' daughter, Lisa Marie Presley.\n\n186. An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat. Reports of the marine mammal's meanderings transfixed Memphians for several days, but the docile creature eluded capture and came to a sad end: It was found dead in December in McKellar Lake.\n\n187. Farewell to the Ape Girl, water-skiing squirrels and a life-sized Dolly Parton sculpted from butter: The last Mid-South Fair at the old Fairgrounds is held in 2008.\n\n188. A second printing of more than 40,000 copies quickly disappears as Memphians descend on The Commercial Appeal offices on Nov. 5, 2008, seeking souvenir editions of the newspaper that reported Barack Obama's presidential victory with a front-page headline that proclaimed \"Yes He Did\" — a play on the Obama campaign slogan, \"Yes We Can.\"\n\n189. Sept. 22, 2009: Memphis Mayor Pro Tem Myron Lowery greets the Dalai Lama with a fist bump and the comment: \"I've always wanted to say, 'Hello, Dalai!'\"\n\n190. Crews in January 2010, dismantle Elvis' favorite roller coaster, the 80-year-old Zippin Pippin, marking a definitive end to decades of amusement park rides at the Fairgrounds.

April 9, 2011: Funeral services are held for former University of Memphis basketball player and coach Larry Finch, 60, arguably the most significant sports figure in local history. Finch led Memphis State to the 1973 NCAA title game against victorious UCLA that — however briefly — united the city.\n\n192. After a decade of planning, Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid opens to the public on April 29, 2015, bringing camo boots, duck decoys and live gators to the 14-year-old pyramid-shaped arena that had hosted the Tigers, Grizzlies, Bruce Springsteen and Prince.\n\n193. May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196. According to city records, there currently are about 9,850 street names in Memphis, including Saint Nick Drive and North Pole Cove; Elvis Presley Boulevard and Elvis Cove; Danny Thomas Boulevard and Uncle Remus Road; Nottingham Place, Maid Marian Lane, Friar Tuck Road, Robin Hood Lane and Zorro Cove; Nightingale Drive, Parrot Cove, Parakeet Road and Mockingbird Lane; Panda Lane, Otter Drive and Doberman Cove; and, perplexingly, Sea Shore Road.\n\n197. Long distance information, give me Memphis, Missouri: Memphis, Tennessee, population 646,889 (according to the 2010 Census), may be the biggest Memphis in the United States, but it isn't the only one. Some others include Memphis, Florida, pop. 7,848; Memphis, Texas, 2,290; Memphis, Missouri, 1,822; Memphis, Nebraska, 114; Memphis, Mississippi, 70; and Memphis, Alabama, which, according to a 2017 estimate, has 28 residents.\n\n198.

In recognition of this year's 150th anniversary of The Peabody, chefs at Chez Philippe created a $150 burger. The patty is between a brioche bun, and is accessorized with butter-poached lobster, caramelized onion, Saint-André cheese, huckleberry aioli and Parmesan black truffle fries.\n\n200. Meanwhile, the 67-year-old Tops Bar-B-Q chain gets new owners, a partnership group announces April 2.

Besides the standard pledges of tax cuts or a slimmed down state, there has also been an enthusiastic promotion of anti-trans positions, potentially marking an intensification of the current government’s “war on woke.”\n\nLeading the pack of hopefuls is Rishi Sunak, Britain’s former Chancellor of the Exchequer whose resignation from the government last week contributed to the resignation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson. After the second round of voting among Conservative Party lawmakers earlier this month, Sunak topped the list of the five candidates who remain in the running.\n\nOne of Sunak’s first policy pledges, after he announced his intention to run, was protecting “women’s rights,” he wrote in a Twitter post, linking to an article in which an unnamed Sunak ally was quoted as saying the lawmaker was “critical of recent trends to erase women via the use of clumsy, gender-neutral language.”\n\nSunak will create a manifesto, this ally told British tabloid the Daily Mail, that will oppose trans women competing in women’s sport and “will call on schools to be more careful in how they teach on issues of sex and gender.”\n\nRishi Sunak, who won the first two rounds of the Conservative leadership contest, will oppose trans women competing in women's sport in his manifesto, an ally told the Daily Mail. Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Johnson-led government leaned into culture war issues during the pandemic as it attempted to play to its traditional, southern Conservative Party base and new northern English voters won over from the center-left opposition Labour party in the 2019 general election. Even if polling suggests culture war issues, like trans rights, do not preoccupy the day-to-day lives of the British public, many of the candidates have taken up the government’s mantle, staking their positions in the debate over sex and gender identity.\n\nOver the past week, Conservative candidates are more likely to have been asked “what is a woman” by British journalists than to have been tripped up by more traditional questions, like the cost of a pint of milk. On Wednesday, Sunak’s biggest rival in the race, the once relatively little-known junior minister Penny Mordaunt, was asked if she would continue with culture war issues like trans rights.\n\n“Let me deal with the issue floating around in the background. It was (former UK Prime Minister) Margaret Thatcher who said that ‘every Prime Minister needs a Willie,’” Mordaunt said in reference to Thatcher’s deputy, William “Willie” Whitelaw. “A woman like me doesn’t have one,” she added.\n\nMordaunt has spent a lot of time this week rowing back on her past pro-trans views. She told online newspaper Pink News in 2018, for example, that “trans women are women.”\n\nIn a 10-part Twitter thread posted last Sunday, Mordaunt u-turned, stressing that trans women might be legally female by law but “that DOES NOT mean they are biological women, like me.” She added: “I am biologically a woman. If I have a hysterectomy or mastectomy, I am still a woman. And I am legally a woman.”\n\nPenny Mordaunt has come under fire for walking back on her statement that \"trans women are women.\" Hollie Adams/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDescriptors like “biological woman” are considered slurs by trans advocates when they are deployed by gender critical activists, who believe the sex one is assigned with at birth is immutable, and any rights or privileges associated with it cannot be extended to those who choose to identify as that gender.\n\nThe repeated misgendering of trans people in the public sphere is not only harmful to their wellbeing, but suggesting gender does not exist and that a person is the sum total of their reproductive organs is reductive, erasing the existence of trans and non-binary people, say advocates.\n\nYet these gender critical views, parroted by a largely sympathetic British press, have helped restrict efforts to broaden trans rights, say campaigners. This includes trans people potentially being left out of plans for a ban on conversion therapy, and the Conservative-led government scrapping efforts to make it easy for trans people to change their gender marker without medical requirements.\n\n“Not in my adult lifetime can I remember a situation where in a leadership election or selection process, there’s been this amount of focus on LGBTQ+ rights measures,” Nancy Kelley, chief executive of LGBTQ rights group Stonewall, told CNN.\n\nThe British public is more tolerant than some politicians or the press care to acknowledge, she said. “I think it’s part of a wider phenomenon that we’re experiencing in the UK where we have really progressive, positive public attitudes to lesbian, gay, bi and trans people, but we’ve got plenty of media and political conversation quite obsessively talking about trans people, and largely in a negative way,” Kelley said.\n\n‘Disproportionate and scary’\n\nStonewall CEO Nancy Kelley told CNN \"negative\" media and political rhetoric surrounding trans people in the UK is at odds with \"positive public attitudes\" to LGBTQ+ rights. Tim P. Whitby/Getty Images\n\nA study by think tank More in Common, published in June, found that “few Britons spend very much of their time thinking about issues of gender identity.” It added that in focus group conversations “most Britons, even those who are opposed to trans people using single-sex spaces, look for common sense ways of handling issues around changing rooms and toilets that involve being aware of people and treating one another with respect.”\n\nAlmost every focus group participant “asked why there were not also now more unisex toilet options available, which seemed for many to be a practical solution to the issue of single-sex spaces,” it wrote.\n\nWhat is dominating public discourse is the state of the UK economy, where inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1% in May, the highest among the G7 leading economies – and is forecast to climb above 11% later this year despite a series of interest rate hikes. The country is in the worst cost-of-living crisis in decades, forcing households to choose between eating or heating this winter amid no real wage growth for over a decade, say economists.\n\n“We’ve got major cost-of-living crisis, we are facing down a global climate emergency, there is war in Ukraine… (and we are) dealing with the aftermath of Brexit – the fact that the media are asking so obsessively about (trans) issues, and candidates are all being expected to pronounce their views on trans people’s place in society is so disproportionate and scary,” for a group that only accounts for an estimated 0.6% of the population, Kelley said.\n\nWhile Liz Truss has avoided culture war issues in her bid for Conservative party leader, her allies have positioned her against Penny Mordaunt's pro-trans record. Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTransphobia might not be an electorally viable strategy, but that has not stopped this year’s leadership hopefuls.\n\nForeign Secretary Liz Truss, who placed third in the second round of voting, has been vocal in her opposition to making it easier for trans people to change their gender markers in England and Wales. While she steered clear of culture wars issues in her leadership speech on Thursday, her allies have been briefing against Mordaunt’s pro-trans record.\n\nBehind Truss was former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch, a spirited culture wars proponent who warned in 2020 that teaching “critical race theory as fact” would be against the law. There is no evidence however that schools have been doing that. Vice News reported this week that Badenoch urged the country’s financial services regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), to drop its policy on trans inclusion.\n\nBadenoch’s spokesperson did not deny the allegation, telling CNN in a statement that “In response to a FCA consultation, and in her capacity as Equalities Minister, Kemi wrote to the FCA on how they could comply with the Equality Act and improve the representation of women on city boards.”\n\nAt the conservative think tank Policy Exchange, where Badenoch launched her leadership campaign on Tuesday, journalists noted handwritten signs scrawled in black ink with the words “men” and “ladies” taped to the doors of gender-neutral toilets.", "authors": ["Tara John"], "publish_date": "2022/07/17"}]}

I was just telling myself, ‘OK, I will go to the right,’ and then I took a chance and it was good for us, it was the right side.”\n\nHjelmseth saved two penalties in her last shootout – the semifinal of the 2013 European Championship.\n\nWORLD CUP CENTRAL: 2023 Women's World Cup Live Scores, Schedules, Standings, Bracket and More\n\n“That was a good one,” she said. “I think when you’re a goalie you can only be a hero so it’s just about picking a side and just finding the right timing to go so you don’t get the VAR stuff.”\n\nNorway will face the winner of Sunday’s game between England and Cameroon.\n\nThe shootout came after a game during which neither team had a clear advantage, though Norway succeeded in keeping Australia’s Kerr from being much of factor. Kerr had a goal ruled out in the second half after offside was called. Australia also had two penalties denied on video review in normal time.\n\nThe game went to extra time after Australia’s Elise Kellond-Knight scored from a corner to make it a 1-1 game in the 83rd minute.\n\nForward Isabell Herlovsen put Norway up 1-0 with a goal in the 31st.\n\nAustralia had to play the final 16 minutes of extra time at a numerical disadvantage after defender Alanna Kennedy was sent off on a red card for hauling down Norway forward Lisa-Marie Utland. Norway peppered Australia’s goal but was repeatedly denied by goalkeeper Lydia Williams.\n\n“It was tough,” Kerr said. “A lot of the girls had already played a lot of minutes so we were already running on empty and then obviously Alanna getting sent off is not ideal but we stuck together. We were still confident and believing in each other but it just didn’t come off tonight.”\n\nKerr ended the tournament tied with American Alex Morgan for the most goals at five.\n\n“Only big players can miss penalties, because small players don’t take them,” coach Ante Milicic said when asked what he told Kerr after the match.\n\nAustralia was thwarted in its attempt to reach the quarterfinals for a fourth straight time.\n\n“This team had high expectations and goals coming into this tournament so to go out this way it was pretty rough and I haven’t really wrapped my head around it I don’t think,” said defender Steph Catley, who had Australia’s only successful penalty kick during the shootout. “Doesn’t really feel like we’re out if that makes sense.

Sara Däbritz made it 2-0 in the 27th with a penalty kick and Lea Schüller got the final goal in the 82nd.\n\nSecond-ranked Germany, which has outscored opponents 9-0, plays the winner of Monday’s match between Sweden and Canada on June 29 at Rennes, a weeklong layoff that gives time for midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsán’s broken toe to heal. The Germans, who won the tournament in 2003 and 2007, have never failed to reach the quarterfinals.\n\nNo. 38 Nigeria was in the knockout phase for the second time, the first since it lost in the quarterfinals to Brazil in 1999, and it joined Cameroon to become the first pair of African teams to reach the knockout stage in the same Women’s World Cup. The Indomitable Lionesses play England on Sunday.\n\nPopp scored on a 4-yard header off Lina Magull’s corner kick, her 48th international goal. A video review upheld the goal after determining Svenja Huth, who was in an offside position, did not obstruct the view of goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie.\n\nDäbritz scored on a low penalty kick beyond the outstretched left hand of Nnadozie, her third goal of the tournament and 13th of her international career. Evelyn Nwabuoko had tried to clear a ball but made a studs-up follow through into Magull, causing the penalty.\n\nNigeria had an excellent chance to cut its deficit in the 50th when second-half substitute Rasheedat Ajibade streaked up a flank and passed to an open Desire Oparanozie, but the ball was just ahead of the forward and rolled by.\n\nSchüller got her ninth international goal following a giveaway by Halimatu Ayinde.\n\nThe Super Falcons were missing defender Ngozi Ebere and midfielder Rita Chikwelu, who served suspensions for yellow card accumulation, and forward Asisat Oshoala, who was injured.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/22"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/961917/england-nigeria-womens-world-cup-lauren-james", "title": "Lionesses dig deep after Lauren James's 'Beckham-esque' red card ...", "text": "BBC commentator Robyn Cowen summed it up as “daylight robbery” as ten-woman England beat Nigeria on penalties to reach the quarter-finals of the Fifa Women’s World Cup. After Lauren James saw red late on in normal time, the last-16 clash in Brisbane finished 0-0 after 120 minutes with the Lionesses progressing after winning 4-2 on spot-kicks.\n\nSarina Wiegman’s European champions were “outplayed by a brilliant Nigeria side”, said Rob Smyth in The Guardian. The Super Falcons created the “best chances” and hit the woodwork twice in the normal 90 minutes. However, after the “mother, father and extended family of scares”, England are through to the quarters where they will face Colombia or Jamaica on Saturday (11.30am BST). They were “outplayed” and “outclassed”, said Suzanne Wrack in The Guardian, but “somehow, somehow, not out”.\n\n‘Moment of madness’\n\n“Talk about digging deep,” said Phil Dawkes on BBC Sport. England were “staring down the barrel” of a World Cup exit after being “second best” to Nigeria. But “once again, the Lionesses find a way” and “when the dust settles” they’ll realise they “got out of jail” because they “did not play well”.\n\nEngland played with 10 women through extra time after Chelsea star James was red-carded for an “ill-tempered stamp” on the back of Michelle Alonzi after the two “went down in a tangled heap”, said Reuters. James, who is England’s top scorer at the World Cup with three goals in the group stage, was “initially given a yellow card for the altercation” in the 87th minute, said Felix Keith on the Daily Mirror, but “VAR intervened” and the card was upgraded to red. She will be given an automatic one-game ban, which “could be extended to three games, meaning that her tournament could be over”.\n\nGoing from “hero to villain”, James’s reckless challenge “brought back memories” of David Beckham being sent off against Argentina at the 1998 men’s World Cup, said Gill Clark on Goal.com. In a tweet, former England striker and football pundit Gary Lineker called it a “Beckhamesque moment of madness” from the Lionesses forward.\n\nEngland ‘have to improve’\n\nWith Germany, Brazil, Canada and holders United States all out, this Women’s World Cup has been described by AP’s James Robson as the “most open” ever. Change is “happening fast” in women’s football and a “levelling of the playing field” is being highlighted at the tournament co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand.\n\nEngland know they will “have to improve” if they want to add the World Cup to their European crown, said WorldFootball.net. But in the end against Nigeria they “found a way, as they so often have under Wiegman”, said Emma Sanders on BBC Sport.

Parents should determine the education of their children. Capitalism lifts people up from poverty. Fossil fuels are requirements for human prosperity, and that even as extreme weather happens more often, the country should unapologetically burn more coal and oil.\n\n\"What we got to do is close the gap between what people are saying in public and what are willing to say online. We've got to close that gap,\" Ramaswamy said. \"The only way we're gonna do it is to speak openly. Speak the truth. We can handle the truth.\"\n\nHis message has appeared to have found a foothold.\n\nA national average calculated by statistical analysis group FiveThirtyEight.com shows Ramaswamy in third place with 6.7% of support from voters in polls dating back to Aug. 3, behind former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nForbes estimated 37-year-old Ramaswamy has a net worth of $630 million. He opened his campaign this summer by proposing to raise the minimum U.S. voting age from 18 to 25.\n\nSame day:Vivek Ramaswamy raps to Eminem's 'Lose Yourself' at Gov. Kim Reynolds' Fair-Side Chat\n\nMany of the positions advocated by Ramaswamy, author of \"Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,\" are similar to those of DeSantis.\n\nHe also is an avowed admirer of Trump. In a Sioux City appearance in June, he pledged that if elected, he would pardon the former president, after Trump was indicted on 37 counts of illegally keeping national defense documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida, after leaving the White House, and conspiring to obstruct justice by hiding them from federal authorities.\n\nWill Vivek Ramaswamy accept anything other than the presidential nomination?\n\nLarge crowds of people swarmed Ramaswamy as he roamed the fairgrounds, stopping him constantly for pictures or a conversation.\n\nWhile walking in the shade near the Anne & Bill Riley Stage at 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Ramaswamy said he thinks he eventually will overtake DeSantis, leaving himself in a one-on-one battle with Trump.\n\n\"I think the two relevant candidates are going to be pretty quickly Trump and myself,\" Ramaswamy said. \"We're the party of the outsider, and it's going to be a choice between two outsiders with very different attributes.\"\n\nAs Ramaswamy walked between the poultry building and an ice cream stop with Iowa Ag Secretary Mike Naig, several fairgoers asked him if he would accept a potential vice president nomination by Trump.\n\n\"I think I'd be a better president,\" he said while strolling down Grand Avenue around 11 a.m. Saturday.\n\nDuring the Register's Soapbox, a woman asked if he would accept the position of vice president if he didn't secure the GOP nomination, Ramaswamy joked that Donald Trump would do \"pretty well\" as a vice president for him.\n\nDuring a press conference after his Soapbox appearance, Ramaswamy said again said that he is focused on winning the GOP nomination and not securing a cabinet position or a vice-presidential nomination.\n\n\"If I were building a political career, of course, I would do that,\" Ramaswamy said. \"I'm not building a political career. I'm not a politician. I don't do well in a number two position.\"\n\nIowa voter looking for an 'outsider' committed to Ramaswamy\n\nMatt Parks, 40, of Granger, waited at around 9 p.m. Friday for Ramaswamy at a meet and greet at Jalapeño Pete's within the Iowa State Fairgrounds. Parks wore one of Ramaswamy's black \"TRUTH.\" hats.\n\nHe likes candidates who are outsiders like Ramaswamy, Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nCandidate tracker:Where and when are presidential candidates visiting Iowa?\n\nThroughout the summer, many voters have said they like Ramaswamy, but think he is inexperienced and would make a better vice president or presidential cabinet member at the moment. But Parks said he is supporting Ramaswamy for president.\n\n\"He's got an outsider perspective, and maybe like RFK Jr. he can bring something new to the Republican Party,\" Parks said. \"\n\nParks had not seen Ramaswamy speak before. He simply went to hear what the candidate told voters.\n\n\"He's different,\" Parks said. \"He's very persuasive. I don't know who I'd vote for, but I'd drop RFK, Trump and Vivek.\"\n\nKatie Howard, 67, of Ottumwa said she supported Trump in the past. But she is supporting Ramaswamy over Trump because she is worried that the criminal investigations into his conduct could divide the country.\n\n“I’m worried about a four-year vendetta from Trump,\" Howard said. \"I’ve watched what happened since 2020. I don’t like it. I don’t like negativity. I like positive outlooks, and Vivek has got that.”\n\nShe loves Ramaswamy because he, “Is articulate, he is radiant, he actually has a plan,” she said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, a Republican, is declining to endorse a candidate in GOP the field.\n\n\"He clearly brings a ton of positive energy to the campaign trail,\" Nunn said. \"I love the fact that he can talk everything from policy to foreign governance and the answer is literate in technology. I think that goes a long way for whoever is going to be the next leader of the free world.\"\n\nNunn joked that on at Friday's Jalapeno Pete's event, Ramaswamy \"bought a round for all of Des Moines.\" Ramaswamy is engaging many young voters, Nunn said.\n\n\"I'm excited to see that he's bringing out the next generation,\" Nunn said. \"When you get a young generation engaged with a philosophy or a candidate style they like, a lot of them stick with them for their entire life. Talk to anybody my age or older and they'll tell you about the good old days of (Ronald) Reagan.\"\n\nRamaswamy dodges climate questions, focuses on fossil fuels\n\nRamaswamy is a staunch supporter of fossil fuels. In the past, he has called out green energy industries. During Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds’ Fair-Side Chat Saturday morning, Ramaswamy said again,” The climate change industry is a hoax.”\n\nJuly was the hottest month on earth in 120,000 years of recorded history, according to Scientific American. And the 2020 derecho produced peak wind gusts of 140 mph and flattened parts of eastern Iowa including Cedar Rapids.\n\nIowa State Climatologist said after the Dec. 15, 2021, derecho spawned 63 tornadoes — a record for any day in recorded Iowa history — that as the climate warms, extreme weather events are happening more often in Iowa.\n\nIn recent years, Iowa has seen flooding caused by higher-intensity rainfall coupled with droughts. While 2018 was the second-wettest year in 149 years of record-keeping, for example, a drought also gripped southeastern Iowa.\n\n\"We're seeing these conditions co-mingle,\" Glisan said in December 2021.\n\nDuring a press conference after his Soapbox speech, Ramaswamy said that global temperatures are going up by \"a little bit\" and that man-made causes are likely the cause.\n\n\"Is that an existential risk to humanity?\" Ramaswamy asked. \"It is absolutely not.\"\n\nInstead, he said as president, he will embrace fossil fuels.\n\n\"We're abandoning the anti-carbon agenda in this country,\" Ramaswamy said. \"We will drill more, we will frack more, we will burn more coal, we will use ethanol, we will use nuclear energy without apologizing for who we are as Americans.\"\n\nVivek Ramaswamy doubles down on eliminating 'three-letter' organizations\n\nRamaswamy has committed to \"shutting down\" the federal government and eliminating federal agencies like the FBI, IRS and Department of Education. While being interviewed by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds Saturday morning, Ramaswamy committed again to downsizing the federal government.\n\n\"We do face a choice in this primary,\" Ramaswamy said during the Soapbox appearance. \"The choice is this — do you want incremental reform? Or do you want revolutions?\"\n\nAddison Lathers covers growth and development for the Des Moines metro.

Ron DeSantis\n\nFormer U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence\n\nU.S. Sen. Tim Scott\n\nEntrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy\n\nNoticeably missing so far is former President Donald Trump, who has a commanding lead in national polls.\n\nThe event draws hundreds of evangelicals from across the state — perhaps the most influential group in Iowa’s GOP caucuses.\n\nAnd it will follow a week in which the Iowa Legislature will convene a special session to take action on restricting abortion in the state. The candidates will likely discuss the outcome as they seek to win support from this key constituency.\n\nHow to go: Doors open at the Community Choice Credit Union in Des Moines at 8 a.m. The program begins at 9 a.m., and interviews with presidential candidates will be scattered throughout the day-long program. General admission tickets can be purchased on the Family Leader website and cost $99.\n\n‘Operation Top Nunn’ draws DeSantis for veterans-focused event\n\nU.S. Rep. Zach Nunn is hosting his first major congressional fundraiser July 15, the day after the Family Leadership Summit.\n\nIt’s a veterans-focused event he’s calling “Operation Top Nunn: A Salute to the Troops,” a play on the blockbuster “Top Gun” movie franchise. Nunn is a U.S. Air Force veteran.\n\nHeadlining the event are DeSantis and Iowa’s U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, both of whom are also veterans.\n\nIt’s likely to be a smaller event than the major cattle calls, but it gives DeSantis an open stage with a couple of Iowa’s top elected Republicans. And you can bet the national TV crews are likely to stick around after the Family Leadership Summit to catch the action.\n\nHow to go: The event will run from 1-3 p.m. at the Ankeny Regional Airport July 15. Individual tickets cost $24 and can be purchased online. A portion of the ticket sales will go to Iowa veterans charity Salute to the Fallen.\n\nThe Iowa GOP’s Lincoln Dinner draws both Trump and DeSantis\n\nFor the first time in Iowa, the two GOP front-runners will attend the same event.\n\nDeSantis and Trump are set to join 11 others at the Republican Party of Iowa’s annual Lincoln Dinner July 28.\n\nThe two men have repeatedly held dueling Iowa events, creating split-screen moments that all but ensure the media is talking about both of them.\n\nIn March, they attended a pair of events in Davenport scheduled just days apart.\n\nIn May, they were scheduled to attend competing Iowa events, though Trump canceled his planned rally because of inclement weather.\n\nAnd later that month, Trump scheduled a Fox News town hall in Des Moines the day after DeSantis made his first Iowa swing as a declared presidential candidate.\n\nBut Trump has shied away from the group political events that draw multiple speakers, opting instead to attend solo events where he can command the spotlight on his own.\n\nThe Iowa GOP’s Lincoln Dinner will be Trump’s first Iowa cattle call of the year, and it will likely put him and DeSantis in the same room for the first time this cycle.\n\nThe full event lineup includes every declared presidential candidate except for Christie, who has focused his campaigning in New Hampshire.\n\nAccording to the party, Christie wasn’t invited to the Lincoln Dinner because he didn’t meet its main criteria of campaigning in Iowa and hiring staff here.\n\nThe speaker list includes:\n\nTrump\n\nDeSantis\n\nPence\n\nHaley\n\nScott\n\nRamaswamy\n\nHutchinson\n\nRadio personality Larry Elder\n\nBusinessman Perry Johnson\n\nNorth Dakota Gov.

The countdown to Election Day is on, and Republicans hoping to retake control of Congress from Democrats are confronting headwinds in several key races where nominees backed by former President Donald Trump face tough general election fights.\n\nThe November election will also have uniquely far-reaching effects on the context and administration of a 2024 presidential election that could potentially feature a rematch between President Joe Biden and Trump.\n\nDown the ballot, 36 states will elect governors in November, including the five – Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona – that flipped from Trump to Biden in 2020.\n\nThe outcomes of those races, coupled with other down-ballot matchups, could have an outsize effect on the next presidential election as Republicans at the state level continue their push to restrict ballot access and put the tools in place to weaponize future fraud claims.\n\nThe US Supreme Court decision striking down Roe v. Wade has also emboldened Democrats and given the party new hope that it can turn out swing voters and independents with a promise – in both state and federal races – to either protect, expand or, through Congress, renew abortion rights.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are banking on voters’ concerns over the economy, especially inflation, which still ranks as the top issue in most polling, and crime to fuel a backlash to Democrats at all levels.\n\nHere are seven takeaways from more than six months of midterm primaries:\n\nRepublicans entered the 2022 midterm election cycle with economic and historical factors behind their bid to win control of the House and Senate in November. But the GOP’s Senate hopes are being complicated by a handful of candidates in key races struggling to make the switch from primary mode to appealing to the broader general electorate.\n\nThe seeds of the GOP’s struggles were planted early in the cycle, when establishment Republicans missed out on top recruiting targets in several key states. Among their most significant disappointments were the decisions of New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to pass on Senate runs.\n\nTrump endorsed a series of first-time candidates in a handful of races that are likely to decide which party controls the Senate, including Masters in Arizona, Walker in Georgia, venture capitalist and author J.D. Vance in Ohio and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania. All four have struggled since winning their respective primaries, lagging behind their Democratic foes in net approval ratings.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell acknowledged the problems Republican candidates have faced in comments last month at a Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce luncheon.\n\n“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate,” he said. “Candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome.”\n\nInfighting threatens Republicans’ congressional ambitions\n\nRepublicans looking to take control of the Senate should be spending all their time focused on Democrats.\n\nBut those troubled candidates have strained relationships among Senate leadership – namely between Sen. Rick Scott, the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, and McConnell, the top Republican in the legislative body.\n\nFor months, the infighting played out in private, with quiet back biting and second guessing over candidates, strategy and spending. But as the summer dragged on and several Republicans struggled to pivot to the general election, Scott and McConnell’s infighting burst into public.\n\nThe eruption came after McConnell’s August airing of his concerns about “candidate quality,” which Scott did not let go unanswered.\n\n“If you trash talk our candidates … you hurt our chances of winning, and you hurt our candidates’ ability to raise money,” Scott told Politico. “I know they’re good candidates, because I’ve been talking to them and they’re working their butts off.”\n\nThis was not the first fight between Scott and McConnell. After the Florida Republican rolled out a plan that would have raised taxes on low income Americans and sunset Social Security and Medicare in March, which he subsequently revised, McConnell brushed him back, telling reporters, “We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.”\n\nMoney is also at the heart of the dispute. Despite raising $181.5 million through the end of July, the Republican Senate campaign committee only had $23.2 million in the bank at that time, a significant disparity to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee’s $54.1 million despite raising less, $173.1 million, over the same time.\n\nMcConnell-aligned forces have jumped into those races in recent weeks, attempting to bail out candidates whose fundraising has lagged well behind their Democratic rivals with huge injections of television advertising.\n\nHow bad have things become? When Punchbowl News asked McConnell if Scott, who is worth an estimated $260 million, should personally fund part of the Republican campaign committee, the Republican leader said it was an “interesting idea.”\n\nTrump demonstrates his influence in GOP open-seat primaries\n\nThe primary season has demonstrated just how closely the Republican electorate is willing to follow Trump’s lead.\n\nBut it also revealed the limits of Trump’s sway. The former President’s biggest miss came in Georgia, where he failed to purge the party of Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger as retribution for their refusal to support his bogus claims of fraud in the 2020 election. The problem with Trump’s bid for vengeance was that GOP voters were otherwise satisfied with their state officials’ performance.\n\nHowever, open-seat Republican primaries – particularly Senate races – have demonstrated Trump’s dominance.\n\nIn North Carolina, he effectively cleared the way for Rep. Ted Budd to advance without a serious challenge. And in Ohio, his late support for Vance – who was polling in third place at the time – catapulted the “Hillbilly Elegy” to victory.\n\nIn Arizona, Trump’s support and tech mogul Peter Thiel’s money elevated Blake Masters for the Senate nod. There, Trump squared off with his own former vice president, Mike Pence, and term-limited Ducey in the GOP gubernatorial primary. Pence and Ducey backed establishment favorite Karrin Taylor Robson; Trump endorsed former journalist and election denier Kari Lake. Lake – and thus Trump – won.\n\nTrump-backed candidates also ousted four of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach the former President following the insurrection of January 6, 2021 – a purge capped off by Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman’s defeat last month of Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of his loudest critics. (An equal number had declined to run for reelection.)\n\nElection deniers dominate Republican nominations\n\nTrump’s influence has elevated scores of election deniers, loading Republican tickets across the country with candidates who have followed his lie that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nIn some states, the entire Republican ticket is Trump backed and election denying, like Arizona, where candidates from Lake, the gubernatorial nominee, to attorney general nominee Abraham Hamadeh have embraced Trump’s lie.\n\nThis trend is arguably most troubling in down-ballot races, particularly races for secretary of state. These officials will be tasked with running elections, including in key presidential swing states, should they win in November.\n\nIn Nevada, Secretary of State nominee Jim Marchant, an unsuccessful congressional candidate in 2020, said that his No. 1 priority would be to “overhaul the fraudulent election system in Nevada” and that he would not have certified Biden’s 2020 win in the state. In Arizona, state Rep. Mark Finchem has falsely claimed that Trump won the 2020 election, called for the arrest of Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs and proposed widespread restrictions on voting in the state if he becomes secretary of state. And in Michigan, Kristina Karamo – who has falsely claimed that Trump won the state in 2020 – rose to prominence by alleging to have witnessed voter fraud as a poll challenger during the state’s count of absentee ballots.\n\nDemocrats have tried to shine a spotlight on these races. Former President Barack Obama will campaign for secretary of state candidates and Biden accused Republicans in a recent speech of “working right now as I speak in state after state to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself.”\n\nBut some Democratic operatives focused on these races have warned that the party is not focused enough on races against election deniers – cautioning that if one of these election denying candidates wins, the 2024 presidential election could be chaos.\n\n“There are these small races, down-ballot races that are going relatively unnoticed that will determine if we have a free and fair election,” said Hari Sevugan, a senior adviser to iVote, a group focused on secretary of state races. “Who wins these seats in 2022 will not only determine what the election looks like in 2024, but what our democracy looks like the day after.”\n\nWill the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling be a game-changer?\n\nIn the days and weeks after the Supreme Court threw out federal abortion rights protections, leadership in both parties seemed uncertain whether the backlash to the decision would drive voters to the polls.\n\nTwo-and-a-half months later, the answer seems clear: abortion is a leading issue in 2022 and its impact is being felt at the ballot box.\n\nThe current surge in voter registration among women, along with the resounding defeat in August of a ballot measure in Kansas that would have allowed its state legislature to push ahead with an abortion ban and unexpected successes in special elections suggest that the backlash to the high court’s decision could fire up the Democratic base.\n\nAs importantly, the issue appears to cut across party lines.\n\nIn heavily Republican Kansas, the move to amend the state constitution that would allow the legislature to remove abortion rights protections was defeated by roughly 20 percentage points. Turnout, too, was astronomical – eclipsing general election totals from 2010 and 2014 and amounting to roughly half of all registered voters.\n\nThree weeks after Kansas, Democrat Pat Ryan won a special election for a House seat in upstate New York over Republican Marc Molinaro, who had been favored, with a message largely focused on abortion rights and, in a parallel to the language used by advocates in Kansas, GOP efforts to strip away that “freedom.”\n\n“It was just so clear how deeply this hit people and how scared they were and how sad they were and how angry they were,” Ryan told CNN.\n\nDemocrats across the country have now adopted similar messaging. Their candidates could also benefit from added turnout in states like Michigan, which, like Kansas, is holding an abortion rights referendum.\n\nRepublicans have largely sought to downplay the issue, insisting in many cases that abortion is not, as Democrats say, “on the ballot.” But new federal legislation to ban abortion after 15 weeks nationwide, introduced by GOP South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham this week, could undercut their argument.\n\nThe economy still a drag on Democrats\n\nThe energy around the abortion debate can only do so much, however.\n\nPolls and conversations with voters show roaring inflation and rising prices continue to be a significant concern, impacting voters in every competitive state and district across the country.\n\nThe Biden administration has attempted to quell those concerns – they named their sweeping health care and climate change bill the “Inflation Reduction Act” – but not all Democratic candidates have lauded their own party’s handling of economic issues.\n\n“Inflation, a broken supply chain and high gas prices – Mainers everywhere are facing tough decision about rising costs,” Democrat Rep. Jared Golden said in an ad for his reelection campaign. Golden goes on to describe himself as a “independent voice” and touts voting against a key portion of the Biden agenda because it would “make inflation worse.”\n\nRepublicans like Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, have attempted to define this election as “a grocery and gas election,” using inflation as an albatross to hang around every Democratic candidate’s neck.\n\nAbortion has complicated that message – putting Republicans in districts on defense – but with eight weeks to go before Election Day, whether the economy or abortion is the most motivating issue for voters will determine who is better positioned to hold or win the majority.\n\nBig-dollar outside spenders are a new force in Democratic primaries\n\nThe combination of redistricting and a wave of House Democratic retirements created a long list of open seats, setting up a series of contentious primaries between moderate, establishment-backed candidates and movement progressives.\n\nBut the left, though it is poised to again gain power in the House Democratic caucus, fell short of its ambitions largely due to a barrage of outside spending from new and increasingly aggressive outside groups and super PACs, including one created by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), and others, like Mainstream Democrats PAC, largely funded by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.\n\nIn New York alone, outside groups spent nearly $10 million in House primaries. One of them, called New York Progressive Inc., was funded by the AIPAC-backed United Democracy Project – an expenditure UDP didn’t reveal until after its preferred candidate, former federal prosecutor Daniel Goldman, narrowly prevailed over the more left-leaning state Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou.\n\nUDP also spent heavily in Democratic races in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina, Maryland, Ohio and South Texas, succeeding in all but the open seat primary based in Pittsburgh, where state Rep. Summer Lee defeated moderate Steve Irwin.\n\nProgressive groups also dug deep to back candidates like Lee and Greg Casar in Texas, with independent expenditure arms of Justice Democrats and the Working Families Party usually leading the way. Indivisible and the Congressional Progressive Caucus’s campaign arm dipped into some races, too, but they were all outspent – a dynamic that many expect to continue in cycles to come.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg Eric Bradner Dan Merica", "Gregory Krieg", "Eric Bradner", "Dan Merica"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/06/01/2024-presidential-election-candidates-republican-democratic/11641319002/", "title": "2024 presidential candidates: A comprehensive list of everyone ...", "text": "The 2024 election cycle has kicked off. Though Election Day is over a year away, the race is well underway.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced he will seek another term, and with former President Donald Trump's hat also in the ring, there's a real possibility of a rematch of their 2020 race. Though the Democratic establishment is expected to fall firmly behind Biden, RFK Jr. has begun to raise some eyebrows as an opponent.\n\nThe Republican side is more of a toss-up. Trump-endorsed candidates suffered in the midterm elections, and with his legal troubles mounting, the GOP may consider other options. Polls still show Trump with a strong lead however, and many of those trying to unseat him have floundered including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis who generated early buzz has suffered in the polls, struggling to translate popularity in Florida to popularity at the national level, and recently firing much of his campaign staff in a major shake-up.\n\nHere are the latest developments on the path to the 2024 election:\n\nAnd here are the candidates who have announced their intention to run for president in the 2024 election:\n\nDemocratic party candidates for 2024\n\nPolitical party: Democrat\n\nAge: 80\n\nFamily: Biden has spoken candidly about grief throughout his political career. He lost his first wife Neilia Hunter and their one-year-old daughter Naomi in a 1972 car accident shortly after winning his first Senate race. His two young sons, Beau and Hunter, were injured in the crash but survived. In 2015, Biden lost Beau to brain cancer and has made it a major political goal to champion cancer research.\n\nHe remarried in 1977, tying the knot with now-First Lady Jill Biden. The two share a daughter, Ashley, and a large clan of grandchildren.\n\nBiden's son Hunter has been the subject of scandal in recent years and has written about his struggles with drug addiction. The GOP-led House has seized on Hunter's business dealings, hosting hearings to investigate his finances and the potential influence he has on his father.\n\nPrevious political experience: Joe Biden is a veteran of the Senate. First elected in 1972, he served as a senator from Delaware for 36 years before being elected as vice president on the Obama ticket in 2008.\n\nAfter serving two terms as vice president, Biden took a brief hiatus from government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.\n\nHis views: Biden's campaign is focused on the \"battle for the soul of America,\" doubling down on the central message of his campaign four years ago. He said the question facing the nation is \"whether, in the years ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer.\"\n\nMore on Biden's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Democratic\n\nAge: 69\n\nFamily: Kennedy bears a powerful last name in Democratic politics. He is the son of Robert F. Kennedy, the former attorney general who was assassinated during a 1968 presidential run, and the nephew of former president John F. Kennedy.\n\nKennedy has been married three times and has six children. He wed current wife Cheryl Hines in 2014. Hines is a television star best known for her role on \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"\n\nPrevious political experience: Kennedy is an environmental lawyer known for trumpeting a debunked theory that vaccines can be linked to autism.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates, calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times used the Holocaust as a historical comparison. In 2017, former President Trump invited Kennedy to head up a presidential commission on vaccine safety.\n\nHis views: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the \"liberties guaranteed by the Constitution,\" according to his campaign website.\n\nMore on Kennedy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Democratic\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Williamson was married once in the late 1970s to a Houston businessman whom she has not named. She has one daughter, India Emmanuelle, whose father has not been publicly identified.\n\nPrevious political experience: Williamson is a self-help author and spiritual leader who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2020. Then she was largely drowned out by a crowded Democratic field, breaking through for a rare viral moment, but eventually written off as a non-traditional candidate whose views involved centering the \"politics of love\" and rejecting a “dark psychic force of collectivized hatred.”\n\nHer views: Williamson supports abortion rights, a single-payer health care system and reparations for descendants of formerly enslaved Americans. She has suggested creating a U.S. Department of Children and Youth to increase child advocacy, and a U.S. Department of Peace.\n\nMore on Williamson's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nRepublican party candidates for 2024\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 55\n\nFamily: Binkley met wife Ellie in college and the two share five children.\n\nPrevious political experience: Binkley is CEO, president, and co-founder of the mergers and acquisitions conglomerate Generational Equity Group.

He says he wants to stand out in a crowded field by prioritizing unity, and leaning on his faith and business experience.\n\nHis views: Binkley has said he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform, and putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against abortion. Though he signed a highly restrictive bill in his own state, he had indicated he would not do the same nationally and it should be a local issue. Binkley advocates for American energy independence using an \"all of the above\" approach that encompasses both fossil fuels and new technologies.\n\nMore on Binkley's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nWho is Ryan Binkley?

He was elected governor of North Dakota in 2016 and reelected in 2020.\n\nBurgum’s candidacy is expected to focus more on economics than culture wars – a favored topic of frontrunners Trump and DeSantis.\n\nHis views: Burgum has emphasized economic issues, rather than hot-button cultural issues that have been a focal point for some other GOP candidates. He is a vocal supporter of the oil industry, and the U.S. role in exporting it to other nations, and has said he favors smaller government and lower taxes.\n\nMore on Burgum's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 60\n\nFamily: Christie met wife Mary Pat at the University of Delaware and the two wed in 1986.

He was elected governor of New Jersey in 2010 and occupied the office until 2018.\n\nChristie has been a prominent figure in the GOP since he launched his first presidential campaign in 2012. He ran again unsuccessfully in 2016 and, despite prior criticism, ultimately endorsed Trump and later joined his campaign.\n\nHis views: Christie is anti-abortion, but does support some exceptions in the case of incest, rape, and danger to the mother. He is not for a federal ban, instead believing the issue should be left to the states.

Since then, he has captured national attention with controversial legislative measures on education and immigration.\n\nWhile in law school, DeSantis joined the U.S. Navy as a JAG officer, later deploying to Iraq for active duty. Prior to his run for governor, he served in the House of Representatives as a congressman for Florida's 6th district for three terms from 2013 to 2018.\n\nHe is widely viewed as Trump’s biggest threat in the Republican primary. Similar in politics but different in demeanor, DeSantis represents a younger, some say more predictable, alternative to the former president.\n\nHis views: DeSantis is campaigning on a hard-right agenda to make America look more like Florida. He is in favor of \"defending parental rights and eliminating CRT,\" and is anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment.\n\nMore on DeSantis' 2024 Presidential Candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: Elder has no children and has been married once. The couple divorced after two years and Elder was engaged again to Alexandra Datig from 2013 to 2015.

Though he lost, Elder received the highest number of votes of any candidate besides Newsom.\n\nElder announced his candidacy on Fox News' \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" tweeting afterward \"America is in decline, but this decline is not inevitable. We can enter a new American Golden Age, but we must choose a leader who can bring us there. That’s why I’m running for President.\"\n\nHis views: Elder backs school choice, including vouchers and charter schools. His platform also includes a vow to be tough on crime, to secure the border, and to \"contain China\" by asserting military dominance in the South China Sea and minimizing reliance on the country's manufacturing.\n\nMore on Elder's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 51\n\nFamily: Haley is one of four children born to Indian-American parents in Bamberg, South Carolina - a town she has described as divided by race.\n\nShe and her husband of 26 years, Michael, live still in South Carolina where they are raising two children Rena and Nalin.\n\nPrevious political experience: Haley started her political career in the South Carolina state legislature where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful campaign for the governor's office in 2010. She won reelection in 2014 and has bragged that she has \"never lost a race.\"\n\nIn 2016, former President Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down in 2018. Haley has played up her role as a female candidate in what is expected to be a largely male primary field. \"May the best woman win,” she quipped in an interview with Fox News.\n\nHer views: Haley is anti-abortion and pro-Israel. She supports cracking down on illegal immigration and \"getting tough\" on China and Russia. She has supported Trump in the past but also criticized him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\nMore on Haley's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 45\n\nFamily: Hurd wed Lynlie Wallace, a fellow political operative, in 2022. The two first met in 2009.\n\nPrevious political experience: A former CIA officer, Hurd served three terms in Congress representing Texas in the House after first being elected in 2014.\n\nHis views: Hurd stands out from an increasingly crowded GOP field as a rare vocal critic of Trump. He joins the likes of Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson in publicly disavowing the former president and in his campaign launch video listed illegal immigration, inflation, crime, and homelessness as legislative priorities.\n\nMore on Hurd's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 72\n\nFamily: Hutchinson has been married to wife Susan since 1973. The two share four children and seven grandchildren.\n\nPrevious political experience: Hutchinson has had a long career in Republican politics. He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to serve Arkansas' 3rd district in 1997; he served until 2001 when he was appointed DEA administrator and later undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security for the George W. Bush administration.\n\nWhile in the House, Hutchinson served as impeachment manager in the trial of former president (and fellow Arkansas native) Bill Clinton. After leaving Washington he was elected 46th Governor of Arkansas. He served for two terms, from 2015 to 2023.\n\nHis views: He supports lower taxes, a strong national defense, and opposes abortion. He has said the Biden administration \"stood on the sidelines\" in the face of crime and “turned its back on the American worker.\"\n\nMore on Hutchinson's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 75\n\nFamily: Johnson tied the knot with wife Diane in 2008, and the pair share three sons.\n\nPrevious political experience: A businessman trying his hand at politics, Johnson built his wealth with the launch of Perry Johnson Registrars Inc., a company that ensures auto, aerospace and other businesses are complying with industrial standards. In 2022, he threw his hat in the ring for the GOP nomination for Michigan governor before being disqualified because of invalid signatures.\n\nHis views: Johnson told a group of Iowa voters in July that he was \"pro-life, pro-Second Amendment, anti-woke and anti-China,\" − and \"if you don't like it, well, tough.\" His campaign's signature \"2 cents\" proposes cutting 2 cents off every dollar of federal discretionary spending.\n\nParty: Republican\n\nAge: 63\n\nFamily: Pence wed wife Karen in 1985 and the two share three children: Michael, Charlotte, and Audrey.\n\nPrevious political experience: Pence entered politics in 2000 when he won his local congressional seat. He went on to serve six terms in the House of Representatives before being sworn in as governor of Indiana in 2013.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump chose Pence as his running mate, and he served one term as Vice President. The role thrust him into a precarious situation in 2021 when Trump sought to pressure him to throw out some of Biden's electoral votes to overturn the election.\n\nPence ultimately defied Trump and certified the results, infuriating MAGA voters and Trump himself. His candidacy will likely involve a difficult tightrope walk as he attempts to distance himself from the former president without alienating the base.\n\nHis views: Pence is a vocal opponent of abortion, and of what he sees as the nation's long-term debt problem. He favors cuts in government spending and lower taxes, and while he often touts his time as vice president and speaks well of the policies that came out of the Trump White House, he has begun to distance himself from his former running mate in terms of tone. He has also criticized Trump's actions during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore on Pence's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 37\n\nFamily: Ramaswamy married Apoorva Tewari, a throat surgeon and assistant professor at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, in 2015. The pair have two sons together.\n\nPrevious political experience: Ramaswamy is framing himself as an outsider, an entrepreneur-turned-political-hopeful who will give the establishment a run for its money.\n\nHe is a former biotech investor who founded pharmaceutical research company Roivant Sciences in 2014. Ramaswamy left the company in 2020 amid clashes with colleagues over how to respond to the murder of George Floyd and the public outcry that followed. He now heads up Strive Asset Management.\n\nHe is the author of three books, including \"Woke Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam,\" which explores how American politics and capitalism have become increasingly intertwined.\n\nHis views: He has peddled ideas such as ending affirmative action and eliminating the Department of Education. His elevator pitch: He'll go farther than Trump ever did or could today.\n\nMore on Ramaswamy's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 57\n\nFamily: Scott is unmarried, with no children. He was raised by a single mother in North Charleston and has one brother.\n\nPrevious political experience: Scott first entered politics in 1995 during a special election for City Council in Charleston. His profile grew nationally when he suggested posting the 10 Commandments outside the council building, a proposal that was denied.\n\nScott served for two years in the state legislature before being elected in 2010 to the House of Representatives for South Carolina's 1st district. He served one term before being appointed to the Senate by then-governor Nikki Haley and becoming the first Black U.S. senator from the state.\n\nScott is pitching himself as a more hopeful alternative to Trump, drawing on Reagan-era ideals and centering a tone of optimism.\n\nHis views: Scott joined the Senate in 2013. He’s anti-abortion and pro-Second Amendment. He says on his website that his “signature legislation,” Opportunity Zones, put $75 billion into “distressed communities” across the country.\n\nMore on Scott's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 45\n\nFamily: Suarez is the son of another prominent Florida politician: Xavier L.

Prior to that he was Miami City commissioner and served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors from 2022 to 2023.\n\nViews: Suarez has said he did not support Trump in either 2016 or 2020, instead using his ballot to write in the names of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and Former Vice President Mike Pence respectively. As mayor, Suarez has championed growing Miami's tech economy, and he has also backed low taxes and increased police spending.\n\nMore on Suarez's 2024 presidential candidacy:\n\nMiami mayor files for 2024 run: Meet Francis Suarez\n\nPolitical party: Republican\n\nAge: 76\n\nFamily: Trump is the son of real estate magnate Fred Trump. Born and bred in New York, he first made his name developing skyscrapers and casinos.\n\nTrump first married in 1977, wedding Czech-born model Ivana. The two were married for 13 years and share three children: Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric. In 1993 Trump married actress and model Marla Maples. The two had one daughter: Tiffany. Following his divorce from Maples, Trump tied the knot for a final time with model Melania, who is mother to his youngest child, Barron.\n\nTrump's family was uncharacteristically involved in his presidency. Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner played prominent roles in the administration, and both Don Jr. and Eric were often cited as close advisors.\n\nPrevious political experience: When Trump entered the race in 2016, he branded himself as a political outsider, a businessman separate from the establishment, ready to \"drain the swamp.\"\n\nPrior to 2016, he dabbled in politics, often sounding off on controversial issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on Barack Obama's citizenship and the guiltiness of the now-exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in \"The Apprentice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Trump shocked pollsters by securing victory over Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. He served a full four-year term and was defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.\n\nHis views: The former president has centered much of his campaign on his purported “political persecution” by Democrats. He supports securing America’s borders, “reclaiming free speech,” and “dismantling the Deep State,” according to his campaign website. He has said he would consider pardoning participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which was inspired by his false claims of election fraud.\n\nMore on Trump's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThird-party 2024 presidential candidates\n\nPolitical Party: The People's Party\n\nAge: 70\n\nFamily: West has been married five times and has two children.

He has taught at a number of Ivy League institutions and works now as a professor of philosophy at Union Theological Seminary.\n\nIn a video uploaded to Twitter, West announced his 2024 candidacy saying, \"I enter in the quest for truth, I enter in the quest for justice.\" As a third-party candidate, West alleged \"neither political party wants to tell the truth\" on various issues. His bid with the People's Party represents the first independent ticket to enter the race thus far.\n\nHis views: West is a proponent of Medicare for All, and removing oil and gas subsidies as well as drilling on public lands. Long a vocal opponent of militarism, West's campaign website lists \"end the wars\" as a key priority which would include disbanding NATO and banning nuclear weapons across the globe.\n\nMore on West's 2024 presidential candidacy\n\nThis story will be updated as additional candidates officially enter the race.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2021/10/06/2024-presidential-campaign-iowa-visits-hint-republican-candidates-ahead-caucuses/5698091001/", "title": "2024 presidential candidates: The Republicans, Democrats likely to ...", "text": "Not every politician traveling to Iowa runs for president — but every politician who runs for president travels to Iowa for the first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\nAnd even though Iowa Democrats' caucuses may have slipped from the front of the pack, Iowa Republicans will still hold their caucuses before anyone else, making it the starting point for choosing America's next president.\n\nWith President Joe Biden officially announcing his reelection bid, we're getting a clearer sense of the field of candidates.\n\nSo who is running for president in 2024?

He added a scary new twist at a time of global tensions, claiming the country was on the verge of tumbling into nuclear war.\n\nLaunching his bid for a third consecutive Republican presidential nomination, Trump conversely painted his own turbulent single term, which ended in his attempt to destroy democracy and a mismanaged pandemic, as a “golden age” of prosperity and American global dominance.\n\nThe new Trump – for the 2024 campaign – is the same as the old Trump.\n\nHe pounded out a message of American decline, highlighted raging inflation and slammed President Joe Biden as aged, weak, and disrespected by US enemies, while highlighting his own chummy ties with global dictators, like North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who seek to weaken American power.\n\nWhen the 76-year-old former property tycoon, reality star and commander in chief promised a new “quest to save our country,” he encapsulated the challenges that his new campaign poses for his own party and the rest of the United States.\n\nTo begin with, in the gold-leafed ballroom of his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump steered clear of the election denialism that helped doom multiple Republican nominees in the midterm elections and that has inspired skepticism of his viability among GOP lawmakers in Washington.\n\nBut as usual, his self-discipline didn’t hold, as he descended further into his personal obsessions the longer he went on, portraying himself as a “victim,” raising new suspicion about the US election system and slamming ongoing criminal probes against him as politicized and deeply unfair. The speech lacked the riotous nature and energy of his campaign rallies. But Trump’s material was a familiar rhetorical cocktail of grievance certain to enthuse his base supporters.\n\nHowever, it may have come across to many of the swing voters in the states that he lost in 2020 as authoritarian demagoguery. Many of those voters deserted Republicans yet again last week, as the party failed to win back the Senate and as it still waits to confirm it will win only a slim majority in the House. Many GOP lawmakers squarely blame the lack of a red wave on Trump – for foisting extreme, election-denying candidates on the party in key states. That’s why there is increasing interest in potential alternative candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who roared to reelection last week, and has recently proved, unlike Trump, that he can build a broad coalition with Trump-style policies but without the chaos epitomized by the 45th president.\n\nAnd yet by launching his campaign so early – before the 2022 election is even finalized – the ex-president is seeking to freeze the GOP field. And there is so far no evidence that his devoted supporters will desert him.\n\nWhat could be the opening acts of a new election clash between Trump and Biden unfolded over multiple time zones. As Trump was speaking, the current president – who confounded historic expectations of a midterm election drubbing – was at another beach resort, in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nBiden spent the moments leading up to Trump’s speech huddled with other world leaders seeking a united response to a possibly alarming escalation in the war in Ukraine after an explosion on the territory of NATO ally Poland. There was some irony to the fact that Biden was leading the same Western alliance at a moment of peril that Trump frequently had undermined while in office. (Biden said after a day of rising global tensions that first indications were that the missile that fell onto a Polish farm, killing two people, did not originate in Russia.)\n\nEpitomizing the gulf between a president’s duties and the frivolity of the campaign trail, Biden, when asked if he had a comment on Trump’s launch, replied: “No, not really.”\n\nTrump seeks a historic comeback under the threat of criminal probes\n\nTrump referred briefly to the FBI search of his home at Mar-a-Lago for his hoard of highly classified documents and subpoenas sent to his family members. It was a reminder that his campaign raises the extraordinary scenario of a candidate for president running for a new term while facing multiple criminal investigations and the possibility of indictment by the Justice Department. Trump, who has not been charged with a crime, is being investigated over the classified documents, the run-up to the US Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021, and in Georgia over his attempt to steal Biden’s win in the crucial swing state in 2020.\n\nTrump has already claimed that he is being persecuted because Biden wants to stop him from becoming president again – an accusation likely to be embraced by his millions of supporters. Thus, the clash between his campaign and various investigations into his conduct promises to inflict even more damage on political and legal institutions that he kept under continuous assault as president.\n\nOne thing noticeably missing from Trump’s speech was acknowledgment of his unprecedented attempt to interrupt 250 years of peaceful transfers of power between presidents. But the Capitol insurrection is an indelible stain that is sure to haunt his campaign. CNN has exclusively reported that top DOJ officials have considered whether a special counsel would be needed during the Trump campaign to avoid potential political conflicts of interest.\n\nTrump is trying to pull off a historic feat accomplished by only one previous president – Grover Cleveland, who became the only commander in chief to serve nonconsecutive terms after he won a return to the White House in 1892.\n\nA Trump victory in 2024 would represent a stunning rebound given that he is the only president to have been impeached twice – once for trying to coerce Ukraine into investigating Biden, and secondly for inciting the mob attack on the Capitol, one of the most flagrant assaults ever on US democracy.\n\nA test for the GOP\n\nA return to the Oval Office for Trump would stun the world. His record of disdaining US allies and coddling dictators such as Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un fractured decades of US foreign policy and made the United States – long a force for stability in the world – into one of its most erratic powers.\n\nTrump left office in disgrace in 2021, after the assault on the Capitol, not even bothering to attend the inauguration of his successor and insisting ever since that the election was corrupt – despite no evidence and against the findings of multiple courts and his own Justice Department.\n\nEver since, the ex-president has made his lies about the 2020 election the centerpiece of a political movement that still has millions of followers – as was seen with the primary victories of some of his handpicked candidates in this year’s midterm elections.\n\nBut many Trump-backed candidates failed to win competitive general elections. And Trump’s 2024 campaign will test whether there are Republicans who, while they may be drawn in by Trump’s bulldozing style and populist, nationalist instincts, will tire of the drama and chaos that surround him. It will also pose a question of whether a new generation of Republicans, who have tapped into his political base and the “America first” principles of Trumpism – like DeSantis, for example – are ready to challenge the movement’s still wildly popular founder.\n\nTrump was already rejected by a broad general election audience once – he lost by more than 7 million votes in 2020. The same pattern appeared to exert itself as the GOP fell short of expectations in the midterms, which ironically will give Trump-aligned lawmakers strong leverage in what’s likely to be a narrow House Republican majority.\n\nAnd even if he secures the nomination again, it’s an open question whether he’ll be able to recreate his 2016 winning coalition after alienating moderate and suburban voters or whether a combination of motivated base voters and previously disaffected Republicans returning to the fold will be able to make up the difference.\n\nA norm-busting first term\n\nTrump’s first term between 2017 and 2021 was one of the most tumultuous periods in American political history.\n\nHe shattered the traditions and restraints of his office, subjecting political institutions – designed by the Founders to guard against exactly his brand of autocratic egotism – to their ultimate test.\n\nThe 45th president’s reputation was also stained by his negligent denial and mismanagement of a once-in-100-years pandemic. He skipped over his failed leadership in the emergency during his speech on Tuesday night.\n\nTrump’s flouting of science and public health guidelines came back to haunt him as he contracted Covid-19 in the fall of 2020. He survived a serious bout with the help of experimental drugs before theatrically ripping off his mask in a White House photo op when he returned from the hospital.\n\nOne important aspect of his pandemic strategy was a success, however. An early White House bet to invest big in vaccine development by private firms and scientists, under the title of Operation Warp Speed, put the US in better position than many other industrialized nations.\n\nThe coronavirus destroyed the roaring economy Trump had hoped to ride to reelection, leaving as his most important achievement the shaping of a conservative Supreme Court majority, which has already dramatically altered American society with its overturning of Roe v. Wade and could last a generation.\n\nBut history will most remember him for his two impeachments, both following abuses of power designed to manipulate the free and fair elections that are at the root of America’s democratic system in order to prolong his tenure in office.\n\nThe House select committee investigating the insurrection has uncovered damning evidence in Trump’s inner circle about his behavior in the run-up to January 6 and during the insurrection. Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, for instance, testified that chief of staff Mark Meadows said Trump thought Vice President Mike Pence deserved the calls for him to be hanged by insurrectionists. There was also evidence of Trump’s vicious pressure on local officials and election workers in states such as Georgia.\n\nYet there remain questions about whether the committee will be able to hold accountable a man who has always dodged responsibility in a wild and whirling life in business, reality television and politics.\n\nEven if the committee advises the Justice Department that prosecuting Trump is merited, it’s unknown whether the evidence it has collected would be sufficient to secure a conviction. And Attorney General Merrick Garland would be faced with a massive dilemma given the extraordinary implications of bringing criminal charges against an active presidential candidate.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/11/11/election-2020-kamala-harris-hopes-for-iowa-surge-staff-additions-unclear/2562980001/", "title": "As Kamala Harris hopes for Iowa surge, staff additions still unclear", "text": "MASON CITY, Iowa — Before she started her stump speech Saturday night, U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris told the crowd about the new office her campaign team opened two blocks away.\n\n\"Please come by and visit with us,\" she said. \"And you're always welcome. And we always welcome any help you can give.\"\n\nThe office, one of 10 the Harris campaign opened in Iowa last month, was part of an injection of resources in the state. The campaign more than doubled its paid staff here, and Harris visited Iowa five times in October, telling reporters she is shooting for a top-three finish in the Democratic caucuses.\n\nThe team announced a second injection two weeks ago — only with more desperation. Down in the polls and short on funding, Campaign Manager Juan Rodriguez wrote in a memo that campaign would shift workers to Iowa from New Hampshire, Nevada and California. Rodriguez said he and other headquarters staff would also take pay cuts.\n\nSince then, the campaign has still not fleshed out exactly what this second Iowa infusion will look like. It's not clear how many staffers will be relocated to the state or where they all will come from.\n\nRodriguez's memo was also a bit vague. While he said \"many field staff\" would come here from New Hampshire, the team laid off its field organizers days later. Three of those organizers said they heard of no plans to come to Iowa.\n\nBroadly speaking, campaign officials in Iowa expect about 20 more workers — bringing the total number of paid staff in the state to 150. They also expect to move about six workers from Baltimore to Des Moines.\n\nIowa Communications Director Miryam Lipper said the campaign will add digital organizers, schedulers and communications specialists here. Asked where the campaign sees an opportunity for growth in Iowa, she said, \"We're trying to just expand capacity across the board.\"\n\n'We've been in constant contact for the entire campaign,\" she said of communication between Baltimore and the Iowa offices. \"But I think there's something to be said about having everyone squarely focused here on the mission on the ground.\"\n\nComeback crunch time\n\nWith three months until the caucuses, Lipper said campaign officials hope they can build momentum off Harris's speech at the Iowa Democratic Party Liberty & Justice Celebration on Nov. 1. Her \"Justice is on the ballot\" rhetorical device received positive reviews from members of the party and some national political writers.\n\nHarris delivered that speech again Saturday night in front of about 200 people at the old City National Bank. She also trotted out a couple of new lines that drew the largest cheers of the night.\n\n\"Teachers don't want a gun,\" she said. \"They want a raise.\"\n\n\"Immigrants have helped make America great,\" she said seconds later. \"And somebody needs to remind Donald Trump that some of his closest relatives are immigrants, too.\"\n\nFrom her front-row seat, Monica Alarcon nodded her head and shouted \"Yes!\" in response. She did not know much about Harris before Saturday night and later asked a reporter how to pronounce the presidential candidate's first name.\n\nShe entered the town hall leaning toward former Vice President Joe Biden, given his ties to Barack Obama, but she is now leaning toward Harris. Her reaction was not about any specific issue that Harris discussed as much as was about her energy on stage.\n\n\"There was a smell of honesty from her,\" she said. \"I can't describe it. No corruption. I didn't smell anything rotten.\"\n\nAnother attendee, Jim Davis, said there's still plenty of time for candidates to make up ground here. But he isn't sure how someone can break through. He has participated in caucuses for 43 years and doesn't remember his neighborhood ever being so flooded with organizers.\n\nDuring an interview with the Register last week, former New Hampshire organizer Jordan Thompson experienced the same problems. He said voters are exhausted and have \"tuned out\" from the campaign. At the same time, he believes this creates an opening for a candidate to surge in the polls.\n\n\"A lot of people have very bluntly said they are not going to make their decision until the week of the caucus, until the weak of a primary,\" he told the Register last week. \"That's totally understandable. They're getting so many calls from so many campaigns.\"\n\nThompson, who was laid off two weeks ago, now counts himself as one of those undecided. He supported Harris because he believed she would offer the strongest counter to President Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nHe said he still has many friends on the Harris campaign, and he wants them to succeed. But the way he and his co-workers were laid off left him upset. He declined to say what specifically the campaign's leaders mishandled.\n\n\"This has been a difficult experience for many of us,\" he said. \"I can only speak for myself on this, but I believe the handling of the situation was less than ideal. It has simply shifted my opinion on what the future of the campaign is.\"\n\nInspiration from the past\n\nIn his memo, Rodriguez name-checked two previous presidential candidates who came from behind to win their party's nomination: former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, a Democrat, in 2004 and former U.S. Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, in 2008. The Iowa state political directors for both campaigns said they disagree with the comparison.\n\nKerry surged in the final months before the 2004 caucuses, according to Des Moines Register polls. He was stuck in third at 15% in November 2003 but overcame Howard Dean and John Edwards to win the state contest.\n\nJohn Norris, Kerry's Iowa political director at the time, said he convinced the national staff during a September meeting in Des Moines to put Kerry in the state more often. Like with Harris this year, the campaign brought extra organizers into Iowa around that time.\n\nNorris did not attribute the comeback to any particular moment in the race. He said Kerry simply showed up and impressed crowds. Norris rebuffed national campaign officials who asked him to give Kerry a tighter schedule, moving him around the area in shorter appearances.\n\nBut Norris insisted that Kerry's 1 1/2-hour policy-laden town halls were making the difference. He believes this could be a problem for a Harris comeback. Fair or not, voters — Norris included — see U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren as the wonk in the race.\n\n\"[Kerry] could just go in-depth on any issues,\" Norris said. \"At that stage, maybe the marginal caucus voter wasn't making up their mind yet. But people who were really engaged were looking for that.\"\n\nMcCain's Iowa political director, Jon Seaton, also doubts Harris can connect with crowds like his candidate did. But, he concedes, outsiders rarely see a comeback coming.\n\nThe summer before the 2004 caucuses, having failed to hit their fundraising goals, the McCain campaign shut down its national headquarters that summer and shifted their teams into Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. In November 2007, according to the Register's poll, McCain was stuck in fifth place in Iowa at 7%.\n\nHe clawed back to 13% on caucus night, enough to finish practically tied for third with Fred Thompson. The finish generated plenty of writing about a McCain comeback, which helped him win in New Hampshire and eventually clinch the party's nomination.\n\nLike Norris, Seaton attributes the comeback to impressive performances in smaller venues around the state. In September, with a staff of five, McCain embarked on a \"No Surrender\" tour through Iowa and defended President George W. Bush's strategy in the Iraq war. In V.F.W. posts and American Legion halls, Seaton noticed that McCain's speeches resonated with crowds.\n\nThe campaign didn't see a boost in the polls for months. But looking back, Seaton believes those simple speeches laid the groundwork.\n\n\"The bells and whistles — I'm not saying they're insignificant,\" he said. \"It's a good idea to run TV ads. We had a professional campaign. [Harris] has a professional campaign. But these things, especially in the early states, are really driven by candidates' ability to connect with voters and convince them to show up on a cold (caucus) night.\"\n\nTyler Jett covers jobs and the economy for the Register.

Terry Branstad declared in late November 2012.\n\nBut a groundswell of GOP cheerleading for the event, including from U.S. Rep. Steve King, shifted its fate. Republicans familiar with how hard it is to raise money for the party have pointed out that it has grossed over $1 million each time since 1999. It brought in $1.5 million before expenses in 2011, including the proceeds from the Fox News debate two days earlier. The net was close to half of the revenue.\n\nAlso, there was fear in some quarters that if there were no straw poll, a religious conservative-oriented event would fill the void.\n\nAnother part of its appeal: It's just a fun event, Iowa Republicans said.\n\n\"It's important to understand,\" former Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn said, \"the state central committee is not the final authority in whether there's a straw poll. That decision ultimately rests with the candidates themselves. Will they invest the time and resources to compete?\"\n\nThe Des Moines Register asked a few GOP leaders, operatives and political thinkers to pick a side and make an argument for or against keeping the straw poll as something resembling the current format. Here are their answers:\n\nCON\n\nTIM ALBRECHT , who has organized hard for the straw poll, including as Steve Forbes' field director in 1999, and is now director of the political firm Redwave Digital: \"The Iowa Straw Poll is an underdog's game. ... What does winning get you? In Michele Bachmann's case, over-inflated expectations and a sixth-place caucus night finish. ... Front-running candidates don't need to participate in order to do well in the caucuses, leaving little motivation to participate and instead framing the contest as a battle of the underdogs to be the top dog in the second tier of candidates.\"\n\n, who has organized hard for the straw poll, including as Steve Forbes' field director in 1999, and is now director of the political firm Redwave Digital: \"The Iowa Straw Poll is an underdog's game. ...

With fewer than 100 days until the general election, the final rounds of 2022 midterms primaries will come fast and furious over the next six weeks, beginning with a busy Tuesday featuring key contests around the country.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump’s influence is again looming over Republican Senate primaries, this time in Arizona and Missouri, while GOP House members in Washington state and Michigan face a conservative backlash over their votes to impeach Trump after the January 6, 2021, US Capitol insurrection.\n\nMichigan GOP Rep. Peter Meijer’s challenge from an election-denying Trump ally has attracted an extra dose of national interest thanks to Democratic campaign leadership, which has invested in propping up his right-wing opponent – a controversial tactic meant to engineer a better matchup for Democrats this fall.\n\nThe meddling has come under fire from not only Meijer, but Democrats worried it will undermine their attempts to criticize extremism in the GOP and backfire in the November elections.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Michigan is home to a handful of competitive House primaries, including one that pits a pair of incumbents, Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin, against one another in a campaign that has attracted heavy investments from competing pro-Israel groups.\n\nKansas, meanwhile, will host one of the first major post-Roe votes when the state conducts a referendum to determine whether its constitution protects the right to an abortion. If the measure succeeds, state lawmakers are expected to quickly move to enshrine a ban.\n\nHere are eight things to watch on Tuesday:\n\nArizona governor primary pits Trump against Pence\n\nThe race to replace term-limited Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, pits Ducey’s chosen candidate, Karrin Taylor Robson, against a Trump-endorsed former television journalist Kari Lake.\n\nLake has built her campaign around lies about election fraud. She referred to the refusal of her leading rival, Ducey-backed Robson, to indulge those lies as “disqualifying.”\n\nRobson, meanwhile, is also backed by former Vice President Mike Pence, who visited Arizona to campaign with Robson and Ducey last month on the same day Trump held a rally at which Lake spoke.\n\nPence used his Arizona trip to urge the GOP to move past Trump’s lies about fraud in the 2020 election and look forward.\n\n“When you get out and vote for Karrin Taylor Robson, you can send a deafening message that will be heard all across America that the Republican Party is the party of the future,” Pence said in Peoria, Arizona.\n\nArizona GOP could pick full slate of election deniers\n\nBeyond the governor’s office, the Arizona GOP could be poised to nominate a statewide ticket of Trump-backed election deniers on Tuesday.\n\nThe race for secretary of state — Arizona’s chief elections officer — also features an election denier endorsed by Trump in Mark Finchem, a state lawmaker who wrongly claims that Trump on the 2020 election and was in Washington January 6.\n\nTrump-backed Blake Masters, who is seeking to face Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, hasn’t just claimed that Democrats “pulled out all the stops” to cheat in 2020, but has suggested the 2022 midterms won’t be fair. Masters faces other Republicans who have rejected the 2020 election outcome, including businessman Jim Lamon, who touts his efforts to fund the bogus review of Maricopa County’s 2020 results. Another Senate candidate, state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, sent a letter claiming to have uncovered election fraud, without detailing any fraud in how the election was managed.\n\nTrump’s chosen candidate in the race for attorney general, Abraham Hamadeh, said he would “take the fraud in our 2020 election seriously and bring justice to those who’ve undermined our Republic.”\n\nMeijer faces Dem-backed, far-right challenge\n\nRep. Peter Meijer, the freshman Republican from western Michigan who was one of his party’s 10 House members to vote for Trump’s second impeachment, is facing off against a Trump-endorsed challenger in John Gibbs.\n\nGibbs has fully embraced Trump’s election lies. He wrongly claimed in a debate with Meijer that the results that led to Biden’s win in 2020 were “simply mathematically impossible” and said that there were “anomalies in there, to put it very lightly.”\n\nWhat’s unique about the GOP contest in the Grand Rapids-based 3rd District is that Democrats have attempted to boost Gibbs with ads casting him as a Trump-aligned conservative.\n\nIt’s a calculated gamble for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has spent more than $300,000 on ads in the race: They believe Gibbs would be much easier to defeat in November, so they are attempting to elevate him Tuesday, and then turn and immediately cast him as a threat to democracy in the general election.\n\nA pro-Meijer group launched a television ad over the weekend highlighting Democrats’ involvement in the Republican primary. “Fox News confirms it: Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to elect their hand-picked candidate for Congress in the Republican primary, John Gibbs,” the group’s ad warns. “West Michigan must say no to Nancy Pelosi’s handpicked candidate for Congress.”\n\nTrump hedges on scandal-plagued Greitens in Missouri\n\nA little more than four years ago, Eric Greitens resigned as Missouri governor as he faced an ethics probe and allegations he abused and tried to blackmail a woman with whom had an affair. Prosecutors ultimately dropped felony charges.\n\nMore recently, his ex-wife accused him of violent and unstable behavior in a court filing related to a child custody dispute. (Greitens denied the claims.)\n\nNow, the former Navy SEAL is one of the frontrunners in what recent polling suggests will be a tight Missouri GOP Senate primary, with a field that includes Greitens, state Attorney General Eric Schmitt and US Rep. Vicky Hartzler.\n\nEven Trump, whom Greitens has sought to align himself with, is hedging – likely because he fears Greitens could be defeated in a general election. On Monday evening, Trump put out a statement endorsing “Eric.” Which one? On that question, Trump wrote, Missouri Republicans would need to “make up their own minds.”\n\nRep. Billy Long, Missouri state Senate President Pro Tem Dave Schatz and Mark McCloskey, a lawyer who became famous after he and wife wielded firearms from their property as a protest against police violence passed by in June 2020, are also part of a crowded field of Republican hopefuls.\n\nDemocrats will choose from Trudy Busch Valentine, a retired nurse and beer fortune heiress; attorney and Marine veteran Lucas Kunce; and Spencer Toder in their primary.\n\nAbortion on the ballot for the first time since SCOTUS decision\n\nFor the first time since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the right to an abortion will be on a ballot.\n\nKansas voters will decide, via a somewhat convoluted question, whether to keep the constitution as is, which the state Supreme Court previously ruled protects abortion rights – a “no” vote – or vote “yes” and change the state’s constitution to specify that the right to an abortion is not guaranteed in the state.\n\nThe vote, in addition to being key to the future of abortions in Kansas, is widely seen as a referendum on whether abortion politics have truly shifted in the wake of the Supreme Court decision earlier this year. Democrats are hopeful that the decision has invigorated voters to oppose anti-abortion measures.\n\nThis will be part of a big election year in Kansas. Democrat Gov. Laura Kelly, who opposed the amendment, is up for reelection in November, representing one of the most vulnerable Democratic gubernatorial incumbents in the country.\n\n“The amendment is written in such a way that the proponents of the amendment want to suggest that this would just leave things as they are in Kansas. But that’s not true,” Kelly said in late July. “What would happen if that amendment would pass is that the Legislature would immediately come back with some very severe restrictions on a woman’s ability to control her own fate.”\n\nRepublican Attorney General Derek Schmidt, who is all but certain to be the party’s nominee for governor, has said he would vote yes for the amendment.\n\nWhitmer gets her challenger\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was on the short list for Biden’s vice presidential nod less than two years into her first term, gets her Republican challenger in Tuesday’s primary.\n\nTrump on Friday endorsed Tudor Dixon, a conservative commentator who has falsely claimed that Trump won the 2020 election. She is also backed by Michigan’s GOP establishment, including former US Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s family, the state Chamber of Commerce and Michigan Right to Life.\n\nThat GOP gubernatorial primary features several other election deniers, as well. One candidate, Ryan Kelley, was in Washington on January 6, 2021, and has pled not guilty to four misdemeanor charges stemming from allegations of his participation in the riot at the Capitol. Retired pastor Ralph Rebandt said he is “convinced that we would find the fraud” in the 2020 election with a “full forensic audit.” And chiropractor Garrett Soldano has touted a film that promotes an unproven conspiracy theory about the 2020 election.\n\nRepublicans in Michigan are poised to nominate election deniers for their entire slate of statewide offices.\n\nThe party is also expected to pick Trump-backed election deniers in the races for secretary of state and attorney general. At a convention in April, the state GOP endorsed Kristina Karamo, an educator and right-wing commentator who claimed to have witnessed irregularities in 2020’s election, for secretary of state, and Matthew DePerno, who was a lawyer on a case challenging the 2020 results, for attorney general. But those races aren’t on Tuesday’s primary ballot; instead, Republicans will make their choices official at a party convention in August.\n\nDemocratic House incumbents clash after redistricting draws them into new district\n\nRedistricting in Michigan laid the groundwork for a Stevens-Levin contest in the state’s newly-drawn 11th Congressional District. Both candidates have claims to the seat, though some moderate Democrats expressed frustration that Levin didn’t try his hand in the open 10th District.\n\nBut the bigger story here has been animated by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee involvement and spending by its new super PAC, United Democracy Project, with the latter having backed Stevens with more than $4 million in outside expenditures.\n\nLevin, a Jewish progressive whose family has a storied history in Michigan politics, now enters primary day as an underdog despite a late boost from J Street, a liberal pro-Israel group attempting to blunt some of AIPAC’s influence with an ad buy worth about $700,000.\n\nNotably, Israel policy has not been a theme – it’s barely mentioned – in either candidate’s campaigns or the ads from the competing groups. But Levin, the lead sponsor of the Two-State Solution Act, has been more willing to criticize the Israeli government.\n\nProgressives have been scathing in their criticism of Democrats, like Stevens, who have accepted help from AIPAC, which also contributes to Republicans, including many who voted against certifying Biden’s 2020 election win. (AIPAC has essentially ignored the backlash, pointing to the Democrats it backs and saying it can’t advance its policy goals without bipartisan support.)\n\nAnother well-known progressive, Rep. Rashida Tlaib, has attracted less attention from pro-Israel groups and, despite an influx of moderate outside cash against her, is the favorite to win nomination again in the redrawn 12th District.\n\nHow much does Trump’s impeachment still matter?\n\nA lot has changed in the last 18 months since Trump was impeached for a second time. But two Republican incumbents – Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse – will face voters for the first time since joining Democrats to impeach the then-President.\n\nA flurry of factors – not only how removed politics is from that impeachment vote – have Republicans in Washington skeptical that both Herrera Beutler and Newhouse will be ousted: Both incumbents have outspent their challengers, the fields are large and fractured and Washington State’s open primary system allows people to vote for any candidate, regardless of affiliation.\n\n“If the vote was held a month (after the impeachment decision), they probably would have lost,” said a top Washington Republican operative. “But given 9% inflation, given the high gas prices we saw, if you are talking with conservative voters, they may be more concerned with the current situation in the country than they are 16 or 18 months ago.”\n\nHerrera Beutler is facing author Heidi St. John, who has received a burst of super PAC money; state Rep. Vicki Kraft; and retired special forces officer Joe Kent, who Trump has backed. While Newhouse faces former NASCAR driver Jarod Sessler, state Rep. Brad Klippert and vocal election denier Loren Culp, who has been endorsed by Trump.\n\nHerrera Beutler and Newhouse aren’t the only decisions for Republicans on Tuesday. The party will also look to nominate a candidate to face Democratic Sen. Patty Murray. Tiffany Smiley is seen as the leading Republican in the race, but Washington voters have not been represented by a Republican in the Senate since 2001.", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg Eric Bradner Dan Merica", "Gregory Krieg", "Eric Bradner", "Dan Merica"], "publish_date": "2022/08/02"}]}

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 16th of August 2023. Today, a closer look at some of the unique challenges for Trump and his Georgia indictment. Plus, Hunter Biden's lawyer asked to quit his case, and we return to Hawaii where teams are working to identify bodies after the Maui fires.\n\n♦\n\nDonald Trump's latest indictment, this time in Georgia, presents some unique challenges for the former president. I spoke with USA TODAY Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page to learn more. Susan, thanks for making the time.\n\nSusan Page:\n\nHey, Taylor, it's always great to be with you.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo this is the fourth time Trump has faced criminal charges since leaving the White House. But, Susan, you write that there are several ways that this trial will not be like the others. For starters, there's actually tape of a prominent phone call in this case. What's on that call, Susan?\n\nSusan Page:\n\nWell, this is the call that Trump had on January 2nd, 2021 with the Georgia Secretary of State, a Republican office holder, in which he basically urged him, coaxed him, threatened him, asking him to find the 11,000 votes he needed to carry Georgia. And Brad Raffensperger declined to do that and said that the vote had been counted accurately, had been recounted and confirmed, and that he wasn't going to do it. It didn't deter Trump. And so in this case, this is a telephone call that seemed quite understandable and maybe very difficult for the former president to explain away.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd this trial will be on television. Why might that prove to be significant?\n\nSusan Page:\n\nI don't know if you're old enough to remember the OJ Simpson trial, but I am. It transfixed the nation. Everybody was watching it. 57% of Americans were watching the verdict being read in the OJ Simpson trial. And can you imagine the ratings that Donald Trump vs. the State of Georgia could get on TV? It's really a way for Americans to take a look on their own about the arguments being made for and against the former president and the other 18 people who have been indicted with him and make their own decisions about who they believe.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSusan, we know this idea of pardons has come up in other indictments for Trump. What are the complications around being pardoned in Georgia?\n\nSusan Page:\n\nWell, for one thing, even if Donald Trump manages to win another election, a president can't pardon someone of a state crime. Now, of course, Georgia is a Republican-leaning state. It has a Republican governor at the moment and in the recent past, but the governor can't pardon someone in Georgia either. The constitution in the state establishes an independent board that decides on pardons. And just one other thing about that board, it doesn't do preemptive pardons, so it can't give you a get out of jail free card before you've been convicted. And after you're convicted, the guidelines say you have to complete your term before you can even ask for a pardon. So this looms as something that could be troublesome for Donald Trump.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWhat do we know about Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis as we see a local prosecutor take on a former president?\n\nSusan Page:\n\nI mean talk about David and Goliath. It's not like she's backed up by the Department of Justice the way the federal special counsel is. She has been elected, she's in her first term as the DA of Fulton County. But, man, she is somebody with guts. She has outlined a really sweeping indictment, one 98 pages long with 41 counts, and she uses the racketeering statute, the one that was designed really to take down the mob, to argue that Trump was leading a criminal enterprise. And I'll tell you one thing interesting about Fani Willis. She used that racketeering statute before against a group of public school teachers in a test scandal case. She won and she sent some of those teachers to jail.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSusan, stepping back to look at the possible political ramifications here, Trump's base has stuck by him in past indictments. What does this particular one mean for him politically?\n\nSusan Page:\n\nWell, in the short term, these indictments, they've not just stuck with him, it's strengthened his position, it's strengthened his fundraising. It's solidified his standing in the polls. It's taken all the oxygen out of the room for his Republican rivals for the party's nomination. So in the short term, I think there's no reason to think this indictment will do anything but that. But in the long term, that could be a different story when you go to an electorate that includes a lot of Independent voters who may be watching these legal actions with some concern.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Susan Page, it should be a fascinating next few weeks and months. Thanks for your insight as always.\n\nSusan Page:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHunter Biden's top criminal attorney has asked a federal judge in Delaware to allow him to withdraw as Biden's counsel. He made the request saying he could become a witness in the case after the collapse of a plea agreement he had negotiated with prosecutors. The attorney, Christopher Clark, filed the motion yesterday citing questions about Biden's now defunct plea agreement on tax charges and a diversion agreement on a gun possession offense.\n\nBiden will continue to be represented by other attorneys. Earlier this summer, he agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor charges of tax evasion in exchange for prosecutors recommending that he receive probation instead of jail time. The deal also called for him to participate in a pretrial program for a gun possession offense. After the judge refused to accept the plea agreement, Hunter Biden pleaded not guilty to failing to pay more than $100,000 in taxes in 2017 and 2018. He faces a separate charge for possessing a firearm in 2018 as a drug user.\n\n♦\n\nThe death toll has risen to 106 in this month's Maui fires and nearly 3000 homes and other structures have been destroyed in the historic town of Lahaina. Search teams continue to work through the wreckage with their latest task finding and identifying the dead. I spoke with USA TODAY National Correspondent Trevor Hughes to learn more. Thanks for making the time, Trevor.\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo the death toll continues to rise from the Maui fires as officials work to identify the dead. What does this difficult process entail?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nWell, you're talking about a wildfire being driven by wind. And so we're not talking about a campfire, we're not talking about a bonfire that people are perhaps familiar with. We're talking about a fire that might've hit 1000 degrees, 2000 degrees, a fire that's hot enough to melt the engine of a car. That's how hot these fires are. The sad reality is that the human body cannot withstand that kind of heat. And so tragically people are reduced literally to ashes. And so it's a very painstaking and slow process to try and identify where bodies are and then who those people were.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTrevor, are these teams moving fragments to another site or how exactly does the identification process work?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nWe were talking to experts about this and they were making the point that this is very complicated and difficult work. And so in many cases what happens is, first, cadaver sniffing dogs are used to search the area to see if there's any trace of humans. And then they bring in forensic anthropologists who are able to identify by sight all of the bones of the human body. And there are 206 bones in the human body. These forensic anthropologists, in some cases are literally sifting through ashes trying to separate charred bone from pieces of drywall. And of course this is a very solemn and significant task and people take it very seriously. But, yes, ultimately what happens is that as best as they can, these remains that are recovered are removed from the site where someone passed away and they are brought to a central location and ultimately turned back over to their families and their loved ones.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTrevor, what dangers are still present in the search areas for both people and even some of these rescue dogs working on site?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nWhen you have these fires that come through residential areas, you've got all this material inside. Houses, rugs, carpets, sofas, those are all made of all kinds of different chemicals. And then you've also got basic household cleaners or gasoline, bleach, pesticides, all of that gets burned and kicked up into the air and then settles back down as dust. So you have these rescue workers who are working under these very tough conditions trying to protect themselves from what is frankly toxic waste. And then in what I find a very heartbreaking element of it, the canine search dogs that are being used to look for bodies, to look for cadavers, in some cases they end up being exposed to these very toxic chemicals day after day, hour after hour.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTrevor, we've seen searches through destruction before, be it after 9/11 or, say, the Surfside collapsed more recently in Florida where search and rescue teams go through immense trauma themselves working through this debris, as you've mentioned. What is the toll on workers' mental health on site?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nIt's horrifying to sort of think about this idea that you are quartering in very, very small increments someone's home where someone lived and someone died. These workers are taking in a lot of trauma to do this day after day because it's not just physically exhausting, but it's emotionally exhausting because you know that family members are depending on you to say, where is my loved one? Where's my mother? Where's my father? Can you help me? And I know these rescue workers because I've talked to them over the years, they are so focused on trying to help those families. It takes a real toll.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Trevor Hughes, thanks for your time and reporting here. Really appreciate it.\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMeanwhile, the Associated Press reports that videos show downed power lines might be to blame as a possible cause of the fires, though officials are still investigating. And President Joe Biden said he and First Lady Jill Biden will travel to the state in the coming days.\n\n♦\n\nRetired NFL Offensive lineman Michael Oher's story was portrayed in the 2009 movie The Blind Side, based on a book of the same name by Michael Lewis. The Hollywood version of the story is that Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy made Oher, then in the foster system, a member of their family, which included two children. Oher then went on to become a star football player, first in college at Ole Miss, then in the NFL where he helped the Ravens win the Super Bowl in 2013.\n\nBut in a 14-page petition filed yesterday in Tennessee court, Oher alleges that the couple never legally adopted him and instead deceived him into making them his conservators, giving the couple legal authority to make business dealings in his name. The petition also alleges that the Tuohies secured a royalties deal for themselves and their children for The Blind Side while Oher received nothing. The film made more than $300 million at the box office, and Sandra Bullock won the Oscar for best actress. Through their lawyers, the Tuohy family responded yesterday calling the move a shakedown.\n\n♦\n\nTesla's new Standard Range versions of its popular Model X and Model S vehicles are significantly cheaper than the regular versions of those cars, about $10,000 so. But there's a major caveat, they can't travel as far on one charge. The Model X's Standard vehicle has an estimated range of 269 miles, 79 miles less than its more expensive version. And the Model S range is reduced by about 85 miles. Both also have a slightly slower acceleration rate. You can read more at usatoday.com/cars.\n\nAnd thanks for listening to 5 Things.

Follow our latest coverage here.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO – California declared a state of emergency Wednesday as a powerful storm generated 45-foot waves out at sea, dropped soaking rain on already saturated ground, and prompted warnings of floods and mudslides, knocking out power to more than 100,000 people.\n\nThe storm was expected to dump up to 6 inches of rain in parts of the San Francisco Bay Area where most of the region would remain under flood warnings into late Thursday night. In Southern California, the storm was expected to peak in intensity overnight into early Thursday morning with Santa Barbara and Ventura counties likely to see the most rain, forecasters said.\n\nOn Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom authorized state National Guard units to support disaster response as a massive storm pummeled much of the state's coastline.\n\nFire and rescue equipment and personnel have been prepositioned in areas deemed most likely to experience severe flooding and mudflows.\n\nGRAPHICS:'Rivers in the sky': Graphics show atmospheric river soaking California's Bay Area\n\n\"If you've still got power, it's a good idea to charge your cellphone, computers and tablets now while you can,\" said National Weather Service meteorologist Cynthia Palmer in the agency's San Francisco area office. If the power goes out, having access to timely information about the storm – and something to watch – will be useful, she said.\n\nThe storm is termed a \"bomb cyclone\" because it is expected to be marked by a quick drop in atmospheric pressure resulting in a high-intensity storm.\n\n\"All told it's about a 30-hour event from start to finish,\" said Rick Canepa, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's San Francisco office. \"The rain won't be done until Thursday afternoon or early evening.\"\n\nSevere weather could drop 10 or more inches of rain in some parts of Northern California over the next week, forecasters say. Wednesday's storm was expected to knock down trees, cause widespread flooding, wash out roads, cause hillsides to collapse, slow airports and potentially lead to the \"loss of human life,\" the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut officials warn even then the danger isn't over. Forecasters are watching other systems out at sea that could also hit the region with more precipitation.\n\nMeanwhile, California wasn't the only place facing severe weather on Wednesday. A possible tornado touched down near Montgomery, Alabama, early Wednesday. There were no deaths but the twister damaged more than 50 homes.\n\nFlood-related deaths confirmed in Sacramento; motorists rescued\n\nTwo more bodies were found Wednesday after flooding in a rural part of south Sacramento County, authorities said, bringing the death toll from the atmospheric river storm on New Year's Eve to three.\n\nThe third body was found in a vehicle that was submerged in water , said Sgt. Amar Gandhi, a Sacramento County Sheriff's Office spokesman.\n\nThe victim had not been identified and there was no additional information about the incident, Gandhi said Wednesday night.\n\nDuring the morning, California Highway Patrol officers found the body of a woman while recovering vehicles that got stuck due to flooding.\n\nOn Sunday, authorities discovered the body of a man inside a submerged vehicle. Gandhi said rescue efforts in Sacramento County are ongoing.\n\nElsewhere across Northern California communities, several motorists were rescued from flooded roads and fallen trees.\n\nThe San Francisco Fire Department rescued a family Wednesday night after fallen trees on a city road trapped the family.\n\nCalifornia residents face outages\n\nWith heavy rain saturating the ground and strong winds, trees are more likely to fall and can cause widespread power outages, according to Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources.\n\nOfficials and power companies warned residents to prepare for possible outages due to the storm by creating emergency kits and keeping essential devices charged.\n\nNearly 178,000 homes and businesses were in the dark Wednesday night, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages. Most outages were reported on the north coast of the state.\n\nHelping homeless people from storm\n\nAt the foot of San Francisco’s Bernal Heights neighborhood, Magaly Rowell waited for her bus under an umbrella at what passes for a bus shelter next to Precita Park. She was defying the elements not because of her job at a security company, but to feed homeless people at a nearby church, something Rowell said she does daily.\n\n“It’s not so bad if there’s no wind,” Rowell said as her umbrella got pelted by the rain and torrents of water flowed down Folsom Street. “It gets harder when the wind picks up like today. I worry about the homeless people. They’re the ones who suffer the most when the weather gets like this.”\n\nEvacuations ordered in coastal cities\n\nOfficials in Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara issued evacuation orders Wednesday as the huge storm puts the coastal areas at high risk due to potential mudslides and flooding.\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were issued for those living in burn scar areas in Santa Barbara County due to potential flooding and debris flows, Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown announced during a Wednesday news conference.\n\nThe Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office issued numerous evacuation orders for southern parts of the county throughout Wednesday due to concerns over potential flooding and debris flow from storm conditions.\n\nFlight disruptions amid powerful storm\n\nWith its high winds and heavy rains, the storm is already causing flight disruptions in the Bay Area with more anticipated to come as the peak approaches.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, San Francisco International Airport has experienced 74 flight cancellations, accounting for 8% of all flights.\n\nAbout 191 flights have been delayed by an average of 35 minutes, according to Doug Yakel, a public information officer for the airport. \"Delays and cancellations are a result of both the reduced ceilings and winds,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\n\"In regards to general airport operations here at OAK, our operations team is prepared,\" a spokesperson for Oakland International Airport told USA TODAY. Passengers with flights to and from Oakland are strongly encouraged to check with their airline through their mobile app or website for updates on their flights.\n\nTravel waivers for flights disrupted by California's \"bomb cyclone\":\n\nSouthwest Airlines is offering free rebooking for flights scheduled for Wednesday, for flights to and from Oakland, Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose. The rebooking must have the same city pairs and travel dates within 14 days of the original travel date.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Delta Air Lines issued a travel waiver for flights scheduled on Thursday and Friday to or from San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento, San Jose, and Fresno.

This particular storm, it’s all flood mitigation.’’\n\nA few doors to the east, Grace Daryanani at Bulls Head restaurant has sandbags and wet/dry vacuum cleaners at the ready.

The National Weather Service in the Bay Area delivered a rare admonition saying the coming \"brutal\" storm system \"needs to be taken seriously.\"\n\n\"Honestly, the biggest story right now is the winds,\" said Palmer. Coastal areas could be hit with winds in the 40 to 50 mph range, while some mountain areas could get gusts as high as 80 mph.\n\nFlooding and landslides likely\n\nBecause the ground was already saturated with the more than 5 inches of rain that fell on New Year's Eve, Wednesday's storm could cause severe problems and damage in some areas.\n\n\"The main concern is the smaller watersheds and steep slopes. So mudslides, shallow landslides and urban and small creek flooding could get quite significant for a period of time on Wednesday night in some locations,\" said Daniel Swain, a climatologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nSevere weather, possible tornadoes in South\n\nThe South, too, was being hit with intense weather Wednesday. Heavy rains, flash floods and severe weather were seen in a swath across Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina.\n\nA possible tornado touched down in east Montgomery, Alabama at 3:14 a.m. on Wednesday.\n\nRodney Penn, who was home when the storm hit, said a fallen tree limb broke out the windows in his wife's car but there was no structural damage to his apartment.\n\n“It literally sounded like there were a thousand baseball bats hitting the side of the house at the same time,” Penn said.\n\nIn South Carolina, five counties were under a tornado watch Wednesday.\n\nHeavy rain in California not an end to drought in West\n\nThe extreme drought conditions California has struggled under are helping avert some possible flooding because many of the state's larger reservoirs are still quite low, said Swain.\n\n\"They have a lot of headroom right now to absorb a lot of water,\" he said.\n\nThe state finds itself in the middle of a flood emergency even as it's in the middle of a drought emergency, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources said during a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"A lot of our trees are stressed after three years of intensive drought, the ground is saturated and there is a significant chance of downed trees that will create significant problems, potentially flooding problems, potentially power problems,\" she said.\n\nWhile the rains are likely to alleviate the short-term drought in Northern California along the coast, they will do little in terms of bringing drought relief to the West as a whole.\n\n\"It won't really help move the needle in the Colorado basin but it certainly will in central and northern California,\" Swain said.\n\nMore water is on the way\n\nThere are two more possible storms also out in the Pacific, one that could arrive late Friday and run into Sunday and then another possible storm that could arrive Tuesday, Canepa said.\n\nBoth could bring higher-than-normal rain levels through the middle of January.\n\nThere's a wide range of uncertainty for next week, ranging from a couple of additional moderate storms which wouldn't cause too many problems to one or possibly more atmospheric river events.\n\nWhat's an atmospheric river?\n\nThe storm, the second of three or possibly four headed toward the California coast, is coming from across the Pacific ocean. It's what's known as an atmospheric river or, to use the term more common a few years ago, a Pineapple Express because it originates over Hawaii.\n\nThese storms bring heavy rainfall and occur when a line of warm, moist air flows from near the islands across the Pacific Ocean to the West Coast.\n\nWhen it reaches the cooler air over the western landmass, the water vapor falls as heavy rain. Atmospheric rivers are long, flowing regions of the atmosphere that carry water vapor across a swath of sky 250 to 375 miles wide. They can be more than 1,000 miles long – and can carry more water than the Mississippi River.\n\nContributing: Dinah Voyles Pulver and Kathleen Wong, USA TODAY; Evan Mealins and Alex Gladden, Montgomery Advertiser; Hannah Workman, The Record", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/01/09/california-weather-storm-flooding-mudslides-updates/11016634002/", "title": "California weather: 14 dead as storm threatens more major flooding", "text": "LOS ANGELES — Exactly five years after a devastating mudslide killed 23 people and destroyed more than 100 homes in coastal Montecito, California, about 10,000 residents of the Santa Barbara County community and its surrounding canyons were ordered to evacuate Monday amid the downpours that continue to pound the state.\n\nThe National Weather Service said up to 8 inches of rain had fallen in 12 hours, and plenty more was expected.

The Pensacola Bay Bridge also closed Tuesday morning amid wind and rain, and over the course of the day, it is likely that more and more routes to coastal communities will be cut off.\n\nIn Alabama, Gov. Kay Ivey also issued a state of an emergency closing Alabama's beaches. The causeway to Dauphin Island, which was already flooding, was closed, and downtown Mobile was nearly deserted. Ivey warned residents living along the Gulf, especially south of Interstate 10 or in low-lying areas, to evacuate if conditions permit.\n\n“This is not worth risking your life,” Ivey said during a news conference Tuesday.\n\nSally had threatened to batter New Orleans, where thousands of evacuees from Hurricane Laura were staying, but turned east over the past day.

Use CNN’s lite site for low bandwidth.\n\nCNN —\n\nHurricane Ian keeps getting stronger as it barrels toward Florida, prompting urgent evacuations and threatening dangerous storm surges in places not used to getting hit directly by a hurricane.\n\nIan is now a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale, according to a 5 p.m. ET update from the Miami-based National Hurricane Center. The eye of the storm is located around 150 miles southeast of the western tip of Cuba and Ian is moving north-northwest near 13 mph, the center said.\n\nFlorida could start feeling Ian’s wrath as early as Tuesday, with hurricane conditions potentially hitting the state Wednesday.\n\nThe hurricane center’s forecast for Ian “has shown an unprecedented rate of strengthening from a tropical storm to powerful hurricane,” CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said.\n\nIan’s winds intensified from 85 mph Monday afternoon to 100 mph at 5 p.m. ET. Forecasters expect Ian to become a major hurricane before it lashes the US, with winds reaching 111 mph or greater.\n\n#Ian is expected to be a major hurricane in the eastern Gulf of\n\nMexico during the middle of this week. Regardless of Ian’s exact track, there is a risk of a life-threatening storm surge, hurricane-force winds, & heavy rainfall along the west coast/Panhandle of Florida by mid-week pic.twitter.com/koVmW9yrtJ — National Weather Service (@NWS) September 26, 2022\n\nConditions in western Cuba are expected to deteriorate this evening and through the night, with “significant wind and storm surge impacts expected,” the hurricane center said. Ian will likely be a Category 3 with winds of 120 mph or greater when it moves over Cuba Tuesday morning, forecasters say, and it’s also expected to produce flash flooding and possible mudslides in parts of Jamaica and Cuba.\n\nA total of 19,283 people have been evacuated from their homes in the Western Cuban province of Pinar del Río, according to the state news channel TelePinar.\n\n“Storm surge could raise water levels by as much as 9 to 14 feet above normal tide levels along the coast of western Cuba in areas of onshore winds in the hurricane warning area tonight and early Tuesday,” the center said.\n\nIn the US, more than 15 million people are expected to suffer at least tropical storm-force winds in cities including Tampa, Orlando, Tallahassee and Jacksonville, Miller said.\n\nA storm surge warning has been added for portions of western Florida with 5 to 10 feet of surge possible, according to the latest advisory. The warning of “life-threatening inundation” stretches from Anclote River southward to Flamingo and includes Tampa Bay.\n\nThe hurricane watch from Englewood to the Anclote River, including Tampa Bay, has been upgraded to a hurricane warning, according to the latest advisory from the hurricane center. This means “hurricane conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, in this case, within 24 to 36 hours,” the center said.\n\nLive updates: Florida braces for Hurricane Ian\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a statement Monday that tropical storm-force winds may begin as soon as Monday night in the Florida Keys and south Florida. “Storm surge has the potential to impact much of Florida’s west coast, with the highest risk from Ft. Myers to the Tampa Bay region,” the statement read.\n\n‘The storm of a lifetime’ for Tampa Bay\n\nWhile projection models show a wide range of possible paths, one fear is evident: The Tampa area, on the western side of Florida, could get its first direct hit from a hurricane since 1921. And that could be devastating.\n\n“The last major hurricane that actually made a direct hit was 100 years ago,” said meteorologist Rick Davis of the National Weather Service’s Tampa office. “So there’s a lot of people that have been brushed by hurricanes in the last five or 10 years in Florida.”\n\nDavis added: “We tell people even if they’re lifelong Floridians like myself, this is something that we haven’t seen in our lifetime… So we definitely need to take it seriously.”\n\nBut the area doesn’t need a direct hit to see catastrophic damage from flooding. Tampa Bay is extremely vulnerable to storm surge because water being pushed into it has nowhere to go.\n\nThe current forecast track for Hurricane Ian puts all of the Tampa Bay region – Tampa, St. Petersburg, Clearwater, Bradenton and others – on the right side of the storm, which would see winds push water northward into the bay, maximizing the inundation from storm surge. The current storm surge forecast for this area is up to 10 feet.\n\nThe center of the storm tracks within 10 miles of the St. Petersburg coastline in Pinellas County, near Clearwater, while also slowing the storm down to a walking pace between 3 to 4 mph on Thursday as it makes its closest pass.\n\nThe combination of mammoth storm surges and a stubborn, slow-moving hurricane could be disastrous for Pinellas County, officials there said.\n\n“It could potentially sit on top of us for 47 hours,” said Cathie Perkins, Pinellas County emergency management director. Officials are expecting 10 to 15 inches of rain, Perkins said.\n\nJamie Rhome, the National Hurricane Center acting director, told CNN Monday that Ian “would be the storm of a lifetime for many Tampa Bay residents.”\n\n‘If you can leave, just leave now’\n\nFishermen prepare to move their boats in Havana, Cuba, on Monday before the arrival of Hurricane Ian. Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters\n\nOn Florida’s west coast, officials urged residents to flee instead of staying to protect their property.\n\n“This is nothing to mess around with. If you can leave, just leave now,” Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said Monday. “You certainly could replace personal possessions. You can’t bring anyone back to life.”\n\nCastor said 49 shelters are open, including some accepting pets and others accommodating residents with special needs.\n\n“We’re not trying to instill fear,” Castor said. “We’re just asking everyone to be responsible, to be cognitive of what this storm can bring us.”\n\nMandatory evacuation orders were issued Monday for Zone A of Pinellas and Hillsborough counties. The Pinellas order goes into effect at 6 p.m. Monday, and the Hillsborough order went into effect at 2 p.m. Voluntary evacuation has been recommended for Zone B of Hillsborough, and emergency shelters are being opened, county administrator Bonnie Wise said Monday.\n\nEffective 6 p.m. today, all residents in Evacuation Zone A (including all mobile home residents) will be under mandatory evacuation orders.

Videos she took of the scene show water rippling past car wheels as rain continues to fall across the road.\n\n“I was able to back up on a ramp to get off the highway,” she said. “I took an alternate route home … although most streets are flooded down there as well.”\n\nHundreds of traffic accidents were reported during the flooding, according to Dallas police.\n\nStalled cars sit abandoned on the flooded Interstate 635 Service Road in Mesquite, Texas, on Monday. Juan Figueroa/The Dallas Morning News/Associated Press\n\nTraffic through the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport was also hard hit, with hundreds of flights to and from the airport canceled and about half of its departing flights delayed, according to tracking website FlightAware.\n\nThe heavy influx of water caused the sanitary sewers to overflow at several places throughout Dallas, the city said in a release Monday, noting that the city water system has not been impacted.\n\n“None of the overflows of diluted wastewater have affected the City’s water supply,” Dallas Water Utilities Department assistant director Zachary Peoples said.\n\nThe city is recommending that some people in the impacted areas use boiled or distilled water.\n\nThe sudden rainfall comes amidst a “flash drought,” which has brought an exceptionally dry year across regions of Texas, including the areas impacted my this week’s flooding.\n\nIn the first half of the year, areas of the state have experienced rainfall deficits of between 8-10 inches, according to the Drought Monitor. But those shortfalls will be essentially erased in Dallas due to the flooding, while other areas will still experience them, the agency said. In less than 24 hours between Sunday and Monday, Dallas had received an entire summer’s worth of rainfall – over 7 inches.\n\nThe frequency and intensity of rainfall over land have increased with every degree of the planet warming since the 1980s.\n\nA large share of precipitation in recent years has come during “intense, single-day events,” which scientists say will become more common because of the climate crisis, along with sudden shifts from severe drought to heavy rain.\n\nFlooding rainfall moves east\n\nCNN Weather\n\nThe wave of flooding rains is crawling to the east Tuesday morning and will continue its slow progression over the next couple of days.\n\nThe vast expanse of moisture gradually overtaking northern Louisiana during the overnight hours will continue to flourish as daylight breaks, the National Weather Service in Louisiana wrote Tuesday morning.\n\n“A very wet weather pattern will continue across portions of the southern U.S. from Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley over the next few days,” the Weather Prediction Center wrote Tuesday morning.\n\nThe WPC said that locations like the Dallas-Fort Worth area that received heavy rainfall amounts in the past 24 hours should be on the western fringe of the heavy rain.\n\n“The heaviest rains should shift eastward across northern Louisiana today,” the WPC added. “Followed by central and southern Mississippi on Wednesday, where rainfall totals of 3-5 inches with locally heavier amounts are likely over the next few days.”\n\nA moderate risk – level 3 of 4 – for excessive rainfall was issued by the WPC for people living in northern Lousiana and portions of southern Arkansas and central Mississippi. This means the WPC believes there is a 40% chance these storms could produce flash flooding similar to what this storm produced Monday in Texas.\n\n“Portions of northeast Texas into northwest Louisiana have the potential for 48-hour rainfall amounts nearing 6-8 inches,” the WPC said.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe Raja Razek", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Raja Razek"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/19/weather/buffalo-new-york-great-lakes-snowstorm-saturday/index.html", "title": "Buffalo snow: Historic storm slams western New York with nearly 6 ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA historic snowstorm is slamming western New York state Saturday with more than 6 feet of snow in some places, closing roads, triggering driving bans and canceling flights the weekend before the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nAnother round of heavy lake-effect snowfall is expected to return to the Buffalo area Saturday night, according to the National Weather Service. With most of the heavy snow bands falling over Lake Ontario, north of metro Buffalo on Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Even though the band will be moving quickly, it is possible that additional amounts around a half foot or so could occur across the Buffalo metro area,” the National Weather Service said.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, New York Governor Kathy Hochul touted the state’s storm preparedness and said crews have been working tirelessly to manage the situation.\n\n“This is the effort we’ve brought together: bringing resources, people, equipment from all over the state of New York. And because we were so preemptive in this strike, we were able to avert many tragedies,” Hochul said.\n\nShe thanked western New Yorkers for shutting down major highways, implementing travel bans and staying home before the snow started to fall which helped prevent accidents, protect human life and ensure roads are safe and clear for emergency services.\n\nHochul said she is doubling the number of New York National Guard members on the ground in Erie County to check on residents and help with snow removal.\n\nShe is also signing a request for federal reimbursement through a Federal Emergency Disaster Declaration.\n\nSo far, snowfall totals of more than 6 feet have been recorded in two locations, according to the National Weather Service. Orchard Park, where the NFL’s Buffalo Bills play, has picked up 77.0 inches in the last 48 hours, and Natural Bridge, just east of Watertown, has picked up 72.3 inches; historic numbers for the area.\n\nAs the snowfall intensified, two county residents died from cardiac complications related to shoveling and attempting to clear the ground, said Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz.\n\n“We send our deepest sympathies and remind all that this snow is very heavy and dangerous,” Poloncarz said. “Please continue to avoid shoveling this very heavy, wet snow, and use caution and avoid overexertion if you must shovel today.”\n\nWinter weather alerts are still in effect for over 8 million people across six Great Lakes states Saturday evening: Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.\n\nForecasters and officials have been sounding the alarm on the life-threatening nature of this snowstorm, which is historic even for the Buffalo region where heavy snow is the norm during winter months.

He folded his hands on the table in front of him, put his head down and sat between his attorneys, Todd Blanche and John Lauro.\n\nTrump and his attorneys quietly talked among themselves, waiting for Magistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya to enter.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, who led the indictment, appeared to be 15 feet away from Trump, and the two exchanged a few looks at each other, including one from Smith that lasted longer than 20 seconds.\n\nThe hearing began more than 30 minutes after the former president first took a seat in the courtroom. He shook his head \"no\" as the criminal case was read.\n\nTrump offered his own plea: not guilty.\n\nBoth sides agreed to a \"speedy\" trial, though Trump's legal team has moved to delay court proceedings in previous cases.\n\nBefore his federal court appearance began, the former president called for the trial to be moved from heavily Democratic Washington, D.C., to a more Republican-friendly place like West Virginia.\n\n\"This Indictment is all about Election Interference!!!\" said the front-running Republican candidate on his Truth Social website.\n\nAs he left court late Thursday afternoon, chants of “lock him up” were heard outside the courtroom.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if anti-Trump protesters outnumbered Trump supporters, but they were certainly louder.\n\nJust before Trump boarded his Boeing 757, he told reporters the legal process is unfair.\n\n“This is a very sad day for America,” he said before leaving Reagan National Airport for New Jersey. As he held an umbrella to block the ongoing rain, Trump called the case the “persecution of a political opponent.”\n\n“This was never supposed to happen in America,\" he said, leaving Washington under a dark cloud.\n\nTrump faces 55 years in prison on the latest charges, Magistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya says\n\nDuring Trump’s arraignment, the presiding judge, Magistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya, told the former president that he faces a maximum of 55 years in prison if convicted on all counts.\n\nThat includes a potential sentence of not more than 5 years on the first count of Conspiracy to Defraud the United States. On the second count of Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Trump faces not more than 20 years in prison and a fine of not more than $250,000.\n\nIf convicted on the third count of Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding, Trump faces not more than 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 and supervised release of not more than 3 years.

Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse, where former President Donald Trump arrived in the case related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nTrump will appear in court after he allegedly engaged in an effort to steal the 2020 presidential election from Biden, but the president's portrait in the courthouse served as a quiet, symbolic reminder of the 2020 presidential election outcome.\n\nTrump, however, has not stopped repeating false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him, doing so in a Truth Social post just hours before his arrival at the courthouse in downtown Washington.\n\n− Miles J. Herszenhorn\n\nTrump in custody, has fingerprints taken\n\nFormer president Donald Trump was taken into custody for booking by the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nTrump had his fingerprints taken digitally after he arrived at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse in downtown Washington for his first court hearing in the case related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhile Trump was fingerprinted, he was not subjected to a mug shot as part of the booking process. The former president did not have his mug shot taken at his arraignments in New York state court and in Miami federal court.\n\nTrump will now be escorted to the courtroom for his arraignment.\n\n− Miles J. Herszenhorn\n\nTrump arrives at the courthouse\n\nTrump arrived at the E. Barrett Prettyman courthouse through its underground entrance. A grim-faced Trump entered the courtroom where he is expected to be arraigned wearing a navy blue suit, a red tie and a white shirt.\n\nSecurity monitored the room as Trump was led to his seat, and a group of spectators in the back of the courtroom watched Trump.\n\nMagistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya is overseeing Trump’s arraignment.\n\n-Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat is an arraignment?\n\nAn arraignment is when formal charges against an accused defendant are read by a judge. This takes place during a defendant’s first appearance before a judge, where they are told about the specific charges they are facing.\n\nTrump on Thursday will be asked how he wants to plead to the official charges. The former president is expected to plead not guilty as he has in two previous indictments.\n\nThe judge will then decide if bail is required. They can also choose to set no bail, which would allow Trump to be immediately released without being placed in jail.\n\n- Olivia Munson and Rachel Looker\n\nWhere is the Trump arraignment? Elijah Barrett Prettyman Courthouse\n\nTrump's appearance today at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse will be the latest historic moment in a federal courthouse that saw the Watergate trials and was home to parts of the Iran-Contra affair.\n\nSeven men, including two former White House aides, involved in the political scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation stood before Chief Federal District Judge John Sirica there. The courthouse also saw trials in the Iran-Contra affair, the 1980s scandal in which senior officials from President Ronald Reagan's administration were found guilty of facilitating secret and illegal arms sales.\n\nThe building was named in 1997 after a chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and originally constructed in the mid-1900s in D.C.'s Judiciary Square.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump surrenders as protesters, supporters gather at courthouse\n\nA group of anti-Trump protesters and Trump supporters gathered near the back of the courthouse where Trump entered.\n\nSome stood on large concrete planters to get a better view of his motorcade.\n\nBanging drums and speaking on microphones, Trump supporters yelled back and forth with those screaming “lock him up.”\n\n“Dirty Democrats,” one Trump supporter yelled on a megaphone.⁃ Rachel Looker\n\nIs Donald Trump going to jail?\n\nIf you're keeping score, this will be Trump's third arrest this year.\n\nA formal arrest is part of the arraignment process, as happened with Trump in New York state court in early April over hush money charges and in Florida federal court in June on allegations involving classified documents.\n\nThree arrests - and counting, possibly.\n\nA state grand jury in Atlanta is considering an indictment and arrest of Trump over efforts to reverse his election loss in Georgia.\n\nTrump is not in jail and will likely leave the courthouse after his arraignment.\n\nAfter the former president enters a plea to charges, the judge will decide if bail is required or set no bail, which would allow Trump to be released without serving jail time.\n\nHe has not been jailed after his previous indictments.\n\n-David Jackson and Rachel Looker\n\nWhat does indicted mean?\n\nAn indictment is a formal charging document that’s used when it’s believed a person committed a crime. It includes charges against a person and should be filed before a case can move forward in a court, David Weinstein, a former federal and state prosecutor, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nAn indictment means a grand jury decided that there’s “more likely than not” enough evidence – based on testimony – to move forward with charging a person, Weinstein said. In a federal court, all cases proceed via indictment.\n\n−Marina Pitofsky\n\nTrump indicted\n\nA grand jury in Washington indicted Trump on Tuesday on charges of conspiring with aides to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden, efforts that led to the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nHis two other indictments: A state case in New York involving hush money payments and a federal case in Florida alleging obstruction of justice and improper retention of classified documents.\n\nMagistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya\n\nTrump will appear before federal Magistrate Judge Moxila A. Upadhyaya to enter his plea. He is expected to answer not guilty to the four charges he faces.\n\nOnce the trial begins, Trump faces U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. A nominee of President Barack Obama, Chutkan has presided over other cases related to the January 6, 2021 insurrection. She is the only judge in D.C. who has given longer sentences to these defendants than what was requested by the Department of Justice.\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\nTrump 757, Trump Force One: What kind of plane does Trump have?\n\nThe former president used a private jet, owned by the Trump Organization, to arrive in Washington.\n\nDubbed “Trump Force One” by the man himself, the massive Boeing 757 cost $100 million, according to reports.\n\nIt also received a facelift amid the indictments to include a new paint job with his name in gold at the front of the aircraft.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nTrump arrives in the D.C. area, headed to the courthouse\n\nThe former president's plane has touched down at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, across the Potomac River from the nation's capital.\n\nAnother Trump motorcade now heads to the federal courthouse in downtown Washington, where he will be arrested, arraigned, and likely released on bond.\n\nThe arraignment is scheduled for 4 p.m.; then he heads back to Bedminster, N.J.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nMore press than protesters\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is expected to arrive at 4:00 p.m. for his arraignment at the federal courthouse in Washington, but less than two hours before his anticipated arrival members of the press continue to overwhelmingly outnumber protesters in front of the courthouse.\n\nSeveral dozen journalists are waiting inside the courthouse for the hearing to begin, with countless more media personnel operating cameras outside.\n\nWhile there have been no large demonstrations as of yet, a handful of anti-Trump and pro-Trump protesters have appeared outside the courthouse.\n\n− Miles J. Herszenhorn\n\nTrump takes off from Newark\n\nThe former president’s plane is airborne from Newark to Washington, D.C. The flight should take no more than 90 minutes.\n\nTrump's motorcade departed earlier from his golf club in Bedminster, N.J., en route to the Newark airport for the flight to Washington, D.C., and his latest federal court arraignment.\n\nProtesting all the way.\n\n\"I AM NOW GOING TO WASHINGTON, D.C., TO BE ARRESTED FOR HAVING CHALLENGED A CORRUPT, RIGGED, & STOLEN ELECTION,\" he said in all-caps post on Truth Social. \"IT IS A GREAT HONOR, BECAUSE I AM BEING ARRESTED FOR YOU. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nActually, Trump is accused of criminally conspiring with others to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump's plane is expected to take off from Newark at around 2 p.m.; it is expected to land near D.C. at around 3:30 p.m.\n\nThe arraignment at the federal courthouse in downtown Washington is scheduled for 4 p.m.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTrump's third arraignment: Here's what we know\n\n-Phillip Bailey\n\nTrump indictment in full\n\nTrump is facing four charges in the election interference indictment:\n\nConspiracy to defraud the United States\n\nConspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding\n\nObstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding\n\nConspiracy against rights\n\nRead the indictment here and below.\n\n-Rachel Looker\n\nWill Trump's arraignment be televised?\n\nNo. Cameras and other broadcasting equipment are not allowed inside federal courtrooms, meaning today's proceedings will not be televised.\n\nHis June arraignment in Miami, where he faced felony charges related to the mishandling of classified documents, was also not televised for the same reason.\n\n-Savannah Kuchar\n\n‘This one could possibly negatively affect him’\n\nStephen Corson, 66, estimates he has stood on the corner outside the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington 40 times in the last few months.\n\nOn the day of Trump’s indictment, he plans to stand there all day. This indictment is different, he said.\n\n“I think this one could possibly negatively affect him,” he said of Trump’s third indictment ahead of the 2024 election. “It’s like I’ve said to everybody, if they don’t knock him off of these indictments this election, they might just say he can’t run soon.”\n\nCorson has spent every night in Washington, D.C. outside of the prison where rioters from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack have been detained. He holds a two-hour vigil each night protesting what he says has been their unfair treatment.\n\nTo him, Trump’s third indictment differs from the past two.\n\n“It’s in the federal city. They’re making a big deal out of it. They’re allowing it to fester and grow and be a big deal,” he said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nTrump supporters balk at indictment charges\n\nHours before Donald Trump arrived for his third indictment, a smattering of Trump’s supporters gathered outside the courthouse in Washington to support the former president and criticize the charges Trump faces.\n\nDaniel Demoura, 32, stood outside the courthouse clad in a t-shirt that read “free the J6 political prisoners.”\n\n“The people have their own freedom of choice to do whatever they want and protest,” Demoura told USA TODAY, saying the mob that breached the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, made their own choices and weren't incited by Trump. “I’m here, Trump didn’t tell me to come. I came because I support the man.”\n\n-Ken Tran\n\n‘The guy is a con artist:’ Chris Christie supporter knocks Trump\n\nDomenic Santana, 61, said he believes Trump should have been imprisoned and is not fit to hold office. Santana said he also appeared outside the courthouse where Trump was arraigned in Miami, Florida, last month in the classified documents case against him.\n\n“The reality is the guy is a con artist,” Santana said. “He’s gotten away with it.”\n\nSantana - a supporter of 2024 GOP candidate Chris Christie - said he supports the former New Jersey Gov. because he says what he means and means what he says.\n\n“We got to look at another game plan to be able to beat Trump at his own game and since he plays dirty, I’m telling the Democrats to wake up, change parties and vote on the Republican primaries for Christie and get Trump out of there,” Santana said.\n\n- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhen is Trump getting arraigned?\n\nThe former president is expected in court at 4 p.m. Thursday.\n\nIn anticipation of his arrival, television production trucks and cameras continued to line the street Thursday morning outside the E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse. Security increased overnight outside the courthouse and fences appeared around the perimeter of the building, as former President Donald Trump is expected to make his first appearance in the case related to his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 president election results. Journalists are currently being let into the courthouse as they attempt to gain access to a seat in the courtroom or into the overflow room for members of the media. — Miles J. Herszenhorn\n\n'We've come on the best day'\n\nColeby Adkin, 18, a tourist from Nottingham, England, said her family decided to walk past the courthouse on their way to a tour of the Capitol because they saw the television cameras. “It’s pretty weird, to be fair, because we’ve not had anything like this in England,” said Adkin while watching a protestor wave a “Trump or Death” flag. “We’ve come on the best day to come to DC,” she added. After watching the theatrics outside the courthouse, Adkin said her desire to attend college in the U.S. has only increased. “It’s crazy,” she added. “I hope to come back here.”\n\n— Miles J. Herszenhorn\n\nBill Barr on Trump indictment\n\nBill Barr told CNN last night the former president “knew well that he had lost.\"\n\n\"We’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg on this,\" Barr said. \"I think there is a lot more to come, and I think they have a lot more evidence as to President Trump’s state of mind.\"\n\nBarr was attorney general during the Trump administration, years after serving in the position under President George H.

The first was at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla., the second at his summer home on the golf course at Bedminster, N.J.\n\nAfter his June arraignment in Miami, Trump also made an unscheduled stop at a local Cuban restaurant to soak up support from some of his voters.\n\nAs of now, the schedule calls for Trump to simply return to Bedminster after his court appearance in Washington, D.C. - though it seems likely that he will get his message out in some form or fashion.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nMike Pence: Trump relied on 'crackpot lawyers'\n\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence is mimicking Trump's defense that he relied on legal advice in pursuing protests of the 2020 election - but he has a much different assessment of the former president's attorneys themselves.\n\n\"President Trump and his gaggle of crackpot lawyers asked me to reject electoral votes and chaos would have ensued,\" Pence said on the social media website X.\n\nPence has repeated his \"crackpot\" jibe in interviews and public comments. Trump responded by saying on Truth Social that \"I feel badly for Mike Pence\" and that \"the V.P. had power that Mike didn’t understand.\"\n\nOne of his ex-lawyers, John Eastman, fired back with an insult of his own, telling an interviewer that Pence chose to act like \"a potted plant.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nAdvocates: Third indictment will ‘resonate more’ with Americans\n\nSvante Myrick, president of People for the American Way, a progressive advocacy group, said Trump’s third indictment is the most important one out of the three he faces.\n\n“This one he was trying to invalidate 80 million people’s votes,” he told USA TODAY, adding that the crimes the former president is accused of in the indictment are “the most serious I could imagine.”\n\nMyrick said the third indictment resonates more with the American people because they watched the culmination of the crimes on their TV screens during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\n“This we all saw,”” he said.\n\nHe thinks Trump faces greater legal jeopardy for charges included in the third indictment than in other cases\n\n“I for the first time thought oh Donald Trump might spend the rest of his life in prison because of what’s alleged,” he said.\n\nChristian Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women, told USA TODAY Trump’s third indictment unveils the gravity behind his actions to voters.\n\n“This indictment shows the seriousness of everything with the election. I think it’s more powerful and it’s putting more heat (on Trump) as people see everything as it starts to unfold,” Nunes said, adding she thought the indictment was “long overdue.”\n\n- Rachel Looker and Ken Tran\n\nWhat's next for Trump? A Georgia indictment?\n\nTuesday’s federal indictment of former President Donald Trump for efforts to overturn the 2020 election is focusing attention on a Georgia investigation that may soon deepen Trump’s legal peril.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is expected within the next few weeks to seek a grand jury indictment for efforts to overturn the state’s elections in 2020.\n\nIn Atlanta this week, recently erected orange barriers stood around the Fulton County courthouse, with one street lined with police cars as part of security preparations. Over the weekend, Willis shared a racist threat with county commissioners and urged them to “stay safe,” as first reported by the AJC.\n\nOn Monday, a Fulton County Superior Court Judge rejected a request from Trump to toss the findings of a special grand jury and disqualify Willis.\n\nDetails of the Georgia investigation that have become public have fed speculation that Willis, a Democrat, is building a case under the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, which would allow her to charge numerous people in a potentially wide-ranging scheme, according to the AP.\n\nWillis’ investigation began more than two years ago, after a recording of Trump’s 2021 call to Georgia’s secretary of state asking him to “find” 11,780 votes.\n\nThat incident was part of Tuesday’s federal indictment, which alleged that Trump induced Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to alter the state’s count of the popular vote and questioned the validity of Biden’s electors’ votes.\n\nRaffensperger on Wednesday declined to comment on the federal indictment.\n\nSome Georgia Republican lawmakers dismissed it, with Republican Congressman Mike Collins saying it was a “sham prosecution” in statement posted on social media and calling for funding cuts to the DOJ.\n\nGeorgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called it a “communist attack” on X, formerly Twitter, and said she would “still vote for Trump even if he’s in jail.”\n\n-Chris Kenning\n\nTrump plans post-indictment campaign stops in South Carolina and New Hampshire\n\nTrump's third indictment will in no way keep him off the Republican campaign trail - he has events coming up in two early primary states.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump is scheduled to headline the South Carolina Republican Party's annual Silver Elephant Dinner in Columbia.\n\nThe Trump campaign has also announced that Trump will travel on Tuesday to New Hampshire to deliver a speech at a high school in Windham.\n\n-David Jackson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/06/politics/trump-organization-fraud-trial-verdict/index.html", "title": "Trump Organization found guilty on all counts of criminal tax fraud ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA Manhattan jury has found two Trump Organization companies guilty on multiple charges of criminal tax fraud and falsifying business records connected to a 15-year scheme to defraud tax authorities by failing to report and pay taxes on compensation for top executives.\n\nThe Trump Corp. and Trump Payroll Corp. were found guilty on all charges they faced.\n\nDonald Trump and his family were not charged in this case, but the former president was mentioned repeatedly during the trial by prosecutors about his connection to the benefits doled out to certain executives, including company-funded apartments, car leases and personal expenses.\n\nThe Trump Organization could face a maximum of $1.61 million in fines when sentenced in mid-January. The company is not at risk of being dismantled because there is no mechanism under New York law that would dissolve the company. However, a felony conviction could impact its ability to do business or obtain loans or contracts.\n\nThe guilty verdict comes as Trump is under scrutiny by federal and state prosecutors for his handling of classified documents, the effort to overturn the 2020 election results, and the accuracy of the Trump Organization’s business records and financial statements. He is also facing a $250 million civil lawsuit from the New York attorney general alleging he and his adult children were involved in a decade-long fraud. The attorney general is seeking to permanently bar them from serving as an officer or director of a company in New York state, among other penalties.\n\nTrump Org. attorneys said they plan to appeal.\n\n“This was a case about greed and cheating,” Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. “The Trump Corporation and the Trump Payroll Corporation got away with a scheme that awarded high-level executives with lavish perks and compensation while intentionally concealing the benefits from the taxing authorities to avoid paying taxes. Today’s verdict holds these Trump companies accountable for their long-running criminal scheme.”\n\nWhen asked on “CNN This Morning” Wednesday why charges weren’t brought against the former president, Bragg said the investigation is ongoing.\n\n“This was a chapter in it. A case against the corporations,” Bragg said.\n\nCNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Elie Honig said Bragg’s approach has been vindicated.\n\n“Obviously, this is a setback for the Trump Org. – a major setback for the Trump Org. They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/01/donald-trump-indicted-election-fraud-live-updates/70476879007/", "title": "Donald Trump indicted on 4 counts in 2020 election investigation", "text": "WASHINGTON – A federal grand jury indicted former President Donald Trump on Tuesday for conspiring to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden, including actions that led to the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which the prosecutor described as \"an unprecedented assault\" on democracy.\n\n\"It was fueled by lies − lies by the defendant,\" special counsel Jack Smith said as the indictment was unsealed.\n\nTrump, now facing his third criminal case, has denied wrongdoing and denounced the indictment as an attempt to derail his 2024 presidential candidacy.\n\nTrump indicted in Jan. 6 probe: What we know so far\n\nThe indictment details multiple strategies Trump and his allies are accused of using in an attempt to overturn his election loss.\n\nOne of the methods Trump allegedly used in a bid to steal the election involved a “fake elector” scheme to overturn Biden’s victories in key battleground states.\n\nTrump also deliberately deceived his supporters, the indictment says, and directed them to march to the Capitol in an effort to pressure former Vice President Mike Pence and lawmakers to reject the certification of electors.\n\nSix co-conspirators are referenced in the indictment but are unnamed.

Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse. Trump’s appearance in the courthouse, less than 2 miles from the White House, will serve as a symbolic moment amid a slew of legal challenges facing the former president.\n\nThe former president has used his most recent indictment to raise money for his 2024 presidential campaign.

No other former president has ever been charged with a crime.\n\nTrump announced July 18 that he was a target of the investigation for alleged conspiracy to defraud the United States, deprivation of rights and witness tampering. He has denied wrongdoing and argued the prosecution is politically motivated while continuing to campaign for president in 2024.\n\nTrump already faces two other criminal cases.

She has said in an interview that a decision to charge Trump could come by Sept. 1.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat is a grand jury?\n\nA grand jury is a group of people who are selected to hear evidence presented by the government to determine whether to charge someone with a crime. Unlike a trial jury, which decides whether to find someone guilty of a crime, a grand jury is tasked only with deciding whether the government has enough evidence to indict someone.\n\nA grand jury usually conducts its proceedings in private and, after hearing evidence, will vote to decide whether to indict someone on criminal charges.\n\nTo decide whether to charge someone with a crime, a federal grand jury requires only a simple majority to vote in favor of indicting. A trial jury, however, needs unanimity to reach a guilty verdict.\n\nThis marks the third time a grand jury has voted to indict Trump.\n\n− Miles J. Herszenhorn\n\nWhat is an indictment?\n\nAn indictment is a formal document that contains allegations that someone committed a crime. It includes the charges laid out against a person and is filed before a case can move forward in court, David Weinstein, a former federal and state prosecutor, told USA TODAY.\n\nWeinstein said an indictment means a grand jury decided there’s “more likely than not” enough evidence – based on testimony – to move forward with charging a person. At least 12 jurors must agree that a defendant allegedly committed a crime to issue an indictment.\n\nAfter a person is indicted, they must go to trial, where a jury will reach an unanimous decision on whether to pursue conviction.\n\n− Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWhat does the indictment say?\n\nThe indictment detailed Trump's effort to use the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\"In late December 2020, the Defendant attempted to use the Justice Department to make knowingly false claims of election fraud to officials in the targeted states through a formal letter under the Acting Attorney General's signature, thus giving the Defendant's lies the backing of the federal government and attempting to improperly influence the targeted states to replace legitimate Biden electors with the Defendant's,\" the indictment stated.\n\nThe indictment also says Trump threatened to change leadership in the Justice Department after senior department officials refused to support the former president's false claims about the 2020 election. The indictment references a 2020 New Year's Eve meeting between Trump, acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, and acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue.\n\n\"On December 31, the Defendant summoned to the Oval Office the Acting Attorney General, Acting Deputy Attorney General, and other advisors,\" the indictment stated. \"In the meeting, the Defendant again raised claims about election fraud that Justice Department officials already had told him were not true--and that the senior Justice Department officials reiterated were false and suggested he might change the leadership in the Justice Department.\"\n\n− Miles J. Herszenhorn\n\nIndictment lists at least six Trump co-conspirators, including a Justice Department official and four lawyers\n\nThe indictment handed up Tuesday lists six people as co-conspirators in Trump’s alleged schemes to illegally stay in power, including Jeffrey Clark, a high-ranking Justice Department official in the Trump administration.\n\nThe indictment does not name any of the alleged co-conspirators. But it says “co-conspirator 4” is “a Justice Department official who worked on civil matters and who, with the Defendant, attempted to use the Justice Department to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures with knowingly false claims of election fraud.”\n\nThe other co-conspirators allegedly helped Trump “in his criminal efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election and retain power.” The indictment described one “an attorney who was willing to spread knowingly false claims and pursue strategies that the Defendant's 2020 re-election campaign attorneys would not,” while another attorney “devised and attempted to implement a strategy to leverage the Vice President's ceremonial role overseeing the certification proceeding to obstruct the certification of the presidentialelection.\n\n−Josh Meyer\n\nUnsealed indictment alleges Trump deliberately directed rioters to Capitol to overturn 2020 election\n\nThe unsealed indictment accuses Trump of deliberately deceiving his supporters with his claims of election fraud and directing them to the Capitol to pressure Pence to overturn the election.\n\n“The Defendant repeated false claims of election fraud, gave false hope that the Vice President might change the election outcome, and directed the crowd in front of him to go to the Capitol as a means to obstruct the certification and pressure the Vice President to fraudulently obstruct the certification,” the indictment reads.\n\nThe indictment also says Trump and an unnamed co-conspirator “attempted to exploit the violence and chaos at the Capitol” by pressuring lawmakers to delay the certification of the electors.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nDeSantis criticizes prosecutors, not Trump\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is Trump's closest competitor in the Republican presidential race, took a low-key approach to his third indictment and criticized the indictment rather than his front-running campaign rival.\n\n\"While I’ve seen reports, I have not read the indictment,' DeSantis said in a social media post. \"I do, though, believe we need to enact reforms so that Americans have the right to remove cases from Washington, DC to their home districts.\"\n\nDeSantis also said that if he is elected president, \"I will end the weaponization of government, replace the FBI Director, and ensure a single standard of justice for all Americans.\"\n\nThe Florida governor was also reluctant to criticize Trump after his first two indictment − both which seemed to fuel Trump's rise among GOP voters. He has a huge lead in Republican polls.\n\n− David Jackson\n\n'Don't care, still voting Trump'\n\nReaction to the new indictment on pro-Trump message boards and from far-right pundits on the social media and messaging app Telegram was swift, furious, and resigned.\n\nSeveral posts of the pro-Trump forum Patriots.win Tuesday evening echoed a similar theme:\n\n“Don't care, still voting Trump,” read the most-upvoted post.\n\n“I'll either write in Trump or vote Libertarian. I'm done with the rest of the party.

And in each case, the latest indictment has been more troubling than the last.\n\nIn the latest case, federal prosecutors are accusing the Republican front-runner of undermining American democracy by organizing a wide-ranging conspiracy to steal the 2020 election that prosecutors say fueled a brazen and historic insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"The attack on our nation's Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy,\" Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, who led the investigation, said at news conference late Tuesday.\n\n\"As described in the indictment, it was fueled by lies − lies by the defendant targeting and obstructing a bedrock function of the US government.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly made false statements about the last presidential contest, which he lost to President Joe Biden. But the consequences thus far have been political losses.\n\nWhat's different now is he faces the harshest accusation yet from the federal government: namely, that his motivation was a criminal effort to cling to power.\n\nTrump, indicted on four felony counts, has denied wrongdoing and denounced the indictment as an attempt to derail his 2024 presidential candidacy.\n\nHere are six key takeaways in the wake of the third indictment.\n\nTrump knowingly spread lies about 2020 election, prosecutor says\n\nCentral to the Justice Department’s case against Trump, according to Smith, is the former president knew that he lost the 2020 election, yet he still spread knowingly false claims of election fraud.\n\nThe indictment singles out Trump's claims of large numbers of dead or other ineligible citizens who voted, \"suspicious vote dumps\" that hurt Trump’s chances, and rigged election machines.\n\n“These claims were false, and the defendant knew there were false,” the 45-page indictment reads. “In fact, the defendant was notified repeatedly that his claims were untrue – often by people on whom he relied on for candid advice on important matters, and who were in best position to know the facts.”\n\nThe indictment alleges that almost everyone in Trump's orbit repeatedly told him that his fraud claims were wrong. Among them were former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump’s senior Justice Department officials, his director of national intelligence, senior White House attorneys, senior campaign staffers and state election officials.\n\nBut he didn't listen, according to the indictment, which calls Trump's false statements “integral to his criminal plans” to stop the certification of the election.\n\nTrump directed Jan. 6 rioters, created fake electors scheme\n\nThe indictment also says Trump, along with six unnamed co-conspirators, did more than just lie about the 2020 election outcome.\n\nSmith's case lays the violent insurrection at the former president's feet, saying he \"attempted to exploit the violence and chaos\" by directing supporters to the Capitol in an attempt to bully lawmakers to delay the certification of the results.\n\nThe indictment also outlines ways in which Trump and the unidentified co-conspirators tried to carry out their plan to stay in power ahead of the Jan. 6 riot, including a plot to get a fraudulent slate of electors in seven states to flip the results where Biden had won.\n\nAfter failing to pressure state officials to change the outcome in early December 2020, the indictment says, Trump and his allies developed a new plan to \"marshal individuals who would have served as (his) electors\" who would have then sent \"false certifications that they were legitimate electors.\"\n\nSome of the fake electors were \"tricked\" into participating in the scheme, according to the indictment.\n\nThe right to lie? Trump's charges hinge on conduct\n\nSmith, in the indictment, makes clear that lying about an election isn't a crime and that Trump has a First Amendment right to do so and challenge the results in court.\n\n\"The defendant had a right, like every American to speak publicly about the election and even to claim, falsely, that there had been outcome-determinative fraud during the election and that he had won,” the indictment says.\n\nInstead, Smith argues, Trump intentionally sowed “widespread mistrust” about the election to perpetrate three specific criminal conspiracies targeting the nation’s process of collecting, counting and certifying presidential election results.\n\nThe indictment charges Trump with three conspiracy charges:\n\nA conspiracy to defraud the United States by using “dishonesty, fraud and deceit” to obstruct the counting and certification of results in a presidential election.\n\nA conspiracy to corrupt and impede the Jan. 6, 2021, session in which Congress counted electoral votes.\n\nA conspiracy against the right to vote and to have one’s vote counted.\n\nThe fourth count against Trump is obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding related to his actions on Jan. 6.\n\nIn many ways the charges and evidence cited by prosecutors mirror the findings and recommended charges from a congressional House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 insurrection last year.\n\nWho are the co-conspirators?\n\nThe indictment charges only Trump, but it references six co-conspirators who helped him.\n\nAlthough they are not named, the indictment outlines several details about them, including their role and behavior, such as key attorneys, a political consultant and a Justice Department official who prosecutors say schemed with the former president to open \"sham election crime investigations\" and \"influence state legislatures.\"\n\nThat is reportedly Jeffrey Clark, a high-ranking Justice Department official during the Trump administration who worked on civil matters and was almost appointed by Trump as acting attorney general in the final days of his term.\n\nSmith could seek to indict some, or all, of the co-conspirators in the weeks ahead.\n\nTrump to Pence: 'You’re too honest'\n\nOne of more intriguing details in the indictment is the deteriorating relationship between Trump and Pence, who was being pressured to leverage his role as vice president to help the alleged plot.\n\nPence, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination in 2024, refused to play along, saying he didn't have the authority to block the election's certification. That infuriated Trump and his supporters, who searched for the vice president through the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nAt one point, according to the indictment, Trump told Pence, \"You’re too honest.\"\n\nSpeaking on Fox News less than an hour after the third indictment became public, Marc Short, who was Pence’s chief of staff during the Trump presidency, cast the indictment in political terms.\n\n\"The reality is that Donald Trump asked Mike Pence to overturn the results of the election,\" Short said. \"Do you want a president who willfully puts himself above the law and asks his vice president to disobey his oath to the Constitution?\"\n\nBiden and Trump's rivals react\n\nDon’t expect the latest indictment against Trump to hurt his chances to secure the 2024 Republican nomination.\n\nIf we’ve learned anything from the first and second indictments, it is likely only to strengthen the resolve of Trump's base. He has amassed a commanding polling lead in the Republican primary despite facing a federal indictment over his handling of classified documents and an indictment in New York over alleged hush-money payments.\n\nThe charges against the former president have forced his primary rivals into the awkward position of condemning the Justice Department for targeting their election opponent.\n\n“As President, I will end the weaponization of government, replace the FBI Director, and ensure a single standard of justice for all Americans,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is considered Trump's chief rival, said in response to the latest indictment.\n\nSen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., another Republican presidential candidate, said in a statement that he remains \"concerned about the weaponization of Biden’s DOJ and its immense power used against political opponents.\"\n\n\"What we see today are two different tracks of justice. One for political opponents and another for the son of the current president,\" Scott said.\n\nBiden took a pass on commenting about Trump's latest indictment, and its implications for the 2024 contest and the country, during his vacation in Delaware this week.\n\nInstead, the president, joined by first lady Jill Biden, went to go see \"Oppenheimer,\" the celebrated film about the physicist who is described as \"the father of the atomic bomb.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/06/politics/fani-willis-georgia-prosecutor-trump-indictments-december/index.html", "title": "Fulton County prosecutor investigating Trump aims for indictments ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nThe Georgia prosecutor leading an investigation into efforts by Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election is aiming to quickly wrap up the grand jury’s work after the midterm elections and could begin issuing indictments as early as December, sources familiar with the situation tell CNN.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has said that her investigation into attempts to subvert the 2020 election will go quiet beginning later this week to avoid any appearance of influencing the upcoming election. But while her investigation will not make any overt moves in the next few weeks, her team is gearing up for a flurry of activity after Election Day.\n\n“I think her hands are tied, certainly, until after the midterms,” said Michael J. Moore, former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia. “She wants to pull some of the politics out of it, so to ensure that the investigation is not forgotten, instead of sort of rattling the sabers and subpoenaing other witnesses you would just say you know we’re going to take this time to reflect on the investigation.”\n\nThe Georgia probe – set off by an hour-long January 2021 phone call from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger asking him to “find” the votes necessary for Trump to win the Peach State – has steadily expanded. It now covers presentations on unfounded election fraud claims to state lawmakers, the fake elector scheme, efforts by unauthorized individuals to access voting machines in one Georgia county and a campaign of threats and harassment against lower-level election workers.\n\n“It has moved from just the idea of the phone call to the Secretary of State to a much broader investigation of tampering with the election,” said Danny Porter, former district attorney for Georgia’s Gwinnett County.\n\nFor the past five months, the special grand jury has been scrutinizing those events to determine whether any of them may have been illegal. When the panel, which does not have the power to issue indictments, completes its work, it is expected to issue a report with recommendations, including whether anyone should face criminal charges.\n\nLegal experts noted that special grand juries are rarely used in Georgia, so there’s sparse precedent. But they said it’s possible Willis could seek indictments from regularly empaneled grand juries in the county before the special grand jury completes its work.\n\n“She has the power to bring a case before a grand jury basically anytime she feels like she has enough evidence to show that the crime has been committed, not beyond a reasonable doubt but by probable cause,” said Porter. “If she gathers that information, she doesn’t have to wait for the report.”\n\nIt remains unclear who could face indictment. Prosecutors previously informed 16 pro-Trump electors who falsely claimed Trump won Georgia in a certificate sent to the National Archives that they could be targets in the probe. Former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani was also told that he was a possible target. None have been charged with crimes.\n\nPursuing RICO charges\n\nWillis has said she could pursue RICO – Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations – charges as part of her investigation. Racketeering charges, sometimes used in gang-related activity, allow prosecutors to bring charges against multiple defendants. Willis could use the law to try to make the case that Trump and his allies were part of a criminal enterprise in their various efforts to pressure state officials, put forth fake electors and otherwise try to influence the election.\n\nWhile some legal experts have questioned whether such an approach would be successful in the case of election interference, Willis has made clear her affection for the RICO statute.\n\n“The reason that I am a fan of RICO is, I think jurors are very, very intelligent,” Willis said at a news conference about a broad gang-related indictment over the summer. “They want to know what happened. They want to make an accurate decision about someone’s life. And so, RICO is a tool that allows a prosecutor’s office and law enforcement to tell the whole story.”\n\nWillis recently fired off a public warning to potential targets of her election investigation: “The allegations are very serious. If indicted and convicted, people are facing prison sentences,” she told The Washington Post.\n\nA spokesperson for the district attorney’s office declined to comment for this story.\n\nSubpoenaing as to new witnesses\n\nAhead of the quiet period, the grand jury has pressed forward with its investigative work. It has continued issuing subpoenas to new witnesses, albeit with the expectation that those witnesses will appear before the grand jury after the election, sources familiar with the probe told CNN. The grand jury recently heard from former Trump White House aide and current lawyer Boris Epshteyn. And prosecutors have said they plan to seek search warrants for unidentified targets, though a judge noted those would be sealed to deter witness intimidation or evidence tampering, according to a recent court filing.\n\nStill, several investigative leads remain unresolved.\n\nWillis still has not secured testimony from White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who was among the participants on the January 2021 call between Trump and Raffensperger. Meadows also made a surprise visit to a Cobb County location in December 2020, where officials were conducting an absentee ballot signature audit.\n\nMeadows has an October hearing scheduled in South Carolina where he could raise objections to a potential grand jury appearance. Former South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is fighting to quash a subpoena for grand jury testimony, as prosecutors seek more information about calls he made to Georgia officials in the wake of the 2020 election.\n\nAnd Willis still faces a decision about whether she wants to try to summon the former President to appear before the grand jury.\n\n“I would be surprised if she tried a stunt like that,” Moore, the former US attorney said of attempting to subpoena Trump, “and I would expect you would probably have litigation that would last months.”\n\nA spokesperson for Trump did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.

Here's a rundown of all the other cases he ...", "text": "WASHINGTON - Former President Donald Trump was indicted for a third time on Tuesday for allegedly tampering with 2020 election results − a move that comes amid Trump’s mounting legal troubles in other federal and state criminal investigations.\n\nThe newly-unsealed indictment says − among other things − that Trump allegedly used fake electors in a scheme to overturn President Joe Biden’s wins in several states, obstructed a congressional proceeding on Jan. 6 and spread false election fraud claims knowingly. Trump was charged with four counts.\n\nThe former president was previously indicted in a federal case related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Prior to that, a Manhattan grand jury in New York indicted him for allegedly falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments made to two women. He pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia are also eyeing a potential indictment over his efforts to overturn the state's 2020 presidential election outcome. The decision in the case could come by Sept. 1.\n\nHere’s a rundown of the criminal and civil cases that Trump’s involved in as he continues to vie for the GOP presidential nomination for the 2024 election.\n\nCriminal cases\n\nMar-a-Lago classified documents case\n\nStatus: Indicted\n\nExpected trial date: May 2024\n\nTrump was indicted last month on 37 felony counts for allegedly storing hundreds of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate upon leaving the White House in 2021. Some of the charges include willful retention of national defense information in violation of the Espionage Act and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all counts in a courtroom in Miami, Florida. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed federal prosecutor Smith in November 2022 as special counsel to oversee Trump’s documents probe.\n\nSmith brought three additional charges against Trump in a superseding indictment last week for allegedly seeking to destroy security footage of rooms in which subpoenaed boxes of classified information were kept and induced others to do so.\n\nTrump's aide, Walt Nauta, and Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos De Oliveira were also indicted in the case.\n\nNew York hush money case\n\nStatus: Indicted\n\nExpected trial date: March 2024\n\nTrump was indicted on 34 felony counts in March by a Manhattan grand jury for allegedly falsifying business records in an attempt to conceal hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, who alleged they had sexual relations with Trump, before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump had arranged for his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to make the payments − $130,000 for Daniels and $150,000 for McDougal − to silence the women on their claims. His organization then paid Cohen reimbursements in the guise of legal fees.\n\nThe case made Trump the first former president to be indicted in history. It was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to all counts in a Manhattan court room in April. The maximum sentence for a felony would be four years in prison under New York law, but first-time offenders can get shorter sentences.\n\n2020 election interference and Jan. 6 case\n\nStatus: Indicted\n\nExpected trial date: Not certain\n\nA federal grand jury indicted Trump on Tuesday for his alleged role in conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. He was charged with Conspiracy to Defraud the United States; Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding; Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding; and Conspiracy Against Rights.\n\nSmith's indictment against Trump details several actions Trump took to undermine Biden's victory in 2020, including directing his supporters to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6, working with six co-conspirators to devise strategies to submit a fraudulent slate of electors and pressuring Vice President Mike Pence to reject the election results.\n\nThe indictment came after Trump had received a target letter earlier this month notifying him that he was the focus of Smith’s investigation into alleged election fraud − a warning to Trump that he would face criminal charges.\n\nTrump is expected to be arraigned in a courtroom on Thursday.\n\nGeorgia 2020 election interference case\n\nStatus: Pending\n\nExpected trial date: Pending\n\nGeorgia's Fulton County District Attorney Fanni Willis is overseeing an investigation related to Trump's alleged role in trying to overturn the state's 2020 election results.\n\nTrump allegedly recruited Republican electors as alternates to the official electors in Georgia and other states President Joe Biden won. He also pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find the votes he needed to win Georgia. A House of Representatives investigation found that Trump tried to call him 18 times.\n\nWillis said that a decision on charges against Trump could come by Sept. 1 in an interview.\n\n“The work is accomplished,” Willis told CNN affiliate WXIA. “We’ve been working for 2 1/2 years. We’re ready to go.”\n\nCivil lawsuits\n\nE. Jean Carroll case\n\nExpected trial date: January 2024\n\nWriter E. Jean Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump in 2019 for comments he made about her while he was president. A judge accepted the lawsuit this year and set the trial date for January.\n\nA federal jury in May found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll at a New York City department store in 1996 and for defamation in a separate case. Trump was ordered to pay $5 million in damages.\n\nThe jury in the case found that Trump for \"willfully or wantonly negligent, reckless, or done with a conscious disregard of the rights of Ms. Carroll\" − said yes. The jurors also found that Trump’s attacks against Carroll in social media posts were \"defamatory,\" \"false,\" and made \"with actual malice.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that he doesn't know who Carroll is.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James case\n\nExpected trial date: October\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against Trump last year after a three-year investigation, alleging that Trump “falsely inflated his wealth by billions of dollars\" through massive fraud involving his namesake business, the Trump Organization.\n\nHe was allegedly aided by his children - Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. - and senior executives at the Trump Organization.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks $250 million in penalties, a ban on Trump or his children running businesses in New York and legal action attempts to prevent Trump and his organization from buying commercial real-estate for five years.\n\nTrump gave a deposition for the case in April, where he dismissed it as \"ridiculous.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/08/14/trump-indictment-in-georgia-how-2020-forever-changed-its-elections/70583357007/", "title": "Trump indictment in Georgia: How 2020 forever changed its elections", "text": "ATLANTA – Sitting in his office in Georgia’s gold-domed Capitol, Brad Raffensperger said he was proud his state “protected the vote.”\n\nRaffensperger was on the receiving end of the phone call after the 2020 election in which then-President Donald Trump pressured him over and over to change the outcome in Georgia, saying, “I just want to find 11,780 votes.”\n\nTo the soft-spoken engineer turned secretary of state, that’s all past now. His office was decorated with a patriotic eagle painting, given to him after he stood up to Trump’s pressure. His state, he contended, emerged with elections that are even more secure and accessible.\n\nAs Raffensperger spoke, though, just one floor above him speakers had filled the state elections board meeting to overcapacity. Suspicious of the Dominion-made voting machines, they lined up to demand paper ballots. “Until we can get rid of these machines,” attendee Jeff Jolly said outside, ”our winners are handpicked by a small group here in this building.”\n\nAbout a mile from the Capitol is ground zero for some of the claims of election fraud: State Farm Arena, where election staff working around the clock at a vote tabulation center were then falsely accused of being “election scammers.” Their defamation lawsuit against Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani is still in court.\n\nAnd just outside Raffensperger’s windows, almost visible, were the orange traffic barricades and police cars ringing the Fulton County Courthouse. There, a grand jury indictment in the investigation of efforts to overturn the 2020 vote was expected any day – an indictment that could come as early as Tuesday and may well include Trump himself.\n\nTo some Georgians, a Trump indictment would be a step toward justice; to others, a sign of just how broken the system is. But no matter the indictment, or any trial, or the desire many people here have to move on, there’s no outcome that seems likely to lift the shadow of 2020.\n\nVoting rights advocates say the election and its aftermath left an enduring imprint on access, election politics and simple trust in Georgia, one of America’s most pivotal swing states.\n\nThey point chiefly to the state’s sweeping overhaul of elections in 2021. Republican legislators said the changes brought election security. Voter advocates and civil rights leaders say it built lasting barriers to voting access – an attempt, they believe, to undercut the growing clout of Democrats and Black voters.\n\nThe state also allowed unlimited citizen challenges to other people’s voter registrations – and right-wing activists filed so many, they swamped some election offices. Election offices were banned from seeking outside funding, which opponents viewed as unfairly helping Democratic counties. After years of threats and intimidation, election and poll workers are scarce.\n\nFor some voters – left to make sense of nearly three years of conflicting messages and investigations, of allegations and legislation – all this makes them push a little harder. They know the state that was under fire for voter access issues even before 2020. The year’s fallout fuels their determination to vote.\n\nThat’s not true for others, though, who have become convinced the outcome is decided by forces beyond the ballot box.\n\n“A lot of this really goes back to the big lie – the idea that something was wrong with our election and our electoral system, and it has to change. And of course, we all know that's not true,\" said Anthony Michael Kreis, a Georgia State University election law professor. “Yet major pieces of public policy have been shifted in response to that lie.”\n\nA land of surveillance video, allegations and threats\n\nOutside an Atlanta coffee shop in early August, Richard Barron recalled the night he got a text from a reporter asking him how he felt.\n\nBarron had no idea what she was talking about, but he soon would understand.\n\nDonald Trump, then the outgoing president, had held a rally in Valdosta, Georgia, to support the Republican in the hotly contested runoff election for the state’s Senate seat. He had fired off false conspiracy theories about stolen elections and voter fraud, and had flashed Barron’s picture on the big screen.\n\nNext came a flood of new threats. One message warned Barron he’d be “served lead.”\n\n“That’s when I really started getting harassment,” he recalled. “I finally got a police officer to stay outside the house when I would sleep at night.”\n\nIt’s not as if Barron, Fulton County’s elections director, had never been embattled. Long before, he had faced problems with lines at polling places, administrative snafus and other issues.\n\nHe led the department during 2018’s bitter governor’s race, when Stacey Abrams narrowly lost to then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Officials rejected hundreds of absentee ballots. Democrats claimed voter suppression. Lawsuits continued for years.\n\nThe following year, Georgia purchased a new voting system made by a company that would soon be a household name: Dominion Voting Systems. The year after that, the COVID-19 pandemic put mail-in ballots into broad use.\n\nMeanwhile, the stakes of elections in Georgia were mounting. The once reliably red state became a swing state that put 16 electoral votes up for grabs.\n\nWhen Biden narrowly won Georgia in November − the first Democrat to win the state since 1992 – Trump alleged fraud. Among his targets were Fulton County, the state’s most populous county.\n\nAfter Trump demanded a hand recount, a statewide hand recount and a subsequent recount found Biden had won by about 12,000 votes.\n\nBut Trump’s claims continued. There were allegations of manipulated ballots. Fraud. Supposedly breached election equipment. Soon, Trump allies like Giuliani and then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows were visiting Georgia.\n\nIn the months after the election, Barron’s staff faced pressure like never before.\n\nMeeting with Georgia lawmakers that December, Giuliani played surveillance footage that included two of Barron’s employees – Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea “Shaye” Moss – at State Farm Arena.\n\nGiuliani said the footage showed the women “surreptitiously passing around USB ports as if they are vials of heroin or cocaine,” the Associated Press reported.\n\nWhat they were actually passing, as Moss would later explain to the Jan. 6 congressional committee, was a ginger mint. But the threats against them exploded.\n\nTrump, in his infamous phone call to Georgia, would falsely call Freeman an “election scammer” at least 18 times.\n\nThey were forced to leave their home for two months at the urging of the FBI.\n\nMoss, who is Black, said she received messages “wishing death upon me. Telling me that I’ll be in jail with my mother. And saying things like ‘Be glad it’s 2020 and not 1920.’”\n\n“There is nowhere I feel safe,” Freeman told the congressional committee.\n\nThis June, a Georgia investigation of the allegations of fraud at the State Farm Arena ballot processing center cleared the two women of any wrongdoing.\n\nBiden’s inauguration didn’t end the pressure. Barron said he continued to take criticism from state elections officials and some local politicians. Fulton County, at the behest of Republican legislators, became the first county in Georgia to undergo a new performance review. Barron’s office faced a possible state takeover.\n\nFinally, in late 2021, he resigned.\n\nBarron, nearly two years later, got through an entire coffee drink on a coffee shop patio near Atlanta’s Ponce City Market as he recounted the years of tumult.\n\nThe partisan acrimony took a toll. He struggled to find work in Atlanta, he said. For a while, he drove for Uber. He’s not sure if he can ever work in elections again.\n\n“I started losing faith in the whole ... everything,” he said.\n\nBut his leaving office was just one chapter in the fallout from 2020. By then, another battle over elections in Georgia was well under way.\n\nCanceled registrations, new restrictions and voter backlash\n\nAt the dining room table of his home east of Atlanta, a red-sided ranch tucked in a quiet neighborhood of neat lawns and leafy trees, Donel Peterman held his phone, typing his name into an app that shows whether a person is still registered to vote.\n\nIt’s something the 70-year-old former public transit supervisor regularly shows to people at his church, ever since the time his name ended up falling off the list.\n\nIn 2017, he found himself among more than a half-million people whose registrations were canceled under the state’s \"use it or lose it” law. State officials defended the policy as voter-role maintenance and denied any nefarious intent, but critics said the system had a high error rate and disproportionately impacted Black voters.\n\nGeorgia declares registrations “inactive” after five years in which those voters do not participate in elections, contact or respond to elections officials or update their registrations – often because they moved. Those voters’ registrations are then dropped from the rolls if they don’t participate in the next two general elections.\n\nExcept Peterman says he had not moved – or missed multiple elections.\n\n“This is totally ridiculous,” he recalled thinking at the time. He had to re-register to vote.\n\nThen came 2020. And Peterman saw what he viewed as new hurdles to the vote.\n\nIn 2021, after Democrats had won two Senate runoff elections, a Republican-led legislature passed a sweeping election law.\n\nSupporters said it was aimed at restoring voters’ confidence and making elections more secure in the wake of 2020. Gov. Kemp said it would make it \"easy to vote, and hard to cheat.\" Critics said that was a pretext, and that the law would disproportionately suppress Democratic votes.\n\nKnown as SB 202, the law drew criticism on a number of provisions. It limited the number of polling places, added voter identification requirements to get absentee ballots, shortened the time to request them, and limited ballot drop boxes. That caused the number in Fulton County, for example, to drop from more than three dozen to 7. The county’s mobile-voting buses were banned.\n\nThe law also shortened the time between an election and a run-off election, shortening the time for voters to receive and return absentee ballots. It limited who could distribute absentee ballots or assist someone with an absentee ballot, a change advocates say impacts voters with disabilities.\n\nAnd it gave the legislature more control over county election offices. All that came on top of 2021 redistricting, which the ACLU has argued diluted the power of Black voters.\n\nCritics said SB 202 made it harder to vote. They said it would disproportionately affect people of color. Biden called the law “un-American” and the Department of Justice challenged provisions in court. Major League Baseball moved its All-Star game out of Atlanta in protest.\n\nGeorgia wasn’t the only place taking aim at elections laws, either. Fourteen states passed 22 restrictive laws in 2021. More did so this year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy group. At the same time, other states expanded voting rights to make ballot access safer and easier.\n\nIn Georgia, voter access groups responded by redoubling the get-out-the-vote efforts that had powered the Democratic wins in 2020.\n\nBishop Reginald Jackson, who leads more than 500 African Methodist Episcopal churches in Georgia, helped create the group Faith Works, a network of churches that conducted canvassing and registration drives, and encouraged early voting.\n\nHelen Butler, head of the voting access group the People’s Agenda, said they too provided more rides to the polls than they had in the past.\n\nDespite the worries, overall turnout during the general election was strong, drawing 56.9% of registered voters, according to the Secretary of State’s Office.\n\nAccording to the Brookings Institution, Georgia saw gains between 2018 and 2022 in white voters but a turnout decline among nonwhite voters. Still, its 2022 nonwhite turnout rate still ranks fourth among all states.\n\nRaffersperger says the strong turnout showed that voter suppression was a myth and concerns about SB 202 overblown. A University of Georgia study found more than 90% of voters had said it was easy to cast a ballot.\n\nJackson and other voting rights leaders credited turnout efforts and people’s determination to vote in spite of the law, and said surveying those who voted left out people who weren’t able to vote.\n\nAndra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University, said the impact of SB 202 has yet to be determined.\n\nIn July, U.S. House Republicans introduced a new federal elections bill modeled after Georgia’s law.\n\nAt home east of Atlanta, Peterman is retired. His wife recently retired, too. They keep a neat home and have a pet bird named Jingle.\n\nRetirement is good. It means more time to volunteer at a political action ministry at his church, helping educate others about the vote. Some people there believe it just doesn’t matter, he said, that the outcomes will be manipulated anyway.\n\nPeterman – a Democrat, who says he sometimes votes Republican, depending on the candidate – doesn’t think that. He said his own experience – having his record temporarily purged, watching new laws come down and new district lines go up – has only made him more determined to vote.\n\nHe votes during the state's early voting window to make sure his vote is counted. Give Gov. Kemp credit for standing up for Trump, he said. But he isn’t happy he signed off on voting bills that concern him.\n\nStill, he thinks efforts viewed as tilting the scales in favor of a particular party have backfired and hopes that will deter those strategies in the future.\n\n“What they’re doing is pissing people off,” he said. “People are going to come and grow the vote.”\n\nPeterman walked from his dining room through the garage, past Jingle’s cage into the leafy green light of a late Georgia summer. He’s watching, like everyone else in Georgia, for the indictments. Maybe, he says, they will stanch the most blatant attempts to sway elections and underscore something that to him seems basic.\n\n“Elections need to be fair and square,” he said.\n\nBut what that means in Georgia can, at times, depend on who you ask.\n\nA world of election information and disinformation\n\nJeff Jolly had made it as far as the Georgia Board of Elections meeting, but he couldn’t get inside. The room had reached capacity.\n\nJolly stood outside as some walked across the street to watch it on a TV feed.\n\nInside, people were demanding the state use paper ballots that could be hand-counted for better election security. Jolly agreed.\n\nSome had arrived in a passenger van that towed a trailer pasted with the slogan “Paper Please.” “We call it the war wagon,” Jolly said.\n\nThe semi-retired pecan businessman wore a T-shirt with the logo “Georgians for Truth,” a group that supports the ballot change.\n\nWhile opponents of changes like SB 202 think Georgia’s election procedures are too restrictive, Jolly – who chairs the local Republican Party in Grady County, way down near the Florida line – thinks they aren’t strict enough.\n\nJolly said he believes Fulton County’s anticipated prosecution of Trump is a “joke” and that the so-called fake electors who sought to certify Georgia for Trump were legitimate. But 2020, he said, “it’s over. We’ve got to move forward. To make sure we have a true election next year.”\n\nGarland Favorito, a founder of the group VoterGA, wants to, too. He contends that fraud, errors and irregularities meant the 2020 election never should have been certified. He blamed courts for stymying their efforts to prove it thus far.\n\nWhile there have been some improvements in election security since 2020, Favorito says, there haven’t been enough to “secure the 2024 elections.”\n\nLingering doubts about elections security led rural Spalding County to require automatic hand recounts for elections earlier this year, which followed a move to cancel Sunday voting, a change protested by Black voters, according to The Guardian.\n\nSB 202 also allowed residents to make unlimited voter challenges against anyone in their county. Rahul Garabadu, senior voting rights attorney for the ACLU of Georgia, said such challenges were once an arcane part of election law, meant for family members or neighbors to alert officials that someone had moved or died.\n\nLast month, a ProPublica investigation found that the vast majority of the challenges since SB 202 became law − about 89,000 of 100,000 − were submitted by six right-wing activists.\n\nOf those challenges, roughly 11,100 were successful − at least 2,350 voters were removed from the rolls and at least 8,700 were placed in a “challenged” status. However, the investigation found that many would have been eventually corrected by routine voter-roll maintenance.\n\nOne resident who was challenged is Carry Smith, 41, who lives in Savannah and works with a voting rights group. After moving there a handful of years ago, she said, she used a mailbox business as her address while she looked for a place to live. She thought she later updated her voter registration but found she was still registered at the business. Luckily, she noticed the piece of mail about it and was able to change her address to remain on the rolls.\n\n“I think if I didn’t check my mail, I wouldn’t have known,” she said.\n\nIn Gwinnett County, which stretches across the increasingly Democratic northern Atlanta suburbs, those challenges created a month’s worth of work in fall 2022, said county elections supervisor Zach Manifold, as he walked among of boxes that included election materials from 2020 that must be retained because of ongoing lawsuits.\n\nIn filing them, activists compared change-of-address and other databases with the county’s voter rolls, the AP reported. Manifold said that of the roughly 12,000 voter challenges they went through, all were dismissed for various reasons.\n\nHe’s not sure if that will continue. But one thing that may continue is his struggle to hire enough workers. With the history of threats, the long hours, plus a competitive job market, election-season temps are hard to find.\n\n“We’d order 25 employees to start on Monday. They’d come up with 12. Six of them would show up. And then by 5 p.m. on the first day, you had two,” Manifold said.\n\nHe started his own job two years ago. Today he says he’s the most senior of any elections leader in any of the four major Atlanta-area counties.\n\nIn May, Georgia expanded to all local governments a 2021 measure that made it illegal for election officials to accept outside funding such as grants. It came after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg donated more than $400 million to election officials nationwide, which Republicans said could favor Democratic counties.\n\nManifold said these days, he does a lot of voter education. While voting systems are more reliable than ever, he said, “There’s just a lot of misinformation, and not understanding election processes. That’s probably the biggest concern.”\n\nA state votes in a test of faith\n\nAt a job fair in a Baptist Church in Tucker, just east of Atlanta, Diona Holman 27, and Linda Watson, 73, walked past rows of tables. Jobs at the state prisons. Jobs at Waffle House. Jobs at local non-profits. The pair had clipboards in hand. They weren’t looking for employees, just voters.\n\nThey were canvassing for the Georgia Coalition for the People’s Agenda, which advocates for voting rights – asking people if their voter registrations were updated.\n\nMost people they spoke to said they were registered. One woman said she didn’t vote. She didn’t explain why, but the look on her face said the reason ought to be obvious.\n\nMerri Nance, a 63-year-old real estate agent, realized she needed to get her address updated after she moved. She said all the lawsuits, legislation and investigations have had an impact.\n\n“In the last election, I was reminding people – don’t forget to vote. And people were so discouraged, they’re like, 'I’m not going to vote.' … They felt like it wasn’t going to make a difference.”\n\nIn July – 2½ years after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol and its fallout – a national USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found that 7 out of 10 Americans agreed U.S. democracy is “imperiled.”\n\nBut Raffensperger believes those views are in the minority amid a Georgia system he says has strong security, voter confidence and accessibility. It’s never been easier to vote, he says.\n\nA January AJC poll found that confidence was rebounding, with 73% of voters saying they thought elections were fair and accurate, compared with 56% of voters about a year earlier.\n\nThere was also a partisan gap. About 87% who identified themselves as liberals said they were confident, compared with 61% of conservatives.\n\nRaffensperger said Trump’s efforts to sow doubts about election results likely diminished the number of Republicans voting for president in Georgia in 2020, which is why he believes that tactic will eventually wane.\n\n“It may be a great way to raise money and run your hustle on people. But at the end of the day, it’s not a winning campaign strategy,” he said.\n\nPolitical observers and scholars say what role Trump’s indictments play – whether they act as a turning point to a tumultuous era in Georgia elections, or deepen divides and the politicization of voting − remains to be seen.\n\n“There’s a chance it will make polarization worse,” Kreis said. “On the other hand, if people are forced to listen to the evidence and to contemplate what prosecutors are presenting, perhaps that will sway a considerable number of people.”\n\nYet the pressure and scrutiny on elections will continue in Georgia as long as it’s a swing state. That could mean more turnout or more disinformation. Or both.\n\nIn his office in the Capitol, where armed Trump supporters protested the former president’s election loss in 2020, Raffensperger says some people won’t ever change their minds.\n\n“Some people today still have not and will not face and maybe cannot face the brutal truth of what happened in 2020. And that is, in Georgia, President Trump lost by about 12,000 votes,” he said.\n\nHe said he’s hopeful that political candidates with positive messages will emerge and leave behind “all this elections nonsense” and stop “looking at the referees and blaming them for all their shortcomings.”\n\n“Honestly, I think most Georgians, most Americans have moved on. They’re tired of all the chattering class back there talking about what happened three years ago,” he said.\n\nOutside his office, 2020 wasn’t going anywhere just yet.\n\nTwo days after Raffensperger spoke, Trump arrived back in Washington, D.C. – to appear as a defendant in federal court. That indictment, on charges of trying to overturn the election, was built in part around the phone call he made to Raffensperger.\n\nNow, in the light of a late Georgia summer, in the eighth month of 2023, the year 2020 feels as present as ever. Witnesses in Fulton County said they had been summoned to testify Tuesday. Indictments could come as soon as immediately after.\n\nAnd just down the street from Raffensperger’s office, the barricades and police wait, along with the rest of the state, for what comes next.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/politics/doj-trump-investigation-expansion-special-counsel/index.html", "title": "Exclusive: DOJ mulling potential special counsel if Trump runs in ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nAs Donald Trump inches closer to launching another presidential run after the midterm election, Justice Department officials have discussed whether a Trump candidacy would create the need for a special counsel to oversee two sprawling federal investigations related to the former president, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nThe Justice Department is also staffing up its investigations with experienced prosecutors so it’s ready for any decisions after the midterms, including the potential unprecedented move of indicting a former president. Top aides to Trump have been eyeing the third week of November as an ideal launch point for his campaign, with two sources telling CNN on Friday morning that the team has specifically discussed November 14.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the election, the Justice Department has observed the traditional quiet period of not making any overt moves that may have political consequences. But behind the scenes, investigators have remained busy, using aggressive grand jury subpoenas and secret court battles to compel testimony from witnesses in both the investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of national security documents kept at his Palm Beach home.\n\nNow federal investigators are planning for a burst of post-election activity in Trump-related investigations. That includes the prospect of indictments of Trump’s associates – moves that could be made more complicated if Trump declares a run for the presidency.\n\n“They can crank up charges on almost anybody if they wanted to,” said one defense attorney working on January 6-related matters, who added defense lawyers have “have no idea” who ultimately will be charged.\n\n“This is the scary thing,” the attorney said.\n\nTrump and his associates also face legal exposure in Georgia, where Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is investigating Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State and expects to wrap her probe by the end of the year.\n\nIndicting an active candidate for the White House would surely spark a political firestorm. And while no decision has been made about whether a special counsel might be needed in the future, DOJ officials have debated whether doing so could insulate the Justice Department from accusations that Joe Biden’s administration is targeting his chief political rival, people familiar with the matter tell CNN.\n\nSpecial counsels, of course, are hardly immune from political attacks. Both former special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation and special counsel John Durham’s investigation into the origins of the FBI’s Russia probe came under withering criticism from their opponents.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment for this story.\n\nBringing on a brain trust\n\nThe Justice Department has brought in a brain trust for high-level advice on the Trump investigations, according to people familiar with the moves.\n\nThe Department of Justice building on Thursday, Aug. 18, 2022 in Washington, DC. Kent Nishimura/Los Angeles Times/Getty Images\n\nTop Justice officials have looked to an old guard of former Southern District of New York prosecutors, bringing into the investigations Kansas City-based federal prosecutor and national security expert David Raskin, as well as David Rody, a prosecutor-turned-defense lawyer who previously specialized in gang and conspiracy cases and has worked extensively with government cooperators.\n\nRody, whose involvement has not been previously reported, left a lucrative partnership at the prestigious corporate defense firm Sidley Austin in recent weeks to become a senior counsel at DOJ in the criminal division in Washington, according to his LinkedIn profile and sources familiar with the move.\n\nThe team at the DC US Attorney’s Office handling the day-to-day work of the January 6 investigations is also growing – even while the office’s sedition cases against right-wing extremists go to trial.\n\nA handful of other prosecutors have joined the January 6 investigations team, including a high-ranking fraud and public corruption prosecutor who has moved out of a supervisor position and onto the team, and a prosecutor with years of experience in criminal appellate work now involved in some of the grand jury activity.\n\nTaken together, the reorganization of prosecutors indicates a serious and snowballing investigation into Trump and his closest circles.\n\nGarland’s big decision\n\nThe decision of whether to charge Trump or his associates will ultimately fall to Attorney General Merrick Garland, whom President Joe Biden picked for the job because his tenure as a judge provided some distance from partisan politics, after Senate Republicans blocked his Supreme Court nomination in 2016.\n\nAttorney General nominee Merrick Garland at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Jack Gruber/USA Today\n\nSeveral former prosecutors believe the facts exist for a potentially chargeable case. But Garland will have to navigate the politically perilous and historic decision of how to approach the potential indictment of a former President.\n\nIn March, Garland avoided answering a CNN question about the prospect of a special counsel for Trump-related investigations, but said that the Justice Department does “not shy away from cases that are controversial or sensitive or political.”\n\n“What we will avoid and what we must avoid is any partisan element of our decision making about cases,” Garland said. “That is what I’m intent on ensuring that the Department decisions are made on the merits, and that they’re made on the facts and the law, and they’re not based on any kind of partisan considerations.”\n\nGarland’s tough decisions go beyond Trump. The long-running investigation of Hunter Biden, son of the president, is nearing conclusion, people briefed on the matter say. Also waiting in the wings: a final decision on the investigation of Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, after prosecutors recommended against charges.\n\nIt likely won’t take long after the midterms for focus to shift to the 2024 presidential race. That could incentivize top DOJ officials to make crucial charging decisions as quickly as possible, including whether to bring charges against Trump himself or other top political activists, other sources familiar with the Justice Department’s inner workings say.\n\n“They’re not going to charge before they’re ready to charge,” one former Justice Department official with some insight into the thinking around the investigations said. “But there will be added pressure to get through the review” of cases earlier than the typical five-year window DOJ has to bring charges.\n\nGeorgia complications\n\nMatters could also be complicated by the situation in Georgia, where Willis is investigating Trump’s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election there. Willis has said she’s aiming for a special grand jury to wrap up its investigative work by the end of the year.\n\nWillis has observed her own version of a quiet period around the midterm election and is seeking to bring witnesses before the grand jury in the coming weeks. Sources previously told CNN indictments could come as soon as December.\n\nKey Trump allies, including South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows are among witnesses that have tried to fight off subpoenas in the state probe into efforts to interfere with the Georgia 2020 election.\n\nHow those disputes resolve in Georgia – including whether courts force testimony – could improve DOJ’s ability to gather information, just as the House Select Committee’s January 6 investigation added to DOJ’s investigative leads from inside the Trump White House.\n\nA not-so quiet period\n\nThe months leading up to the election have provided little respite from the political and legal activity around the investigations. The DC US Attorney’s Office – which is still shouldering the bulk of the January 6 investigations – has dealt with burnout in its ranks, as prosecutors are taking to trial or securing guilty pleas from more than 800 rioters who were on the grounds of the Capitol and still look to charge hundreds more.\n\nTrump has also foiled the DOJ’s efforts to keep things quiet in the weeks leading up to the election, leading to a steady barrage of headlines related to the investigation.\n\nTrump’s legal team successfully put in place a complicated court-directed process for sorting through thousands of documents seized from Mar-a-Lago, to determine whether they’re privileged and off limits to investigators. But the Justice Department and intelligence community have had access for weeks to about 100 records marked as classified that Trump had kept in Florida.\n\nThe outcome of the intelligence review of those documents may determine if criminal charges will be filed, according to one source familiar with the Justice Department’s approach.\n\nYet in both investigations, under-seal court activity never subsided, with the Justice Department trying to force at least five witnesses around Trump to secretly provide more information in their grand jury investigations in Washington, DC, CNN has previously reported.\n\nOn Tuesday a federal judge ordered Trump adviser Kash Patel to testify before a grand jury investigating the handling of federal records at Mar-a-Lago, according to two people familiar with the investigation.\n\nJudge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court granted Patel immunity from prosecution on any information he provides to the investigation— another significant step that moves the Justice Department closer to potentially charging the case.\n\nThis story is breaking and will be updated.", "authors": ["Evan Perez Katelyn Polantz Jeremy Herb", "Evan Perez", "Katelyn Polantz", "Jeremy Herb"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/08/01/trump-jan-6-indictment-test-for-democracy/70504832007/", "title": "Why Trump's indictment on Jan. 6 charges is a test for US democracy", "text": "Donald Trump, as the world now knows, already had been charged in two criminal cases. But now a federal indictment has been issued that charges him with actions he allegedly took as a sitting president to overturn the will of the American people and illegally stay in office after losing the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIt is the first time such criminal charges have been levied in U.S. history. And the new case, constitutional scholars and legal analysts tell USA TODAY, is exponentially more serious – and historically consequential – than anything Trump has faced before.\n\nThe new indictment, first disclosed by Trump himself in a post on his Truth Social platform, was handed up Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Washington and his legal team was then notified. That means the former president will soon be taken into custody for the third time in recent months, and will make a court appearance. He will likely surrender voluntarily under some agreement between his lawyers and federal prosecutors from the office of special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nThe 45-page indictment charges Trump −and at least six co-conspirators − with three conspiracies, including a scheme \"to defraud the United States by using dishonesty, fraud, and deceit\" to overturn the results of a presidential election. Trump is also charged with a conspiracy to corruptly obstruct and impede the January 6 congressional proceeding\" at which the collected results of the presidential election were to be counted and certified on Jan. 6, 2021. And the third conspiracy, the indictment said, was a \"conspiracy against the right to vote and to have one's vote counted.\"\n\n\"A self-coup, using lawyers instead of soldiers”\n\nLegal analysts, speaking broadly about the charges, say the new case is unprecedented.\n\n“These alleged offenses go to the very foundation of our democracy, namely, interference with the votes of the American people that give legitimacy to the functioning of our entire political system,” said Norman Eisen, an ethics and governance scholar who served on the House panel investigating Trump's first impeachment.\n\n“You cannot get more serious possible crimes than that,” Eisen said. “What Trump was trying to do was a self-coup, using lawyers instead of soldiers.”\n\nMore:Is Trump indictment in big Jan. 6 case imminent? Jack Smith's background may hold hints\n\nNoah Bookbinder, a former federal prosecutor who is now executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said no one should take lightly Trump’s two prior cases, in which he’s charged with allegedly hoarding classified documents when he left office in 2021 and paying hush money to a mistress while campaigning for it in 2016.\n\n“There's credible evidence that he engaged in a wide variety of criminal activity and that's extraordinary,” said Bookbinder. “But when Donald Trump engaged in a course of conduct to try to keep himself in power after losing an election, that really endangered the viability of democracy in America.”\n\n“It really was an assault on this republic and on the form of government that we've had for centuries,” Bookbinder said. “And that is just about the most dangerous and serious thing that a leader in this country, maybe that anyone in this country, can do.”\n\nHere’s a look at the charges brought by Smith – as well as a looming one by a Georgia prosecutor – and why legal experts say they are so significant:\n\nWhat is Trump being indicted for?\n\nTrump has been under investigation on two fronts for allegedly illegal activity in the weeks and months after losing the 2020 election to Biden.\n\nOne probe was launched almost immediately by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in Georgia for Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn Biden’s win in the critical swing state.\n\nWillis, who represents the broad Atlanta area, has since widened her investigation to look into alleged efforts by Trump and his team of lawyers and other associates to overturn Biden election victories in other states too, primarily by creating a false slate of electors who could then be approved by Trump allies in Congress. Trump is widely expected to be indicted soon in that case.\n\nMore:Will DOJ's target letter to Donald Trump lead to a new indictment? Here's what it could mean.\n\nThe Justice Department also launched a wide-ranging investigation into the events of Jan. 6, including Trump’s efforts as president to overturn the election.\n\nWhen Trump declared himself a candidate for office in 2024 last November, Biden’s politically appointed attorney general, Merrick Garland, tapped Smith − a former DOJ lawyer and war crimes prosecutor − as a special counsel to take over the various Trump probes in an effort to prevent the appearance of a politically motivated conflict of interest.\n\nClose to the vest, but glimmers of details\n\nBoth Smith and Willis are well-known for keeping their investigations close to the vest, but glimmers of what charges they were likely to seek have emerged from their respective investigations, which remain independent of each other.\n\nIn the federal case, Smith had sent Trump what’s known as a \"target letter\" based on evidence that prosecutors have brought before grand juries sitting in Washington and South Florida.\n\nThe target letter, which Trump has confirmed, notified the former president that he faced at least three criminal felony charges relating to the events on and before Jan. 6, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol and stopped Congress from certifying Biden's Electoral College win and initiating the orderly transfer of power. In the indictment handed up Tuesday, he was actually charged with four: Conspiracy to Defraud the United States; Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding; Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding; and Conspiracy Against Rights.\n\nSeveral of the charges in the new indictment give prosecutors extremely wide latitude in deciding how to prosecute Trump and suspected co-conspirators for allegedly teaming up after the election to overturn its results.\n\nOne of the charges appears to focus on obstruction or attempted obstruction of an official proceeding, presumably regarding the orderly transfer of power that was temporarily halted at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Another involves a post-Civil War civil rights statute that makes it a crime for people to conspire to threaten or intimidate others from exercising their rights under the Constitution and federal law.\n\nIn the Georgia case, Willis has all but said she plans to indict Trump and potentially a host of other people in a broad-ranging racketeering or conspiracy case.\n\nThe Georgia conspiracy law is much broader than the federal conspiracy statute, because it only requires a corrupt agreement between two or more persons, even if they never take steps actually to do anything.\n\nWillis has used the state anti-racketeering law before, including in a case against Atlanta public school administrators and teachers accused of conspiring to inflate test scores illegally.\n\nTo be guilty, she said in her opening arguments in that case, all co-conspirators “have to do is all be doing the same thing for the same purpose. You all have to be working towards that same goal.”\n\nBut neither Smith nor Willis has given any hint of who else might be indicted along with Trump in the alleged conspiracy, and for what.\n\nThe federal indictment handed up Tuesday lists six people as co-conspirators in Trump’s alleged schemes to illegally stay in power, including Jeffrey Clark, a high-ranking Justice Department official in the Trump administration. It also says there are other potential co-conspirators \"known and unknown to the grand jury,\" suggesting future charges are possible.\n\nThe indictment does not name any of the alleged six co-conspirators it describes by their roles in the conspiracy. But referring to Clark, it says “co-conspirator 4” is “a Justice Department official who worked on civil matters and who, with the Defendant, attempted to use the Justice Department to open sham election crime investigations and influence state legislatures with knowingly false claims of election fraud.”\n\nThe other co-conspirators allegedly helped Trump “in his criminal efforts to overturn the legitimate results of the 2020 presidential election and retain power.”\n\nThe indictment described one “an attorney who was willing to spread knowingly false claims and pursue strategies that the Defendant's 2020 re-election campaign attorneys would not,” while another attorney “devised and attempted to implement a strategy to leverage the Vice President's ceremonial role overseeing the certification proceeding to obstruct the certification of the presidential election.\"\n\nA potentially large group of Jan. 6 co-conspirators\n\nIn both cases, the possibilities of who besides Trump might be charged are wide open.\n\nTrump's former White House director of trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, openly boasted about scheming to delay certification of Biden's 2020 election with the help of longtime Trump adviser Steve Bannon. In Navarro's 2021 book, \"In Trump Time,\" he referred to it as operation \"Green Bay Sweep\" and said it was the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats’ jaws of deceit.\"\n\nNavarro, who has denied wrongdoing, said in a later interview that Trump was “on board with the strategy,” according to the special House Jan. 6 committee investigating the attacks.\n\nSmith’s investigators have brought many of Trump’s closest political allies and White House associates before the grand jury for questioning, including former chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump’s personal and campaign lawyers, such as Rudy Giuliani.\n\nBut there are perhaps six other potential conspiracies involving Trump, according to legal analysts and the Jan. 6 committee, which referred three charges to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution based on its 18-month investigation and series of public hearings.\n\nMore: ‘Somewhat dicey' and ‘problematic’: Inside Trump's bid to have fake electors overturn 2020 election\n\nOne was Trump's alleged effort to steal or illegally obtain votes in several states, notably in Georgia, where he called Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and demanded that he help him \"win\" Georgia: \"So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state,\" Trump said on the call, which also included aides and lawyers.\n\nAnother possible scheme involved cultivating fake electors in at least four swing states in an effort to illegally replace the Electoral College votes legitimately given to Biden because of his wins in those states' popular vote.\n\nThere is Trump's alleged conspiracy with Justice Department official Jeff Clark to have the Justice Department investigate election fraud that didn't exist. And there is Trump's unrelated effort to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify the election, which Pence refused.\n\nTrump also faces potential liability over his efforts to raise millions of dollars by lying about losing an election he knew Biden had won. And last but certainly not least, according to the Jan. 6 committee and legal analysts, were Trump's alleged efforts to send his supporters to the Capitol on Jan. 6 and stop Congress from certifying the election.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor and criminal defense attorney Rory Little said the fact that the two new potential cases involve the actions of a sitting president make them a critically important test for the viability of American democracy.\n\n“The wide-ranging scope of charges is almost unheard of. It's really like an organized crime case against the boss of a very large crime family,” said Little, a professor of constitutional law at the University of California School of Law, San Francisco. “But it’s also a crisis for the rule of law, because either our system is going to sort of get through this with a feeling of integrity, or we're going to emerge from this with a great loss of public confidence in what the law can accomplish and what the law means.”\n\nMore:A breakdown of the 187 minutes Trump was out of view on Jan. 6 as aides urged him to act\n\nWill criminal indictments for Jan. 6 hurt Trump politically?\n\nSo far, Trump’s mounting legal jeopardy has done little to help his presumed Democratic rival in the 2024 election, Joe Biden, or even to break the political stalemate that has deadlocked Congress – and the American people – in terms of who they’ll support.\n\nIn fact, the more Trump faces increased criminal jeopardy, the more it helps him politically as the 2024 Republican presidential primary field takes shape. President Joe Biden usually holds a slight lead over Trump in a general election contest but one recent poll, the New York Times/Siena College poll released Tuesday, found Trump and Biden to be tied at 43 percent in a general election matchup.\n\nTuesday's indictment was unsealed less than an hour after Trump sought to preempt prosecutors by announcing to supporters that he expected to be charged.\n\n\"Why didn’t they do this 2.5 years ago?\" Trump posted on his Truth Social account. \"Why did they wait so long? Because they wanted to put it right in the middle of my campaign. Prosecutorial Misconduct!\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/fact-check-trump-announcement-speech-2024/index.html", "title": "Fact check: 20 false and misleading claims Trump made in his ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump began his 2024 presidential campaign just as he ended his presidency in 2021: with a whole lot of inaccuracy.\n\nLike many of Trump’s speeches as president, his announcement speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday was filled with false claims about a variety of topics – from his record in office to his Democratic opponents to the economy, the environment and foreign policy.\n\nHere is a fact check of 20 false or misleading things he said. This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}]}

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nMore than 15 years after fast radio bursts were discovered, new research has both unraveled and deepened the mystery of the sources of these deep space phenomena.\n\nFast radio bursts, or FRBs, are bright, powerful emissions of radio waves ranging from a fraction of a millisecond to a few milliseconds, each producing energy equivalent to the sun’s annual output.\n\nRecent research suggested that some FRBs originate from magnetars, which are neutron stars with extremely powerful magnetic fields. A fast radio burst found in the Milky Way was associated with a magnetar, according to a 2020 study.\n\nBut scientists haven’t yet pinpointed the origins of cosmological FRBs, which are very distant at billions of light-years away. It’s a quandary that led an international team of scientists to see what it could learn from observations of nearly 1,900 bursts from an active fast radio burst source outside our galaxy called FRB 20201124A, according to a study published September 21 in the journal Nature.\n\nAn illustration depicts a fast radio burst (not the one detailed in the new studies). Mark Garlick/Science Photo Librarary/scipho/AP\n\nThe emissions associated with FRB 20201124A occurred for 82 hours over 54 days in the spring of 2021, making it one of the most active known fast radio bursts. It was visible through the world’s largest radio telescope – the China-based Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, or FAST.\n\nDuring the first 36 days, the study team was surprised to see irregular, short-time variations of the Faraday rotation measure, which measures the strength of the magnetic field and density of particles in the surroundings of FRB 20201124A. A larger rotation measure means the magnetic field near the radio burst’s source is stronger, denser or both, and a smaller measure means the opposite, Bing Zhang, a coauthor of the study and astrophysicist, said via email.\n\n“This is not reflective of the beginning of the FRB’s (life span),” said Zhang, the founding director of the Center for Astrophysics at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. “The FRB source has been there for a long time but has been dormant most of the time. It occasionally wakes up (this time for 54 days) and emits a lot of bursts.”\n\nThe measures went up and down during that time period, then stopped during the last 18 days before the FRB dampened – “suggesting that the magnetic field strength and/or density along the line of sight in the vicinity of the FRB source are varying with time,” Zhang added. “It suggests that the environment of the FRB source is dynamically evolving, with rapidly changing magnetic fields or density or both.”\n\n“I equate it to filming a movie of the surroundings of an FRB source, and our film revealed a complex, dynamically evolving, magnetized environment that was never imagined before,” Zhang said in a news release.\n\nA physical model that a different team of researchers made based on the observations of FRB 20201124A proposes that the FRB came from a binary system about 8,480 light-years away containing a magnetar and a Be star, a star that’s hotter and larger and rotates faster than the sun, according to a separate study published September 21 in the journal Nature Communications.\n\nThe radio burst’s complex, magnetized environment is within about an astronomical unit (the distance between Earth and the sun) from its source, the researchers found.\n\nThey also discovered that the burst originated from a barred spiral galaxy, which is metal-rich and similar in size to the Milky Way, by using the 10-meter Keck telescopes in Mauna Kea, Hawaii. The radio burst’s source is located between the galaxy’s spiral arms where no significant star formation is taking place, making it less likely the origin is solely a magnetar, according to Nature study coauthor Subo Dong, an associate professor at the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Peking University.\n\n“Such an environment is not straightforwardly expected for an isolated magnetar,” Zhang said in a news release. “Something else might be in the vicinity of the FRB engine, possibly a binary companion.”\n\nThe modeling study should encourage further searches for fast radio burst signals from Be star/X-ray binaries, the authors said.\n\n“These observations brought us back to the drawing board,” Zhang said. “It is clear that FRBs are more mysterious than what we have imagined. More multi-wavelength observational campaigns are needed to further unveil the nature of these objects.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/world/webb-telescope-eerie-pillars-of-creation-scn/index.html", "title": "Ghostly figures emerge from Pillars of Creation in new Webb ...", "text": "The Pillars of Creation are set off in a kaleidoscope of colour in the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope's near-infrared-light view. The pillars look like arches and spires rising out of a desert landscape, but are filled with semi-transparent gas and dust, and ever changing. This is a region where young stars are forming -- or have barely burst from their dusty cocoons as they continue to form. Protostars are the scene-stealers in this Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) image. These are the bright red orbs that sometimes appear with eight diffraction spikes. When knots with sufficient mass form within the pillars, they begin to collapse under their own gravity, slowly heat up, and eventually begin shining brightly. Along the edges of the pillars are wavy lines that look like lava. These are ejections from stars that are still forming. Young stars periodically shoot out jets that can interact within clouds of material, like these thick pillars of gas and dust. This sometimes also results in bow shocks, which can form wavy patterns like a boat does as it moves through water. These young stars are estimated to be only a few hundred thousand years old, and will continue to form for millions of years. Although it may appear that near-infrared light has allowed Webb to \"pierce through\" the background to reveal great cosmic distances beyond the pillars, the interstellar medium stands in the way, like a drawn curtain. This is also the reason why there are no distant galaxies in this view. This translucent layer of gas blocks our view of the deeper universe. Plus, dust is lit up by the collective light from the packed \"party\" of stars that have burst free from the pillars.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nA stellar nursery where stars are born, interactions between galaxies and a unique view of an exoplanet are just some of the new cosmic images were shared Tuesday.\n\nAfter decades of waiting, it’s finally time for the world to see the first images taken by the most powerful space telescope ever – the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nDevelopment of the world’s premier space observatory began in 2004, and after years of delays, the telescope and its massive gold mirror finally launched on December 25.\n\nThe first glimpse of how the James Webb Space Telescope will change the way people see the universe has arrived.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has released one of Webb’s first images, and it’s “the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,” according to NASA.\n\nThe space observatory, which launched in December, will be able to peer inside the atmospheres of exoplanets and observe some of the first galaxies created after the universe began by viewing them through infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nWebb will peer into the very atmospheres of exoplanets, some of which are potentially habitable, and it could uncover clues in the ongoing search for life outside of Earth.\n\nThe telescope will also look at every phase of cosmic history, including the first glows after the big bang that created our universe and the formation of the galaxies, stars and planets that fill it today.\n\nNow, Webb is ready to help us understand the origins of the universe and begin to answer key questions about our existence, such as where we came from and if we’re alone in the cosmos.\n\nThe first images\n\nThe first image, released on Monday, shows SMACS 0723, where a massive group of galaxy clusters act as a magnifying glass for the objects behind them. Called gravitational lensing, this created Webb’s first deep field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies.\n\nThe image of SMACS 0723 is \"the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,\" according to NASA. NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\nSome of these distant galaxies and star clusters have never been seen before. The galaxy cluster is shown as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nThe image, taken by Webb’s Near-Infrared Camera, is composed of images taken at different wavelengths of light over a collective 12.5 hours. Deep field observations are lengthy observations of regions of the sky that can reveal faint objects.\n\nNASA shared Webb’s first cosmic targets on Friday, providing a teaser for what else Tuesday’s image release will include: the Carina Nebula, WASP-96b, the Southern Ring Nebula and Stephan’s Quintet.\n\nWebb’s study of the giant gas planet WASP-96 b is the most detailed spectrum of an exoplanet to date. The spectrum includes different wavelengths of light that reveal new information about the planet and its atmosphere. Discovered in 2014, WASP-96 b is located 1,150 light-years from Earth. It has half the mass of Jupiter and completes an orbit around its star every 3.4 days.\n\nNASA's James Webb Space Telescope captured a spectrum of WASP-96 b. NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\nWebb’s spectrum includes “the distinct signature of water, along with evidence for clouds and haze, in the atmosphere surrounding a hot, puffy gas giant planet orbiting a distant Sun-like star,” according to NASA.\n\nThe observation demonstrates “Webb’s unprecedented ability to analyze atmospheres hundreds of light-years away,” according to NASA.\n\nIn the future, Webb will capture actual images of known exoplanets while also searching for unknown planets, said Knicole Colón, Webb deputy project scientist for exoplanet science at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, during a news conference. And the spectrium of WASP-96 b is “barely scratching the surface of what we’re going to learn.”\n\nColón anticipates that scientists will determine just how much water is in the exoplanet’s atmosphere.\n\nThe Southern Ring Nebula, also called the “Eight-Burst,” is 2,000 light-years away from Earth. This large planetary nebula includes an expanding cloud of gas around a dying star. Webb helped reveal previously hidden details about the nebula, which is a shell of gas and dust released by the dying star. The nebula’s second star can be seen in the Webb image, as well as how the stars shape the gas and dust cloud.\n\nNASA/ESA/STScl/Aura NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI NASA\n\nThe second star is surrounded by dust while the brighter star, at an earlier stage of evolution, will release its own cloud of gas and dust later on. As the two stars orbit one another, they effectively “stir” the gas and dust, resulting in the patterns seen in the image.\n\nThe insights from images like this could help astronomers to unlock how stars change their environments as they evolve. Multi-colored points of light in the background represent galaxies.\n\nThe space telescope’s view of Stephan’s Quintet shows the way galaxies interact with one another. This compact galaxy group, first discovered in 1877, is located 290 million light-years away in the constellation Pegasus. Four of the five galaxies in the group “are locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters,” according to a NASA statement.\n\nNASA/ESA/Hubble SM4 ERO Team NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI NASA\n\nIf you’ve ever watched “It’s a Wonderful Life,” you’ve seen Stephan’s Quintet. Now, Webb has revealed the galactic grouping in a new mosaic which is the telescope’s largest image to date.\n\n“The information from Webb provides new insights into how galactic interactions may have driven galaxy evolution in the early universe,” according to NASA.\n\nThe Stephan’s Quintet image provides a rare glimpse into how galaxies can trigger star formation in one another when they interact, as well as outflows driven by a black hole at a new level of detail.\n\nThe gravitational dance between these galaxies can be seen through tails of gas, dust and stars and even shock waves as one of the galaxies pushes through the cluster.\n\nLocated 7,600 light-years away, the Carina Nebula is a stellar nursery, where stars are born. It is one of the largest and brightest nebulae in the sky and home to many stars much more massive than our sun.\n\nNow, its “Cosmic Cliffs” are revealed in an incredible new Webb image.\n\nNASA/ESA/Hubble Heritage Team NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI NASA\n\nWebb’s ability to see through cosmic dust has revealed previously invisible areas of star birth within the nebula, which could provide new insight on the formation of stars. The earliest stages of star formation are harder to capture – but something Webb’s sensitivity can chronicle.\n\nWhat looks like a landscape in the image is really a massive gaseous cavity with “peaks” reaching 7 light-years high.\n\n“The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble, above the area shown in this image,” according to NASA. And what looks like “steam” rising off the “mountains” is hot, energetic gas and dust.\n\nThe targets were selected by an international committee, including members from NASA, the European Space Agency, the Canadian Space Agency and the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'I'm a little verklempt': Analyst breaks down stunning new Webb telescope images 03:50 - Source: CNN\n\nA long future of observation\n\nThese will be the first of many images to come from Webb, the most powerful telescope ever launched into space. The mission, originally expected to last for 10 years, has enough excess fuel capability to operate for 20 years, according to NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy.\n\n“The James Webb Space Telescope will give us a fresh and powerful set of eyes to examine our universe,” Smith wrote in an update on NASA’s website. “The world is about to be new again.”\n\nWhile some of what Webb could reveal has been anticipated, the unknowns are just as exciting to scientists.\n\n“We don’t know what we don’t know yet,” said Amber Straughn, Webb deputy project scientist for communications at NASA Goddard. “I think it’s true that every time we launch a revolutionary instrument into space, like with Hubble, we learn things that completely surprise us but do cause us to sort of change our fundamental understanding of how the universe works.”\n\nHubble’s 31 years have yielded a wealth of discoveries that couldn’t be anticipated, and the scientific community views Webb and its capabilities in the same way.\n\nWhen comparing Webb’s first images to other breakthroughs in astronomy, Webb program scientist and NASA Astrophysics Division chief scientist Eric Smith compared it to seeing Hubble’s images after the telescope was repaired and everything snapped into focus.\n\n“A lot of people sometimes see pictures of space and they think it makes them feel small,” Smith said. “When I see these pictures, they make me feel powerful. A team of people can make this unbelievable instrument to find out things about the universe revealed here, and just seeing that pride in the team, and pride in humanity, that when we want to, we can do that.”\n\n“The universe has (always) been out there,” said Jane Rigby, Webb operations project scientist at NASA Goddard. “We just had to build a telescope to go see what was there. Yeah, very similar feeling of, maybe, people in a broken world managing to do something right and to see some of the majesty that is out there.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/world/year-in-space-discoveries-moments-scn/index.html", "title": "2022's unforgettable moments in space exploration | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThis year, humankind glimpsed the universe in ways that were never before possible, and space missions took unprecedented leaps forward in unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos.\n\nWe witnessed the first mission to the International Space Station funded entirely by space tourists. A new space-based internet service played a key role in the war in Ukraine. And there were historic launches of spacecraft and technology by NASA and its international partners that could one day be used to land humans on Mars.\n\n“There is no doubt that 2022 was out of this world,” NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. “2022 will go down in the history books as one of the most accomplished years across all of NASA’s missions.”\n\nHere are some of the unforgettable space discoveries and moments from 2022.\n\nArtemis I moon mission launches\n\nAfter years of preparation, NASA finally got its latest lunar exploration program off the ground with an uncrewed test flight that carried anastronaut-worthy spacecraft around the moon.\n\nThe mission was chock-full of huge moments. The rocket that got the mission off the ground, the Space Launch System or SLS, became the most powerful rocket ever to reach orbit — boasting 15% more thrust than the Saturn V rockets behind the Apollo program.\n\nUpon reaching space, the Orion capsule, which flew empty save for a few test mannequins, captured stunning images of the Earth and moon. And Orion’s orbital path swung farther out beyond the far side of the moon than any spacecraft designed to carry humans has traveled before.\n\nNASA's Orion spacecraft captures an image of the \"Earth rise\" as it emerges from the far side of the moon. NASA\n\nThe trial run has paved the way for future Artemis missions, with the aim of returning humans to the lunar surface before mapping out a pathway for the first human spaceflight to Mars.\n\nWebb telescope reveals the invisible universe\n\nIn partnership with international space agencies, NASA not only made strides in its human exploration program, but it also notched steps forward in scientific endeavors. After decades of anticipation, the James Webb Space Telescope finally began observing the universe in July.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope captured this image of the spiral galaxy IC 5332. ESA/NASA/CSA/J. Lee\n\nSince then, the world’s most powerful space observatory has turned its gaze on planets, stars and galaxies in infrared light, which is invisible to the human eye.\n\nThe telescope has spied unseen aspects of the universe and previously hidden features, including the most distant galaxies ever observed. Webb has also shared new perspectives on some of astronomy’s favorite cosmic features and captured them in a new light, such as the Pillars of Creation.\n\nThe telescope’s images have already gone beyond what astronomers expected — and the best news: Webb is just getting started.\n\nObserving astronomical wonders for the first time\n\nThe Webb telescope, however, wasn’t the only space observatory expanding our understanding of deep space. The Hubble Space Telescope spied the most distant single star ever observed, faintly shining 28 billion light-years away. The star existed just 900 million years after the big bang created the universe, and its light has traveled nearly 13 billion years to reach Earth.\n\nAstronomers nicknamed the star Earendel, derived from an Old English word that means “morning star” or “rising light.”\n\nMeanwhile, astronomers used the Event Horizon Telescope to capture an image of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy for the first time. This first direct observation confirmed the presence of the black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, as the beating heart of the Milky Way.\n\nWhile black holes don’t emit light, the shadow of the cosmic object was surrounded by a bright ring — light bent by the gravity of the black hole.\n\nShifting an asteroid’s trajectory in space\n\nIn late September, NASA successfully completed the first test mission for planetary defense. The space agency slammed a spacecraft into Dimorphos, a small asteroid that orbits a larger space rock named Didymos — and yes, the collision was intentional. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test, or DART, was a full-scale demonstration of deflection technology.\n\nThe rocky surface of Dimorphos was the last thing DART saw before crashing into the asteroid. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nNeither Dimorphos nor Didymos poses a threat to Earth, but the system was a perfect target to test a technique that may one day be used to protect the planet from an asteroid strike.\n\nThe DART mission marked the first time humanity intentionally changed the motion of a celestial object in space. The spacecraft altered the moonlet asteroid’s orbit by 32 minutes.\n\nNASA announces plans to study UFOs\n\nAnd that’s not all 2022 offered when it came to the study of unusual objects in the skies. In June, NASA announced it would delve into the mysteries surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena, more popularly known as unidentified flying objects or UFOs. The space agency later selected a team of experts across numerous disciplines — including astrobiology, data science, oceanography, genetics, policy and planetary science — for the task.\n\nOfficials at NASA aren’t suggesting aliens may be responsible for such phenomena. The goal is merely to take a serious look at the as-yet-unexplained — but much publicly debated — topic of UAPs and how they might be studied through a scientific lens.\n\n“Without access to an extensive set of data, it is nearly impossible to verify or explain any observation, thus the focus of the study is to inform NASA what possible data could be collected in the future to scientifically discern the nature of UAP,” according to a NASA news release.\n\nMilestones on Mars\n\nMeanwhile on the red planet, the InSight lander’s mission came to an end due to a surplus of dust on its solar panels (and no whirlwinds to vacuum them clean), but the stationary spacecraft made history in 2022. InSight detected the largest quake on Mars and captured the sounds of space rocks slamming into the planet — which created craters that revealed treasure troves of subsurface ice.\n\nThe NASA InSight lander acquired this image of the area in front of the spacecraft on Mars on December 11. NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nAs InSight winds down, the Perseverance rover’s sidekick has continued to take to the Martian skies, above and beyond its original five-flight mission. The Ingenuity helicopter broke its own altitude record and has aced 37 flights on the red planet since April 2021. The little chopper has acted as an aerial scout for Perseverance, which collected an incredible diversity of Martian rock and sediment samples.\n\nNow, the rover is setting up a depot of samples that will be stored on the Martian surface. The samples will be retrieved and returned to Earth in 2033 via the ambitious Mars Sample Return program, which will send a lander and a duo of retrieval helicopters to the red planet later this decade.\n\nInterstellar meteor visits our cosmic neighborhood\n\nSpeaking of space rocks, a rare specimen traveled to Earth in 2014. But scientists just put its puzzle pieces together this year, and the discovery was announced in a US Space Command document.\n\nThe first known interstellar meteor to hit Earth crash-landed along the northeast coast of Papua New Guinea in January 2014.\n\nInterstellar meteors are space rocks originating from outside our solar system, such as ʻOumuamua, the first known interstellar object in our solar system that was detected in 2017.\n\nDebris from Space Shuttle Challenger disaster discovered\n\nTo be sure, NASA has seen many successes this year but also faced reminders of tragedy and disaster. Investigators set off in March to search suspected shipwreck sites in the Bermuda Triangle, a swath of the northern Atlantic Ocean said to be the site of dozens of shipwrecks and plane crashes, for a TV docuseries. But the crew stumbled upon something unexpected at another site off Florida’s east coast: a 20-foot-long (6-meter-long) piece of debris from the Space Shuttle Challenger, which broke apart shortly after takeoff in 1986 and killed all seven crew members aboard.\n\nDivers discovered a lost piece of the Space Shuttle Challenger while scouring the ocean floor off Florida's east coast. The History Channel/\"The Bermuda Triangle: Into Cursed Waters\"\n\nIt was the first debris to be discovered since pieces from the shuttle washed ashore in 1996.\n\n“This discovery gives us an opportunity to pause once again, to uplift the legacies of the seven pioneers we lost, and to reflect on how this tragedy changed us,” Nelson, the NASA administrator, said in a statement. “At NASA, the core value of safety is — and must forever remain — our top priority, especially as our missions explore more of the cosmos than ever before.”\n\nNascent satellite system provides internet to war-torn Ukraine\n\nAs Russia launched its invasion in February and some areas of Ukraine lost internet access, a space-based internet system that barely existed a few years ago began to provide crucial connectivity.\n\nElon Musk’s SpaceX designed and launched the system, called Starlink. It makes use of thousands of small satellites orbiting a few hundred miles above Earth. The satellites work in tandem to blanket the globe in internet connectivity, and all that’s needed to get online is an easy-to-use Starlink satellite dish.\n\nMusk and SpaceX sent thousands of those dishes to Ukraine. Though a funding controversy later ensued, the use of Starlink in the Eastern European country was hailed as a game changer in strategic communication for its military, allowing Ukraine to fight effectively, even as the ongoing war disrupted cellular phone and internet networks.\n\nFirst all-private mission to the space station\n\nStarlink, however, is one small part of SpaceX’s booming business. The company routinely launches not only satellites but also astronauts into space on NASA’s behalf. And this year, SpaceX even flew a few wealthy thrill-seekers to the International Space Station on a mission brokered by Axiom. The event marked the first space station mission that was fully paid for by paying customers and included only private citizens.\n\nThe AX-1 crew is shown (from left): Larry Connor, Michael López-Alegría, Mark Pathy, Michael López-Alegría and Eytan Stibbe. Courtesy SpaceX\n\nThere were four crew members. Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee, was mission commander. And the three paying customers were Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe, Canadian investor Mark Pathy and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor.\n\nThe mission, called AX-1, launched on April 8 and was originally billed as a 10-day trip. Delays, however, extended the mission by about a week.\n\nAllowing private missions to the space station is part of NASA’s plan for more commercial activity in low-Earth orbit as it turns its focus to exploring deep space.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland Jackie Wattles", "Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/30/world/celestial-events-2023-scn/index.html", "title": "Watch the night sky for these celestial events in 2023 | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nStunning meteor showers, full moons and eclipses will light up the sky in 2023.\n\nThe year is sure to be a sky-gazer’s delight with plenty of celestial events on the calendar.\n\nA comet discovered in March 2022 will make its closest approach to the sun on January 12, according to NASA. The comet, spotted by astronomers using the Zwicky Transient Facility at the Palomar Observatory in San Diego County, California, is named C/2022 E3 (ZTF) and will make its closest pass of Earth on February 2.\n\nThe comet should be visible through binoculars in the morning sky for sky watchers in the Northern Hemisphere during most of January and those in the Southern Hemisphere in early February, according to NASA.\n\nINTERACTIVE: The best space photos of 2022\n\nOn any given day, there is always a good chance that the International Space Station is flying overhead. And if you ever want to know what planets are visible in the morning or evening sky, check The Old Farmer’s Almanac’s calculator.\n\nHere are the rest of 2023’s top sky events, so you can have your binoculars and telescope ready.\n\nFull moons and supermoons\n\nMost years, there are 12 full moons — one for each month. But in 2023, there will be 13 full moons, with two occurring in August.\n\nThe second full moon in one month is known as a blue moon, like the phrase “once in a blue moon,” according to NASA. Typically, full moons occur every 29 days, while most months in our calendar last 30 or 31 days, so the months and moon phases don’t always align. This results in a blue moon about every 2.5 years.\n\nThe two full moons in August can also be considered supermoons, according to EarthSky. Definitions of a supermoon can vary, but the term generally denotes a full moon that is brighter and closer to Earth than normal and thus appears larger in the night sky.\n\nSome astronomers say the phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 90% of perigee — its closest approach to Earth in orbit. By that definition, the full moon for July will also be considered a supermoon event, according to EarthSky.\n\nHere is the list of full moons for 2023, according to the Old Farmer’s Almanac:\n\nJanuary 6: Wolf moon\n\nFebruary 5: Snow moon\n\nMarch 7: Worm moon\n\nApril 6: Pink moon\n\nMay 5: Flower moon\n\nJune 3: Strawberry moon\n\nJuly 3: Buck moon\n\nAugust 1: Sturgeon moon\n\nAugust 30: Blue moon\n\nSeptember 29: Harvest moon\n\nOctober 28: Hunter’s moon\n\nNovember 27: Beaver moon\n\nDecember 26: Cold moon\n\nWhile these are the popularized names associated with the monthly full moon, each one carries its own significance across Native American tribes (with many also referred to by differing names).\n\nLunar and solar eclipses\n\nThere will be two solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses in 2023.\n\nA total solar eclipse will occur on April 20, visible to those in Australia, Southeast Asia and Antarctica. This kind of event occurs when the moon moves between the sun and Earth, blocking out the sun.\n\nAnd for some skywatchers in Indonesia, parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea, it will actually be a hybrid solar eclipse. The curvature of Earth’s surface can cause some eclipses to shift between total and annular as the moon’s shadow moves across the globe, according to NASA.\n\nLike a total solar eclipse, the moon passes between the sun and the Earth during an annular eclipse — but it occurs when the moon is at or near its farthest point from Earth, according to NASA. This causes the moon to appear smaller than the sun, so it doesn’t completely block out our star and creates a glowing ring around the moon.\n\nA Western Hemisphere-sweeping annular solar eclipse will occur on October 14 and be visible across North, Central and South America.\n\nBe sure to wear proper eclipse glasses to safely view solar eclipses, as the sun’s light can be damaging to the eye.\n\nMeanwhile, a lunar eclipse can occur only during a full moon when the sun, Earth and moon align and the moon passes into Earth’s shadow. When this occurs, Earth casts two shadows on the moon during the eclipse. The partial outer shadow is called the penumbra; the full, dark shadow is the umbra.\n\nWhen the full moon moves into Earth’s shadow, it darkens, but it won’t disappear. Instead, sunlight passing through Earth’s atmosphere lights the moon in a dramatic fashion, turning it red — which is why the event is often referred to as a “blood moon.”\n\nDepending on the weather conditions in your area, it may be a rusty or brick-colored red. This happens because blue light undergoes stronger atmospheric scattering, so red light will be the most dominant color highlighted as sunlight passes through our atmosphere and casts it on the moon.\n\nA total lunar eclipse appeared in the skies of Canta, east of Lima on May 15, 2022. Ernesto Benavides/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA penumbral lunar eclipse will occur on May 5 for those in Africa, Asia and Australia. This less dramatic version of a lunar eclipse happens when the moon moves through the penumbra, or the faint, outer part of Earth’s shadow.\n\nA partial lunar eclipse on October 28 will be visible to those in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, parts of North America and much of South America. Partial eclipses occur when the sun, Earth and moon don’t completely align, so only part of the moon passes into shadow.\n\nMeteor showers\n\nThe new year kicks off with the Quadrantid meteor shower, which is expected to peak in the overnight hours between January 3 and 4 for those in North America, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nIt’s the first of 12 meteor showers throughout the year, although the next one, the Lyrid meteor shower, doesn’t peak until April.\n\nHere are peak dates of other showers to watch in 2023:\n\nLyrids: April 22-23\n\nEta Aquariids: May 5-6\n\nSouthern delta Aquariids: July 30-31\n\nAlpha Capricornids: July 30-31\n\nPerseids: August 12-13\n\nOrionids: October 20-21\n\nSouthern Taurids: November 4-5\n\nNorthern Taurids: November 11-12\n\nLeonids: November 17-18\n\nGeminids: December 13-14\n\nUrsids: December 21-22\n\nIf you live in an urban area, you may want to drive to a place that isn’t littered with city lights. If you’re able to find an area unaffected by light pollution, meteors could be visible every couple of minutes from late evening until dawn.\n\nFind an open area with a wide view of the sky. Make sure you have a chair or blanket so you can look straight up. And give your eyes about 20 to 30 minutes to adjust to the darkness — without looking at your phone! — so the meteors will be easier to spot.", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/business/william-shatner-new-book-boldly-go-scn/index.html", "title": "William Shatner describes space travel in new book \"Boldly Go ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nAstronauts have for decades described their trips to space as “breathtaking” and humbling, a reminder of the Earth’s fragility and humanity’s need to serve as stewards of our home planet.\n\nActor William Shatner, who joined a suborbital space tourism flight last year, experienced the same phenomenon, but he had a very distinct observation when he turned his gaze from the Earth to black expanse of the cosmos: “All I saw was death,” he wrote in a new book.\n\nShatner’s biography, called “Boldly Go,” which he co-wrote with TV and film writer Joshua Brandon, is filled with similarly grim anecdotes about Shatner’s experience bolting above the Earth’s atmosphere aboard a real-life rocket after his memorable stint playing a spaceship captain on the 1960s TV show “Star Trek” and several franchise movies in the following decades.\n\n“I saw a cold, dark, black emptiness. It was unlike any blackness you can see or feel on Earth. It was deep, enveloping, all-encompassing. I turned back toward the light of home. I could see the curvature of Earth, the beige of the desert, the white of the clouds and the blue of the sky. It was life. Nurturing, sustaining, life. Mother Earth. Gaia. And I was leaving her,” reads an excerpt from “Boldly Go” that was first published by Variety.\n\n“Everything I had thought was wrong,” it reads. “Everything I had expected to see was wrong.”\n\nWhile he had expected to be awed at the vision of the cosmos, seen without the filter of the Earth’s atmosphere, he instead became overwhelmed by the idea that humans are slowly destroying our home planet. He felt one of the strongest feelings of grief he’s ever encountered, Shatner wrote.\n\nShatner’s book was released October 4 by publishing house Simon & Schuster. CNN interviewed him in June about the book, his trip to space with the Jeff Bezos-backed space tourism company Blue Origin, and what’s next for the 91-year-old. A transcript of the interview, edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nCNN: We all saw how emotional you were when you stepped out of the Blue Origin spacecraft after landing. How did that experience change you?\n\nWilliam Shatner: Fifty-five or 60 years ago I read a book called “Silent Spring” by Rachel Carson. She wrote about the environmental issues that are still happening today. I’ve been a verbal ecologist since then. I’ve been aware of the changing Earth and my apprehension for all of us.\n\nIt’s like somebody owing money on a mortgage, and they don’t have the payments. And they think, “Oh, well, let’s go to dinner and not think about it.”\n\nBut it’s so omnipresent! The possibilities of an apocalypse are so real. It’s hard to convince people — and especially certain political people — that this is not on our doorstep any longer. It’s in the house.\n\nWhen I got up to space, I wanted to get to the window to see what it was that was out there. I looked at the blackness of space. There were no dazzling lights. It was just palpable blackness. I believed I saw death.\n\nAnd then I looked back at the Earth. Given my background and having read a lot of things about the evolution of Earth over 5 billion years and how all the beauty of nature has evolved, I thought about how we’re killing everything.\n\nI felt this overwhelming sadness for the Earth.\n\nI didn’t realize it until I got down. When I stepped out of the spacecraft, I started crying. I didn’t know why. It took me hours to understand why I was weeping. I realized I was in grief for the Earth.\n\nI don’t want to ever forget, nor have I forgotten, the momentousness of that occasion.\n\nCNN: What else have you realized about the experience in the months since you took your spaceflight?\n\nShatner: I had an awareness that human beings may be the only species alive on this planet that is aware of the enormity and the majesty of the universe.\n\nThink about what we’ve discovered in just the last 100 years given the 200,000 years that humans have existed. We’ve discovered how mountains have formed, the Big Bang. And I kept thinking about how mankind is evolving rapidly into a knowledgeable creature at the same time it’s killing itself.\n\nIt’s a race.\n\nCNN: Space tourism companies such as Blue Origin have also received a lot of criticism from people who view those efforts as more of a vanity project for wealthy individuals rather than something that can be truly transformational. How do you respond to that criticism?\n\nShatner: The whole idea here is to get people accustomed to going to space, as if it’s like going to the Riviera. It’s not only a vanity – it’s a business.\n\nBut what Jeff Bezos wants to do and what is slowly accruing because of our familiarity with space is get those polluting industries up into orbit and get the earth back to what it was. (Editor’s note: Bezos has routinely talked about moving heavy industries into orbit to help preserve the Earth, and that idea also has its skeptics and critics.)\n\nCNN: What do you think about the ‘astronaut’ title. Are people who pay for brief, suborbital flights to space astronauts?\n\nShatner: I call them half astronauts.\n\nCNN: What should we be doing in space next?\n\nShatner: The ability to go to Mars which is lurking in the background, which I think that should take a backseat to going to the moon, setting up the moon as a base and mining whatever the moon has to offer, rather than mining it here.\n\nThose are just my own opinions. What’s-his-name would not agree. He wants to go to Mars. (Editor’s note: SpaceX CEO Elon Musk founded his company with the goal of setting up a colony on Mars.)\n\nStar Trek actor William Shatner speaks to the news media after his flight with three others in a capsule powered by Blue Origin's reusable rocket engine New Shepard on a landing pad near Van Horn, Texas, on October 13, 2021. Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nCNN: Are you are you anxious to go back to space?\n\nShatner: If you had a great love affair, could you go back? Or would that demean it?\n\nCNN: You mentioned you got a chance to speak with famed astrophysicist Stephen Hawking before he died. What was that experience like?\n\nShatner: I was never able to ask him about String Theory, which I wanted to. We had to get him all the questions in advance. And he had said when we made the arrangement, ‘I want to ask Shatner a question.’\n\nFinally, I’m leaning in, you know, we’re sitting side by side looking at the cameras.\n\nSo he laboriously typed out, ‘What is your favorite Star Trek episode?’ which is the question every fan asks, and I started laughing. He didn’t have the ability to laugh (because of his degenerative disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS).\n\nBut his laughter showed in the redness of his face and he got so red. He then invited me to dinner. I had a beautiful moment with him.\n\nCNN: What are you doing next?\n\nShatner: I should take the opportunity to say I have an album out there called “Bill.” And I kept making songs with my collaborators. The song “So Fragile, So Blue,” is very much about my experience in space. I recently performed with (musician) Ben Folds at the Kennedy Center. That could be a TV show or an album.\n\nI also have a really wonderful show called “The UnXplained” on the on the History Channel.\n\nAnd then I have my book, called “Boldly Go,” coming out in the fall.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/world/ufos-nasa-team-study-scn/index.html", "title": "UFO study by NASA-selected study team kicks off | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

Rather, the team will look to hash out exactly how it’s best for NASA to approach further study of the phenomenon.\n\nThe space agency has already noted that the limited number of observations of UAPs has made it difficult to draw scientific conclusions about the nature of such events.\n\n“Without access to an extensive set of data, it is nearly impossible to verify or explain any observation, thus the focus of the study is to inform NASA what possible data could be collected in the future to scientifically discern the nature of UAP,” according to a NASA news release.\n\nThere have been several studies of UAPs carried out by various arms of the US government, including a Pentagon report that was declassified in June 2021, though none have given the public a clear answer about what the UAPs could be. Officials at NASA have been thinking about how to study UAPs in a formal way for a long time, but they wanted to ensure that they approached it in the right way, said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, in June.\n\nThis study, expected to last about nine months, will also be entirely unclassified and within the public domain.\n\n“Exploring the unknown in space and the atmosphere is at the heart of who we are at NASA,” Zurbuchen said in a Friday statement. “Understanding the data we have surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena is critical to helping us draw scientific conclusions about what is happening in our skies. Data is the language of scientists and makes the unexplainable, explainable.”\n\nSpecifically, the team will look for data on “events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena — from a scientific perspective,” the agency said.\n\nUnidentified aerial phenomena are of interest, NASA said, from a security and safety perspective. There was no evidence UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin, NASA emphasized during the initial announcement in June.\n\nThe search for life\n\nThe space agency has long been tasked with finding life elsewhere, which is why astrobiology programs are part of its focus. The Mars Perseverance rover is currently searching for signs of ancient life that may have once existed on the red planet while future missions are being developed to seek signs of life on ocean worlds in our solar system.\n\nThe agency will approach the UAP study like it would any other scientific study, taking a field that is poor in data and making it worthy of scientific investigation and analysis.\n\n“There’s many times where something that looked almost magical turned out to be a new scientific effect,” Zurbuchen said in June.\n\nGiven the national security and air safety issues that have been raised with UAPs, scientists want to look at the observations and establish if these are natural or need to be explained otherwise.\n\nTalking about UAPs in a traditional science environment may be looked down on or regarded as something not related to science, but Zurbuchen has said he “vehemently opposes that.”\n\n“I really believe that the quality of science is not only measured by the outputs that come behind it, but also the questions we’re willing to tackle with science,” he said earlier this year.\n\nLike NASA’s other standard grant review panels, the budget estimated for this project is between tens of thousands of dollars and no more than $100,000, said Daniel Evans, the assistant deputy associate administrator for research at NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.\n\nFrom the outset, it’s difficult to anticipate what the study will reveal. “We should be open to the idea that we’re looking at several different phenomena,” Spergel said earlier this year.\n\n“I think we have to approach all these questions with a sense of humility,” Spergel said. “I’ve spent most of my career as a cosmologist. I can tell you, we don’t know what makes up 95% of the universe. So there are things we don’t understand. I hope this study moves us forward to understand these phenomena better. But at the end of the day, we may conclude that we still don’t understand many aspects of them and perhaps have a road map on how to make progress.”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt Ashley Strickland Jackie Wattles", "Katie Hunt", "Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/23/world/space-2022-scifi-moments-scn/index.html", "title": "10 moments in 2022 straight out of a sci-fi movie | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nFrom a spacecraft the size of a refrigerator plowing into an asteroid (deliberately) to a helicopter trying to catch a rocket plummeting back to Earth, 2022 offered surreal moments in space that could have been ripped from the pages of a science fiction movie script.\n\nAmong the memorable events were billionaires mapping out plans to explore the cosmos and scientists attempting to find answers to perplexing questions, only to discover deeper mysteries.\n\nResearchers managed to grow plants in lunar soil for the first time, while engineers successfully tested an inflatable heat shield that could land humans on Mars. And scientists determined that a rare interstellar meteor crashed into Earth nearly a decade ago.\n\nHere’s a look back at 10 times space travel and exploration felt more like a plot from a Hollywood movie than real life.\n\nCrashing a spacecraft into an asteroid — on purpose\n\nA NASA spacecraft intentionally slammed into Dimorphos, a small asteroid that orbits a larger space rock named Didymos. While this collision seemed like something out of the 1998 movie “Armageddon,” the Double Asteroid Redirection Test was a demonstration of deflection technology — and the first conducted on behalf of planetary defense.\n\nDimorphos' rocky surface was the last thing the DART mission spacecraft saw before crashing into the asteroid. NASA/Johns Hopkins APL\n\nMany tuned in on September 26 to watch as the surface of Dimorphos came into view for the first time, with DART’s cameras beaming back live imagery. The view ended after the spacecraft collided with the asteroid, but images captured by space telescopes and an Italian satellite provided dramatic photos of the aftermath.\n\nThe DART mission marked the first time humanity intentionally changed the motion of a celestial object in space. The spacecraft altered the moonlet asteroid’s orbit by 32 minutes. Neither Dimorphos nor Didymos pose a threat to Earth, but the double-asteroid system was a perfect target to test deflection technology.\n\nA heartbeat in space\n\nFast radio bursts in space have intrigued astronomers since their 2007 discovery, but a mysterious radio burst with a pattern similar to a heartbeat upped the ante this year.\n\nFast radio bursts, or FRBs, are intense, millisecond-long bursts of radio waves with unknown origins — which only fuels speculation that their cause is more alien than cosmic.\n\nAstronomers estimate that the “heartbeat signal” came from a galaxy roughly 1 billion light-years away, but the location and cause of the burst are unknown.\n\nAdditionally, astronomers also detected a powerful radio wave laser, known as a megamaser, and a spinning celestial object releasing giant bursts of energy unlike anything they had ever seen before.\n\nMysterious space rings\n\nSpeaking of strange objects, astronomers made a new leap forward in understanding odd radio circles, or ORCs. No, they aren’t the goblinlike humanoids from “The Lord of the Rings” books, but these fascinating objects have baffled scientists since their discovery in 2020.\n\nAstronomers captured an image of odd radio circles in 2022. © Jayanne English (U. Manitoba)\n\nThe space rings are so massive that they each measure about 1 million light-years across — 16 times bigger than our Milky Way galaxy. Astronomers believe it takes the circles 1 billion years to reach their maximum size, and they are so large they have expanded past other galaxies.\n\nAstronomers took a new detailed photo of odd radio circles using the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory’s MeerKAT telescope, narrowing down the possible theories that might explain these celestial oddballs.\n\nEerie, unusual black holes\n\nBlack holes are known for behaving badly and shredding stars — so astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope were surprised when they saw a black hole fueling star birth.\n\nTheir observation revealed a gaseous umbilical cord stretching from a black hole at the center of a dwarf galaxy to a stellar nursery where stars are born. The stream of gas provided by the black hole triggered a fireworks show of star birth as it interacted with the cloud, which led to a cluster of forming stars.\n\nThis year, astronomers also captured an image of the supermassive black hole lurking at the center of our galaxy, and Hubble spied a lone black hole wandering the Milky Way. And X-ray signals from black holes were converted into eerie sounds we won’t soon forget.\n\nA hook-wielding copter tries to catch a rocket in midair\n\nRocket Lab, a US-based company that launches out of New Zealand, is trying to figure out a way to recapture its rocket boosters as they tumble down toward Earth after launch. In 2022, the company made two attempts to deploy a helicopter with a hook attachment. The wild spectacle is all part of Rocket Lab’s plans to save money by recovering and reusing rocket parts after they vault satellites to space.\n\nThe first attempt in May appeared to go as planned when the helicopter snagged a booster. But the pilots made the decision to drop the rocket part due to safety concerns.\n\nOn the second attempt, the rocket never came into view, and pilots confirmed the booster wouldn’t be returning to the factory dry. In a tweet, the company reported there was a data loss issue during the rocket’s reentry.\n\n‘Open the pod bay doors, Hal’\n\nNASA flew its first virtual assistant on a moon mission with the space agency’s historic Artemis I flight — a version of Amazon’s Alexa.\n\nWhile not exactly reminiscent of HAL 9000, the antagonistic voice assistant in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” the decision did spark plenty of facetious comparisons.\n\nThe Artemis I mission was uncrewed, but NASA’s ground control teams used the voice assistant, called Callisto, to control cabin lighting and play music during the journey. It did not have the ability to open or close doors, for the record.\n\nArtemis I was just a test mission, and NASA is still evaluating how the voice recognition system may be included on future missions.\n\nA Japanese billionaire and 8 artists plan a trip around the moon\n\nJapanese fashion mogul Yusaku Maezawa picked eight passengers who he said will join him on a trip around the moon, powered by SpaceX’s yet-to-be-flown Starship spacecraft. The group includes American DJ Steve Aoki and popular space YouTuber Tim Dodd, better known as the Everyday Astronaut.\n\nThe mission, called Dear Moon, was first announced in 2018 with the intention of flying by 2023. Maezawa initially aimed to take a group of artists with him on a six-day trip around the moon but later announced he had expanded his definition of an “artist.” Instead, Maezawa announced in a video last year that he would be open to people from all walks of life as long as they viewed themselves as artists.\n\nSeparately, millionaire Dennis Tito — who became the first person to pay his way to the International Space Station in the early 2000s — made his own lunar travel plans with SpaceX.\n\n‘Alien’ pace debris found in Australia\n\nChunks of space debris were reportedly found on farmland in Australia’s Snowy Mountains, and NASA and authorities confirmed that the objects were likely scraps of hardware from a SpaceX Dragon capsule intentionally jettisoned as the spacecraft reentered Earth’s atmosphere in May 2021.\n\nLikely debris from SpaceX Crew-1 appears on a field in Dalgety, Australia, in July in an image from social media. Brad Tucker/Reuters\n\nIt’s common for space debris to fall to Earth. But it’s far less common for the objects to wind up on land since most space garbage is discarded in the ocean.\n\nStart-up looks to use centrifuge to fling satellites into space\n\nPerhaps among the most unique space start-ups in the world, SpinLaunch aims to whip satellites around in a vacuum-sealed chamber and toss them into space rather than put them on a rocket.\n\nThe company began testing a scaled-down version of its technology last year, but things ramped up in 2022. SpinLaunch notched its 10th test flight in October.\n\nThere’s a science fiction connection as well. SpinLaunch founder Jonathan Yaney cites the work of Jules Verne — the “Journey to the Center of Earth” writer who died more than 50 years before the first satellite traveled to space — as the inspiration for SpinLaunch.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the company’s technology will ever come to fruition. But in the meantime, this group will be in the New Mexico desert attempting to bring art to life.\n\nJeff Bezos’ joyride rocket explodes on uncrewed mission\n\nIf it wasn’t surreal enough watching Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos and other celebrities travel to space on his self-funded, suborbital rocket last year, hearing that the rocket exploded a little more than a year later over West Texas — albeit on a trip without any passengers — was a harrowing moment that brought home the adage “space is hard.” However, the crew capsule, which was carrying science projects and other inanimate payloads on September 12, was able to land successfully.\n\n“The capsule landed safely and the booster impacted within the designated hazard area,” the Federal Aviation Administration said in a September statement. Bezos’ Blue Origin has been in limbo since and has not returned to flight.\n\nAnd with Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic still grounded, neither of the companies spearheading suborbital space tourism last year are conducting routine flights.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles", "Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/29/world/webb-telescope-deep-field-oldest-galaxies-scn/index.html", "title": "Webb telescope spies a celestial sparkler among the universe's ...", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe very first image captured by the James Webb Space Telescope is revealing some of the oldest stars and galaxies in the universe, including one that looks like a sparkler, according to new research.\n\nWebb’s first stunning view was released by President Joe Biden on July 11 and it is “the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,” according to NASA.\n\nWebb’s first image shows SMACS 0723, where a massive group of galaxy clusters act as a magnifying glass for the objects behind them.\n\nCalled gravitational lensing, this created Webb’s first deep field view that includes incredibly old and faint galaxies. Deep field observations are lengthy observations of regions of the sky that can reveal faint objects.\n\nThe image of SMACS 0723 is \"the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,\" according to NASA. NASA/ESA/CSA/STScI\n\nSome of these distant galaxies and star clusters have never been seen before. The galaxy cluster is shown as it appeared 4.6 billion years ago.\n\nNow, researchers have conducted an analysis of Webb’s first deep field and spotted the most distant globular clusters ever seen. These clusters are dense groups that contain millions of stars, some of which may be the first and oldest stars in the universe. A study detailing the findings were published Thursday in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\n“JWST was built to find the first stars and the first galaxies and to help us understand the origins of complexity in the universe, such as the chemical elements and the building blocks of life,” said Lamiya Mowla, co-lead study author and Dunlap Fellow at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, in a statement.\n\n“This discovery in Webb’s First Deep Field is already providing a detailed look at the earliest phase of star formation, confirming the incredible power of JWST.”\n\nOne feature of interest in the deep field has been nicknamed the Sparkler galaxy because it appears to be surrounded by red and yellow sparkling dots. The galaxy is located nine billion light-years away.\n\nThe sparkles could either be young clusters where stars were actively forming just three billion years after the Big Bang, or they might be ancient globular clusters of stars from the early days of the galaxy’s formation.\n\nThe surrounding environment of the Sparkler galaxy was analyzed in detail. Mowla, Iyer et al. 2022\n\nThe team analyzed 12 of the sparkles and determined that five of them are among the oldest known globular clusters ever found.\n\n“Looking at the first images from JWST and discovering old globular clusters around distant galaxies was an incredible moment, one that wasn’t possible with previous Hubble Space Telescope imaging,” said Kartheik G. Iyer, co-lead author of the study and Dunlap Fellow at the Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto, in the statement.\n\n“Since we could observe the sparkles across a range of wavelengths, we could model them and better understand their physical properties, like how old they are and how many stars they contain. We hope the knowledge that globular clusters can be observed at such great distances with JWST will spur further science and searches for similar objects.”\n\nWebb’s sensitivity and resolution is shedding light on previously unseen aspects of the universe, like the clusters surrounding the Sparkler galaxy.\n\n“These newly identified clusters were formed close to the first time it was even possible to form stars,” Mowla said. “We are observing the Sparkler as it was nine billion years ago, when the universe was only four-and-a-half billion years old, looking at something that happened a long time ago. Think of it as guessing a person’s age based on their appearance — it’s easy to tell the difference between a 5- and 10-year-old, but hard to tell the difference between a 50- and 55-year-old.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/18/world/webb-telescope-jupiter-images-scn/index.html", "title": "New Webb telescope images show Jupiter in a new light | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope’s first stunning images of the distant universe have been followed up by something a little closer to home.\n\nData collected during the telescope’s commissioning period, before its science operations officially started on July 12, have been released on the Space Telescope Science Institute’s website. The publicly available data is now ready for scientists around the world to study.\n\nThat data includes new images of Jupiter, which were taken while the space observatory’s instruments were still being tested.\n\n“Combined with the deep field images released the other day, these images of Jupiter demonstrate the full grasp of what Webb can observe, from the faintest, most distant observable galaxies to planets in our own cosmic backyard that you can see with the naked eye from your actual backyard,” said Bryan Holler, a scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, in a statement.\n\nHoller helped with the planning for the observations.\n\nWebb is an infrared telescope, so it captures light that is invisible to the human eye. One of Webb’s images of Jupiter shows the giant planet’s telltale atmospheric bands as well as the Great Red Spot.\n\nThis famous feature is a massive storm about twice the size of Earth that has churned for over a century. It looks white in the image due to the processing of the infrared image.\n\nEuropa, one of Jupiter’s moons, is visible to the left of the planet. The shadow of the moon also makes a cameo left of the Great Red Spot.\n\nJupiter, center, and its moon Europa, left, are seen through the Webb telescope's NIRCam instrument. NASA/ESA/CSA/B. Holler/J. Stansberry/STScI\n\n“I couldn’t believe that we saw everything so clearly, and how bright they were,” said Stefanie Milam, Webb’s deputy project scientist for planetary science based at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, in a statement.\n\n“It’s really exciting to think of the capability and opportunity that we have for observing these kinds of objects in our solar system.”\n\nSome of the telescope’s other perspectives of Jupiter revealed some of the planet’s faint rings. The images prove that Webb is able to observe faint details and objects close to bright planets like Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nThis is especially exciting because it means that Webb may also be able to observe plumes of material releasing into space from ocean worlds in our solar system, like Europa or Saturn’s moon Enceladus.\n\nInteractive: The search for life on Mars and ocean worlds in our solar system\n\n“We’ll look at our own solar system with new infrared eyes, looking for chemical traces of our history, and tracking down mysteries like Jupiter’s Great Red Spot, composition of the ocean under the ice of Europa, and the atmosphere of Saturn’s giant moon Titan,” said John Mather, Webb senior project scientist at NASA Goddard, in a statement.\n\nThe first images were anticipated by Mather for 25 years. “What comes next? All the tools are working, better than we hoped and promised. Scientific observations, proposed years ago, are being made as we speak,” Mather said.\n\n“We want to know: Where did we come from? What happened after the big bang to make galaxies and stars and black holes? We have predictions and guesses, but astronomy is an observational science, full of surprises.”", "authors": ["Ashley Strickland"], "publish_date": "2022/07/18"}]}

The meeting was supposed to start four minutes ago, but Oliver Luck isn’t fazed. He pours himself another cup of coffee.\n\nEnough. They begin, one intern short, with the customary who-you-are-and-where-you’re-from pleasantries. Luck listens intently as the NCAA’s newest crop of one-year interns, most of whom are former collegiate athletes, introduce themselves. For Luck it’s like a game of trivia. What does he know about their hometown? Their alma mater? Their alma mater’s conference?\n\nOne reveals he’s from New Orleans. Luck perks up. He has a question.\n\n“Do you know what the word lagniappe means?”\n\nIt's 8:35 on a Monday morning and Oliver Luck is quizzing an intern on New Orleans parlance.\n\n“Something extra?” comes the answer. Luck smiles. He nods. He explains.\n\n“A reporter asked me recently if the driving force behind me coming to Indianapolis was to hang out with my kid,” says the NCAA’s newly-hired vice president of regulatory affairs, whose kid – the Colts starting quarterback when he’s not nursing that sore shoulder – happens to be the most famous athlete in the state. “I said to him, ‘Nah, it’s just sort of lagniappe.’ He said, ‘What?’ I said, ‘You don’t know what lagniappe means? It’s sort of like the extra scoop of ice cream on top of your sundae. It’s like a bonus.’\n\n“Lagniappe,” Luck continues, addressing the whole room. “Great word. Remember that word.”\n\nThe interns hastily scribble in their notebooks. Lagniappe.\n\nAfter the lesson, the 10th intern arrives. They move on. Luck walks them through a CliffNotes account of NCAA history, sprinkling in statements like: “Amateurism is really just an outgrowth of late 19th century Britain.” This causes more scribbling in notebooks.\n\nLuck has been a campus hero, a professional athlete, a candidate for congress; he’s run pro teams in two different sports in two different countries; he’s built stadiums and directed an athletic department. But on this morning Andrew Luck’s dad sounds more like a history professor than anything else.\n\nAt one point he likens the state of his new employer to the Parthenon in Greece.\n\n“The columns have been chipped away,” Luck says. “It’s a time of transition, a time of change. It’s almost like there’s been a gunfight at the Acropolis.”\n\nLuck then refuses to tiptoe around the interns' rocky reality. The NCAA is an organization stuck in a strange duality: College sports are as popular as they’ve ever been in this country, yet the organization that governs them remains about as popular as Bill Belichick in an Indianapolis bar. Legal battles, notably the class action lawsuit filed by former UCLA basketball player Ed O’Bannon, continue to drag on in the courtroom. The war won’t end anytime soon.\n\n“We have more lawyers than you’d know what to do with,” Luck tells the interns.\n\nHis arrival represents headway. By luring Luck to town back in January the NCAA made a splash hire that earned it the rarest of triumphs – positive press. Luck and his Midas touch were coming to Indianapolis. The NCAA had its white knight.\n\nBut Oliver Luck is not here simply because his son plays football down the street – that’s lagniappe, remember. There's work to do. He is a man who’s authored a stunning resume as a sort of meandering maestro of sports business. Need a league built? A franchise run? A stadium deal? Call Oliver Luck. It’s the credo he’s employed since, he says, he retired from the NFL and “became a suit.” Solve one problem, onto the next. Or as a former boss of Luck’s puts it, “Oliver is a guy who always wants more. He always wants the next challenge.”\n\nAnd what challenge out there could be bigger than this one?\n\n\n\nAll Oliver Luck must do now is save the NCAA.\n\n***\n\nLuck is not wrong in his metaphor. The NCAA’s Parthenon – the amateur model upon which the organization was founded in 1906 – is under siege. In recent years, football players from Northwestern attempted to unionize, citing “unjust NCAA rules.” The O’Bannon suit, first filed six years ago, is still under appeal and could land in the Supreme Court. Athletes want to be paid, they want health benefits, and they want to own rights to their own image and likeness. While the lawsuits are flying, the profits are staggering – the NCAA’s crown jewel, the men’s basketball tournament, raked in a cool $7.5 billion in advertising revenue over the last decade.\n\nStuck squarely in the middle of it: NCAA President Mark Emmert. The ideal he relentlessly defends, the one his organization is fighting for in the courts – the student-athlete ideal – feels more archaic with each passing season, each new billion-dollar television contract.\n\nMake no mistake: Their myth has been tarnished.\n\nAnd that’s where Luck comes in. If there’s one student-athlete story the NCAA wants told, it’s Oliver Luck’s.\n\n***\n\nThis is a man who emails friends and colleagues articles from “The Economist” about why the German language “is hip again.” He spends his summer evenings biking down the Monon Trail. He swipes books from his son’s Downtown condo. “Sometimes you’re like, ‘Where did that one go?’” Andrew says, laughing. “Then you realize…”\n\nThe book on Oliver Luck’s bedside table at the moment is called: “Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944-1956.” It traces how Joseph Stalin’s Soviet machine spread its Communist muscle in countries like Poland, Hungary and East Germany after World War II.\n\n“Fascinating,” Luck calls it.\n\nHe was the brainy high school quarterback from Cleveland who turned down Harvard and Yale to see if he could make it at a big-time college football program; he left West Virginia a school icon after pulling the Mountaineers to their first victory in a bowl game in six years. He was a Rhodes Scholar finalist, a second-round draft pick of the Houston Oilers in 1982, a backup quarterback who stuck around the NFL for four seasons, mainly so he could qualify for the league pension.\n\nProfessional football was never the endgame for Oliver Luck. By his second season with the Oilers he was studying law at night and in the summers “simply because I was wasting time,” Luck says, as if it’s normal for an NFL quarterback to double as a law student. Soon he was the team’s unofficial clubhouse lawyer. Teammates would grab a seat next to him on flights and beg for legal advice.\n\nHe finished his law degree at the University of Texas, where he met his wife, Kathy. They moved to Germany for a yearlong fellowship for young lawyers, then returned and landed in Washington D.C., where their first son, Andrew, was born. Luck was working in the private sector, not three years after he retired from the NFL, when he took the next logical step: He ran for Congress. And he nearly won. A Republican candidate, Luck scored 44 percent of the vote in West Virginia’s second congressional district, but still fell to a four-time incumbent.\n\n“Thoroughly enjoyed it,” Luck says now.\n\nMere days after the election, the phone rang out of the blue – a common thread in Luck’s winding, serendipitous career. He traces his odyssey with a surprising sense of humility: He works, quietly and efficiently, refusing to rest on past triumphs or envision future stops. The opportunities simply arise, one after another, like dream jobs falling from the sky. All the while he keeps plugging along, fixed only on the challenge before him. That's Luck: Outwardly calm, innately driven.\n\nThat phone call was from the World League of American football, wanting to know if Luck would move to Frankfurt, Germany, to start a pro football team. Other than his German-born mother and his year overseas, Luck had no real qualifications, no background in business. He said sure.\n\nSo they packed up, 1-year-old Andrew in tow, figuring they’d stay a year or two. It ended up being 10. “Worked my way up the proverbial food chain to become president of NFL Europe,” Luck says, nonchalantly. They returned to the states in 2000 – by then Andrew had two younger sisters and a younger brother – and settled in Houston. Luck worked as the CEO of the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority, and by the time he left, his team had delivered the city three sparkling new sports venues: Minute Maid Park, Reliant Stadium (now NRG Stadium) and the Toyota Center. In between Luck landed the city a pro soccer team, became its president and general manager and watched the Houston Dynamo win MLS titles in each of its first two years of existence.\n\nSolve one problem, onto the next.\n\n“If you were moving a franchise to a new city, you couldn’t hire a better person than Oliver,” says J. Kent Friedman, Chairman of the Board of the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority. “He has a unique ability to walk into a room full of strangers and walk out with a bunch of new friends.”\n\nThen, in 2010, the phone rang again. It was Luck’s alma mater, West Virginia, in need of an athletic director. He went home.\n\n“A rock star,” Luck’s former boss and WVU president, Jim Clements, calls him. “When I was looking for candidates, he checked every box and five boxes I didn’t even think of.”\n\nBack in Morgantown Luck pulled the Mountaineers out of the sinking, football-less Big East and into the booming Big 12. He secured financing for a new $25 million baseball facility.\n\nLast winter it was the NCAA that called. Emmert stressed the significance of the next handful of years for the organization, arguing it would forever shape the amateur athletic model in this country. Luck thought about it. He agreed. He took the job.\n\nEmmert wanted Luck’s services so badly he created a new position for him on his senior staff. The fancy title: vice president of regulatory affairs. Luck simplifies it as such: “It’s where the sausage gets made.”\n\nHe’s not Emmert’s No. 2 any more than he’s the NCAA’s president-in-waiting. He’s part of a seven-member senior executive team that reports to Emmert. Luck’s department deals directly with the membership – some 1,110 schools across three divisions that support some 460,000 student-athletes.\n\nSolve one problem, onto the next.\n\n***\n\nIn Luck the NCAA earns a fresh set of eyes. In the past he was one of its many critics – “More Byzantine than the Byzantine Empire,” Luck said of the NCAA in a 2013 speech. He just happens to be the first of those critics they’ve gone out and hired.\n\nHe arrived in January and shortly thereafter made headlines. At a convention in Maryland, Luck shared an opinion that directly contradicts what the NCAA is defending in the O’Bannon suit. “I do believe that the name, image, likeness for an individual is a fundamental right,” he said.\n\nMonths later Luck, new job or not, holds firm in his stance.\n\n“This is not the NCAA speaking, it’s just me,” he cautions, “but I believe there’s a fundamental right that an individual has, not just as a student-athlete, to his image and likeness.”\n\nHe bases this, he says, “on watching college athletics the last 40 years, knowing what I went through, what my kids went through.” In addition to Andrew, a two-time All-American at Stanford, Luck has a daughter, Mary Ellen, who played volleyball at Stanford; his youngest son, Addison, will play soccer at Yale beginning next fall.\n\nThat’s not to say he’s not onboard. He believes in the NCAA, its ideals and its foundation, whether the Parthenon has been chipped or not.\n\n“We believe college athletics has a high value and we want to make sure all the schools are put in a position where they can run these teams, hire these coaches and prove all those values,” he says. “There has to be a system in place to do that.”\n\nAll the while the definition of amateurism is changing. Luck knows it. In June the NCAA announced it would distribute $18.9 million to Division 1 schools primarily to cover cost-of-attendance-based scholarships, the idea being star football or basketball players will no longer be forced to scrape for a sandwich when they’re hungry. “We’ve redefined, effectively, the scholarship and what it means,” Luck says. “No more is it just room, board, tuition and fees.”\n\nThis is where Luck’s department comes in. A liaison between the NCAA and the schools, his job is to give the athletic departments whatever they require. Implementing these redefined scholarships is not a simple task. “Things can get a little messy on campus,” Luck says. “It’s not all that clean.”\n\nThus he’s been busy. Shortly after taking the job Luck reached out to iconic shoe marketer Sonny Vaccarro, a longtime critic of the NCAA who has been instrumental in the O’Bannon lawsuit. Luck wanted to pick his brain. Last month, in a speech to athletic directors, Luck made it clear that any student-athlete caught betting on college sports – namely on fantasy sites FanDuel and Draft Kings – would immediately forfeit a year of eligibility.\n\nHe’s working the way he always does – quietly, efficiently, below the surface – to put his stamp on the NCAA.\n\n“What annoys me?” he says. “People that aren’t willing to look at change or look at improvement. This happens in groups fairly often. People say, ‘Well, this is the way we’ve always done it.’ It’s not to say that was bad at all. But a responsible adult should be able to say, ‘Let’s just think about what it could be like if we do X, Y or Z.”\n\nHe knows implementing X, Y or Z inside the stubborn walls of the NCAA won’t be easy. But neither was running a pro football team in Europe. Or getting three stadiums built in Houston. Or saving West Virginia’s athletic department.\n\nWhat if Luck’s Midas touch isn’t enough? What if the lawsuits pile up, the courts rule against the NCAA and the amateur model on which they’ve constructed their billion-dollar enterprise starts to crack?\n\nWhat if it fails?\n\nHe smiles. Oliver Luck doesn’t know failure.\n\n“Not an option,” he says.\n\n***\n\nAnd then there’s lagniappe.\n\nFor the first time since Andrew’s senior year of high school, he and his father live in the same city. They bike together down the Monon and discuss what books they’re reading. Football? It hardly ever comes up.\n\n“My theory is he gets enough of that at work,” says Oliver, likely the first former NFL quarterback to ever to say that about his star quarterback son.\n\nThey started out like any father and son, tossing the football in the backyard. Except their backyard was in Frankfurt, then London. Oliver never pushed Andrew into football – his first love was soccer – but when they returned to the states and Andrew told him he wanted to give the Pop Warner youth league a try, dad said sure. He’d even coach the team.\n\nOne of his first moves? Putting his son at defensive end.\n\n“I think he treated me a little harsher (than the rest of the kids),” Andrew says now. “Which is probably normal for a dad to do.”\n\nBut as soon as Andrew joined the school’s football team, dad backed off. Hard as it was, he watched from the stands, not the sideline. On car rides home from games, he’d bite his lip.\n\n“He never wanted to muddy that line,” Andrew says. “It can be tough on a kid if you do that. I appreciate that now.”\n\nEven without dad’s advice, Andrew became a prodigy, a Heisman Trophy finalist, the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft and the quarterback tasked with replacing Peyton Manning in Indianapolis. He wasn’t all that surprised when his dad decided to tackle his new post at the NCAA.\n\n“He’s curious. He enjoys problems and enjoys solving them. I’d like to think, with his background he can bring a perspective that’s maybe a little different than your typical amateur administrator.”\n\nThat perspective – that’s what the interns are after. The Monday morning meeting is winding down. The brainy quarterback from Cleveland who has traveled the globe, built stadiums and leagues and franchises, is asked for career advice.\n\nWhat’s the secret?\n\nLuck pauses. He thinks for a moment, about all those phone calls, about his winding road, about his new challenge at the NCAA. Then he shares one of his favorite metaphors.\n\n“Act like a duck,” he tells them. “Be calm on the surface, but paddle like hell underneath.\n\n“It’s a great way to picture it, isn’t it?”\n\nThe interns nod. Then they start scribbling in their notebooks.\n\nCall Star reporter Zak Keefer at (317) 444-6134 and follow him on Twitter: @zkeefer.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2022/01/13/ohio-state-football-add-cincinnatis-perry-eliano-safeties-coach/6510313001/", "title": "Ohio State football to add Cincinnati coach Perry Eliano", "text": "Ohio State’s coaching staff changes were continuing on Thursday on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nThe program is set to bring in Perry Eliano as safeties coach and Tim Walton as cornerbacks coach, joining newly arrived coordinator Jim Knowles, people familiar with their hirings confirmed to The Dispatch.\n\nLinebackers coach Al Washington and defensive coordinator Kerry Coombs will not be retained in order to create the openings.\n\nThe school has yet to announce the moves.\n\nNFL Draft:Tracking 2022 NFL draft decisions from Ohio State football underclassmen\n\nRyan Day:If the NFL comes calling, would Ryan Day consider leaving Ohio State football?\n\nEliano, 43, has been the cornerbacks coach at Cincinnati for the past two seasons, where he was credited with shaping the development of decorated cornerbacks Coby Bryant and Ahmad \"Sauce\" Gardner, both of whom were critical last fall in helping the Bearcats to become the first team from a Group of Five conference to reach the College Football Playoff.\n\nBryant was the recipient of the Jim Thorpe Award as the nation’s top defensive back, while Gardner was a consensus All-American.\n\nCincinnati finished second nationally in pass defense, giving up an average of 169 yards per game.\n\nEliano, a native of Killeen, Texas, also spent a pair of seasons as the defensive coordinator at Bowling Green in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe 50-year-old Walton has been an assistant in the NFL for the last decade, most recently as the cornerbacks coach for the Jacksonville Jaguars. He also was a cornerback for the Buckeyes from 1990-93, bringing him back to his alma mater.\n\nFormer Ohio State defensive coordinator Chris Ash, who was on the Jaguars' staff with Walton this past fall, gave him plenty of praise.\n\n\"He’s great with the players,\" Ash said. \"Lots of energy and a very good motivator. Very good teacher. Lots of NFL experience. Always talked about the Buckeyes and how much he loved his experience there.\"\n\nDespite being at the NCAA limit of 10 on-field assistant coaches before Thursday’s moves, the Buckeyes had been looking to add at least one position coach for their secondary.\n\nIn addition to calling plays for the defense on an interim basis for most of last season, Matt Barnes had coached the defensive backs. But Barnes left in the aftermath of the Rose Bowl to become the defensive coordinator at Memphis.\n\nHis departure allowed for Knowles to come aboard on Jan. 2, but it still left them without a secondary coach.\n\nIn his first stint on staff under former coach Urban Meyer from 2012-17, Coombs had remarkable success as a cornerbacks coach, recruiting and developing seven first-round NFL draft picks before leaving for the league himself to coach under Mike Vrabel with the Tennessee Titans.\n\nHe returned to Ohio State as an assistant in 2020, replacing former defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley, who left to become the coach at Boston College, but Coombs was no longer coaching defensive backs in order to focus on his coordinator role.\n\nCoombs was stripped of his defensive play-calling responsibilities after a 35-28 loss to Oregon in Week 2.\n\nDuring a mid-season press conference, he acknowledged how difficult the demotion had been, but he pledged to not let it affect his attitude.\n\nHis players took notice.\n\n\"I just want to give a big shout-out to coach Coombs,\" freshman defensive end Jack Sawyer said before the Rose Bowl. \"Obviously, the position he was in wasn't easy, getting all that hate on social media and getting demoted mid-season. It wasn't easy for him.\n\n\"He showed us what it was to be a leader and what it is to be a true man in this business, the way he came back to work the next day. You never saw him down, always in a positive mindset, checking how we're doing, and then just busting his ass as hard as he could to coach us. When we saw that, it kind of motivated us because I don't think people really realize how hard a position that was for him.\"\n\nWashington had been an assistant with the Buckeyes for three seasons, joining Ryan Day’s inaugural staff in 2019 as a linebackers coach.\n\nHe made the rare move to go from Michigan to Ohio State, but it was an opportunity for him to return to his native Columbus, where he graduated from Bishop Watterson High School, and his father, Al Washington Sr., had been a linebacker for the Buckeyes.\n\nLast offseason, Washington turned down an offer to be the defensive coordinator at Tennessee, a lucrative role that included a seven-figure salary, to remain at Ohio State.\n\nWith his departure, it’s possible that Knowles will coach the linebackers in addition to his coordinator duties.\n\nHe was not responsible for a position group as the defensive coordinator for four seasons at Oklahoma State, but he was the linebackers coach in addition to being the coordinator at Duke in his previous stint.\n\nThe Buckeyes have also made previously announced changes on the offensive side of the ball with Justin Frye being tapped as the offensive line coach to replace Greg Studrawa and wide receivers coach Brian Hartline being promoted to passing game coordinator.\n\nBut the defense was the most pressing issue for the team to address entering 2022.\n\nWhile they had been the highest-scoring team in the nation last season, they gave up points in bunches.\n\nIn the final two games, they surrendered a combined 87 points to Michigan and Utah. it was only the second time in program history and the first time since 1891 that they had allowed 40 or more points in consecutive games.\n\nGet more Ohio State football news by listening to our podcasts", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2016/03/30/swartz-hired-coach-rebel-football/82436288/", "title": "Swartz hired to coach Rebel football", "text": "Mark Hicks\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK – Tennessee\n\nDOVER, Tenn. — The man known as “Mr. Rebel,” Chanz Swartz, has been named head football coach of the Stewart County High School Rebels.\n\nSwartz, whose jersey number from his playing days at SCHS was retired last fall, was hired for the job on Wednesday, said Stewart County School System Athletic Director Steve Nolen.\n\n“He was an assistant coach for the high school, and he was the head coach of our middle school team,” Nolen said. “I think he’ll do a good job for us.”\n\nSwartz takes over for Cody Finley who announced on March 25 that he would not return next year as the Rebels' head football next year.

Ross' gift pledges to the University of Michigan\n\n•​​​​​​​ Key dates in Stephen Ross donation to University of Michigan\n\n“I think this transaction was grossly abusive, and the court decided that in imposing the highest non-criminal penalty that can be imposed on a taxpayer,” said Brian Galle, law professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nAlso read:\n\nGilbert, Ross each donate $5 million to Wayne State Law\n\nIlitches' Wayne State gift comes with strings\n\nA review of thousands of pages of depositions, court filings and trial testimony from the Ross case sheds new light on how high-profile donors try to turn charitable contributions into massive write-offs. It also raises questions about the steps taken by University of Michigan officials to convert gifts from the New York real estate developer into cash.\n\nTax law experts expressed shock at the large difference between how much Ross and his partners paid for the gift and the inflated value claimed in the return by Ross and his partnership only months later.\n\n\"It's very, very rare that something is going to grow tenfold in less than a year,\" said Miranda Perry Fleischer, professor of law at the University of San Diego and expert in tax policy and charitable giving. \"They were trying to play games\" with valuing the gift.\n\nThe gift in question is a small fraction of giving by Ross, who stands among the nation's most generous supporters of higher education. With a total of $328 million pledged to the University of Michigan, he remains the largest alumni benefactor in the institution's history. His name stretches across the Ann Arbor campus, from its business school to its athletic facilities.\n\nU-M also received the money Ross promised 15 years ago at the heart of the tax case. The gift came from Ross, who also owns the Miami Dolphins professional football team, and his partners. It helped pay for the Stephen M. Ross Academic Center for student-athletes.\n\nBut in the tax case, the IRS and federal tax judge found that Ross and his partners failed to back up their claimed deduction based on the U-M gift with credible information about its fair market value.\n\n“I don’t understand why someone is not going to jail,” University of Florida professor Steven J. Willis, who has authored books on charities and tax law, said of those involved with the tax filing.\n\nTwo key figures in structuring his gift and its resale by U-M were Ross' former accountant and an outside lawyer brought in to complete the deal.\n\nIn an unrelated criminal case, federal prosecutors later charged Ronald Katz, Ross’ former tax accountant, and Harold Levine, a lawyer who helped engineer the U-M donation, with fraud for a series of deals not connected to Ross. In June of this year, both men pleaded guilty to felony obstruction and tax evasion.\n\nRoss \"was surprised and extremely disappointed by the actions of the two individuals, who have pled guilty, and has severed all dealings with them,\" Ross' spokeswoman said in a statement.\n\nAs for the tax case, Ross is likely to appeal the judge's ruling, Ross spokeswoman Joanna Rose said.\n\nThe outcome of the case has not affected Ross' pledges, she said. \"Mr. Ross is pleased to have fulfilled on all of his obligations\" to the University of Michigan, Rose added in a statement.\n\nIn his ruling last month, the tax judge didn't directly address the role of U-M officials. But according to the IRS, the University of Michigan also failed to follow some of its own policies and procedures in accepting and reselling the non-cash gift in Ross’ name.\n\nCritics say those were warning signs that the deal was problematic, and U-M officials may have succumbed to pressure from a wealthy donor.\n\nIn response to questions from the Detroit Free Press, U-M officials said the acceptance of the Ross gift and its resale by the university was thoroughly reviewed by lawyers and tax experts.\n\n\"The university does, on occasion, accept gifts of tangible property, real estate and, in this case, non-marketable financial interests,\" university spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said in a statement. “When such gifts are accepted, the university works to liquidate those assets as soon as appropriate.”\n\nThe U.S. Tax Court did not find fault with the university's handling of the Ross donation, Fitzgerald added.\n\nOthers, however, see evidence of a broader problem.\n\n“This is one of a few instances we’ve seen recently where major universities are seemingly willing to look the other way when a major donor is clearly playing a little fast and loose with the charitable tax deduction,” said Galle, who had served as a tax enforcement attorney at the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nMost alumni gifts to U-M are cash. But this gift from Ross was a piece of southern California real estate that housed a data center. The property stake was donated to the university and resold for nearly $2 million for cash to help Ross fulfill his pledge, which eventually grew to $5 million — and enable him to take a tax deduction.\n\nAs part of their probe, IRS officials also found that the University of Michigan:\n\nAgreed to accept Ross' gift of a stake in the California property without first obtaining an appraisal of its value, contrary to university practice.\n\nAcceded to Ross' request for an unusual two-year hold on reselling the gift, even though university policy calls for disposing of non-cash gifts promptly.\n\nAccepted an offer for reselling the property stake from a mysterious buyer — who it turned out was the same lawyer and accountant who represented Ross and his partners in the original donation.\n\nwho represented Ross and his partners in the original donation. Resold the property stake for less than one-third the appraised value, contrary to university policy calling for sales of public property to be for fair market value.\n\nPublic institutions have an obligation to try to sell their non-cash gifts for a fair market value and refrain from giving “insiders” any economic advantage, according to legal experts.\n\nGalle said U-M officials may have improperly allowed a suspicious donation to the university's athletic department and served as a kind of pass-through to raise funds needed for a construction project.\n\n“Michigan walked away with $1.94 million ... for allowing someone else” to try to take millions out of the U.S. Treasury,” he said. “Well-run charities shouldn’t do that.”\n\nNETTING A ‘BIG FISH’\n\nThere are few graduates better-known by top U-M officials than 77-year-old Stephen M. Ross.\n\nThe Detroit native graduated with a business degree in 1962 and practiced tax law early in his career. Then in 1972, Ross founded Related, the real estate empire behind New York City’s Time Warner Center and the under-construction Hudson Yards, billed as the largest private real estate development in the history of the U.S.\n\n“After all, Steve Ross gave the university another hundred million dollars for the business school, so he was a big fish,” former U-M athletic director Bill Martin said in a deposition for the tax case.\n\nIn 2013, Ross walked into his namesake business school to announce a $200-million donation as the university marching band played “Hail to the Victors,” Michigan’s fight song. A throng of students inside wore maize and blue T-shirts proclaiming “WELCOME HOME.”\n\n\"This is a great day for the University of Michigan,\" then U-M President Mary Sue Coleman said at the campus rally. \"We are celebrating a historic $200-million gift from a remarkable leader and alumnus, Stephen Ross.\"\n\nHis total gifts also made Ross the second-largest donor as an individual to any college or university in the country at the time, only behind former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nAccording to Forbes’ latest list of the world’s wealthiest people, Ross is now worth $7.4 billion. In 2013, Ross signed on to the Giving Pledge, a public commitment created by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and famed investor Warren Buffett for the nation's richest people willing to give more than half of their wealth away.\n\nMost people, Ross told the Free Press in an interview last fall, “want to leave the world a better place. ... I think there is a social responsibility in giving back.”\n\nHUNTING FOR TAX BREAK\n\nIn the early 2000s, Katz, Ross’ accountant, first told him about a new partnership called RERI, according to trial testimony.\n\nRERI was a limited liability company only in existence from 2002-04. It would have no assets other than property stakes known as remainder interests, including the Hawthorne, Calif., industrial property leased to AT&T.\n\nRoss said he and Katz did work together for at least three decades.\n\n“He would bring me deals from time to time and ask me if I would be interested in them,” he testified at the June 2015 tax trial.\n\nSeeking a deal with tax advantages wasn’t unusual for Ross.\n\n“In real estate, there’s a lot of tax benefits so that the tax benefits that the real estate throws oftentimes are lucrative,” he said.\n\nCourt documents filed by the IRS describe Ross as “RERI’s largest member.” Despite that, Ross said in his trial testimony he didn’t concern himself with the technical details of the deal, which he described as outside his normal business of developing real estate projects.\n\n“Once I agreed to do the deal, he showed me and described the transaction, he followed through and handled all the arrangements,” Ross said of Katz.\n\nOther Related executives said they joined RERI knowing about the potential tax benefits.\n\nTwo of them said in a separate civil lawsuit that Katz described the deal as a complex transaction that involved forming a limited liability corporation that would buy “remainder interest” in properties and then donate it to a nonprofit. Each investor would be allowed to take a tax write-off substantially higher than the donation, according to the lawsuit.\n\nExperts say that a remainder interest can be relatively common for wealthy donors who want to gift their home to a charity, but allow a surviving spouse to remain in the house until they die. The charity's stake in the property is known as a remainder interest.\n\n“It was brought to my attention it would be a good time to give a gift based on the fact that there would be a sizable deduction and that it would be (to) the University of Michigan,” Ross said at the tax trial.\n\nFederal court records show Ross and his partners, through RERI, paid $2.95 million in 2002 for the so-called remainder interest in the Hawthorne property outside Los Angeles.\n\nWitnesses at trial said RERI’s donation of this kind of remainder interest was unusual, if not unprecedented.\n\nRoss said he called his friend Bill Martin, a successful real estate company owner who ran the university's athletics department, shortly after RERI bought the property stake in 2002 to see whether U-M would accept the gift of a remainder interest.\n\n“He indicated he would. I told that to Katz. And they then took it from there, and that was about the end of my involvement,” Ross said at trial.\n\nQUESTIONING TAX WRITE-OFF\n\nThe federal government relies on voluntary information submitted by taxpayers to account for the real value of their donations when assessing their bill to Uncle Sam. Legal loopholes and tax shelters can substantially lower a rich person's tax bill.\n\nStill, Ross said he initially had concerns about the size of the tax benefits he sought.\n\n“They were quite large,\" he said in trial testimony, recalling his discussions with Katz. \"And I wanted to know, you know, if it was really something that was real. And he brought in Harold Levine who explained to me the transaction and satisfied me.\"\n\nRoss said he had no role in the university’s resale of the property stake more than two years later, in December 2005.\n\n“I was hoping it would be held longer and it would satisfy the agreement — the pledge,” Ross said of his commitment to pay for half of U-M's Stephen M. Ross Academic Center. (Ross boosted his pledge for the center to $5 million from $4 million in September 2004 after the university changed its plans for the building, which opened in 2006.)\n\nBelieving it could claim a substantial tax deduction, the 30-member RERI partnership donated the entire stake in 2003 to help fulfill Ross’ $5-million pledge for the academic center. The university later sold the stake for $1.94 million and credited Ross' pledge, records show.\n\nRoss' personal tax write-off for his $500,000 investment in RERI was $5.4 million. (His company’s president at the time, U-M alumnus and donor Jeff Blau, testified he received a $3.8-million deduction for his $350,000 investment in RERI).\n\nIRS lawyers wanted to know whether Ross ever questioned the disparity between the investment and the value under the deduction.\n\n“When I gave the gift knowing that the deduction would be such, I asked, you know, you know, how that was possible because I wanted to make sure that what I was doing was proper and legal,” Ross responded. “And I was told by Mr. Levine who showed me that the regulations provided for this and had a table that set forth the valuation of remainder interest.”\n\nDuring the court fight, the IRS argued that RERI’s charitable contribution was \"a sham for tax purposes or lacks economic substance, and therefore the transaction should be disregarded for federal tax purposes and the deduction disallowed in its entirety.\"\n\nKatz and Levine invoked their constitutional right against self-incrimination, declining to testify at the 2015 trial.\n\nStill, in court papers, RERI countered that its members took the write-off because they properly valued the asset and used a government tax table for the remainder interest in the property.\n\nThe RERI donation wasn’t the only time Ross fulfilled part of his pledge to U-M using a stake in real estate.\n\nHe also donated holdings in several Rite Aid pharmacies and a movie theater, which were later resold by U-M. A spokeswoman declined to say how much Ross may have saved on his taxes from these deals.\n\nVALUING GIFT\n\nHow to sell Ross’ unusual gift through RERI was a challenge for university officials. And in the end, U-M only received less than one-third the appraised value in reselling the gift, according to the sales price and the university's own appraisal.\n\nEarly on, some university officials thought the gift might be worth more. Ross described the donated property interest as “worth, best of my recollection, three or three-and-a-half million dollars,” Michael Hilliard, now U-M’s assistant vice president for leadership giving, said in a deposition.\n\nBut when RERI sent the university a form on noncash charitable contributions, the partnership left blank the part asking for a fair market value. So the university logged the gift with a nominal value of only $1.\n\nAs part of the agreement with RERI, university officials also agreed not to sell the stake for at least two years. That meant U-M didn't need to file a government form that would have alerted the IRS to how much RERI originally paid, according to legal experts.\n\n“Is it a common practice of the university to allow donors of non-cash assets to decide the timing of sale?” asked IRS lawyer Travis Vance III.\n\n“It’s uncommon,” Gordon Beeman, then U-M associate general counsel in charge of vetting charitable gifts, answered at his deposition.\n\n(On its own, RERI obtained an appraisal for the stake in September 2003 of $32,935,000, more than 10 times what it paid for the stake the prior year. Then RERI claimed a charitable deduction of nearly the same amount on its tax return.)\n\nIn early 2005, university officials began discussions on selling the stake. Beeman said in his deposition that Martin took a “lead role” in the sale and “he would be consulting with Stephen Ross” in mid-2005.\n\nThere was concern among some at the university that the value of the RERI property had significantly diminished since the date of the gift and the property stake might not be readily convertible into cash.\n\nThat’s when Levine approached U-M about buying the stake for another client.\n\nLevine’s client was a company called HRK Real Estate Holdings. Katz and Levine owned HRK themselves or through family members but university officials said they did not know that, according to court records.\n\nSome university officials said at that time they felt pressured by Ross to sell. Beeman called it a “new risk.\"\n\n“If we didn’t accept the offer we received in December of 2005, which was, I think $1,940,000 for the Hawthorne property, that (Ross) would deem himself relieved of his pledge by that amount,” Beeman said, although he added that he didn’t become aware of that risk until later.\n\nTim Slottow, then the university’s chief financial officer, argued in pre-trial depositions that he didn’t feel pressure from Ross since the university viewed the $5-million gift agreement as binding no matter the sales price of the RERI remainder interest.\n\nBut in a 2005 e-mail just before the sale closed, Slottow acknowledged the influence of a prominent donor on the sale of his gift.\n\n“I am not a (real estate) expert but continue to be comfortable relying on Bill’s (Martin) and Steve’s (Ross) collective advice for timing and price — they now agree and want to sell fast,” Slottow wrote in an e-mail to other university administrators.\n\nBeeman said in his deposition that “we had an interest in maximizing the price. It was university property. We had a fiduciary duty, too, considering all the risks and all the attendant factors in getting the best deal. That would mean getting the cash sooner, not later.”\n\nBy the end of the year, U-M agreed to sell for $1.94 million, the original offer price, to HRK. That was two-thirds less than the appraised value of around $6.5 million, obtained by the university that year before the sale.\n\nDuring one deposition, an IRS attorney asked whether university officials were concerned “that the general public was going to find out that you got a $6-million appraisal and you sold the property for $1.94 million.”\n\n“That was one of the concerns, yes,” Beeman responded. “Remember, the university of Michigan is a public body.”\n\nLOSING IN COURT\n\nUniversity of Michigan officials declined to answer specific questions about the tax court case decided last month against RERI. Instead, its spokesman provided a statement.\n\n\"The university plays no role in establishing or even agreeing to what may be the fair market value claimed by the donor as a charitable contribution on their individual tax return. Rather, that is a decision made by the donor and his or her tax counsel and advisers,” U-M's Fitzgerald said in a statement.\n\nSeton Hall University’s Sarah Waldeck, a law school professor who specializes in charitable giving, sees the university's role as thoughtful despite unusual circumstances.\n\n“In my experience, nonprofits work really hard to stay away from the question of what donors are actually claiming on their taxes,\" Waldeck said. \"I think that the decision not to become tangled up in or involved in what donors’ tax returns looks like a legitimate, practical move by a nonprofit.”\n\nBut others remain critical of the university's actions.\n\n\"The fact that the donor left the donor's valuation blank on the form they gave Michigan was a red flag that should have gotten more attention,\" Galle said, adding that \"the pressure from the donor is not a proper reason for the university to get a bad deal on what is, legally, fully its own property at that point.\"\n\nIn the unrelated criminal case, Katz and Levine are scheduled for sentencing in October and face recommended prison time. Their attorneys did not return e-mails and phone calls seeking comment.\n\nThe criminal investigation connected to Katz and Levine is ongoing, according to a person familiar with the matter. The IRS declined to comment.\n\nIn addition, another civil case looms.\n\nIn June 2014, the federal government sued Levine, alleging he had participated in “at least” 90 different schemes “designed to cheat the government out of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax liability,” according to the complaint. The government accused Levine of making more than $5 million in fees from improper transactions.\n\nThe suit is currently on hold because of criminal proceedings against Levine, court records show. None of the transactions described in the suit appear to be related to RERI.\n\nIn his July tax case ruling, Judge Halpern cut RERI’s allowable deduction completely: from $33 million sought in the partnership's 2003 tax return down to zero.\n\nHe also ruled the partnership was liable for an additional penalty: Forty percent of the overvaluation. The exact amount to be paid will likely depend on the tax bracket and other financial circumstances of the individual partners, legal experts said.\n\nRoss' spokeswoman attributed the adverse ruling to a technical error. RERI failed to fill out a tax form completely by leaving blank the value of the property stake, she said.\n\n“The value of a charitable gift of a remainder interest is governed by\" U.S. tax code, Rose wrote. “In this decision, the charitable deduction was disallowed due to a failure to include an entry on the form, which we continue to believe was done in error.”\n\nBut West Virginia University tax law professor Elaine Wilson said Ross and his partners may have received a harsh ruling from the tax judge because the partnership tried to use a wildly inflated appraisal to justify the $33-million deduction.\n\n\"There's a saying that tax lawyers use, which is: 'Pigs get fed and hogs get slaughtered,'\" Wilson said. \"They went for too much.\"\n\nRead: IRS on U-M’s role in Ross’ gift.\n\nRead: University of Michigan’s response to IRS probe\n\nContact Matthew Dolan: 313-223-4743 ormsdolan@freepress.com.

Phil Bryant, who also hasn't been criminally charged. Text messages cast doubt on the idea that Bryant and Favre were unaware of the illegality involved in some of their maneuvers.\n\nThe scandal centers around federal money from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families fund, distributed as block grants to each of the 50 states. It potentially dates back to 2016, when Human Services executive John Davis began directing multimillion-dollar lump sum payments to the Mississippi Community Education Center, a nonprofit that theoretically would then determine how the TANF money could be used. Davis did not make director Nancy New report how she spent the money.\n\nMore:Brett Favre welfare scandal shows that former QB's image is a fraud, too | Opinion\n\nMore:What we know about Brett Favre and his texts in Mississippi welfare scandal\n\nDavis and New have both been arrested for their involvement in what follows. Favre and his legal representative have denied wrongdoing.\n\nMost of this timeline relies on reporting from Anna Wolfe of Mississippi Today and the outlet's special report \"The Backchannel.\"\n\nJuly 2017: Favre first meets with officials about funding volleyball facility for Southern Mississippi\n\nBrett Favre, interested in helping to fund a new volleyball facility for his alma mater at the University of Southern Mississippi, first asks for funding from the Mississippi Department of Human Services during a meeting on campus. Favre's daughter, Breleigh, ultimately played both indoor and beach volleyball at the school.\n\nAmong those in attendance were members of the USM athletics staff, DHS director John Davis and Nancy New, the executive for nonprofit organization Mississippi Community Education Center.\n\nAugust 2017: Text (unearthed in 2022) suggests Favre knew this could cause bad publicity\n\nFavre sends a text to New asking, \"If you were to pay me is there anyway the media can find out where it came from and how much?\" followed by reassurance from New that those things wouldn't be made public and, a day later, that Gov. Phil Bryant is on board. These messages came to light Sept. 13, 2022.\n\nOctober 2017: Funding for volleyball facility begins using federal dollars\n\nNew commits $5 million to Southern Mississippi Athletic Foundation to rent all athletic facilities in a five-year lease agreement. Because TANF funds weren't permitted to be used for \"brick and mortar\" construction, the parties craft an agreement to satisfy federal law; as part of the deal, the foundation would use the facility (called the \"Wellness Center\") for programs to help needy families. One former employee said the facility was never used for that. The $5 million commitment is the biggest known single expenditure within the misspent $77 million.\n\nNew's MCEC pays the first lump sum of $2.5 million to USM in November, with another $2.5 million to follow in December. Favre was paid under an agreement to advertise for the welfare program $500,000 in 2017 and $600,000 in June of 2018, with that money expected to go toward the volleyball project.\n\nJune 2018: Construction on volleyball facility begins\n\nConstruction begins on the new volleyball facility, known as the \"Wellness Center,\" initially projected as a $6 million project.\n\nNovember 2018: Favre advises biomedical startup executive to reach out to Gov. Bryant\n\nFavre, who become involved with a biomedical startup called Prevacus in 2014, advised the company's founder, Jacob VanLandingham, to reach out to Gov. Bryant via text for support. Favre wrote, \"Don't know if legal or not, but we need to cut him in.\"\n\nLater texts show that Bryant used his political clout to help get the startup off the ground by finding investors and gaining favor with federal regulators and was offered stock upon his departure from the governor position in 2020. Bryant denies ever accepting the stock.\n\nOut of $135 million in federal aid from the TANF program in 2018, Mississippi spent just 5% ($7.3 million) on direct cash assistance to poor families. In the same year, Human Services gave $44 million of those funds to MCEC and another nonprofit.\n\nJanuary 2019: Favre looks for more funding and strikes deal with Nancy New for Prevacus\n\nStill needing more money to finish the volleyball center, Favre reaches out hoping to meet with Davis and Bryant about more funding.\n\nIn a separate meeting with VanLandingham, Favre and New, the parties agree to direct grant funding to Prevacus, toward its development of an anti-concussion treatment. A payment of $750,000 was sent to Prevacus on Jan. 18, though a $1.7 million contract between MCEC and Prevacus wasn't signed until the next day.\n\nJune 2019: John Davis retires as director of Human Services, forced out behind the scenes\n\nDavis, the director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services who directed money to Nancy New, retires early after 28 years with the agency. Behind the scenes, he'd been ousted by Gov. Bryant after a Human Services employee came forward with a tip about suspected fraud. Bryant appointed former FBI Special Agent in Charge, Christopher Freeze, to take Davis' place.\n\nWhen Favre inquires how Davis' departure might impact the volleyball facility, Bryant texts back: “I will handle that… long story but had to make a change. But I will call Nancy and see what it will take.\"\n\nSummer 2019: Volleyball facility still a topic in text messages\n\nA text exchange from Bryant to New: “Just left Brett Favre. Can we help him with his project. We should meet soon to see how I can make sure we keep your projects on course.”\n\nIn August, a text exchange suggests the new volleyball facility could even be named after Bryant. Bryant has denied steering funds illegally to the project.\n\nSeptember 2019: New and MCEC given more money shortly after meeting with Favre\n\nFavre, New, Bryant and Freeze meet to discuss progress on the new volleyball facility again.\n\nTwo days after the meeting, New receives a letter informing her that the welfare agency was increasing her TANF subgrant by $1.1 million, which the letter said was for the purpose of reimbursing payments the nonprofit made to its partners.\n\nNovember 2019: A new governor is elected\n\nTate Reeves is elected the next governor of Mississippi.\n\nBryant was completing his second and final term according to state law.\n\nJanuary 2020: Favre identified as a driving force behind the volleyball venue and Bryant seemingly prepared to invest in Prevacus\n\nAn Associated Press story cites Favre and his Favre4Hope Foundation as the driving force behind funds to build a volleyball center at Southern Miss.\n\nSeparately, now ex-governor Bryant has a text exchange with Jake VanLandingham about his company, Prevacus, and Bryant seems open to benefits from the company.\n\n“Now that you’re unemployed I’d like to give you a company package for all your help,” VanLandingham writes in a Jan. 16, 2020, text. “…We want and need you on our team!!!”\n\n“Sounds good,” responds Bryant, who was getting ready to take over a private-sector lobbying firm. “Where would be the best place to meet. I am now going to get on it hard…”\n\nFebruary 2020: State auditor announces charges of conspiracy\n\nState auditor Shad White announces that former director of human services John Davis and nonprofit officials conspired to embezzle millions of dollars meant for services to poor Mississippians. Davis and colleague Latimer Smith are arrested, as are MCEC employees Nancy New, Zach New and Anne McGrew — the employees who were directing federal money inappropriately — as well as retired pro wrestler Brett DiBiase.\n\n“The funds that were illegally obtained in this case were intended to help the poorest among us,\" White said. \"The funds were instead taken by a group of influential people for their own benefit, and the scheme is massive. It ends today.\"\n\nDavis and Smith are accused of manufacturing documents to funnel money to DiBiase from TANF; the invoices indicated the money compensated DiBiase for teaching classes about drug abuse, but DiBiase was in a luxury rehab facility for his own drug use in Malibu, California, and did not perform the services.\n\nNancy New and son Zach New were further accused of using TANF money to pay for personal investments in medical device companies in Florida.\n\nA report from Mississippi Today reveals that $5 million in cash from the MCEC was used in the construction of the volleyball facility.\n\nBryant, the former governor, cuts ties with Prevacus following the arrests.\n\nFirst half of 2020: Focus on Favre accelerates\n\nIn March, Favre denies that he discussed the volleyball center with Bryant in a text to Mississippi Today.\n\nIn May, anaudit reveals that $1.1 million has been paid to Favre Enterprises for speaking events in which he did not show, and the state ordered him to repay the misappropriated funds. Favre makes an initial payment of $500,000, but the office of auditor Shad White says Favre still owes an additional $600,000. White says there is no indication Favre knew the money he was receiving was meant for helping needy residents and applauded Favre's offer to pay it back.\n\n\"Upon a cursory review of those dates, auditors were able to determine that the individual contracted did not speak nor was he present for those events.\"\n\nFavre denies that he was a no-show at the speaking events.\n\nOctober 2021: Favre repays money to state of Mississippi\n\nFavre repays the state of Mississippi the rest of the money but still owes $228,000 in interest in an as-yet unpaid cost. Favre reiterates on Facebook that he would never take money for no-show appearances.\n\nApril 2022: Zach and Nancy New reach plea agreement, turning over phone records\n\nZach New admits in a plea agreement to defrauding the government when he participated in a scheme to disguise the brick-and-mortar construction of the volleyball facility as a lease.\n\nNancy New pleads guilty to four counts of bribing a public official, two counts of fraud against the government, six counts of wire fraud and racketeering. Zach pled guilty to many of the same charges, and both agreed to cooperate with prosecutors and testify against co-defendants, thus leading to many of the unearthed texts.\n\nMay 2022: Favre sued by Mississippi\n\nFavre is sued by the Mississippi Human Services Department asking for a judgment of $3.2 million against Favre, $1.1 million against Favre Enterprises and more against Prevacus and its founder. The dollar figures include damages and additional awards for legal fees.\n\nJuly 2022: Attorney fired after digging into involvement of USM, Favre and Bryant\n\nBrad Pigott, a U.S. attorney representing the state's welfare agency, files a subpoena against the USM athletic foundation for communication with several key players, including Bryant and Favre.\n\nLess than two weeks later, Pigott is fired from the case.\n\nPigott says he believes his firing was political; Human Services agency head Bob Anderson says Pigott was fired because he didn't consult with the agency before filing the subpoena naming a former governor. Mississippi Today obtained a July 1 email that showed Pigott sent a draft copy of the subpoena to both the attorney general's office and welfare agency's general counsel 10 days before filing.\n\nNew governor Tate Reeves justifies not including USM in the lawsuit as part of his office's \"objective process\" but seems to have inadvertently made the volleyball facility a focal point.\n\nSeptember 2022: Texts unearthed, providing insight into Favre's communication with officials\n\nTexts available in court filings between Nancy New and other players in the case, such as Favre and Bryant, see the light of day. Favre biographer Jeff Pearlman posts to Twitter that he'd ask people to not read his 2016 book \"Gunslinger,\" calling Favre \"a bad guy.\"\n\nOn Sept. 21, reports indicated that John Davis, the former director of human services, would also plead guilty to both state and federal charges.\n\nOn Sept. 23, Good Karma said it was pausing Favre's radio appearances in Milwaukee.\n\nOn Sept. 25, the AP reported that new documents showed Favre also texted Bryant about a new indoor football facility at USM. A report in The Athletic indicates that Favre's own Favre 4 Hope charity (ostensibly for cancer patients and disadvantaged kids) provided more money to USM than to any other charitable partner.\n\nOctober 2022: Favre hires high-profile lawyer\n\nAccording to Axios, Favre hires Eric Herschmann, a top White House lawyer to President Trump. There are still no criminal charges levied against Favre, and Herschmann says he does not believe Favre should be charged.\n\nOn Oct. 11, Favre releases a statement to Fox News Digital claiming he had been \"unjustly smeared by the media\" and reiterated that he didn't know money was being misappropriated from TANF for his requests and that he was never asked to appear at speaking engagements.\n\n\"No one ever told me, and I did not know, that funds designated for welfare recipients were going to the University or me,\" Favre stated. \"I tried to help my alma mater USM, a public Mississippi state university, raise funds for a wellness center. My goal was and always will be to improve the athletic facilities at my university.\"\n\nThe article also quotes Mississippi State Auditor Shad White.\n\n\"Now, whether or not Mr. Favre knew that this money was specifically coming from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, there are no documents out in the public right now that suggest that,\" White said. \"There are no documents that suggest that he knew the precise laws and regulations around TANF funds. But he did know it was government money, and he did know that it was coming from this agency. And of course, that agency is the agency that is responsible for handling programs that are geared toward helping the poor.\"\n\nNovember 2022: Prevacus in the crosshairs\n\nESPN publishes a lengthy report about two concussion drug companies run by Jake VanLandingham, including Prevacus (for which Favre is a major investor). The companies received more than $2.1 million in funds earmarked for Mississippi welfare programs according to a civil lawsuit and exaggerated the known effectiveness of their drugs during fundraising.\n\nOn Nov. 29, Favre filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit against him.\n\nDecember 2022: Lawsuit officially names Favre as it seeks reimbursement for volleyball money\n\nThe Mississippi Department of Human Services revises its demands against Brett Favre in its lawsuit against the quarterback, acknowledging that he paid the $1.1 million for unfulfilled public speeches. But the lawsuit now asks for up to $5 million from Favre and a university sports foundation, the money improperly channeled into the volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi.\n\nText messages between Favre and new governor Tate Reeves are turned over to the Mississippi Free Press through an open records request. They show that Favre asked Reeves in 2020 about state funds to further pay for the volleyball facility; Favre still owed $1.6 million he had pledged once the facility was completed in early 2020.\n\nJanuary 2023: HBO's 'Real Sports' takes a deep dive on Favre\n\nHBO's \"Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel\" spends a segment traveling to Mississippi to examine the Favre saga, including to his hometown of Kiln, where a statue, signage, paint jobs and resident testimonials showcase the love many Mississippians had or still have for Favre.\n\nThe segment featuring reporter David Scott and producer Max Gershberg interviews Shad White, the state auditor, and Christopher Freeze, the man appointed to replace disgraced former HHS director John Davis.\n\n\"This shows that something was wrong, and that you thought that it would be good for the public to not know what was going on here,\" White tells the HBO cameras, specifically referencing the infamous text in which Favre asked Nancy New if there was any way the media could find out about his activity.\n\nCommunity leader Aisha Nyandoro points out Mississippi's poverty rate is at about 20%, highest in the country, and 9 out of 10 families who apply for assistance from TANF are rejected.\n\n\"And it's heartbreaking because I know what it does to someone's self-esteem and self of worth when they are constantly having to prove that they're poor enough to need assistance,\" she said.\n\nFreeze said, \"It seems pretty brazen; you've got to read the room,\" when asked what he thought when Favre again asked for money even after Davis had left the position.\n\n\"To work with the agency in any capacity and work with a nonprofit … I don't see how you don't know that the money is welfare dollars,\" Freeze says.\n\nFavre, who declined an interview request for the story, maintains that he did not know TANF funds were being accessed for his requests and has not been charged with a crime.\n\nFebruary 2023: Favre files defamation suit against Shad White, Pat McAfee and Shannon Sharpe\n\nFavre files a defamation lawsuit against state auditor Shad White as well as sports commentators Pat McAfee and Shannon Sharpe. The latter, of course, is the Hall of Fame brother of Sterling Sharpe, with whom Favre was teammates early in his Packers career.\n\nThe suit against McAfee says he made statements on The Pat McAfee Show, accusing Favre of \"steal(ing) from the poor\" \"(taking) money right out of their pockets\" and \"stealing from poor people in Mississippi.\" Current Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has appeared on McAfee's show numerous times in a weekly capacity.\n\nThe suit also cites comments made by Shannon Sharpe on another TV show, \"Undisputed,\" and says of White, \"By shamelessly and falsely attacking Favre's good name, White has gained national media attention he previously could have only dreamed of, including appearances on television shows on CNN and HBO, a popular ESPN podcast, as well as interviews for print and online media.\"\n\nApril 2023: Favre says he didn't rely on state money for volleyball project and has a list of donors, including Aaron Rodgers\n\nFavre says the state's welfare agency didn't help satisfy his pledge to help build the volleyball center, but many donors did, including his Green Bay Packers successor, Aaron Rodgers.\n\nAn email produced by Favre outlining a number of donors cited $650,000 worth of gifts ostensibly used for the facility. Rodgers, according to the records, donated $10,000 on Oct. 10, 2019, which happens to be the date of Favre's 50th birthday.\n\n“Brett fulfilled his only obligation to USM,\" a Favre spokesman told Mississippi today. \"No funds he received from MCEC went towards the wellness center. Brett both solicited donations and often asked individuals or groups to send money to USM instead of paying him for services he provided.\"\n\nMississippi Today also reports a more concrete link between former Gov.

The night begins with an appetizer reception at 6 p.m., followed by dinner at 7. Tickets are $100 each.\n\n\"This event is always a great night to celebrate Bloomfield's rich athletic history and the successes of today,\" said Jenkins.\n\nWilliams was a legendary track coach at Bloomfield and is fondly remembered as a demanding teacher with high expectations for his mathematics students. A graduate of Northwestern University, he returned to his alma mater in 1962 and stayed there until retiring in 1997.\n\nWilliams was the head cross-country, winter track and spring track coach at BHS for 34 years and was the coach of the 1968 state champion cross-country team, which finished undefeated. Today, he is a dean of New Jersey high school track officials.\n\nMayer is also an institution in coaching at his alma mater. In 2016, he won his 500th career game as the softball coach. He's led the program to numerous Essex County tournament championships, as well as conference and state sectional titles.\n\nMayer is so revered that Lorenzo Sozio, Mount St. Dominic's softball coach who has also won over 500 games, still refers to Bob as \"Mr. Mayer,\" since Sozio grew up in Bloomfield and had the former as a physical education teacher. Mayer has been an educator in the Bloomfield school system for 43 years.\n\nSibilia is being inducted for his tremendous basketball career at BHS. Playing for the great coach George Cella, Sibilia was one of the first players in school history to score 1,000 career points and will join teammates Paul Lape and Todd Tripucka in the Hall.\n\nCastiglia was an accomplished baseball player for the Bengals, but also excelled in football and bowling. His batting averages at BHS were .475, .525 and .405. Castiglia was also an excellent pitcher. After high school, he went on to Arizona State University, then transferred to Eckerd College in Florida. Later, Castiglia was drafted by the Boston Red Sox and eventually made the team's 40-man roster in spring training.\n\nRichards is also being inducted for his success on the baseball diamond and, like Castiglia, lettered in two other sports, soccer and basketball. In his senior year, Richards was a captain for all three sports. Richards attended the University of Notre Dame and was later drafted by the Texas Rangers, where he ascended to the Class AAA level before a knee injury ended his career.\n\nGabay was a tremendous softball player for the Bengals, where her coach was Mayer. Another multi-talented athlete, she also lettered in soccer and basketball. Gabay guided the Bengals to a state sectional championship in softball. She would go on to attend Duke University and earn a degree in economics. She is today a highly successful managing director in the field of mergers and acquisitions.\n\nAll proceeds from the event will benefit The Bloomfield Educational Foundation, a registered 501(c)(3) charity.

Over the last few months, the entertainer has stirred controversy with transphobic comments and jokes that have drawn criticism from civil rights groups and students at the school.\n\nDuring Monday’s dedication ceremony, Chappelle said he decided to decline the honor because he did not want his name to distract from the students’ work at the school. Last year, The Duke Ellington School of the Arts initially postponed the naming of their theater after backlash mounted over Chappelle’s Netflix comedy special, “The Closer.” The set included graphic jokes about transgender women.\n\n“No matter what they say about ‘The Closer,’ it is still (one of the) most watched specials on Netflix,” Chappelle said Monday, according to USA Today. “The more you say I can’t say something, the more urgent it is for me to say it. It has nothing to do with what you are saying I can’t say. It has everything to do with my freedom of artistic expression.”\n\nThe theater will instead be called the Theater for Artistic Freedom and Expression.\n\nDuke Ellington Principal Sandi Logan told the Washington Post the school has had several conversations with students and staff about Chappelle’s inclusion.\n\nChappelle is from Washington, DC and a 1991 graduate of the the prestigious school, which educates a predominantly Black student body and, according to Logan, a significant LGBTQ community.

It's already the deadliest U.S. wildfire for over a century.\n\nThe newly released figure surpassed the toll of the 2018 Camp Fire in northern California, which left 85 dead. A century earlier, the 1918 Cloquet Fire broke out in drought-stricken northern Minnesota and raced through a number of rural communities, destroying thousands of homes and killing hundreds.\n\nAt least two other fires have been burning in Maui, with no fatalities reported thus far: in south Maui’s Kihei area and in the mountainous, inland communities known as Upcountry. A fourth broke out Friday evening in Kaanapali, a coastal community in West Maui north of Lahaina, but crews were able to extinguish it, authorities said.\n\nIn Maui, a desperate search for the missing\n\nFire crews battled blazes still burning Saturday from wildfires that ravaged parts of Maui as teams with cadaver dogs combed through the rubble in an intensifying search for the missing.\n\nFirefighters were making progress, but three main wildfires that ignited Tuesday were still not extinguished: The Lahaina fire was 85% contained, the Pulehu/Kihei fire 80%, and the Upcountry Maui fire 50% as of late Friday.\n\nAnother fire that prompted evacuations in the Kaanapali area of West Maui on Friday evening was 100% contained within a few hours and evacuation orders were canceled, officials said.\n\nAs the sun rose in Kihei on Saturday, the sky was filled with the smell of smoke. On the highway into Lahaina, a historic town decimated by the fires, cars, trucks and buses laden with supplies ignored signs to keep off the median as they tried to bypass the traffic jam ahead of a road blockade.\n\nResidents who were allowed to return to Lahaina on Friday were met with charred remains, demolished homes and businesses and a changed landscape, including the loss of dozens of their neighbors. But police on Saturday were once again restricting access into West Maui, warning people to stay out of the area because of hazards, including toxic particles from smoldering areas.\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green has warned the death toll could climb even higher as the search for the missing continued. Cadaver-sniffing dogs were brought in Friday to assist the search for the dead, Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen Jr. said.\n\nCommunity members gather supplies for Lahaina\n\nEarly Saturday morning, Marina Sanchez, 28, and Dustin Akiona, 31, began loading up their pickup with supplies to make another run into devastated Lahaina Town. There’s a traffic jam leading to a road block on the main road, but they’re hoping to get in “backside.”\n\nThe pair spent hundreds on batteries, flashlights, gas, first aid kits and anything else residents have asked for at Lowe’s and Home Depot.\n\nSanchez said community members have sent her so much money for supplies, she’s asked them to stop. She said money should be going directly to those who have lost their homes and businesses and will need the cash for rent and rebuilding.\n\n“Because our community is so tight, there’s no hesitation,” she said. “I’m really grateful everyone is coming together.”\n\nSanchez and Akiona have been going house to house, trying to meet individual needs. Some of the homes still standing in Lahaina Town have been converted into makeshift donation centers.\n\n“People know they can go there and get what they need and it’s not limited,” she said. “Such a big part of Hawaii is community.”\n\nFirefighters on the front lines are losing their homes\n\nFirefighters and emergency crews trying to battle the fires and keep people safe in shelters were operating on scant resources themselves, the governor said Friday.\n\nGreen said many buildings are so badly damaged in Lahaina and at risk of collapsing that the whole area is a public safety threat. About 30% of the firefighters working this week lost their own homes, Green told Hawaii News Now television.\n\n“They also don’t have cell service or ability to go home,” he said.\n\nSome forms of health care are not available in Lahaina because a clinic and a dialysis center were “incinerated,” Green said.\n\nDeadliest natural disaster in Hawaii in decades\n\nThe toll from the wildfires makes this the deadliest natural disaster in the state in decades, surpassing a 1960 tsunami that killed 61 people. An even deadlier tsunami in 1946, prior to Hawaii's statehood, killed more than 150 on the Big Island, prompting the development of an outdoor siren alarm system.\n\nOverly dry vegetation that acted as fuel, the ongoing drought, strong winds from Hurricane Dora, a high-pressure system and dryness of the atmosphere made for a devastating combination that allowed the flames to spread at a faster pace than firefighters could contain them.\n\nThe warning system was notably silent on Maui before residents were forced to run for their lives Tuesday, survivors and officials said. Instead, alerts on cellphones, televisions and radios went out across the island, but widespread power outages and cell signal loss made it unclear how successful that warning was.\n\n“There was no warning. There was absolutely none. Nobody came around. We didn’t see a fire truck or anybody,” said Lynn Robinson, who lost her home in the fire.\n\n'THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO':As Lahaina burned, he looked for a way out. Then he heard the screams.\n\nA line of abandoned, charred cars paves the path to Lahaina\n\nBlackened, burned cars. Firetrucks abandoned. Boats scorched in the harbor. The path out of Lahaina was a scene of horror in the aftermath of the fires.\n\nAssociated Press reporters saw an eerie traffic jam of charred cars that didn’t escape the inferno as surviving roosters meandered through the ashes.\n\nJesse Kong, resident and owner of a concrete pumping company, described to USA TODAY the horror of fleeing on his bike while seeing others stuck and the highway on fire. One abandoned fire engine still had its lights on. Another was just a smoldering shell.\n\nKong saw people trapped inside a car fully engulfed by flames; they were screaming. A traffic signal had fallen on the vehicle. He couldn’t get close.\n\n\"You can see their flesh burning,” he said. “There was nothing I could do.”\n\n− Ashley Lewis and Jordan Culver, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nOfficials warn of 'toxic' aftermath of fires\n\nIn the wake of wildfires, people returning to inspect the damage of their homes and businesses in Lahaina should be cautious of the \"highly toxic\" burning areas.\n\nThe Hawaii Department of Health said anyone accessing restricted areas should wear a tight-fitting N95 mask, gloves and other protective equipment because inhalation of airborne particles and dust can be a health hazard. The department said people should be careful of ash and ash pits – holes filled with burned ash that can be fallen into and cause burns.\n\n\"Ash and dust (particularly from burned buildings) may contain toxic and cancer-causing chemicals including asbestos, arsenic, and lead,\" the health department said.\n\nWater, too, wasn't safe in some places. An unsafe water advisory was put in place Friday in the Upper Kula and Lahaina areas, where some running water had been restored. People should use only bottled water for drinking, brushing teeth and preparing food, Maui County said.\n\nPeople should limit bathing to quick showers in well-ventilated rooms with lukewarm water, the county said, but Purdue University engineering professor Andrew Whelton told AP even that is not advisable until the water can be tested because there might be \"hazardous waste levels of benzene.\"\n\nResidents returning to Lahaina face devastation, no water or power\n\nResidents finally allowed back to Lahaina, a treasured town with cultural and religious sites that trace their roots back centuries, discovered a scene of ash-ridden devastation.\n\n“It hit so quick, it was incredible,” Lahaina resident Kyle Scharnhorst told the Associated Press as he surveyed the damage to his apartment complex Friday. “It was like a war zone.”\n\nOnly a few items were able to be retrieved from the lot where Summer and Gilles Gerling’s home once stood. They picked up a piggy bank, their daughter’s jade bracelet and watches they gifted each other when they got married. But their wedding rings were lost.\n\n“Safety was the main concern. These are all material things,” Gilles Gerling said.\n\nAnthony Garcia saw dead animals, such as cats and roosters, as he stood under Lahaina’s cherished banyan tree, now charred. As the grim reality sank in, he felt like he had to ground himself and safeguard his mental health.\n\n“If I don’t do something, I’ll go nuts,” said Garcia, who lost everything he owned. “I’m losing my faith in God.”\n\nResidents who could prove they lived in the area or were hotel guests were let back in around noon Friday, according to a county update.\n\nMaui County officials said there would be a daily curfew in place in Lahaina from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., and certain barricaded areas were off-limits to unauthorized people.\n\n\"West Maui remains without power and water, and search crews continue efforts in the Lahaina town area for victims of the brush fire,\" the county said.\n\n'NO PLACE TO LIVE':Why rebuilding Maui won't be easy after deadly fires\n\nHawaii lawmaker: We 'underestimated the lethality' of the fire\n\nDays after officials have said the wildfires sparked and spread so quickly there was little time to give any warning, Rep. Jill Tokuda told CNN on Saturday the state \"underestimated the lethality, the quickness of fire,\" and didn't plan adequately for redundancies in the emergency alert system.\n\nThough alerts went out to people's cellphones, Tokuda said there was no cellphone service in many places as the fire began to whip through Maui.\n\n“It's not like hurricane force winds are unknown to Hawaii, or dry brush, or red flag conditions,\" Tokuda said. \"We did not learn our lesson\" from 2018's Hurricane Lane, which led to brush fires on Maui and Oahu.\n\n\"We have got to make sure that we do better,\" Tokuda said.\n\nHawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez announced Friday a \"comprehensive review\" of decisions and policies related to the fire would be launched.\n\nUpdate on the damage, acres burned\n\nThe fires that tore through parts of Maui left thousands of buildings damaged or destroyed, and the governor said he anticipates recovery costs to run into the billions and rebuilding could take years.\n\nThe Pacific Disaster Center and the Federal Emergency Management Agency late Friday released an update on the devastation caused by the Lahaina fire:\n\n2,207 structures damaged or destroyed\n\n86% of buildings exposed to the fire were classified as residential\n\n2,170 acres burned\n\n51,700 square feet of shelter are estimated to be needed\n\n4,500 people estimated in need of shelter\n\nIt will cost an estimated $5.52 billion to rebuild\n\nHow you can help Maui fire victims\n\nMaj.

But he's fortunate he and his family escaped the inferno alive, having merely lost items that can be replaced − including his home.\n\nAs Saribay fled wildfires raging across the island of Maui late Tuesday, he saw his own home and the home of his grandmother engulfed. Walls of flame \"as tall as the buildings\" and debris turned into dangerous projectiles surrounded him at every turn.\n\n\"Everything is gone, every single one of our family homes,\" Saribay said. “The entire Lahaina Town and the entire subdivision of Lahaina – gone.\"\n\nWind-whipped wildfires scorched the main heart of Maui, reducing homes and businesses in historic Lahaina Town to ashes and forcing people to jump into the ocean to escape the flames and smoke. At least 36 people have died.\n\nThe flames grew much faster than anyone could have imagined. In a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated a town center that traced its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGetting out of the danger zone made for a surreal journey as he tried to find an unclogged escape route amid blistering heat.\n\n\"While driving through the neighborhood, it looked like a war zone,\" Saribay said. \"Houses throughout that neighborhood were already on fire. I’m driving through the thickest black smoke, and I don’t know what’s on the other side or what’s in front of me.\"\n\nWhen he made it out, Saribay felt a pang of emotion seeing Lahaina in his rearview mirror, wondering what would be left to go back to. \"Just praying that a miracle happens,\" he said.\n\n'PROVIDING SHELTER AND COMFORT':Maui wildfires leave wake of devastation in Hawaii. How you can donate or volunteer.\n\n'This fire – it just hit so fast'\n\nHeidi Denecke, owner of the Maui Animal Farm, spent Tuesday night awake in her truck at her farm in Lahaina watching the fires with friends before being evacuated early Wednesday.\n\n\"It was very, very frightening. We all sat together and watched (the fire) because we were concerned about the animals,\" Denecke said. \"You can't sleep during those times.\"\n\nDenecke and her neighbors spent Tuesday evening attaching phone numbers on their horses' backs in case they had to be let loose. Once she was evacuated, Denecke drove six cages of bunnies and guinea pigs to the Hawaii Animal Foundation.\n\n\"I was standing at the top of my driveway and (the fire) was right below us and it was so frightening,\" Denecke said. \"This fire − it just hit so fast, and it devastated a lot of people. We didn't really get a chance to get things set up because it came on so fast.\"\n\nThe animal farm has survived the fire, but the roofing was torn up, Denecke said. She doesn't know the extent of the damage because she has not been allowed back to her farm.\n\nHOW DID THE MAUI FIRES START?What we know about humans making disasters worse\n\n'Everything was burning'\n\nBeatrice Hoopai drove for hours in the middle of the night trying to find shelter before ending up at the Warm Memorial Gymnasium. She, her husband, disabled son and two infants were living at Ka Hale A Ke Ola (KHAKO), which is low-income housing, in Lahaina waiting to be told to evacuate as the fires were approaching. A friend told Hoopai a nearby transformer caught on fire and to leave as soon as possible.\n\n“We packed up what we could and left,” she said. “KHAKO didn’t turn on their evacuation, we didn’t know we were going to be evacuated. Nobody told us nothing.”\n\nThe family got in Hoopai’s car and started driving but kept going around in circles as roads were closed. Branches were catching on fire and tin roofs blew past the car, she said. “You could see black smoke, the flames, everything was falling down,” she said. “If you looked back in the mirror, everything was burning.”\n\nHoopai has lived on Maui for her entire life and just moved to Lahaina in May. “This is the first time I’ve ever seen anything like this.” Tourists, she said, can lose their luggage but still return back to their homes. But local residents lose their homes.\n\nShe’s worried about what’s next now that the shelter is gone but she’s thankful for her family’s safety.\n\n“You can lose everything but you cannot replace a life,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Minnah Arshad, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/11/maui-hawaii-wildfires-sirens/70572170007/", "title": "What went wrong in Maui? As 'cataclysmic' fires grew, many heard ...", "text": "Hawaii State Sen. Angus McKelvey started hearing explosions in Lahaina as he was running errands. Hours later, he said he could see burning embers “raining down from the sky” and several homes on fire as he drove to his brother's house to check on the family pets. A nearby apartment building stood engulfed by large balls of fire, and by the time he returned home, flames were lighting up his condo.\n\nAs the destruction spread, McKelvey never heard emergency sirens or alarms. He didn't see police overseeing evacuations. Like other residents trying to flee the area, he said, he was uncertain about what to do next.\n\nFor the rest of the night Tuesday, McKelvey saw Lahaina, the historic tourist town he was born and raised in, erupt in flames \"like a war zone.\"\n\nMcKelvey is part of a growing chorus of voices questioning what, if anything, went wrong in Maui in fires that have claimed at least 93 lives, destroyed more than 2,200 structures and scorched more than 2,100 acres. Locals are questioning whether residents were given enough notice via sirens or other notifications as the wildfire swept through. There are also questions about whether the area had the resources to help people, including enough firefighters.\n\nAbout 1,000 people were still missing, Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier said.\n\n\"There probably should have been a more aggressive activation at the onset, more preparation,\" McKelvey told USA TODAY. \"We heard about the red flag warning as brush fires were definitely a concern initially, not this cataclysmic totality that overwhelmed the community.\"\n\nFire weather watch was issued two days before wildfires began\n\nThe warning signs came early, McKelvey said. On Aug. 6, the National Weather Service in Honolulu issued a \"fire weather watch\" for the state after fears about Hurricane Dora soaking the area subsided. \"Strong and gusty winds, combined with low humidities ... may lead to critical fire conditions across leeward areas over the coming days,\" the watch said.\n\nThe next day, on Aug. 7, the weather service issued \"a red flag warning\" as dry areas, combined with \"strong and gusty easterly winds\" of 30 to 45 mph with gusts up to 65 mph, were expected. \"Any fires that develop will likely spread rapidly,\" officials warned.\n\nAnd that's exactly what happened early Aug. 8 as catastrophic wildfires swept through Maui's west side fueled by intense winds with gusts as high as 80 mph from Hurricane Dora to the south.\n\nDid warning sirens sound before the fires?\n\nIt's still unclear what steps local officials took to warn residents.\n\n\"I think this was an impossible situation,\" Maui Mayor Richard Bissen said on NBC's \"Today\" show on Friday. \"I can’t comment on whether or not the sirens sounded, but I know the fires came up so quickly and they spread so fast. There were some initially, when there was a smaller fire. Homes were evacuated.\"\n\nHawaii Emergency Management records showed no indication warning sirens were triggered before the fires erupted, officials told The Associated Press on Thursday. Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Adam Weintraub said the department’s records don’t show Maui’s warning sirens were triggered Tuesday when the Lahaina fire began.\n\nInstead, the county used emergency alerts sent to mobile phones, televisions and radio stations, Weintraub said. But power and cellular outages may have limited the alert's reach.\n\nMaui’s ability to fight the fires may also have been hampered by a small staff, said Bobby Lee, president of the Hawaii Firefighters Association. A maximum of 65 firefighters are working at any given time in Maui County, and they are responsible for fighting fires on three islands: Maui, Molokai and Lanai, he said.\n\nThose crews have more than a dozen fire engines and two ladder trucks, but the department does not have any off-road vehicles, he said. That means fire crews can’t attack brush fires thoroughly before they reach roads or populated areas.\n\nBusiness owner J.D. Hessemer told CBS News he evacuated before the fires hit his neighborhood but never heard an emergency alert. \"The winds were just getting out of control. Power lines were down everywhere and we had to reroute,\" Hessemer told \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday. \"We just decided it was not safe to stay around for the day.\"\n\nPeople running out of food, fuel\n\nElizabeth Pickett, co-executive director of the nonprofit Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, told the Honolulu Civil Beat the fire was foreseeable.\n\n\"We keep hearing from certain elected officials and other people being quoted in the media, 'We had no idea, this is unprecedented,'\" Pickett said Thursday. \"But actually, those of us in the wildfire community, meaning our fire agencies, our forestry natural resource management community, we have long been working to increase our risk reduction efforts.\"\n\nMcKelvey said more people should have been told to leave their homes.\n\n\"I think there would’ve been a stronger urge to evacuate with some better planning,\" McKelvey said. \"It's hard.\"\n\nHe said there is \"an urgent and desperate need\" for power lines to be restored. If not, he hopes federal officials will consider bringing in mobile vans or trailers that offer wireless coverage to ravaged areas as shortages of food, water and fuel grow.\n\n\"There are so many questions that need to be answered,\" McKelvey said. \"But right now, there are a lot of people worried to death about their family members and friends who are missing and don't know if they are alive or dead.\"\n\nWildfires can be difficult to predict, disaster expert says\n\nDespite the weather service's official warnings, Karl Kim, executive director for the National Disaster Preparedness Training Center at the University of Hawaii, said Thursday that even he was surprised by the level of devastation and deaths from the fast-spreading wildfires.\n\n\"Even the best of us can be second-guessed by a red flag warning, not considering how that it might affect us directly,\" Kim said.\n\nHawaii has among the largest integrated outdoor all-hazard public safety warning systems in the United States. Despite nearly 400 sirens islandwide to alert residents of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tsunamis, flooding, volcano eruptions and earthquakes, wildfires can be difficult hazards to track, Kim said. He said he doesn't know whether any of those sirens were triggered by the fires.\n\n\"Out of all of the threats, wildfires are the most difficult to predict, unlike hurricanes and volcanos, because we have much better detection alerts and warning systems in place\" for those, Kim said. \"A wildfire can be triggered in many different ways, by strong winds, lightning, people disposing of cigarette butts, and other human causes.\"\n\nHe said the tragedy shows the need to understand the science of wildfires, as well as use technology such as costly mobile sensors that detect gas, smoke and flames, particularly in remote wildfire-prone areas. Questions are being raised on where to place them and how to connect them to the internet or satellite communication systems.\n\nA sensor unit that could be attached to a tree could cost about $250, Kim said. That cost, however, does not include any installation, connection service, maintenance and periodic testing.\n\nKim said the Maui wildfires involved a deadly combination of incredibly strong winds and \"dry fuel,\" including brush, grass, trees and centuries-old wooden structures for houses, buildings and businesses.\n\n\"The wildfire took out main sources of communications as word didn't spread fast enough by phone and other means,\" Kim said. \"And by the time you start smelling the smoke, unfortunately, it may be a little too late. This is a harsh wake-up call.\"\n\n'Plenty of blame to go around'\n\nKim said that while there might have been warnings about possible fire dangers, many people tend to ignore them for various reasons, including longstanding tendencies that they \"won't directly affect me.\"\n\nThose beliefs are not uncommon, said Tricia Wachtendorf, a sociology professor and director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware. She said many residents might have been more focused on a hurricane hitting the island instead of the risk of fire danger.\n\n\"We don't associate these two types of natural hazards, in this case, a hurricane and a wildfire, as being related,\" Wachtendorf said.\n\nThere's a lot to learn going forward in terms of weather patterns, climate change and urbanization, Kim said. He called it \"one of the most unprecedented disasters\" in Hawaii's history.\n\n\"There's plenty of blame to go around, as it would be wrong to focus narrowly on the emergency response systems due to this incredible force of nature,\" Kim said. \"This is a signal for us to do even more work on our preparedness and improving our technology and communications systems. And above, all understanding our own behavior patterns.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/14/maui-wildfires-trauma-mental-health-resources/70586599007/", "title": "As Maui death count grows, many survivors are left traumatized", "text": "LAHAINA, Hawaii − Malia Waring can’t go home.\n\nHer house wasn’t destroyed when the nation’s deadliest wildfire in a century ripped through Maui last week. But her family is gone, and she can’t bear to sit at home thinking about them.\n\nEver since her cousin came to tell her that four members of their family, including her 8-year-old nephew, burned to death in their car while trying to escape the blaze, Waring, 65, has been spending time with friends at Napili Park, which has become one of several crowd-sourced aid depots in the beloved, nearly destroyed area of Lahaina.\n\n“I'm very, very emotional if I talk, I don’t know, I will cry,\" she said Sunday.\n\nWaring is one of many locals grappling with widespread loss. As the death toll continues to climb, officials in Maui have only just begun the complex process of finding and identifying the dead. And as the community works to provide for people's immediate physical needs, mental health professionals are preparing to meet the longer-term needs of a community that has barely had time to comprehend and grieve the loss of their loved ones, homes, businesses and centuries-old cultural sites.\n\nMaui fire victims identified by officials, many still missing\n\nAt least 96 people have been killed by the wildfire but only two have been officially identified using DNA, Maui Police Chief John Pelletier said. Some estimates suggest more than 1,000 people are still missing. Officials have said they don't know the exact number and have encouraged relatives of people still unaccounted for to visit a family assistance center in Kahului to submit DNA samples.\n\nBut as the days drag on, many, including Leslie Hiraga, are beginning to assume the worst. Hiraga said she was volunteering at the busy depot in Napili Park on Saturday when a man came looking for his cousin.\n\n\"And then he starts telling me the name is Toni Molina,\" Hiraga said. \"She was at my wedding. She's a really good friend of mine and by this time I would have heard from her.\"\n\nHiraga said she believes Molina may have perished in a car like Waring's family, and she's trying to find Molina's brother to get a DNA sample. On Sunday, she flagged down residents at the supply depot to get them to fill out a county form that includes a section on missing loved ones.\n\nShe said she and other volunteers turned in about 30 of those forms on Saturday. When asked if she knew of anyone who had been reunited because of the forms, she shook her head no.\n\nCrews with cadaver dogs have covered just 3% of the search area, Pelletier said Saturday.\n\nJoani Morris, 71, is worried about what investigators will find as rumors swirl about horrific scenes in the neighborhoods and the county offers little information.\n\n\"We don't want to blame them,\" said Morris, a volunteer with José Andrés' World Central Kitchen. \"But we deserve to know where our family and friends are.\"\n\nWhat happened in Maui fires, historic Lahaina\n\nLahaina is centuries old and was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii in the early 1800s. The town of about 13,000 people was home to the sacred Moku'ula palace, the center of the kingdom and the burial home to many \"ali'i\" − chiefs.\n\n\"This is hard psychologically because of the loss. We lost the whole culture of the village of Lahaina,\" Morris said. \"Like now my grandchildren won't go to a school that's been here for 50 years, won't dance hula.\"\n\nEileen Domingo saw the destruction in Lahaina for the first time as she drove in to deliver supplies Sunday. As the skeletal remains of burned buildings and ashen cars came into view, she wept.\n\n\"I'm devastated,\" she said through tears. \"This is my hometown.\"\n\nWhen the fires started Domingo, 36, was in Seattle, where she works as a family medicine physician. Her job can be demanding and being on the mainland with little information left her \"so depleted emotionally.\"\n\nSo, she took leave to \"grieve the loss of her community\" and flew to Hawaii on Friday along with boxes of donated goods.\n\nWhen Domingo rolled into Napili Park on Sunday with a community aid convoy, her car was stuffed to the roof with toilet paper, paper towels, sanitizing wipes and coffee filters. By the afternoon, as the group drove through neighborhoods not far from Lahaina's iconic and decimated Front Street, her car was completely empty.\n\nShe said gathering supplies has helped keep her occupied and given her hope during the emotional time. But, she said, as in any disaster \"you're just in survival mode, there's no time to grieve.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of people who haven't really seen the damage in person yet, because they're all on the other side,\" she said. \"I think that's really when it's going to set in.\"\n\nLike Domingo, Paula Ventura, 76, cried when she returned to her home after the fires ripped through. As the flames approached her home, she said she fled uphill with her cats. Her neighbors managed to save the house she has lived in for 52 years.\n\nNow, the house she built is covered in soot and could be without power for months, she said. Her neighbors are gone and she worries some may be dead.\n\n\"You go to sleep crying, you wake up crying. That's what happens,\" she said. \"The smell. The smell. The smell will never leave me ever.\"\n\nShe said cadaver dogs have been searching nearby, but the streets are eerily devoid of the neighborhood noises she'd grown accustomed to.\n\n\"At night, especially, it's so lonely and sad,\" she said. \"But I can't go. I can't leave because my cats are here, so I'll stay in with them.\"\n\nMaui death toll fuels mental health crisis\n\nAs trucks and cars filled with supplies moved in and out of Napili Park, John Oliver, the Maui branch chief of the Community Mental Health Center, arrived flanked by other health officials.\n\nOnce people who have gone through a disaster like this get their basic needs met, they can start to focus more on the trauma of what happened to them, Oliver later said, and the center is working to meet those intermediate and long-term needs. He said the center has coordinated with the American Red Cross and the governor's office to make sure they had volunteers that were doing \"mental health first aid\" and is now branching out into communities to assess their needs.\n\nHe urged residents who are feeling despair or loneliness to reach out and said he hopes most will take refuge away from the most devastated areas.\n\n\"It's such devastation. ... It's hard to comprehend at times,\" he said. \"And so to actually be living inside that, I don't know if it'd be safe and psychologically safe either.\"\n\nOliver said Asian Americans have one of the lowest uses of mental health care services in the country, which can breed stigma and shame, and there are similar challenges for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. He said it's crucial that mental health services are provided in a culturally competent way, noting that the Napili area is home to many Native Hawaiians.\n\n\"For some, it's looking at more kind of cultural practitioners and sort of natural healing and working with a totally different system than what you would say for Western medicine,\" he said.\n\nHe said the center is hiring additional staff and is in the process of piloting the state's first certified community behavioral health clinic, which would allow them to work with children as well as adults.\n\nOliver said much of their support is also focused on first responders. About 30% of the firefighters working this week lost their own homes, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green told Hawaii News Now television.\n\nLike many in the area, Oliver applauded the community's efforts to support one another.\n\n\"Something we do really well together here on the island is that your 'ohana, your family, is your community,\" he said. \"So our community is definitely coming together.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Sandy Hooper, John Bacon andMinnah Arshad, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/14/maui-hawaii-wildfire-live-updates/70586899007/", "title": "Maui fires updates: Governor says death toll could double or triple", "text": "Editor's note: This file is based on the news of the Hawaii wildfires on Monday, Aug. 14. For the latest news and updates on the Maui fire, please see our live updates file for Tuesday, Aug. 15.\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii − The death toll from the Lahaina fire could double or even triple from the current total of 99, according to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, adding to what is already the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century.\n\nIn a recorded interview with “CBS Mornings” that aired Monday, Green indicated the number of fatalities is likely to increase considerably. Green later confirmed 99 deaths at a news conference Monday.\n\n“We are prepared for many tragic stories,” Green told CBS. “They will find 10 to 20 people per day, probably, until they finish. And it’s probably going to take 10 days. It’s impossible to guess, really.”\n\nHis estimate of 10 to 20 bodies found daily over a 10-day stretch would put the death count at around 200 to 300.\n\nIn a video posted on social media late Sunday, Green said more than 2,700 structures were destroyed in Lahaina and an estimated value of $5.6 billion \"has gone away.\" The Lahaina fire was one of multiple blazes that began burning Tuesday on Maui.\n\nGreen said the \"fire hurricane,\" which he said was new in the age of global warming, was the \"ultimate reason\" the death toll has been so high.”\n\nStarting Tuesday, authorities will begin releasing the names of those who died amid the blaze, Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier said at the news conference. Names of people will not be released until their families have been notified.\n\nMaui rescue teams search ruins'full of our loved ones'; Hawaii churches offer prayers for dead, missing: Updates\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾Green said Federal Emergency Management Agency has 416 people working in Hawaii, including Administrator Deanne Criswell. The agency has provided dozens of searchers and 20 dogs to aid the search for human remains in Lahaina, the governor said.\n\n◾The total of missing people in Maui has dwindled from more than 2,000 to about 1,300 as cellphone service has slowly been restored, according to Green.\n\n◾Green said Monday that nearly 2,000 housing units have been secured, including 402 hotel rooms, 1,400 units from Airbnb starting Tuesday, and that 160 residents have opened up their own homes to families in need.\n\n◾The Upcountry/Kula fire that sprawled about 678 acres was 60% contained, Maui officials said in a statement late Sunday. Maui County said the fire destroyed at least 19 homes. The Lahaina fire, estimated to stretch across 2,170 acres, is 85% contained, according to officials.\n\n◾As of Monday, Pelletier said 25% of the area affected by the fire has been searched. He said the aim is to search 85 to 90% of the area by the weekend. Search efforts started with one dog, he said, and there are now 20.\n\n'It's heartbreaking':Without food and fuel, Maui locals lean on neighbors to survive\n\nFire thought to be extinguished likely cause of tragedy, governor says\n\nIn his Sunday night video, Green pointed to a blaze that authorities “deemed to be out” and roared to back to life as the likely source of the inferno that wiped away historic Lahaina, although the cause is still under investigation.\n\n\"It must have not been completely extinguished,\" Green said, adding flames were then fanned by winds of up to 81 mph. “With those kinds of winds and 1,000-degree temperatures, ultimately all the pictures that you will see will be easy to understand.\"\n\nGreen said a comprehensive review will be conducted in the wake of frustrations that sirens and other warnings did not reach or alert residents to the fires. Because the fire was moving so fast, up to a mile a minute, Green said “it’s unlikely that much could have been done except, of course, moving people out before, and that’s what we’ll talk about.”\n\nFEMA seeking housing options for short and long term\n\nAs search crews make their way through what Criswell called “extremely hazardous’’ conditions from the Lahaina fire, the agency is also grappling with finding accommodations for displaced survivors in a state with a longstanding housing shortage that has been exacerbated by the disaster.\n\nIn addition to paying for lodging at specified hotels and motels for a certain amount of time, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is working with Green on a plan to help provide survivors housing options beyond their immediate needs, Criswell said Monday at a news briefing from Hawaii.\n\n“Whether that means longer term we bring in tiny houses or our transitional housing units to help him create the communities that he wants,’’ she said. “We're not taking anything off the table and we're going to be very creative in how we use our authorities to help build these communities and help people find a place to stay for the longer term.’’\n\nCriswell declined to estimate how long the search-and-recovery mission might last, citing the difficulty of an operation that requires for engineers to assess the stability of structures before cadaver-sniffing dogs and crews can go in.\n\n“The dogs can only work so long because of how hot the temperatures are,’’ she said. “There's also hot spots, and so we have fire crews that are helping to cool down the areas so the dogs can go in there. I’d hate to give an exact estimate because we want to make sure that we are precise and methodical and respectful as we go through this.’’\n\nUpcoming rain presents its own hardship\n\nIn Lahaina, where donations are pouring in to help some of those most impacted by the wildfires, volunteers and residents are scrambling to protect their resources and homes before the expected arrival of rain Monday night. Tropical Storm Greg will pass hundreds of miles to the south Thursday and Friday and is expected to have \"no direct impacts in the state,'' according to the National Hurricane Center, but the forecast calls for showers and breezy conditions in west Maui most of the week.Last week, winds gusts caused in part by passing Hurricane Dora helped fuel the flames in Maui. The upcoming rain may help tamp them down but still presents some hardships.Before the fires ignited on Maui, Andrea Fausett, 29, was the creator of a women’s fitness app who organized trail races for women. Now, she’s become the de facto distribution coordinator, responsible for doling out medical supplies, food and anything else that gets flown into the Kapalua West Maui Airport.As a helicopter whirred in the background Sunday, she said her focus has turned to the incoming storm.“So now one of our biggest issues that we're working to solve today before it becomes an issue is how to protect all of our supplies that are sitting out in the open right now,” she said. “And so that's like our next hurdle. I feel like every day it changes.”Father and son Nelson and Wilson Simpliciano worked Sunday to quickly repair their roof, which was damaged by the strong winds last week. The wind already appeared to be picking up, and the elder Simpliciano said he’s worried rain could cause a leak. He wanted to get a tarp down to cover the exposed wood before he leaves the island.“It’s just gonna get worse,” Simpliciano said.\n\nResidents find government efforts lacking, seek to help each other\n\nMaui residents are banding together to help each other through the tragedy, trying to provide food, fuel and other resources to those in the worst-hit areas, including the hundreds of people who lost their homes.\n\nThey're finding the task complicated by law enforcement road closures and slow communication from a government some accuse of failing to adequately warn them about the fires, which has prompted the locals to create their own aid systems to provide shelter and other necessities.\n\n\"Right now, this is not my home,\" said Archie Kalepa, who has been directing dozens of volunteers. \"This is our community's home.\"\n\nThat community has been devastated by the Lahaina fire, and questions linger about why emergency alert systems failed to notify enough people about the wildfire sweeping through and direct them away from danger. There are also questions about whether the area had the resources to help people, including enough firefighters.\n\n\"There probably should have been a more aggressive activation at the onset, more preparation,\" Hawaii state Sen. Angus McKelvey said. \"We heard about the red flag warning as brush fires were definitely a concern initially, not this cataclysmic totality that overwhelmed the community.\"\n\n− N'dea Yancey-Bragg and Terry Collins\n\nSurvivors' lives in turmoil as they mourn dead\n\nMalia Waring's house wasn’t destroyed when the nation’s deadliest wildfire in a century ripped through Maui last week.

Johnson said in a video posted Sunday on Instagram that he is in contact with relief organizations in Maui such as The Hawaii Community Foundation on the best ways to help.\n\n\"I know that, by now, all of you around the world have seen the complete destruction and devastation that has hit our Hawaiian islands – our island of Maui – and I'm completely heartbroken over this and I know all of you are too,\" Johnson said.

The suit, filed by LippSmith LLP and other law firms, claims downed power lines owned by Maui Electric, Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and their parent company, Hawaiian Electric Industries, caused the fire.\n\nThe lawsuit, obtained by USA TODAY, also claims the utility companies \"inexcusably kept their power lines energized during forecasted high fire danger conditions,\" ultimately causing \"loss of life, serious injuries, destruction of hundreds of homes and businesses, displacement of thousands of people, and damage to many of Hawaii’s historic and cultural sites.\"\n\nHawaiian Electric spokesman Jim Kelly stressed in an email that no cause had been determined and that the company will cooperate with authorities investigating the blaze. \"Our immediate focus is on supporting emergency response efforts on Maui and restoring power for our customers and communities as quickly as possible,\" Kelly said.\n\nSome fire hydrants reportedly ran dry as blaze grew\n\nSome firefighters battling to halt the spread of the Lahaina fire found fire hydrants began to run dry, the New York Times reported. As the fire grew, water pressure faded and some hydrants became \"largely useless,\" the Times reported.\n\n“There was just no water in the hydrants,” firefighter Keahi Ho told the Times.\n\nThe Maui Department of Water Supply did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY. John Stufflebean, head of the agency, warned people in Lahaina not to drink water even after boiling it until further notice because hundreds of pipes have been damaged by the wildfires.\n\nFirefighters also struggled with high winds, fueled by Hurricane Dora spinning offshore, that spread the fire quickly and limited aerial assaults on the blaze.\n\nDonations needed after Maui fire\n\nKako‘o Maui Match Donation Fund: Last week the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement helped start the fund and quickly reached its $1.5 million goal. Donations are still being accepted and the council said 100% of proceeds will go toward relief efforts.

Emig and Paskaly, who have lived on Sanibel for the last two years, said they did not expect it to be unrecognizable.\n\n“I can’t believe the destruction,” Emig told CNN through tears as she and her wife looked at the field of debris in front of them. “It’s incomprehensible that a storm, a hurricane, can wipe us all out like this in just a few hours.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly returned to Sanibel Island by boat to check on their home. CNN\n\nThe walk from the shoreline of Sanibel Island to Emig and Paskaly’s home was less than a mile along a windy, sandy road. On the way, the couple saw a familiar bright blue street sign lying mangled in the mud in a pile of twisted gutters, blankets and branches. They also passed a large banyan tree that had many of its branches twisted and snapped, with one large branch lying in front of a neighbor’s garage.\n\nAs they neared their home, Paskaly said with a heavy sigh: “I’m afraid to turn the corner.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly saw this mangled sign on Sanibel Island as the couple returned to check on their home. CNN\n\nSanibel’s reopening to residents came the same day President Joe Biden visited Florida to see Ian’s destruction first-hand. The President, who received an aerial tour of the damage in Fort Myers, was also briefed by Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Florida officials on the response to the storm and recovery efforts.\n\n“Today we have one job and only one job,” Biden said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. “That’s to make sure the people of Florida get everything that they need to fully, thoroughly recover.”\n\nEvery single home on Sanibel Island is damaged in one way or another, and people have lost everything in some cases, Vice Mayor Richard Johnson told CNN’s Pamela Brown Wednesday. Ninety-five percent of homes on Sanibel Island have been visited by urban search and rescue teams, Johnson said, adding that the city is now looking forward to rebuilding, which brings its own concerns.\n\n“We’re absolutely concerned about rebuilding. This could happen again, and it will happen again,” Johnson said. “However, we will be prepared. We will rebuild, and we will rebuild stronger and better than we were before.”\n\nAt least 125 people have been reported killed as a result of the storm – 120 of them in Florida and five in North Carolina. As of Tuesday night, Florida data provided to CNN reflected at least partial information for 72 of the state’s storm victims. Of those 72 deaths, drowning was listed as a “possible” or known “circumstance” in the deaths of 40 people.\n\nMore than 1,000 search and rescue personnel have combed through 79,000 structures across the Sunshine State, DeSantis told reporters Tuesday, with more than 2,300 rescues logged.\n\nSearch and Rescue teams will begin secondary searches of damaged and destroyed homes on Sanibel Island Thursday, according to city manager Dana Souza. Teams will not enter homes unless they have reason to believe that someone needs assistance.\n\nBut it’s still unclear how many people remain missing.\n\nOfficials are compiling a list of those who remain unaccounted for, Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said Monday.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nPeople load supplies Tuesday onto a boat in Matlacha, Florida, to be taken to Sanibel Island. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nStatewide, more than 270,000 customers still have no power Wednesday, according to PowerOutage.us, many of them in hard-hit Lee and Charlotte counties. Many schools also remain shuttered, some hospitals are still struggling to provide care and boil-water notices remain in place in some areas.\n\nHurricane Ian hit the area just before tourist season. Johnson said Sanibel will feel an economic impact.\n\n“Unfortunately, this tourist season will be nonexistent,” Johnson said. “We are not going to be prepared to accept our tourists at this time.”\n\n‘How do you even start with this?’\n\nWhen Emig and Paskaly finally made it to their house on Sanibel, they were in awe of the damage.\n\nTheir “dream home” was still standing, but the lower level was “unlivable.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly's pool was covered with metal and wood debris when they returned for the first time a week after Hurricane Ian hit Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nAs Paskaly walked around the debris that was their front yard, Emig looked over the couple’s pool, now covered with warped metal and trees.\n\n“It’s gonna be a long time before we swim in it, huh?” Emig said, adding they need to be careful of displaced alligators.\n\nThe chaotic scene left Paskaly in a trance. She had only expected parts of their screen enclosure to have fallen, she said, covering her mouth – “How do you ever start with this?”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly look at their displaced mailbox amid the destruction outside of their home one week after Hurricane Ian pummeled Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nIn their garage, the couple found an item on top of a shelf filled with water, leading them to believe the surge reached at least 5 feet. The floor was slippery from being covered in sludge. Their Mini Cooper – filled with mold and water – was ruined.\n\n“I knew I was going to lose it, but you just look at all of this and it’s like 5 or 6 feet of water in here and it’s like where do we start?” Emig said through tears.\n\nInside, they discovered their refrigerator in their lower level apartment was on top of the counter and their kitchen island was on its side.\n\nOthers also felt the wrath of Ian. Anddy Garcia, owner of property management company Sanibel Home Concierge, had to tell several clients what they had been dreading to hear: Their homes were beyond saving.\n\n“It’s totally devastating to hear them on the other end of the phone, just gasping for air, and you’re telling them their home was destroyed,” Garcia said. “It’s totally heart-wrenching for me.”\n\nSteve and Lori Schulz rode out the storm at their friends’ house on the island. They were securing homes for neighbors who weren’t on the island, and by the time they finished, they no longer felt like they had time to leave, the couple told CNN.\n\nThe Schulz’s home took on several feet of storm surge and “pretty much everything” in the house is ruined.\n\nDespite all the destruction, Emig told CNN she remained hopeful her community would rebuild. “Sanibel’s full of a lot of working people who care about the island and we’ll be back,” she said. “Sanibel will be back.”\n\nFor now, many homes in that once-tranquil island community “are not livable,” Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe said previously, also noting many homes are off their foundations and alligators and snakes are present across the island.\n\nIn addition to the devastation on the island itself, Ian ripped away several parts of the causeway that was Sanibel’s only access to Florida’s mainland, leaving dozens of people stranded and hindering recovery efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis also toured the damage on Sanibel Wednesday for the first time.\n\n“You can go over it in a helicopter and you see damage, but it does not do it justice until you are actually on the ground, and you see concrete utility poles sawed off right in half, massive power lines everywhere, massive amounts of debris,” he said.\n\nOfficials said most electrical poles, transmission lines and wastewater systems remain down, meaning a return to normal is still a while away.\n\nIan damaged the Sanibel Causeway that connects Fort Myers to the island community. Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/AP\n\nIt could take a month or longer just to restore power to some areas of Sanibel and Pine islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan told CNN. “It will be much easier to restore power once we can gain access to the island,” she said.\n\nAn estimated 6,400 people lived in the City of Sanibel as of April 2021, according to the US Census Bureau. The island is also home to a number of hotels and resorts and sees a significant amount of tourists each year.\n\nDeSantis has directed transportation authorities to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway.\n\nNeighboring Pine Island residents should be able to access their community by car later Wednesday, DeSantis announced, when crews are expected to complete a temporary fix for a part of a damaged bridge washed away in the storm.\n\nResidents lost both their homes and their jobs\n\nAt Salty Sam’s Marina in Fort Myers, owner Darrell Hanson and many of his employees – about 120 at this time of year and up to 200 at the height of tourist season – are working to salvage what they can, some of them dealing with the loss of their livelihoods and personal property.\n\n“In the parking lot, we must have had about 12 feet of water. Everything on the first floor was … destroyed,” said Hanson, who has so far been unable to access his own home on Sanibel Island. “All our gift stores and restaurants and everything, they’ve lost all their inventory. It’s hundreds of thousands of dollars that each business lost.”\n\n“But the employees have all come together,” he said, choking back tears. “They’re all out there working their butt off.”\n\nEmployee Ty Landers, who works on a pirate cruise at the marina, rode out the storm at his family’s home in Fort Myers. Fortunately the home and his family are safe, he said.\n\nBut some of his coworkers weren’t so lucky.\n\n“Many of our employees, even on the pirate ships, my crewmates, they lost their houses, they lost everything,” Landers told CNN. “Hopefully when the time’s right they’ll come back. But right now their lives fell apart, and they’re putting it back together.”\n\nSalty Sam's Marina, which employs about 120 people this time of year, was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ian. CNN\n\nDespite ongoing struggles, ‘there’s hope to rebuild’\n\nMany areas remain under boil water notices since the storm made landfall, damaging critical infrastructure, as well as homes.\n\nResidents of Lee and Charlotte counties – the two counties with the highest death tolls from the hurricane – will be able to get temporary blue coverings with fiber-reinforced sheeting at no cost for their roofs to help reduce further damage, according to a Charlotte County news release.\n\nIn Charlotte County, which is north of Fort Myers, public schools will be closed until further notice after several of its 22 schools were damaged by Ian. “The storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,” Charlotte County public schools spokesperson Mike Riley said.\n\nPublic schools in Collier County are set to open Thursday, according to district spokesperson Chad Oliver, who added he did not know how many kids will show up for classes. More than than 22% of the district’s teachers live in hard-hit Lee County, but Oliver says the district is confident it is ready to reopen with the help of more than 800 substitute teachers.\n\nFlorida hospitals have also been struggling. Emergency departments sustained damage, staffing is impacted as hospital workers were displaced or lost their vehicles, and some facilities lost reliable access to water.\n\n“We were ready, we had our generators all ready. We had plenty of fuel. What we couldn’t anticipate and didn’t anticipate was the loss of water from our utility companies,” said Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and CEO of Lee Health.\n\nMembers of the Miami-Dade Task Force 1 Search and Rescue team look Tuesday through debris for victims in Matlacha, Florida. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nJessica Hernstadt, a resident of Fort Myers Beach in Lee County, said the community “looked like an apocalyptic disaster” when she made her way there after Ian slammed the shore, with cars, pots, pans and clothing littering the area.\n\nHomes the storm tore from their foundations blocked the streets leading to her house, which she found ablaze when she arrived, she told CNN in an interview Wednesday.\n\nLater, combing through the ashes, Hernstadt found just one item unscathed: a candlestick holder her great-grandmother carried in her pockets as she emigrated from Poland to the US.\n\n“It was the simplest, most prized possession that I had, and it gave me a sense of hope, especially today being Yom Kippur,” she said Wednesday. Yom Kippur is the holiest day of the year in Judaism.\n\n“We will survive.

Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency for Mariposa County after the fire forced more than 3,000 people to evacuate their homes, a news release from his office said. Activating a state of emergency allows for additional resources to aid response to the fire.\n\nElectricity service in the area stopped Friday at about 4 p.m., “and the fire has been coming towards us faster and faster,” Detamore said.\n\nThe fire had destroyed at least 10 structures and damaged another five, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire, said Saturday. At that time, the blaze was threatening 2,000 other structures, Cal Fire said.\n\nIt had burned 6,555 acres by Saturday morning and nearly 12,000 that evening, according to Cal Fire. Fire activity was extreme, and emergency personnel were working to evacuate people and protect buildings, the department said.\n\nEleven fire crews with more than 400 personnel, as well as 45 fire engines and four helicopters, have been assigned to fight the flames, Cal Fire said.\n\nEvacuations have been ordered for certain areas of Mariposa County south and east of the fire, as shown in an online map. The evacuation zones did not include the town of Mariposa.\n\nA Red Cross evacuation center has been established at an elementary school in Mariposa, Cal Fire said.\n\nThe blaze comes as much of the US has been experiencing an extreme heat wave this week, with parts of California seeing temperatures in the triple-digits.\n\nWildfires scorching the western US in recent years have become more common due to worsening drought conditions fueled by climate change. In California alone, more than 2.5 million acres were burned in nearly 9,000 fires last year, according to Cal Fire.\n\nCouple left with ‘just the clothes on their back’\n\nNick Smith told CNN his parents’ home burned down as a result of the fire.

Noah Berger/AP\n\nSmith told CNN that his father is a Mariposa sheriff and was working on the fire when his mother, Jane, had to evacuate. She had time to load their horses and get out of the area, according to Smith.\n\n“They had just the clothes on their back and the shoes on their feet,” he added.\n\nIn the meantime, the couple is staying with friends and family. Smith created a verified GoFundMe to support his parents and help them overcome their loss.\n\n“They lived in their home for over 37 years, and now have lost everything,” Smith wrote on the GoFundMe. “37 years of memories, generations of family treasures, and countless more sentimental things. Although these are materials, it is devastating to lose everything literally in the blink of an eye without notice.”\n\nThe blaze is a few dozen miles southwest of Yosemite National Park’s southern edges, though the park is closer when measured by a straight line.\n\nThe Oak Fire is the largest of California’s currently active wildfires of note, which numbered at least six Saturday morning, according to Cal Fire.\n\nThe second-largest, the Washburn Fire, has burned in and near southern Yosemite National Park for more than two weeks.

Twenty-four deaths were recorded in Charlotte County – up from 12.\n\nHurricane Ian also contributed to the deaths of eight people in Collier County, five in Volusia County, three in Sarasota County, two in Manatee County and one each in Lake, Hardee, Hendry, Hillsborough and Polk counties, officials said. Four other people died in storm-related incidents as Ian churned into North Carolina.\n\nMore than 1,600 people have been rescued from Hurricane Ian’s path in parts of southwest and central Florida since last week, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office said Sunday.\n\nNow, as blue skies return, Floridians who took shelter while the hurricane raged have emerged – many of them still without power or clean drinking water – to find their communities unrecognizable.\n\nMore than 491,000 homes, businesses and other customers in Florida still did not have power as of Monday night, according to PowerOutage.us. In Fort Myers Beach, where search crews are going through the rubble one house at a time, power may not be restored for 30 days due its electrical infrastructure being destroyed, Lee County Manager Roger Desjarlais said.\n\nThe National Guard will be flying power crews to Sanibel and Pine islands to assess the damage and start working on restoring power, DeSantis said.\n\nMany residents are without clean tap water, with well over 100 boil-water advisories in places around the state, according to Florida Health Department data.\n\nLIVE UPDATES\n\nIn Naples, Hank DeWolf’s 4,000-pound boat dock was carried through a condo complex by the powerful hurricane, landing in his neighbor’s yard. And the water brought someone’s car into his own backyard. He doesn’t know who it belongs to or how to remove it.\n\nAs crews in Naples comb through the wreckage to make sure no one is still trapped, residents face the enormous task ahead of cleaning up and restoring the city, Jay Boodheshwar, city manager of Naples, told CNN.\n\n“People need to take care of their emotional and mental health, because we’re really going to need to work together on this,” Boodheshwar said.\n\nNaples received record-high storm surge, when the hurricane sent rising ocean water flooding into the city’s streets and tearing through its infrastructure.\n\n“The amount of water that we received and the height of the surge affected a lot of the infrastructure,” Boodheshwar said. “So there are transformers that are fried. It is not simply rehanging lines. There are things that may need to be replaced.”\n\nA man stands in front of a home damaged by storm surge in the wake of Hurricane Ian in Naples, Florida. Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nIn Lee County, Desjarlais said officials cannot stop residents from coming home, but with no water or electricity and with extensive damage, it’s not safe.\n\nSimilar scenes are playing out in other communities. Hurricane Ian – expected to be the most expensive storm in Florida’s history – devastated neighborhoods from the state’s western coast to inland cities like Orlando.\n\nIn some cases, emergency workers out searching for signs of life are at the same time contending with losing their own homes.\n\n“Some of the guys on Pine Island, they lost everything, but they’re doing what they can,” said emergency physician Dr. Ben Abo, who was preparing to join first responders on a rescue mission Sunday near decimated Sanibel Island and Pine Island.\n\nAnd the flooding isn’t over yet.\n\nSeminole County continues to experience significant flooding in certain neighborhoods, with families being rescued from waist-high waters over the weekend.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Cameraman rushes to help family during live report 00:59 - Source: CNN\n\nDays after the hurricane left, flooding continues to increase in areas near the St. Johns River, Lake Monroe, and Lake Harney, with an additional 100 homes suffering floodwater damage over the last 24 hours, Seminole County emergency management officials told CNN affiliate WESH.\n\nQuestions over timing of evacuation orders as deaths mount\n\nLee County officials have faced criticism about why the first mandatory evacuations weren’t ordered until a day before Ian’s landfall, despite an emergency plan which suggests evacuations should have happened earlier.\n\nDeSantis has said Lee County officials acted appropriately when they issued their first mandatory evacuations on Tuesday, less than 24 hours before Hurricane Ian made landfall on the barrier island Cayo Costa, and a day after several neighboring counties issued their orders.\n\nDesjarlais said the county made the decision to evacuate at the earliest time possible.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that so many people chose not to evacuate,” he said. “You know, I think I told you the other day we had room for 40,000 people in our shelters, but only 4,000 showed up, which means that people made the conscious choice not to evacuate, and it is regretful and you know, no one feels worse than we do about all that.”\n\nBut people are “used to longer evacuation orders,” Shawn Critser, a pastor in Fort Myers Beach, told CNN Monday. “But we got it the day before.”\n\nIn the days leading up to the storm, Critser believed – like many others – that the heaviest impacts would be felt farther to the north, near Tampa Bay. But then the forecast was revised, showing the storm’s track shifting to the south.\n\n“When that evacuation order came, we’re like, ’24 hours, that’s not a lot. But we’ll still kind of make it,’” Critser said. “And it wasn’t until Wednesday morning when we woke up and saw that it had made another adjustment. And at that point, it’s just too late.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Miracle': Captain tells incredible story about his boat during Hurricane Ian 04:00 - Source: CNN\n\nSheriff Marceno stood by the handling of the evacuation orders Monday, saying he was “confident in our county manager, our leaders, our governor, all of us in law enforcement that we got that message out at the right time.”\n\nHard-hit Sanibel Island will be ‘out of commission’\n\nHurricane Ian wiped away parts of the Sanibel Causeway, which connects Sanibel Island to the mainland, stranding residents as their only link became impassable.\n\nSearch and rescue personnel have been going door-to-door searching properties for anyone who may need to be evacuated, and nearly 100 members of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue continue to conduct rescue efforts along Southwest Florida’s Barrier Islands like Sanibel, Captiva and Pine Island.\n\nThe fire rescue team is helping evacuate residents, dispensing medicine, treating injuries, helping people get in touch with family and just providing hard-to-come-by information, said Capt.

It wasn’t. God is good. We made it out alive,” Lynn wrote on Facebook. “We lost everything. My car is gone. I haven’t seen my home on Sanibel. I’ve been told it’s destroyed.”\n\nLynn was thankful to be alive, but, she wrote, “This is so much more than devastating. The heart of the (Southwest Florida) coast is forever changed.”\n\nAuthorities will allow residents to return Wednesday by private boat but said they should look online first. Sanibel officials plan to post photos and information on whether the property is deemed destroyed or damaged.\n\nThe bridge to Pine Island was knocked out by the storm and the transportationdepartment hopes to have a temporary bridge in place by the end of the week, the governor said Monday.\n\n“This is not necessarily going to be a bridge you’re going to want to go 45 miles per an hour over, maybe, but at least you’ll have connectivity to the mainland,” DeSantis said.\n\nOfficials said food is being dropped at fire stations on Pine Island.\n\nPower could be out for weeks\n\nSome residents and businesses in storm-damaged counties may not be back on the grid for “weeks or months” because of the structural damage caused by the hurricane, said Eric Silagy, president and CEO of Florida Power & Light Company.\n\nFPL expects to have power restored by Sunday to 95% of its 126,700 customers in Charlotte County, which includes Punta Gorda, Patrick Fuller, the county emergency management director said Monday.

A warmer atmosphere can hold more water, making extreme rainfall events more likely.\n\nDriveways ‘fell down the mountain’\n\nEvents like this, in which massive amounts of water are dumped in a short period of time, “have increased in frequency and intensity in the Southeast,” according to the US government’s latest National Climate Assessment, “and there is high confidence they will continue to increase in the future.”\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for Buchanan County around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.

He doesn't deserve ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe only thing that climbed as high as gas prices earlier this year was the disapproval of President Joe Biden, as Americans blamed him for record prices at the pump. But Biden had relatively little control over the prices set primarily by global markets.\n\nIf Biden got too much blame for when the price of gasoline shot up to a record $5.02 for a gallon of regular by mid-June, he is now hoping he gets credit for the steady drop in gas prices to below $4. There have been 71 straight days of declining prices to $3.88 a gallon as of Wednesday according to AAA.\n\nBiden did order the release of about 1 million barrels of oil a day from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR. But that was responsible for maybe 15 cents of the $1.13 decline in price over the last 10 weeks, according to Andy Lipow, president of consultant Lipow Oil Associates.\n\n“The biggest impact on gasoline prices is reduced consumption and also the fears of recession around the world,” he said.\n\nRecessions can cause a huge drop in gasoline and oil prices, as people facing job loss and money worries will drive less, reducing demand for both gas and oil.\n\nIn 2008, the average gas price plunged 60% between a then-record price of $4.11 a gallon in July and the end of that year, as the financial markets meltdown sparked the Great Recession and massive job losses.\n\nRecession risks not limited to US\n\nBut it’s not just threats of a US recession that are pushing down oil and gasoline prices. The US economy, with a strong job market, has a more robust economy than many other major oil consumers.\n\nUS oil and gasoline prices have also been helped by a rising dollar, which is up 12% versus the Euro since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and also up against other major and minor world currencies.\n\nSince oil futures are priced in dollars, that has helped to limit the increase paid by US consumers, since their dollars are going farther. But it is driving up oil and gasoline prices even more around the globe since more of those currencies are needed to buy oil and gasoline in dollars.\n\n“That means the fears of recession are that much greater in other countries,” said Lipow. And the more economies around the globe that fall into recession, the more that could reduce global demand.\n\nBut even if American consumers are enjoying gas prices down more than 20% from their peak, it’s not a particularly good idea for Biden to be taking too much credit for the decline, said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for OPIS, which tracks prices for AAA.\n\n“If they do that, it could be the the 2022 equivalent of ‘Mission Accomplished,’” said Kloza, referring to the banner hung up on an aircraft carrier behind then-President George W. Bush, shortly after US troops reached Baghdad following the US invasion of Iraq.\n\nThe event became widely mocked as the war continued to stretch on for years afterwards. Kloza said if Biden makes too much of the drop in oil prices, it could hurt him if prices start to rise again.\n\n“There’s still a chance that come October or November, if these economies wobble and don’t fall into recession, we could see $120 a barrel crude prices once again,” he said. Current prices are now down close to $100 a barrel.\n\nA hurricane hitting the US oil platforms and refineries along the Gulf Coast or a worsening of the war in Ukraine could also send prices higher. This weekend is the 17th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which caused a massive spike in gasoline prices nationwide.\n\nBiden’s limited impact on oil production\n\nLipow said that US oil producers have made modest increases in production – of about a half-million barrels a day – to take advantage of the high crude oil prices. Biden has pushed oil companies to produce more oil, but so far that has had negligible impact on production, and thus on prices.\n\nBut if oil and gas prices have fallen in the last 10 weeks with little help from Biden, they rose in the four months before for reasons that were far beyond Biden’s control.\n\nThe major factor was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions that were put on Russia by western countries supporting Ukraine. While the US did not import much oil from Russia, the markets reacted to the impact that losing much of Russia’s exports had on global supply.\n\nPrices were already going higher even without the invasion.\n\nWhen oil prices crashed to briefly trade for less than $0 early in the pandemic, it prompted oil producing nations to slash production in an effort to support prices. They have been slow to add back production, as the global economy got back on track in 2021 and early this year, before the latest recession fears.\n\nDespite the talk about the Biden administration policies hurting production, none of the steps taken since Biden took office, such as blocking the Keystone Pipeline or pausing new fracking contracts on federal lands, have affected current supplies of crude oil.\n\nIf if Biden had not taken those steps, any additional oil that might have been produced would not have been available yet.\n\n“Keystone or fracking limits might have had an impact on prices in ’24, ‘25 or ‘26. But until then, they’re just a Republican talking point,” said Kloza.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/politics/fact-check-biden-gas-prices/index.html", "title": "Fact check: Biden falsely claims the most common gas price was ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden has made another false claim about gas prices.\n\nDuring a Thursday speech in Syracuse, New York, Biden accurately said that gas prices, now averaging about $3.76 per gallon, have declined by roughly $1.25 since this year’s June peak of over $5 per gallon. But then he claimed, “Today, the most common price of gas in America is $3.39 – down from over $5 when I took office.” People in the audience applauded.\n\nFacts First: Biden’s claim that the most common gas price when he took office was more than $5 isn’t even close to true. The most common price for a gallon of regular gas on the day he was inaugurated, January 20, 2021, was $2.39, according to data provided to CNN by Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy – much lower than the most common price today, not much higher than the most common price today as Biden said. In other words, Biden made it sound like gas prices have fallen significantly during his presidency when they have actually increased significantly.\n\nThe national average gas price on Biden’s Inauguration Day was also $2.39 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. The national average peaked at about $5.02 per gallon in mid-June, according to AAA, after a spike prompted in part by Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine. It has fallen substantially since, including a decline over the last month.\n\nIn previous remarks, Biden has discussed the state of gas prices in relation to the Russian invasion or the summer peak, not in relation to when he took office. Regardless of his intentions in his remarks on Thursday, though, the price of gas might well be the single most important price in the midterm election campaign, and this speech was the second this fall in which Biden described it inaccurately – both times in a way that made it sound more impressive.\n\nIn late September, Biden asserted that “in 41 states plus the District of Columbia, the average gasoline price is less than $2.99.” In fact, not a single state had an average lower than $2.99 at the time. After CNN inquired about that false claim, the White House made a correction to the official transcript to reflect that Biden should have said $3.99, as he had correctly said in other remarks, instead of $2.99.\n\nDe Haan of GasBuddy said Friday that the highest the most common price ever got under Biden, in June, was $4.99 per gallon. The most common price as of this Tuesday was $3.39 per gallon, the number Biden cited in the Thursday speech, and it had fallen to $3.29 per gallon as of Friday.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Friday.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/04/can-crown-basilica-declaration-landfill-park-news-around-states/111392984/", "title": "Can-Am Crown, basilica declaration: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: Some civic and political groups are urging Huntsville-area officials to stop criminally charging people who have marijuana. The Huntsville Times reports the Tennessee Valley Progressive Alliance and 20 other groups sent a letter to Huntsville and Madison County leaders urging police and prosecutors to stop enforcing laws against marijuana possession. The letter argues that stopping enforcement would ease racial disparities in policing, allow officials to focus on violent crimes and improve police-community relations. Signers included the Madison County Democratic Party, the NAACP of Huntsville and Madison County, and the League of Women Voters of the Tennessee Valley. Alliance leader David Odom says the letter received no responses. Madison County District Attorney Rob Broussard said he dismissed the letter because he’s sworn to uphold the law.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State taxes on motor and marine fuels would double and registration fees for electric and hybrid vehicles would rise under a bill passed by the Alaska Senate on Monday. The bill’s sponsor, Republican Sen. Click Bishop, said the measure would generate additional funds that could help address transportation infrastructure and maintenance needs. The motor fuel tax would go from 8 to 16 cents a gallon and marine fuel from 5 to 10 cents a gallon. Registration fees would go from $100 to $200 for electric vehicles and from $100 to $150 for hybrids, according to a fiscal analysis. The bill passed 12-5; no one who voted against it spoke during the floor debate. The measure next goes to the House.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The biggest bonuses awarded last year by state government went to a handful of employees who oversee some of Arizona’s lowest-paid workers. Seven employees of Arizona Correctional Industries, a prison work program, received bonuses ranging from $12,000 to $57,000, with the largest going to a sales representative for the operation. Inmates who work in construction, egg harvesting and other jobs for ACI, meanwhile, are paid between $0.10 and $5.25 an hour. Corrections spokesman Bill Lamoreaux said ACI employee bonuses are paid by the private employers who use ACI to hire inmates, not taxpayers. Records show at least 52 Corrections employees associated with ACI received $384,221 in bonuses last year, averaging $7,389 – more than five times the average incentive pay for the 16,000 state employees who received bonuses in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nPine Bluff: A local man who served in the U.S. Army during World War II was awarded the medals he earned during the war during a ceremony Friday morning, more than 70 years after his discharge. Fulton Walker, now 97, who went on to earn a bachelor’s and master’s degree and was the second African American to be appointed principal at an all-white school in Arkansas, received the Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with three Bronze Service Stars, World War II Victory Medal, Marksman Badge with Rifle Bar and Honorable Service Lapel Button World War II from U.S. Sen. John Boozman. Walker was born Sept. 1, 1923, near Emerson. During his freshman year in college, he was drafted into the Army, where he served from 1943 to 1946.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBerkeley: The University of California, Berkeley has received a $252 million donation – its largest-ever single gift – to start construction of a new building for students and faculty studying computing and data science. The gift, made anonymously, will allow the university to start building the Data Hub on the north side of campus, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Another $300 million in donations will be needed to complete the building, which will house the Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society, which teaches an increasing number of students across a variety of majors. More than 6,000 of the university’s 31,000 undergraduate students take data science classes each year. The Data Hub will house classrooms and offices and also may include robotics and artificial intelligence laboratories, research centers, public gathering areas and a large auditorium.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: An armed man who tried to steal cars from multiple people, including an off-duty sheriff’s deputy, died after an officer-involved shooting Sunday night, police said. The deputy fired at the 35-year-old suspect when he tried to carjack the deputy’s vehicle, police said. An officer who arrived during that attempted carjacking also fired at the suspect, police said. The man died at the scene. The deputy and the officer were not injured. The suspect allegedly first stole a 2004 Dodge truck after hitting the victim with a handgun. After officers found the truck and were investigating that theft, the suspect allegedly got away in a black Cadillac Escalade, but it was disabled after a short chase, police said. The suspect then tried to steal two more vehicles, including the one driven by the off-duty Pueblo County sheriff’s deputy. The man was carrying an AR-15-style rifle, police said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMeriden: Connecticut State Police are hoping to draw more women to their ranks with a special recruiting forum planned during the agency’s latest trooper application process. The forum is scheduled for Sunday and Monday at the Connecticut Police Academy in Meriden. Those interested in attending are urged to RSVP online. Female troopers will be on hand to share their experiences and answer questions. Public safety Commissioner James Rovella and top state police leaders will also talk to prospective applicants. According to state police statistics, women comprise only about 8% of the 922 state trooper positions, and officials say they want to significantly increase that percentage. The deadline to apply to be a state trooper in the current application period is March 13.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: After seeing a significant increase in car crash deaths last year, the state is on track to have even more roadway fatalities in 2020, according to the Delaware Department of Transportation. And that’s worrying state officials. Department of Transportation Secretary Jennifer Cohan told lawmakers Monday that the state’s current highway safety plan is “going in the wrong direction.” “More needs to be done,” she said, without offering specifics. “We need to do better.” As of Tuesday morning, Delaware has had 18 total traffic deaths versus 10 at this time last year, DelDOT said. Ten of the 2020 traffic deaths were vehicle occupants, and eight were pedestrians, according to the data. This time in 2019, Delaware had seen five vehicle occupant deaths and five pedestrian deaths.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Park Service says D.C.’s favorite trees have officially reached the first stage of the blooming process, WUSA-TV reports. The Yoshino cherry blossom trees around the Tidal Basin reached green bud, the first of six stages culminating in peak bloom, on Feb. 28, six days earlier than in 2019. However, that timing remains several days later than the green bud stage was reached in 2018 or 2017. Meteorologists say a mild winter could lead to an earlier peak bloom period, possibly before the Cherry Blossom Festival even begins March 20. The district’s 3,200 Yoshino cherry trees were a gift from Japan more than a century ago to commemorate the friendship and relationship between the two countries. Cherry blossoms are Japan’s national flower, symbolizing hope and peace.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State lawmakers have advanced dueling proposals to require employers to check the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States, a key policy priority being pushed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, who wants all employers in his state to use a federal database known as E-Verify. Republican lawmakers last year joined DeSantis, in his freshman year as governor, in advancing a ban against so-called sanctuary cities to prevent local governments from giving safe harbor to people who are in the country illegally. But the Legislature declined then to approve an E-Verify bill, partly because key lawmakers – including some top Republicans – expressed concern that the proposal would be a burden to business. Critics of E-Verify say the system remains riddled with outdated and inaccurate data.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge has declined to order election officials in Sumter County to use hand-marked paper ballots after election integrity activists raised concerns that the state’s new voting machines violate voters’ right to a secret ballot. In a lawsuit filed last week in Sumter County Superior Court against the five members of the county election board, the activists said the machines’ large, bright, vertical touchscreens and large font allow other people in the room to see a voter’s selections. In denying an emergency motion seeking a switch to hand-marked paper ballots, Sumter County Superior Court Judge Rucker Smith wrote in an order signed Monday that the activists hadn’t proven that it will be “impossible or impracticable” for the election officials to arrange the voting machines “in a manner that protects the secrecy of the ballot while allowing sufficient monitoring.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A proposal to create a new state agency to build and renovate public schools is moving forward despite concerns the agency would be exempt from many legal safeguards. The School Facilities Agency would be responsible for development, planning and construction of capital improvement projects at public schools, taking over that work from the Department of Education, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The agency would be exempt from all county ordinances – except building codes – and from state laws focusing on historic preservation, environmental protection, budgeting and civil service. The facilities agency would also be exempt from parts of the procurement code and the Sunshine Law, which governs how state and county board conduct official business. Proponents see the agency as a way to expedite building modern schools and redeveloping old properties without bureaucratic delay.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Several news and legal organizations have told the Idaho Supreme Court that they believe state prison officials are required to reveal the source of drugs used in executions under public records law. The American Bar Association, the Idaho Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the Idaho Press Club and others filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of a lawsuit that University of Idaho professor Aliza Cover brought against the Idaho Department of Correction. Several news organizations, including the Associated Press, the Idaho Statesman and Boise television station KTVB, joined with the Idaho Press Club in its brief. The Department of Correction didn’t have any comment on the filings, spokesman Jeff Ray said. Cover, who is represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Idaho, sued after prison officials largely denied her request for execution-related records in 2017.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A new bill would require schools that want to keep using Native American mascots and logos to receive approval from local tribes if they want to participate in playoffs, among other requirements. State Rep. Maurice West, a Rockford Democrat, pitched the plan to the Interscholastic Athletic Organization Act after students at Hononegah High School in Rockton led a protest over the use of the Princess Hononegah Indian mascot and other Native American imagery and iconography. West’s bill would prohibit Hononegah and other schools from using their Indian mascots and logos unless they complied with certain rules, according to the Rockford Register Star. Failure to meet them would make the school ineligible to participate in playoff competitions. Some of the requirements include getting written approval from a tribe based within 500 miles and offering Native American culture programs and courses at the school.\n\nIndiana\n\nLebanon: The slopes of a former municipal landfill could become a park laced with trails for mountain bikes. City engineer Kevin Krulik pitched conceptual designs for the project to Lebanon City Council members last week, telling them the proposed $500,000 mountain bike park would be geared toward families. “This is not a Red Bull racing facility. This is not an extreme mountain bike facility. This is very much family-focused, family-friendly,” Krulik said. The park would be built on a former 110-acre landfill along U.S. 52 in the Boone County city about 20 miles northwest of Indianapolis. That city-owned site operated as Lebanon’s landfill until 1984, when it was shuttered and capped. Lebanon is considering developing the park under a partnership with the National Interscholastic Cycling Association, the Indianapolis Business Journal reports.\n\nIowa\n\nSpringville: A deteriorating Revolutionary War monument will be restored this summer in eastern Iowa if the Daughters of the American Revolution can raise enough money, organizers say. The 16.5-foot marble and granite monument honors a Revolutionary War soldier buried in Linn County. It’s being held together with wire, and the concrete base is falling apart. The monument was damaged by a tornado in 1977. The monument was built in honor of Nathan Brown, a former soldier who settled in Springville in the 1800s. It was commissioned by his son in 1886. Three local Daughters of the American Revolution chapters and the Springville Historical Society have worked for six years to raise money, secure grants and find someone to do the restoration work on the monument. The estimated repair cost: $44,000.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The number of women in prison in the state is growing far faster than the number of men, outpacing national trends, according to a new report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. Kansas News Service reports that from 2000 to 2019, the women’s prison population in Kansas rose by 60%, while the men’s rose by 14%. It’s not clear why Kansas’ female prison population grew more than other states’ populations, but policy changes intended to reduce the number of people in prison likely have had different effects on men and women. Last year, 77% of women who entered Kansas prisons did so because they violated probation or parole, compared to 65% of men. According to a senior research analyst at the Kansas Sentencing Commission, the number of female prisoners grew after a 2013 state law that changed probation. Across the country, the population of women in state prisons rose by 26% from 2000 to 2016, while the men’s population rose by 8%.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Knox: It’s going to get loud at Fort Knox. The U.S. Army says to expect more noise than normal at the central Kentucky post over the next couple of weeks as it hosts a training session March 3-16. The training will involve larger caliber weapons than usual, military aircraft and land vehicles, news outlets report, citing a post on the Fort Knox Facebook page. Fort Knox said it was posting the alert as a courtesy to residents in surrounding communities who should expect to hear increased noise and vibrations. “Military training involving aircraft, maneuvers and weapons firing in the daytime and nighttime hours is an important aspect of maintaining critical capabilities and readiness of all units,” the post said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The voter registration deadline is nearing for the state’s presidential primary, and officials are reminding voters that the election is a rare closed primary that allows only registered Democrats and Republicans to cast ballots. Nearly all of Louisiana’s elections are open primaries, where all candidates regardless of party run against each other on the ballot – and all voters can choose among all the candidates. But the April 4 presidential primary is closed. Only Republicans can vote in the GOP primary to select the Republican nominee for president, and only Democrats can choose among the Democratic candidates for president. Those who aren’t registered with either political party cannot vote in the presidential primary. Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin’s office said the deadline to register in person or by mail to vote in the election is Wednesday. The deadline for online registration is March 14.\n\nMaine\n\nFort Kent: A Canadian musher crossed the finish line 35 seconds ahead of his closest competitor Monday to win the Can-Am Crown, a 250-mile dog sled race across the wilderness of northern Maine. Denis Tremblay, of Saint Michel des Saints, Quebec, was the Can-Am Crown runner-up four times before notching his dramatic victory. Second-place finisher Katherine Langlais, of Glenwood, New Brunswick, was 12 minutes behind at the start of the final 43-mile sprint, but she closed the gap to 35 seconds for the closest finish in race history, said Can-Am President Dennis Cyr. Neither Tremblay nor Langlais knew how close they were because the hilly course prevented them from seeing each other. The 250-mile Can-Am Crown kicked off Saturday in Fort Kent. The grueling course took mushers to Portage Lake and then to the town of Allagash before looping back to Fort Kent.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state Senate has voted to ban a pesticide that has been found to damage children’s brain development. The Senate voted 31-14 on Tuesday for the measure, which now goes to the House. The Senate measure bans the pesticide called chlorpyrifos for four years, beginning Dec. 31. Supporters of a complete ban hope to make it permanent this legislative session. Supporters of the measure say the pesticide also poses threats to aquatic life and the Chesapeake Bay. The Maryland Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would develop regulations to phase out the regular use of the pesticide, but supporters of the legislation are pushing for a ban in the law. California, Hawaii and New York have approved bans on the pesticide.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Boston area public transit agency has again taken several new rail cars out of service after identifying a potential problem, the agency announced Tuesday. “The new Orange Line trains have been temporarily taken out of service,” the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said in a tweet. “Inspectors identified a fault with the bolsters which is being corrected to ensure the vehicles are reliable & safe for the duration of their service lives.” The trains are expected to return to service later in the week. This is the third time the new train cars have been pulled since two sets of six cars made their debut in August. In September, when a door on one car came open while it was in motion, all were taken out of service to replace a part. They were taken out of service in December to address an “uncommon noise” coming from part of the wheel assembly. One of the new cars derailed in November when there were no passengers on board.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A church in the city has been declared a basilica by Pope Francis, a rare honor for a Roman Catholic parish in the U.S., officials announced Sunday. Ste. Anne Church is one of only 86 churches in the United States, including three in Michigan, to carry the title of Minor Basilica, the Archdiocese of Detroit said. Ste. Anne parish, near the Detroit River, began in 1701 and is the second-oldest continuously operating Catholic parish in the U.S., with 575 families, the archdiocese said. The current church was built in 1886. “To demonstrate it met criteria for becoming a Minor Basilica, Ste. Anne extensively documented its heightened liturgical activity and its architectural stature. … It contains many artifacts from the so-called stone church, the church building that preceded the present structure,” the archdiocese said. Archbishop Allen Vigneron will celebrate the designation at a Mass on April 26.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: A police officer was justified in fatally shooting a man in a north Minneapolis neighborhood last August, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman. In a statement released Monday, Freeman said he determined that the deadly use of force by Officer Jason Wolff was reasonable and therefore not criminal. Police responded to a call about 3 a.m. Aug. 2 and found 32-year-old Mario Benjamin kneeling next to an injured woman in the street. In his interview with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension conducted two days after the shooting, Wolff said at first he thought Benjamin was trying to help the woman. Then, Wolff saw Benjamin stand up with a gun in his right hand, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Wolff’s body camera footage shows Benjamin holding the gun to his head while Wolff repeatedly orders him to drop the gun. Wolff said he shot Benjamin three or four times after he refused to drop the weapon.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Republican-led Legislature is trying to restrict the reasons women may seek abortion, after federal courts blocked time limitations that the state tried to put on the procedure the past two years. Abortion would be prohibited if a woman is seeking the procedure because of the race, sex or genetic abnormality of the fetus, under a bill that passed a state House committee Tuesday. The only exception would be in case of a medical emergency. Other states have been sued over similar laws, and opponents questioned whether Mississippi is inviting another lawsuit over abortion. House Bill 1295 moves to the full House for more debate. Anyone who performs an abortion because of race, sex or genetic abnormality could face one year to 10 years in prison. The woman having the abortion would not face penalties.\n\nMissouri\n\nSikeston: Strong winds from a thunderstorm are being blamed for the deaths of more than 1,000 birds, all of them found in this southeast Missouri town. The storm rolled through Sikeston on Sunday night. KFVS-TV reports Scott County Conservation Agent Andrew Mothershead and a conservation department biologist were called to the western part of Sikeston after a large number of dead birds were seen near the power plant. Mothershead said in a statement that they found carcasses of red-winged blackbirds, brown-headed cowbirds, grackles and European starlings in fields. They also found several other birds showing signs of injury.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Schools must test drinking water for lead content following state rule changes related to school health, officials said. Schools may begin this month, with a December 2021 deadline to complete testing, The Daily Inter Lake reports. Schools are required to test all fixtures providing water for human consumption or food preparation, including sinks, drinking fountains and water bottle refill stations. State officials encouraged elementary schools to begin testing first because young, developing children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure. Schools are required to test once every three years or submit requests for alternative schedules.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Goodwill Omaha fired its longtime CEO in 2017 amid a scandal over his six-figure salary, $100,000 annual performance bonuses, a $519,000 lump-sum retirement payout and a country club membership. But after it parted ways with Frank McGree, he was paid an additional $610,000, according to Goodwill’s latest public disclosure statement, the Omaha World-Herald reports. He’d sued Goodwill in September 2017 because its board had refused to pay his negotiated severance. In 2018 the charity’s board acknowledged that it settled the lawsuit. Until now, the settlement figure wasn’t publicly known. Goodwill trains and employ people with disabilities and others who may have a hard time getting and keeping jobs. McGree received total compensation of more than $933,000 in 2014, and 13 Goodwill executives were paid more than $100,000, reducing the amount of money available for job training programs.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The state’s largest utility has filed a request for more than $30 million in rate reductions for ratepayers beginning in October. Under the request filed with the state Public Utilities Commission, ratepayers in northern Nevada would enjoy about a $24.1 million savings and those in southern Nevada about $6.7 million effective Oct. 1. Utility President and CEO Doug Cannon says the proposed rate cuts are in addition to earlier rate reductions effective April 1 that will reduce the cost of monthly electric bills about $2.10 for northern Nevada customers using 760 kilowatt hours of power. Southern Nevada residential electric customers using 1,092 kilowatt hours of electricity a month will see a decrease of $3.88 on their monthly bills. That reduction is tied to the lower cost of fuel used to produce power at NV Energy’s generating stations.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLisbon: A 19th-century farm will be conserved forever by the Ammonoosuc Conservation Trust. The trust has closed on the conservation easement of 30 acres donated by Dori Hamilton, the Caledonian Record reports. The farmhouse, dubbed Tranquil Vewe Croft, was built in 1885 and started by an Irish farmer, Hamilton said. The trust is working with retiring farmers to determine what will happen to similar properties, ACT Executive Director Rebecca Brown said. Brown said food security and potential disruptions to the supply chain are among the concerns being addressed in farmland conservation. “Can we grow all of our food locally?” Brown said. “No, that’s not realistic. But we have to do better than what we are doing now.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nShamong: An emergency medical services crew will fight a $108,000 fine proposed by state officials for sending an unlicensed ambulance to 90 emergencies. Shamong Medical Services, part of the Indian Mills Volunteer Fire Company, operates two vehicles that are licensed through the state’s health department. An audit prompted by an anonymous complaint found that a third unlicensed ambulance had responded to calls between Oct. 7, 2018, and Oct. 9, 2019, according to a notice from the state. The state’s Office of Emergency Medical Services also found that Shamong didn’t staff its ambulances with at least two EMTs as required by state law on 36 occasions, according to the notice. Shamong EMS Chief Dave Taylor told NJ Advance Media on Tuesday that there was “a verbal understanding with the state” that the EMS could operate one unlicensed ambulance with one EMT as long as it did not bill health insurance companies.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Low-income students who qualified for reduced-price school breakfast and lunch no longer have to come up with co-payments for the meals under a measure signed into law by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. In signing the bill Monday, the governor said that while many families meet the criteria for reduced fees, they still have difficulty coming up with the money when they have multiple children in school. “A 40-cent copay should never come between a child and the food they need to grow and learn,” she said in a statement. The legislation comes with a $650,000 appropriation that the state Public Education Department will use to reimburse school districts for the fees the children normally would have paid. Supporters say the change will make school meals accessible to an additional 12,500 students.\n\nNew York\n\nNew Rochelle: After months of legal turmoil, the rebirth of the city’s long-vacant armory may be at hand. The city and a developer began renovations to the building last summer, with the intent of enticing another company to develop a project there. But a group of veterans, skeptical of the project, sued New Rochelle and the developer in charge of renovations, Twining, accusing the city of neglecting the armory and even planning to tear it down. If the lawsuit is successful, the city would be stopped from transferring the property to Twining. The city and Twining want the lawsuit thrown out, claiming that renovations have begun, including a new roof. A court date is set for Wednesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDuck: A surfer has won a legal battle to gain access to an 8-foot-wide path that cuts through private property to the ocean on North Carolina’s Outer Banks. The Virginian-Pilot reports the legal battle was waged by Bob Hovey and his wife, Tanya, in the town of Duck. The couple had sued the Sand Dollar Shores Homeowners Association for the right to use the path where they go surfing. The walkway passes between two oceanfront houses. A sign said the path was private and only for homeowners and their guests. A judge in Camden Superior Court recently ruled in Hovey’s favor. The ruling could open up other access points at the end of streets near the ocean. Hovey, 50, said on Facebook: “It’s been a long struggle, but the public can now enjoy the beach in Duck.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Community leaders in the state’s oil patch areas are ramping up efforts to encourage census involvement, noting that population totals have a decadelong impact on federal funding. County officials are hoping the next census, which begins this month, accurately reflects their population size, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Since the shale oil boom in places like Williston and Watford City, the population increase has not matched their official census counts. Williams County, which includes Williston, had 22,398 people for the 2010 census. Lindsey Harriman, co-chair of the Williams County Complete Count Committee, suspects the number was lower than the county’s actual population at the time, when the oil boom started. Officials estimate Williams County has more than 47,000 residents today, Harriman said. Under counting is also a concern in McKenzie County.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: A Ku Klux Klan group that caused tensions with a rally last year has applied to hold another one this year. The Honorable Sacred Knights of Indiana recently asked for a permit for a Sept. 5 rally in Dayton. Montgomery County’s administrator said the application hasn’t yet been approved, the Dayton Daily News reports. At least 10 people want to speak publicly while defending “white Christian American rights,” the application states. Fewer than 10 people rallied last May on Dayton’s courthouse square, badly outnumbered by hundreds of anti-Klan protesters. A massive police presence kept order without direct clashes or injuries after many downtown businesses shut down and roads were blocked. Mayor Nan Whaley said she’s incredibly frustrated and understands people in Dayton are upset and angry about the group’s plans to return. “Let me be clear: I’m angry too,” she said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStringtown: A prison was on lockdown with no visitation following what prison officials called a “disturbance” among about a half-dozen inmates, the state Department of Corrections said Tuesday. There were no serious injuries as a result of the disturbance Monday night at Mack Alford Correctional Center in Stringtown, about 105 miles southeast of Oklahoma City, said DOC spokesman Matt Elliott. Elliott said the cause of the disturbance was under investigation, and the lockdown was ordered after investigators learned of more potential violence at other state prisons. “We’re trying to head off anything serious” at other facilities, Elliott said. All state prisons were locked down in September after an outbreak of apparent gang-related violence left one inmate dead and more than a dozen injured.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Leaders of an American Indian reservation shut down its casino and several other facilities Monday after an employee contracted coronavirus, and a state health official said the virus is likely circulating and will appear in additional locations in the state. The employee of the Wildhorse Resort and Casino on the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation is hospitalized and is the third such case to emerge in Oregon, state and tribal officials said. The previous two other known cases occurred in the Portland area and had household contacts with each other, but the casino is 215 miles east of the city. Meanwhile, dozens of employees of a hospital in a Portland suburb – Kaiser Permanente Westside Medical Center – have been quarantined at home after they may have had contact, unprotected, with the first Oregonian to come down with the virus, The Oregonian reports.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state-owned university system will implement a plan to reduce the size of its faculties by creating an early retirement incentive program. At least 200 members of the faculty at the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education have indicated they will opt for the one-time incentive program, the system said in a statement Monday. The system’s governing board approved the plan in January to align staffing with the decrease in student enrollment. The incentive increases the maximum number of unused sick days for which retirees can be paid out. At least 200 full-time faculty members had to sign up in order to make the plan cost-effective. Faculty members who opted into the program will receive an additional payout of sick leave if they retire on or before Aug. 14, according to the statement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is enacting tougher environmental regulations in an effort to contain the spread of invasive species. The state Department of Environmental Management introduced changes that prohibit the transport of any plants and $100 fine for each violation, The Westerly Sun reports. The state has more than 100 ponds and lakes and 27 river segments that are hosting at least one invasive plant species. The species disrupt the habitats of native plants and animals, degrade water quality and hurt recreation. The state’s initiative plans to align Rhode Island with other states in New England, says Katie DeGoosh-DiMarzio, an environmental analyst with state agency’s Office of Water Resources. The new regulations require that freshwater fishermen remove all plants, animals and mud from gear and equipment, as well as drain all water-containing devices. They must also dry equipment for 24 hours before using it again.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state once had one of the county’s highest rates of execution, even putting two prisoners to death in one night. But now it hasn’t executed a prisoner in nine years and lacks the drugs to carry out lethal injections for any of the 37 inmates on the state’s death row. Some lawmakers are pushing to give the state an option to start executing prisoners again by giving them no choice but to go to the electric chair. Currently, condemned South Carolina prisoners have a choice between lethal injection or electrocution, with lethal injection as the default if they do not pick. The bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday forces inmates to be electrocuted if lethal injection is not available, like the current situation in which South Carolina’s supply of lethal injection drugs has expired and no pharmaceutical companies will sell them any more without a guarantee they won’t be publicly identified. The proposal now heads to the House floor.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State lawmakers and Gov. Kristi Noem floated vastly different cost estimates for legalizing industrial hemp Tuesday, presenting a final hang-up to the resolution of their yearlong dispute. The governor’s office argued that the legalization of industrial hemp would fundamentally change how the state enforces its marijuana laws and require an expansion of staff, drug testing and law enforcement across three state agencies. Lawmakers cast it as an agricultural program similar to other crops that would require oversight by just one person and part-time testing by law enforcement. Rep. Oren Lesmeister, a Democrat from Parade and a proponent of hemp, said the governor’s office inflated the numbers based on a false presumption that drug cases would “skyrocket” as a result of an industrial hemp program. He charged that the governor is using the high estimates as a tactic to thwart the bill.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Eleven Nashville and Memphis parents are suing the state for its controversial Education Savings Account program, marking the second lawsuit filed contending the program is unconstitutional. The suit was filed Monday on behalf of the 11 by the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the Education Law Center and Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP. The petition, filed in Davidson County court, says the state’s program violates numerous provisions in Tennessee’s constitution. The lawsuit outlines similar complaints made in a February lawsuit by Nashville, Shelby County and Metro Nashville Public Schools. Education savings accounts, a voucher-style program, use taxpayer funds deposited for families who withdraw their children from public school. The program is limited to Memphis and Nashville and was a campaign promise of Republican Gov. Bill Lee.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The Leaning Tower of Dallas, the nearly iconic remnant of a high-rise building implosion gone awry, finally collapsed in a cloud of dust Monday after two weeks of being whacked with a headache ball. The tower collapsed about 3:15 p.m. after a few last whacks with a wrecking ball swung by a high-rise crane. No injuries were reported. The tower was the core of an 11-story building that was imploded with explosives Feb. 16. The 11 floors surrounding the core duly collapsed, but the solid concrete core containing the stairway and elevator shafts remained standing at an angle. The demolition contractor has been whacking away at it ever since with a 5,600-pound wrecking ball. In the meantime, the tower drew hundreds of people who took often-whimsical photographs of themselves with the tower in the background.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A bill targeting a new Salt Lake County rule to require gun show vendors in county facilities to run background checks on customers passed the state House of Representatives. The bill passed without debate Friday aims to clarify state control over gun laws in Utah, The Deseret News reports. The bill would prevent cities or counties from being able to work around the state’s gun legislation. The bill passed after lawmakers approved an amendment clarifying guns can be banned in homeless shelters, as well as striking a clause allowing elected officials to be sued for voting to regulate firearms. The bill is sponsored by Republican Rep. Cory Maloy, an outspoken Second Amendment supporter, and faces opposition from Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson and Democrats who argue local governments should be able to pass regulations. The bill will proceed to the state Senate for consideration.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city has a new public official whose job is part of Burlington’s long-running effort to advance equity. The hiring of Tyeastia Green, whose formal title is director of racial equity, inclusion and belonging, was announced last week by Mayor Miro Weinberger. “Breaking down the barriers of institutional racism and implicit bias requires hard, detailed and sustained organizational work,” Weinberger said. Green brings to Vermont her experience working with municipal employees on race and equity issues in Bloomington, Minnesota. There, she worked with a team to create the city’s first Racial Equity Toolkit, a policy document to inform decisions the city makes through the lens of racial equity. She also developed the Start Seeing Color campaign to bring visibility to race. Green said she is excited for her new position in Burlington because of its focus on inclusion.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A solar array at an elementary school is the first to receive the highest possible designation under a new program that encourages pollinator-friendly solar development. The Department of Conservation and Recreation announced Monday that Cople Elementary School in Westmoreland County had been awarded a Gold Certified Pollinator Smart Project label. The program includes recommendations to plan, build and monitor solar facilities that attract pollinators, lessen stormwater impacts and increase the visual appeal of the installations, according to the department. A key focus is the use of Virginia native plant species. Charlottesville-based Sun Tribe installed the project. The company said in a news release that the ground-mounted solar system meets 100% of the school’s energy needs and will save Westmoreland County Public Schools an estimated $3.6 million in energy costs.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The City Council has adopted a new law that seeks in part to dampen the loud protests outside the Planned Parenthood Spokane Health Center. The Spokesman-Review reports the ordinance passed 6-1 on Monday night, with Councilman Michael Cathcart casting the only “no” vote. Council members who supported the measure stressed it was not intended to restrict anti-abortion protesters’ rights to march, hold signs and pray. “All we’re asking is that you keep the noise down to a reasonable level,” Councilwoman Karen Stratton said. The ordinance was proposed in part because a group called the Church at Planned Parenthood has regular gatherings of anti-abortion activists who sing and pray outside the clinic’s walls. Planned Parenthood has said the demonstrations can be heard through its walls and interfere with the services it provides to patients, which include abortion but also STD and cancer screening, pregnancy testing and birth control.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: It could soon be easier for power companies to use solar energy under a bill passed Tuesday in the House of Delegates. Lawmakers voted 75-23 to approve the measure after about an hour of debate that revolved around whether it’s better to focus on coal or renewable energy sources. The state commerce department pushed for the bill, saying big companies want to know that they can use renewable energy sources before relocating to a state. The proposal would create a regulatory program for utilities to use a small amount of renewables. The measure makes several nods to the coal business and says nothing in the bill can “displace any current levels of coal-fired generation capacity.” The bill now moves to the Senate for the chamber to approve some minor House amendments. Senators unanimously approved the measure last month.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOak Creek: A survivor of a shooting at a suburban Milwaukee Sikh temple that killed six worshippers in 2012 has died of complications stemming from a bullet wound to his head. Baba Punjab Singh’s death Monday ties the temple shooting with a 2005 church shooting as the deadliest mass shootings in Wisconsin in the past 20 years. White supremacist Wade Michael Page burst into the temple in Oak Creek on Aug. 5, 2012, and shot 10 people, killing six and wounding four. He ultimately killed himself during a firefight with an arriving police officer in the temple parking lot. “I think, collectively as a community, (Singh’s death) reopens a lot of wounds that might have scabbed over,” said Pardeep Kaleka, whose father, temple president Satwant Singh Kaleka, was killed in the shooting. “But we express condolences to his family and just hope that they over the next couple weeks can have some closure.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state had the second-highest suicide rate in the United States in 2018, a new report says. An American Association of Suicidology study released earlier this month found 25.4 out of every 100,000 Wyoming residents took their own lives in 2018, The Casper Star-Tribune reports. The figure fell from 2017, when Wyoming had more than 27 people per 100,000 people who died by suicide. The 2018 national suicide rate was 14.8 per 100,000 people. New Mexico had the highest rate with 25.6 that year. Wyoming’s age group with the highest rate of suicide was between 20 and 24 years old. There were 16 cases of suicide in that group in 2018. The association found more than 73% of Wyoming residents who died by suicide used a firearm. The national percentage was 50%. Wyoming has been in the highest five of state suicide rates since 1996.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/04"}]}

Usage is on the rise despite health risks ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for the Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nMore and more adults are taking over-the-counter melatonin to get to sleep, and some may be using it at dangerously high levels, a study has found.\n\nThe overall use among the US adult population is still “relatively low,” but the study does “document a significant many-fold increase in melatonin use in the past few years,” said sleep specialist Rebecca Robbins, an instructor in the division of sleep medicine for Harvard Medical School. She was not involved in the study.\n\nThe study, published in the medical journal JAMA, found that by 2018 Americans were taking more than twice the amount of melatonin than a decade earlier.\n\nMelatonin has been linked to headaches, dizziness, nausea, stomach cramps, drowsiness, confusion or disorientation, irritability and mild anxiety, depression and tremors as well as abnormally low blood pressure. It can also interact with common medications and trigger allergies.\n\nWhile short-term use for people with jet lag, shift workers and those who have trouble falling asleep appears to be safe, long-term safety is unknown, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health at the National Institutes of Health.\n\n“In an associational study we found that older adults who reported frequent use — every night or most nights — of a sleep aid (over the counter or prescription) had a higher risk of incident dementia and early mortality,” Robbins said.\n\nHowever, researchers could not determine which type of sleep aid — over-the-counter medications, such as melatonin, or prescription medications — was responsible for the findings.\n\nMelatonin’s side effects\n\nSince 2006, a small but growing subset of adults are taking amounts of melatonin that far exceed the dosage of 5 milligrams a day typically used as a short-term treatment, the study found.\n\nHowever, pills for sale may contain levels of melatonin much higher than what is advertised on the label. Unlike drugs and food, melatonin is not fully regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, so there are no federal requirements that companies test pills to ensure they contain the amount of advertised melatonin.\n\nPeople are using twice as much melatonin as they did a decade ago, sometimes at dangerously high levels. Shutterstock\n\n“Previous research has found that that melatonin content in these unregulated, commercially available melatonin supplements ranged from — 83% to +478% of the labeled content,” said Robbins, who coauthored the book “Sleep for Success! Everything You Must Know About Sleep But are Too Tired to Ask.”\n\nNor are there any requirements that companies test their products for harmful hidden additives in melatonin supplements sold in stores and online. Previous studies also found 26% of the melatonin supplements contained serotonin, “a hormone that can have harmful effects even at relatively low levels,” according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.\n\n“We cannot be certain of the purity of melatonin that is available over the counter,” Robbins said.\n\nTaking too much serotonin by combining medications such as antidepressants, migraine medications and melatonin can lead to a serious drug reaction. Mild symptoms include shivering and diarrhea, while a more severe reaction can lead to muscle rigidity, fever, seizures and even death if not treated.\n\nIs it bad to take melatonin every night?\n\nBecause it is purchased over the counter, experts say many people view melatonin as an herbal supplement or vitamin. In reality, melatonin is a hormone made by the pineal gland, located deep within the brain, and released into the bloodstream to regulate the body’s sleep cycles.\n\n“There is a view that if it’s natural, then it can’t hurt,” Robbins told CNN in an earlier interview on the impact of melatonin on children. “The truth is, we just really don’t know the implications of melatonin in the longer term, for adults or kids.”\n\nAnother reality: Studies have found that while using melatonin can be helpful in inducing sleep if used correctly — taking it at least two hours before bed — but the actual benefit is small.\n\n“When adults took melatonin, it decreased the amount of time it took them to fall asleep by four to eight minutes,” Dr. Cora Collette Breuner, a professor in the department of pediatrics at Seattle Children’s Hospital at the University of Washington, told CNN in 2021.\n\n“So for someone who takes hours to fall asleep, probably the better thing for them to do is turn off their screens, or get 20 to 40 minutes of exercise each day, or don’t drink any caffeinated products at all,” Breuner said.\n\n“These are all sleep hygiene tools that work, but people are very reticent to do them. They rather just take a pill, right?”\n\nTraining your brain to sleep\n\nThere are other proven sleep tips that work just as well, if not better than sleeping aids, experts say. The body begins secreting melatonin at dark. What do we do in our modern culture? Use artificial light to keep us awake, often long past the body’s normal bedtime.\n\nResearch has found that the body will slow or stop melatonin production if exposed to light, including the blue light from our smartphones, laptops and the like.\n\n“Any LED spectrum light source may further suppress melatonin levels,” said Dr. Vsevolod Polotsky, who directs sleep basic research in the division of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nSo ban those devices at least an hour before you want to fall asleep. Like to read yourself to sleep? That’s fine, experts say, just read in a dim light from a book or use an e-reader in night mode.\n\n“Digital light will suppress the circadian drive,” Polotsky said, while a “dim reading light will not.”\n\nOther tips include keeping your bedroom temperature at cooler temperatures — about 60 to 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 20 degrees Celsius). We sleep better if we’re a bit chilly, experts say.\n\nSet up a bedtime ritual by taking a warm bath or shower, reading a book or listening to soothing music. Or you can try deep breathing, yoga, meditation or light stretches. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, even on weekends or your days off, experts say. The body likes routine.\n\nIf your doctor does prescribe melatonin to help with jet lag or other minor sleep issues, keep the use “short term,” Robbins said.\n\nIf you are planning to use melatonin for a short-term sleep aid, try to purchase pharmaceutical grade melatonin, she advised.

That ingredient has recently been removed.\n\nFor years, claims have circulated on the internet that the lemon-lime soda Mountain Dew contains a dangerous additive called brominated vegetable oil that's also used as flame retardant.\n\nOne particular Facebook post from April 2017 by user Betsy Ball Clark has racked up more than 1.1 million shares over the past three years. The post continued to be widely read and circulated in May of this year.\n\n\"BVO is a toxic chemical that is banned in many countries because it competes with iodine for receptor sites in the body, which can lead to hypothyroidism, autoimmune disease and cancer,\" Clark's post states.\n\nA main ingredient of BVO, bromine, is a \"poisonous, corrosive chemical\" that has been linked to major organ damage, birth defects and other medical issues, the post says.\n\nClark's post quotes an online article — whose link in the Facebook post no longer works — that says there is \"flame retardant\" in Mountain Dew.\n\nBVO is a patented flame retardant for plastic and has been banned as a food additive in Europe and Japan. Soda binges have led to medical issues for some patients, the quote claims.\n\nClark updated her post this month, saying she had emailed PepsiCo Inc., which makes Mountain Dew, and received confirmation that the company has removed BVO as an ingredient for Mountain Dew.\n\nClark did not return a request for comment.\n\nWhat is brominated vegetable oil?\n\nBrominated vegetable oil has been used as a food additive since the 1930s to keep ingredients from separating in sodas and other beverages.\n\nRobert McGorrin, professor of food science and technology at Oregon State University, said BVO works as an emulsifier, particularly in beverages that use citrus oils, to keep the citrus oils from floating to the top of the drink.\n\n\"Instead of them kind of coalescing and ringing at the top — forming a film at the top of the soda — they're uniformly dispersed throughout,\" he said.\n\nBut the additive is banned in some countries due to concerns about possible health risks when it's ingested in large amounts.\n\nThe product originally carried the \"generally recognized as safe\" designation from the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S., but that designation was removed in the 1970s. The FDA's position since 1977 is that BVO can be used safely \"on an interim basis,\" provided it is used in amounts of under 15 parts per million.\n\nMcGorrin said most beverages that contain BVO use it in much smaller amounts, such as 8 parts per million.\n\nIn 2014, Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo announced that they would remove brominated vegetable oil from their soft drinks. The announcement came as public pressure to remove the additive mounted, partially due to a Change.org campaign begun in 2012 by Mississippi teenager Sarah Kavanagh. Her campaign started when she began asking PepsiCo to remove BVO from its Gatorade products.\n\nDespite the 2014 announcement by both companies, reports from as recently as last year showed the ingredient remained in Mountain Dew.\n\nBut that ingredient has recently been removed. Nutrition facts posted on PepsiCo's product information website no longer include brominated vegetable oil as an ingredient. PepsiCo did not respond to a request for comment on when and why it removed the ingredient from the soft drink.\n\nIs brominated vegetable oil really a flame retardant?\n\nFor years, BVO has drawn a comparison to brominated flame retardants, leading to claims like the one mentioned in the post that there is \"flame retardant\" in Mountain Dew.\n\nBut the reality is more nuanced, said Christopher Reddy, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has studied brominated flame retardants and other brominated compounds.\n\nBVO could be used — and has been patented as — a flame retardant, he said. But the fact that it's patented doesn't mean it's in common use, or related to the vast majority of other brominated flame retardants.\n\nThe common brominated flame retardants in use are different from the food additive, he said.\n\n\"To lump all brominated flame retardants as one single entity about how it may interact with humans and the environment is not accurate,\" he said.\n\nMcGorrin said the common brominated flame retardants in use have different chemical makeups than BVO. Equating the two would be like comparing Splenda, a sweetener, with bleach, since both contain the element chlorine.\n\n\"People (are) just hearing the word 'brominated' and thinking all the negative connotations the word bromine brings with it,\" he said.\n\nResponding to articles comparing BVO to flame retardants, the Bromine Science and Environmental Forum — an industry group that represents companies that produce brominated flame retardants — issued a statement that said its member companies \"have never marketed BVO as a flame retardant.\"\n\n\"Apart from the fact that both contain bromine, there is no direct connection between brominated vegetable oil and brominated flame retardants,\" the statement said.\n\nIs brominated vegetable oil safe?\n\nBrominated vegetable oil has been controversial for years, and questions have continued about the general safety of the additive.\n\nAmerican Beverage Association spokesperson Danielle Smotkin said in a statement that BVO is \"safe, permitted by the FDA, and when used is listed as an ingredient.\"\n\nBut some scientists have recommended more study of the ingredient over the past decade. An article from Environmental Health News that was published in Scientific American in 2011 said there have been some some cases of patients who needed medical attention for bromine-related symptoms such as memory loss and nerve disorders after drinking large amounts of soda — more than 2 liters a day — that contained BVO.\n\nWalter Vetter, a food chemist at Germany's University of Hohenheim who has studied brominated vegetable oil, told Environmental Health News that \"the scientific data is scarce\" surrounding BVO, and it merits further study.\n\nCharles Vorhees, a toxicologist at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center who studied BVO's effects more than 30 years ago, also told Environmental Health News that evaluations of chemicals has improved over the years, and he believes BVO should be reexamined.\n\nThe New York Times also reported in 2012 that some limited studies of BVO in humans and animals found bromine building up in tissues.\n\nReddy told USA TODAY that he believes there's still gray area in scientists' understanding of BVO.\n\n\"We know we drink it,\" he said. \"But I don't think it's fully understood about where it goes once it passes your teeth, how long it stays in your body and whether it breaks down in your body — whether it creates significant harm to the body or even chronic harm.\"\n\nHe said the stories mentioned in articles like the Scientific American are often from acute use, significant amounts drunk at once. But drinking smaller amounts over time could be different.\n\n\"I haven't seen the data that really works on those types of differences,\" he said.\n\nKatherine Zeratsky, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Mayo Clinic who has written about the use of brominated vegetable oil in beverages, agreed that she doesn't believe there's as much research on the buildup over time.\n\nShe said she believes it's unlikely that drinking soda in moderation, such as a can a day, would pose harmful effects. The worries come when a person drinks larger amounts.\n\n\"There's a concern that — with this additive, in particular, and many others — your body has to process it somehow,\" she said.\n\nZeratsky said she advises that people avoid drinking large amounts of beverages that contain BVO.\n\nOur ruling: Partly false\n\nThe Facebook post's claim that brominated vegetable oil is no longer in Mountain Dew is true. The use of brominated vegetable oil has declined over the years as major companies have removed the additive from their drinks in favor of other emulsifiers.\n\nBut experts agree that a sweeping comparison of the additive to flame retardant lacks nuance. It has been patented as one but is not the same as the brominated flame retardants in popular use.\n\nExperts also say it has also not been conclusively proven that drinking the amount of brominated vegetable oil found in soft drinks will lead to all of the negative health effects mentioned in the post. However, scientists agree more information is likely needed to broaden understanding of the ingredient's ability to build up in the human body over time, and that some people drinking large amounts of soda at once have experienced adverse effects.\n\nThat caution is reflected by the FDA's categorization of BVO as allowed in certain amounts on an \"interim\" basis, as well as the banning of the ingredient in some countries overseas.\n\nFor those reasons, we rate this post as PARTLY FALSE.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nIan Richardson covers the Iowa Statehouse for the Des Moines Register.

The vehicle was built in December 2021, falling outside the original or expanded recall dates.\n\nThe amended lawsuit says Rich never received a recall notice or warning from Ford, apparently because Ford has yet to expand the safety recall regarding the spontaneous fire defect to include 2021 models, like his, that were built in December of that year.\n\nAnd it still isn't covered by the expanded recall.\n\nVehicles in question were built between July 27, 2020, and Aug. 31, 2021. The original recall covered vehicles built between Dec. 1, 2020, and April 30, 2021.\n\nFortunately, a passerby saw the fire and called the local fire department, which extinguished the blaze before it spread to Rich’s home.

A CNN review of local hospitals shows that at least eight patients are still hospitalized in relation to the fire, while at least 25 people have been treated and released.\n\nNow, the building’s fire alarms and a series of open doors are on the radar of investigators and officials probing the second major deadly fire in a week in the Northeast.\n\nThe Bronx blaze was deemed the second most deadly US home fire in nearly 40 years by the National Fire Protection Association. The NFPA also reported that heating equipment is the second-leading cause of US home fires and the third-leading cause of home fire deaths and injuries.\n\n“This is a horrific, horrific, painful moment for the city of New York, and the impact of this fire is going to really bring a level of just pain and despair in our city,” Adams said Sunday.\n\nMany of those in the building were Muslim immigrants from the West African nation of The Gambia. The country’s ambassador told CNN the building had been a beloved home for many such immigrants over the years.\n\n“I think a lot of Gambians who came here, they stayed there before they moved anywhere else. This was kind of a first port of call, this building. It’s a building Gambians have a lot of attachment to,” said Ambassador Dawda Docka Fadera, who traveled from Washington to New York after learning of the fire.\n\nThe families in the apartment complex and neighborhood told CNN they were devastated. Some are still searching for loved ones, and all are desperate for answers.\n\n“I’m totally worried and devastated — not me alone, but the whole community and the family at large.

This (the space heater) was being used to supplement the building heat. There were smoke alarms throughout the building. The first call that came in was due to a neighbor hearing the smoke alarm and looking and seeing the smoke and calling,” he said.\n\nWhen residents left the fiery unit, the apartment door was left open, allowing the blaze to spread, Nigro said. The fire was contained to that hallway, but the smoke traveled upwards and took over much of the building. The doors were supposed to close automatically, but the apartment door as well as the door from the stairwell to the 15th floor were not functioning properly, Nigro said Monday.\n\n“The smoke spread throughout the building, thus, the tremendous loss of life and other people fighting for their lives right now in hospitals all over the Bronx,” he said. “So, we are investigating where everyone was found, how the smoke traveled, but certainly the marshals have determined through physical evidence and through firsthand accounts by the residents that this fire started in the bedroom, in a portable electric heater.”\n\nAbout 200 members of the FDNY responded to the fire at 333 East 181st Street, the agency said. Units arrived at the scene within three minutes of getting an emergency call, Nigro said. They “found victims on every floor in stairways,” he said, many of them in cardiac and respiratory arrest.\n\n“It was a very difficult job for our members. Their air tanks contained a certain amount of air – they ran out of air, many of our members – and they continued working to try to get as many people out as they could,” he said.\n\nResidents say they narrowly escaped smoke and flames\n\nEmergency personnel work Sunday at the scene of the fatal Bronx fire. Yuki Iwamura/AP\n\nDaisy Mitchell, a 10th-floor resident who had just moved in to the building, was one of those who fled to safety. She told CNN’s Brianna Keilar her husband first smelled smoke and noticed the fire.\n\n“The alarm was going off for a while so I didn’t pay it no mind,” she said. “Then, when he opened the door and I went out there, I passed out — it was devastating, it was like really scary.”\n\n“I went to the stairs, I opened the door, it just blew me back [to] the house,” she added. “If I’d stayed out there for another three seconds, I would have been gone too.”\n\nIt was common for fire alarms to go off in the building, 10th-floor resident Chanasia Hunter told CNN affiliate WABC.\n\n“So, when you don’t know that it’s a fire, like, you know, how would you supposed to know if it’s a fire or if it’s always going off?” said Hunter, adding she got a call from a resident on the third floor warning her of the fire, then a knock on her door telling her and her family to get out.\n\nKaren Dejesus lives on the same floor as the apartment that caught fire and said the flames encroached on her residence.\n\n“I can see the flames, I can see the smoke and everything, you know, coming into my apartment,” Dejesus said. “You’re being trapped somewhere. As you see, we have no fire escapes, obviously the building was not fireproof like we thought it was.”\n\nDejesus said firefighters broke down her door to rescue her, her granddaughter and her son. They had to climb out of a window to escape the flames.\n\nShe, too, noted fire alarms in the building often went off.\n\n“So many of us were used to hearing that fire alarm go off so it was like second nature to us,” she said. “Not until I actually seen the smoke coming in the door, I realized it was a real fire and I heard people yelling help, help, help.”\n\n“I thank God that me and my family are safe,” said Dejesus. “I’m sorry for all of my neighbors that didn’t make it, I’m sorry for my neighbors that are still in the hospital fighting for their life. This was crazy, this was so scary.”\n\nFire alarms and self-closing doors are focus of investigation\n\nInvestigators are examining potential issues with the fire alarms and with self-closing doors designed to contain fire and smoke.\n\nReports of smoke alarms frequently malfunctioning will be looked into, Nigro said, adding he couldn’t confirm them.\n\nThe building had no fire escapes, but “there are interior stairways,” he said. “So, the residents should know where the stairwells are, and I think some of them could not escape because of the volume of smoke.”\n\nMayor Adams, speaking to CNN’s Brianna Keilar, said fire marshals will investigate the self-closing doors in the building to see if there was a malfunction. New York passed a law in 2018 making self-closing doors a requirement in buildings with three or more apartments.\n\n“We have a law here in NYC that requires doors to close automatically,” he said. “We also want to double down on that PSA that I recall as a child… close the doors,” he said.\n\nThere have been no major building violations or complaints listed against the building, which contains 120 units, according to city building records. Past minor violations were rectified by the property, and no structural violations were listed.\n\nBuilt in 1972, the building was federally funded, so may have been built outside the New York City fire code, Nigro said, adding it was unlikely to have been a factor in Sunday’s blaze.\n\n“Certain federal buildings can be built under different standards. But to be perfectly clear, the fire itself – other than getting in the hall because the door was open – never extended anywhere else in the building, so that was not a factor.”\n\nAt a news conference Monday, New York firefighter union representatives confirmed the building was not required to adhere to city fire codes.\n\n“There was different fire protection in this building than we have in tenements and other high rises under the New York City code,” said Jim McCarthy, president of the FDNY Fire Officers Association. “So it exposed members to a more dangerous atmosphere.”\n\nLife-saving fire protection devises like sprinkler systems were oftentimes not a requirement in older buildings, McCarthy said.\n\nMany older buildings in the city have been retrofitted with sprinklers, McCarthy said. It doesn’t appear this building had a sprinkler system installed, according to Andrew Ansbro, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association.\n\nFor the victims, the city will work to ensure Islamic funeral and burial rites are respected and will seek Muslim leaders to connect with residents, said Adams, who took office only this month. The names of those who request government assistance will not be turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, he added.\n\nResidents of the apartment building were initially housed at a middle school next door, and longer-term shelter for them would be found, said Christina Farrell, first deputy commissioner of NYC emergency management.\n\nLow-income areas face higher fire risk, official says\n\nThe “tragic and terrifying” fire underscores the need for federal investment in affordable housing, said Congressman Ritchie Torres, who represents residents of the apartment building.\n\n“Many of these buildings are old. Not every apartment has a fire alarm. Most of these buildings have no sprinkler system. And so the risk of a fire is much higher in lower-income neighborhoods in the Bronx than it might be elsewhere in the city or in the country,” Torres told MSNBC.\n\n“When we allow our affordable housing developments to be plagued by decades of disinvestment, we are putting lives at risk. These buildings are wide open to catastrophic fires that can cost people their lives, including the lives of children.”\n\nThe Bronx has been the scene of other grave fires in recent decades – the most deadly in 1990, when 87 people died at the Happy Land social club. In 2007, 10 people – nine of them children – were killed in a fire at a residence after a space heater cord overheated.\n\nIn December 2017, 13 people died when a fire broke out at an apartment block. The fatal fire began when a 3-year-old played with burners on the stove and started a kitchen fire, officials said. When the boy’s mother fled the apartment with him and his 2-year-old sister, she left the door open.\n\nThe apartment’s stairway acted “like a chimney,” and the fire rapidly spread through the apartment building, Nigro said at the time. After that fire, the city passed the self-closing door law.", "authors": ["Susannah Cullinane Brynn Gingras Bonney Kapp Mirna Alsharif Amir Vera", "Susannah Cullinane", "Brynn Gingras", "Bonney Kapp", "Mirna Alsharif", "Amir Vera"], "publish_date": "2022/01/10"}]}

The Massachusetts doughnut and coffee chain is preparing to launch a collection of spiked iced coffee and iced tea drinks under the name Dunkin’ Spiked.\n\nVinePair first reported that Dunkin’ Spiked was added to the list of label approvals on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) database. Dunkin’ received label approval in May, but the launch date has yet to be announced.\n\nHere's what we know about Dunkin' Spiked\n\nThe hard coffees and teas will be available in variety packs, with four flavor options: Original Iced Coffee, Caramel Iced Coffee, Mocha Iced Coffee, and Vanilla Iced Coffee.\n\nThe spiked iced tea flavors include Dunkin’s Slightly Sweet Iced Tea, Half & Half Iced Tea, Strawberry Dragonfruit Iced Tea Refresher, and Mango Pineapple Iced Tea Refresher.\n\nThe spiked coffees will be slightly boozier than the teas at 6 percent ABV versus 5 percent ABV for the iced teas.\n\nThe international coffee chain is partnering with Boston-based brewery Harpoon Brewery to produce the malt-based alcoholic beverages.

Yet with all the studies coming out on how a cup of joe can reduce the risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, dementia and some cancers, what’s the harm?\n\nIt’s even trickled down to children.\n\nDespite years of warnings from pediatricians and other health professionals that coffee and other caffeinated beverages such as sodas and sports drinks can be harmful to youth, parents are allowing their little ones — even toddlers — to drink those beverages.\n\nA 2015 study of Boston moms found that 14% of those surveyed allowed their 2-year-olds to drink between 1 and 4 ounces of coffee a day (a half a cup of coffee is 4 ounces). The study also found that 2.5% of moms gave coffee to their 1-year-olds.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no caffeinated coffee, tea, soda, sports drinks or other products for children under 12, while adolescents between 12 and 18 should limit their intake to less than 100 milligrams per day — about the size of an old-fashioned cup of coffee. A 16-ounce “grande” of Starbucks popular Blonde Roast coffee contains 360 milligrams, while the same size of its Pike Place Roast is 310 milligrams.\n\nCoffee comes in all sorts of sizes, flavors and levels of caffeine. Adobe Stock\n\nIt’s not just coffee. A bottle of sports drink can contain nearly 250 milligrams of caffeine depending on the brand, according to a Consumer Reports investigation. A cup of tea can have up to 47 milligrams, while a diet soda can have 46.\n\nChocolate has some caffeine, too, with the amount rising as the chocolate darkens in color. A handful of chocolate-covered coffee beans can have 336 milligrams of caffeine, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nYou can even buy caffeine chewing gum, mints, gummy bears and energy bars — and let’s not forget coffee ice cream.\n\nWhat age can you drink coffee?\n\nBecause children are usually smaller in body size, it takes less caffeine to impair their functioning. An insignificant amount for an adult could be overwhelming for a small child. Too much caffeine can raise heart rates and blood pressure, contribute to acid reflux, and cause anxiety and sleep disturbances in children. In high doses, caffeine can be dangerous.\n\n“Kids show up in the emergency room with irregular heartbeat or what we call tachycardia or rapid heartbeat,” said pediatrician Dr. Mark Corkins. “Some people think it’s cool to give toddlers a soda pop.”\n\nThe limits are based mostly based on body size, and those limits increase when a child has grown large enough to metabolize caffeine more readily. However, if children are small for their age, or have migraines, heart problems or seizures, they may be even more sensitive, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n\nWith all this bad news, why are parents letting kids drink coffee?\n\nIt starts when small children begin to ask for caffeinated drinks such as coffee “because they see the parents and older siblings drinking it — it’s a ‘grown-up’ thing to drink,” said Corkins, division chief of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, via email.\n\nAnd because parents perceive it as harmless — and it likely is in tiny amounts — they will let their children take a sip or two, Corkins said. “However, once the parents start, it becomes a slippery slope and easier to let the kids drink what they want than fight with them.”\n\nCoffee toppings and add-ons can affect nutrition\n\nThere’s another issue: the impact of coffee, tea, soda and sports drinks on a balanced diet.\n\n“My other problem with kids drinking coffee is that it’s of little nutritional value, and it’s replacing something that should be nutritionally complete, such as milk and water,” Corkins said. “Milk is packed with calcium and vitamin D, and water is a nutrient. We’re like 60% water, basically an ocean.”\n\nThen there are the add-ons. Gone are the days when coffee simply came with a lump of sugar and cream. Coffee shops on nearly every corner now offer dozens of ways to spice and fatten up your drink of choice.\n\n“These drinks are basically a dessert,” Corkins said. “They have the foam and the shots of flavored syrups, with whipped topping and then the sprinkles on top. Presentation is better than some of the desserts I’ve seen.”\n\nExtra sugars and heavy creams add fat and calories, while sugar-free versions can expose a children to artificial sweeteners.\n\nWhat’s the bottom line? “Avoid caffeine! Why do your kids need it?” Corkins said.\n\n“Caffeine is a stimulant that increases alertness. If your child feels like he or she needs caffeine to get through the day, it would be better to work with a pediatrician to identify the root cause of what is creating the fatigue in the first place.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/03/20/starbucks-coffee-shop-alcoholic-beverages-wine-beer/6658379/", "title": "Starbucks serving alcohol at more locations", "text": "Bruce Horovitz\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nDon't be surprised if you soon get carded at your neighborhood Starbucks.\n\nLike others in the ultra-competitive restaurant world, the coffee giant plans to expand the number of domestic locations that sell alcoholic beverages.\n\nWhat began with a single Seattle Starbucks location selling beer and wine in 2010, has slowly but methodically evolved into 26 locations. That's about to go into hyperdrive. Within the next several years, the alcoholic beverage platform will expand to thousands of locations, spokeswoman Lisa Passé says.\n\n\"The concept is a natural progression for Starbucks as we seek to create a new occasion for customers to gather, relax and connect with each other in the evenings,\" Passé says.\n\nStarbucks once again finds itself at the leading edge of an industry trend on the grow. Not only are sales of alcoholic beverages lucrative, but they attract night-time customers, when business typically slows down. The risk is turning off customers who don't want to be part of that environment. The chain has seen little blowback in its slow expansion of beer and wine sales, which will reach 40 locations by the end of this year.\n\nSome unlikely restaurants have increasingly embraced sales of alcoholic beverages in recent years. Applebee's has heavily marketed its alcoholic beverage sales. Red Robin earned some recent social-media buzz when it began to roll out wine shakes — a few years after rolling out beer shakes. Burger King gave it a go, when it began selling beer and burgers four years ago at its new concept, the Whopper Bar in Miami Beach's tourist-heavy South Beach. Three years ago, Sonic began to sell beer at a couple of its Florida locations.\n\nAmong other things, wine and beer sales can substantially boost the average ticket at Starbucks. At Wednesday's annual shareholders meeting, CEO Howard Schultz noted that the typical Starbucks customer spends about $5 per visit. A glass of beer or wine can instantly double that figure. \"We are in the early stages of our growth and development,\" Schultz said. \"If we're a 20-chapter book, we are only in chapter four or five.\"\n\nOne of those chapters could be the careful evolution from coffee to alcohol. There are no plans for alcoholic beverages beyond wine and beer, Passé says, nor are there plans to expand the program outside the USA.\n\nShe says the menus at these locations typically offer shareable, warm small plates and desserts. The same stores typically sell artisan flatbreads, truffle mac n' cheese, bacon-wrapped dates, salted caramel and cheesecake brownies.\n\nEven then, coffee rules. \"In the true spirit of a traditional coffeehouse, while some stores may serve wine and beer,\" Passé says, \"coffee will remain the focus of the experience.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/03/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2023/03/15/st-patricks-day-2023-deals/11467843002/", "title": "Happy St. Patrick's Day: Get your leprechaun on with these deals ...", "text": "You're in luck if you're looking for food deals this St. Patrick's Day.\n\nTo celebrate the Irish holiday Friday, many restaurants are offering specials and turning treats green, from Krispy Kreme doughnuts to McDonald's Shamrock Shake and Oreo Shamrock McFlurry.\n\nAccording to a survey by Numerator, 44% of U.S. consumers plan to celebrate St. Patrick's Day, with about 36% of celebrators saying they plan to buy alcoholic beverages during the holiday.\n\nSt. Patrick's Day is celebrated annually on March 17.

Make the authentic Mexican drink for the holidays ...", "text": "You may have ordered horchata at your local Starbucks, but have you ever tried an authentic version of the beverage?\n\nStarbucks’ \"Horchata Almondmilk Frappuccino\" is made from cinnamon dolce, caramel and coffee flavored syrups along with almond milk and whipped cream, but true horchata is quite different.\n\nHorchata has enjoyed a rising presence in U.S.-based restaurants, its appearance on menus growing 24% over the past four years, market research firm Datassential found. Horchata flavored ice cream was even one of the top trending flavors of 2019.\n\nLearn about the beverage’s origins and how to make an authentic Mexican version below.\n\nWhat is sake?:Learn about the Japanese alcoholic beverage and how it's made\n\nWhat is horchata?\n\nHorchata is a sweet, plant-based drink typically served over ice. Nowadays you can find it at chain coffee stores or even in the form of a protein shake, but the authentic version of the drink we know in the U.S. comes from Mexico. The Mexican version is rice-based, but Horchata de coco — made using coconut milk — is also a popular choice.\n\nHorchata was originally popularized in Spain, known as horchata de chufa and made of dried tiger nuts, water and sugar. But the drink originated in modern-day Nigeria and Mali (called kunnu aya) as early as 2400 B.C., LATV reports. The Moors brought the drink to Spain during the Muslim conquest and horchata de chufa became widely known.\n\nWith cross-continental roots, LATV calls it a “tribute and acknowledgment to the resilience of Afro-Latino culture.”\n\nAs horchata traveled, the exact recipe changed and became reminiscent of the region it was made in. Traditional Mexican horchata is made from rice while Oaxacan horchata, also from Mexico, is often served with chopped walnuts, melon and pear ice cream as a dessert. Venezuelan chicha is similar to horchata in that it’s made from soaked rice and has a thick, creamy consistency, Remezcla reports. There’s also Salvadoran horchata which is made with rice, peanuts and morro, sesame and pumpkin seeds. Nicaraguan horchata is made similarly using morro (or jicaro) seeds. Puerto Rican horchata de ajonjolí is made with sesame seeds, and Ecuadorian horchata is made as an herbal tea.\n\nTop DoorDash orders on Thanksgiving:Where horchata falls in the lineup\n\nWhat does horchata taste like?\n\nHorchata is a thick, creamy consistency and has a sweet, cinnamon taste similar to rice pudding. Different types of horchata may vary in flavor, especially depending on if they are made with rice or nuts.\n\nHow do you make horchata\n\nAccording to My Latina Table, you can make authentic Mexican horchata using rice, sugar, almonds, evaporated milk, milk, water, vanilla extract and cinnamon sticks. You’ll also need a fine mesh strainer and blender along with large bowls to soak the ingredients.\n\nSoak rice, cinnamon and almonds in a bowl of water for at least five hours, preferably overnight. Strain and dispose of the water from the mixture Blend the mixture with evaporated milk until a smooth mix is formed. Strain the liquid into a pitcher and add vanilla, sugar and milk, stirring until well combined. Add a liter of water and serve over ice.\n\nYou can also try different types of horchata, like this recipe for Puerto Rican horchata de ajonjolí or Oaxacan horchata.\n\nHow to make holiday horchata\n\nHorchata also makes an appearance around the holidays with a cinnamon variation of the drink. Because it can be served warm, there are plenty of holiday or Christmas horchata recipes to try in the cold, festive months of the year. Disney even makes its own holiday horchata at the Festival of Holidays at Disneyland in California.

Some customers aren’t happy because several specialty drinks cost a lot more points.\n\nThe new system comes with a number of changes. Members will receive 10 points for every $1 spent, up from 5 points for every $1 in the old program. And they can start redeeming rewards after 150 points instead of 200 and use those points toward food for the first time. Plus members who visit a Dunkin’ at least 12 times within a calendar month can unlock more points and have access to new benefits for three months.\n\nBut another big change is causing a backlash: Under the new system, members need 700 points to get a free cold brew, cold brew with cold foam, Dunkin’ refresher or hot or iced espresso drink, and 900 points for a frozen drink or hot or iced signature latte. With DD Perks, members were able to get a free drink, without those limitations, for just 200 points.\n\n“We consistently heard members ask for three things: flexibility, variety, and recognition,” said Scott Murphy, Dunkin’ president. “We’re excited to deliver this to them through the new program.”\n\nMurphy added that Dunkin’ hopes to attract loyal customers who weren’t part of DD Perks with the new program, “while introducing new and expansive ways to continue to thank our longstanding loyalty members.” The new program should help improve customer experience overall, he said.\n\nDunkin' is making changes to its rewards program. Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDunkin’ ran a limited pilot of the program this summer. Now, Dunkin’ Rewards is replacing DD Perks entirely — those with DD Perks memberships will become Rewards members automatically. It will start rolling out the new program Thursday. Dunkin’ unveiled changes on its website, and Insider shared details of the program earlier this week.\n\nAlready, some are expressing dismay about the new program, especially because of the amount of points required to earn free drinks.\n\n“Please keep DD Perks — it’s a million times better,” one person wrote on Twitter, adding “why do you have to try and fix things that aren’t broken???” Another said “I hate the new dunkin rewards,” adding a cry face emoji.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Murphy noted that “change is always going to be an adjustment.” But, he said “in the long run, Dunkin’ loyalists will benefit even more,” because of the added flexibility. He also said that with special perks for the most loyal members and other targeted offers, “members will get many of our coffee beverages at a better value than with DD Perks.”\n\nRewards programs are an important way for companies to learn more about their customers’ preferences and promote loyalty in a competitive sector. Recently, many chains have been making tweaks to their programs or launching new ones.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) said during its September investor day that it is planning improvements to its loyalty program, including showing real-time order updates in the app. The coffee chain also teased a joint rewards program with other companies such as retailers and airlines.

For the latest news and updates on the Maui fire, please see our live updates file for Tuesday, Aug. 15.\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii − The death toll from the Lahaina fire could double or even triple from the current total of 99, according to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, adding to what is already the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century.\n\nIn a recorded interview with “CBS Mornings” that aired Monday, Green indicated the number of fatalities is likely to increase considerably. Green later confirmed 99 deaths at a news conference Monday.\n\n“We are prepared for many tragic stories,” Green told CBS. “They will find 10 to 20 people per day, probably, until they finish. And it’s probably going to take 10 days. It’s impossible to guess, really.”\n\nHis estimate of 10 to 20 bodies found daily over a 10-day stretch would put the death count at around 200 to 300.\n\nIn a video posted on social media late Sunday, Green said more than 2,700 structures were destroyed in Lahaina and an estimated value of $5.6 billion \"has gone away.\" The Lahaina fire was one of multiple blazes that began burning Tuesday on Maui.\n\nGreen said the \"fire hurricane,\" which he said was new in the age of global warming, was the \"ultimate reason\" the death toll has been so high.”\n\nStarting Tuesday, authorities will begin releasing the names of those who died amid the blaze, Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier said at the news conference. Names of people will not be released until their families have been notified.\n\nMaui rescue teams search ruins'full of our loved ones'; Hawaii churches offer prayers for dead, missing: Updates\n\nDevelopments:\n\n◾Green said Federal Emergency Management Agency has 416 people working in Hawaii, including Administrator Deanne Criswell. The agency has provided dozens of searchers and 20 dogs to aid the search for human remains in Lahaina, the governor said.\n\n◾The total of missing people in Maui has dwindled from more than 2,000 to about 1,300 as cellphone service has slowly been restored, according to Green.\n\n◾Green said Monday that nearly 2,000 housing units have been secured, including 402 hotel rooms, 1,400 units from Airbnb starting Tuesday, and that 160 residents have opened up their own homes to families in need.\n\n◾The Upcountry/Kula fire that sprawled about 678 acres was 60% contained, Maui officials said in a statement late Sunday. Maui County said the fire destroyed at least 19 homes. The Lahaina fire, estimated to stretch across 2,170 acres, is 85% contained, according to officials.\n\n◾As of Monday, Pelletier said 25% of the area affected by the fire has been searched. He said the aim is to search 85 to 90% of the area by the weekend. Search efforts started with one dog, he said, and there are now 20.\n\n'It's heartbreaking':Without food and fuel, Maui locals lean on neighbors to survive\n\nFire thought to be extinguished likely cause of tragedy, governor says\n\nIn his Sunday night video, Green pointed to a blaze that authorities “deemed to be out” and roared to back to life as the likely source of the inferno that wiped away historic Lahaina, although the cause is still under investigation.\n\n\"It must have not been completely extinguished,\" Green said, adding flames were then fanned by winds of up to 81 mph. “With those kinds of winds and 1,000-degree temperatures, ultimately all the pictures that you will see will be easy to understand.\"\n\nGreen said a comprehensive review will be conducted in the wake of frustrations that sirens and other warnings did not reach or alert residents to the fires. Because the fire was moving so fast, up to a mile a minute, Green said “it’s unlikely that much could have been done except, of course, moving people out before, and that’s what we’ll talk about.”\n\nFEMA seeking housing options for short and long term\n\nAs search crews make their way through what Criswell called “extremely hazardous’’ conditions from the Lahaina fire, the agency is also grappling with finding accommodations for displaced survivors in a state with a longstanding housing shortage that has been exacerbated by the disaster.\n\nIn addition to paying for lodging at specified hotels and motels for a certain amount of time, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is working with Green on a plan to help provide survivors housing options beyond their immediate needs, Criswell said Monday at a news briefing from Hawaii.\n\n“Whether that means longer term we bring in tiny houses or our transitional housing units to help him create the communities that he wants,’’ she said. “We're not taking anything off the table and we're going to be very creative in how we use our authorities to help build these communities and help people find a place to stay for the longer term.’’\n\nCriswell declined to estimate how long the search-and-recovery mission might last, citing the difficulty of an operation that requires for engineers to assess the stability of structures before cadaver-sniffing dogs and crews can go in.\n\n“The dogs can only work so long because of how hot the temperatures are,’’ she said. “There's also hot spots, and so we have fire crews that are helping to cool down the areas so the dogs can go in there. I’d hate to give an exact estimate because we want to make sure that we are precise and methodical and respectful as we go through this.’’\n\nUpcoming rain presents its own hardship\n\nIn Lahaina, where donations are pouring in to help some of those most impacted by the wildfires, volunteers and residents are scrambling to protect their resources and homes before the expected arrival of rain Monday night. Tropical Storm Greg will pass hundreds of miles to the south Thursday and Friday and is expected to have \"no direct impacts in the state,'' according to the National Hurricane Center, but the forecast calls for showers and breezy conditions in west Maui most of the week.Last week, winds gusts caused in part by passing Hurricane Dora helped fuel the flames in Maui. The upcoming rain may help tamp them down but still presents some hardships.Before the fires ignited on Maui, Andrea Fausett, 29, was the creator of a women’s fitness app who organized trail races for women. Now, she’s become the de facto distribution coordinator, responsible for doling out medical supplies, food and anything else that gets flown into the Kapalua West Maui Airport.As a helicopter whirred in the background Sunday, she said her focus has turned to the incoming storm.“So now one of our biggest issues that we're working to solve today before it becomes an issue is how to protect all of our supplies that are sitting out in the open right now,” she said. “And so that's like our next hurdle. I feel like every day it changes.”Father and son Nelson and Wilson Simpliciano worked Sunday to quickly repair their roof, which was damaged by the strong winds last week. The wind already appeared to be picking up, and the elder Simpliciano said he’s worried rain could cause a leak. He wanted to get a tarp down to cover the exposed wood before he leaves the island.“It’s just gonna get worse,” Simpliciano said.\n\nResidents find government efforts lacking, seek to help each other\n\nMaui residents are banding together to help each other through the tragedy, trying to provide food, fuel and other resources to those in the worst-hit areas, including the hundreds of people who lost their homes.\n\nThey're finding the task complicated by law enforcement road closures and slow communication from a government some accuse of failing to adequately warn them about the fires, which has prompted the locals to create their own aid systems to provide shelter and other necessities.\n\n\"Right now, this is not my home,\" said Archie Kalepa, who has been directing dozens of volunteers. \"This is our community's home.\"\n\nThat community has been devastated by the Lahaina fire, and questions linger about why emergency alert systems failed to notify enough people about the wildfire sweeping through and direct them away from danger. There are also questions about whether the area had the resources to help people, including enough firefighters.\n\n\"There probably should have been a more aggressive activation at the onset, more preparation,\" Hawaii state Sen. Angus McKelvey said. \"We heard about the red flag warning as brush fires were definitely a concern initially, not this cataclysmic totality that overwhelmed the community.\"\n\n− N'dea Yancey-Bragg and Terry Collins\n\nSurvivors' lives in turmoil as they mourn dead\n\nMalia Waring's house wasn’t destroyed when the nation’s deadliest wildfire in a century ripped through Maui last week. But her family is gone and she can’t bear to sit at home thinking about them. Ever since her cousin came to tell her that four members of their family, including her 8-year-old nephew, burned to death in their car while trying to escape the blaze, Waring, 65, has been spending time with friends at Napili Park, which has become one of several crowdsourced aid depots in the beloved, nearly destroyed area of Lahaina.\n\n“I'm very, very emotional if I talk, I don’t know, I will cry,\" she said Sunday.\n\nWaring is one of many locals grappling with major loss. And as the community works to provide for people's immediate physical needs, mental health professionals are preparing to meet the longer-term needs of a town that has barely had time to comprehend and grieve the loss of loved ones, homes, businesses and centuries-old cultural sites.

Read more here.\n\n− Naledi Ushe\n\nLawsuit claims power companies caused wildfires\n\nAuthorities have not determined the cause of the Lahaina fire, but a class-action lawsuit on behalf of victims and survivors blames Hawaiian Electric. The suit, filed by LippSmith LLP and other law firms, claims downed power lines owned by Maui Electric, Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and their parent company, Hawaiian Electric Industries, caused the fire.\n\nThe lawsuit, obtained by USA TODAY, also claims the utility companies \"inexcusably kept their power lines energized during forecasted high fire danger conditions,\" ultimately causing \"loss of life, serious injuries, destruction of hundreds of homes and businesses, displacement of thousands of people, and damage to many of Hawaii’s historic and cultural sites.\"\n\nHawaiian Electric spokesman Jim Kelly stressed in an email that no cause had been determined and that the company will cooperate with authorities investigating the blaze. \"Our immediate focus is on supporting emergency response efforts on Maui and restoring power for our customers and communities as quickly as possible,\" Kelly said.\n\nSome fire hydrants reportedly ran dry as blaze grew\n\nSome firefighters battling to halt the spread of the Lahaina fire found fire hydrants began to run dry, the New York Times reported. As the fire grew, water pressure faded and some hydrants became \"largely useless,\" the Times reported.\n\n“There was just no water in the hydrants,” firefighter Keahi Ho told the Times.\n\nThe Maui Department of Water Supply did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY. John Stufflebean, head of the agency, warned people in Lahaina not to drink water even after boiling it until further notice because hundreds of pipes have been damaged by the wildfires.\n\nFirefighters also struggled with high winds, fueled by Hurricane Dora spinning offshore, that spread the fire quickly and limited aerial assaults on the blaze.\n\nDonations needed after Maui fire\n\nKako‘o Maui Match Donation Fund: Last week the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement helped start the fund and quickly reached its $1.5 million goal.

Officials said earlier that 271 structures were damaged or destroyed and dozens of people injured.\n\nEntire blocks of homes and businesses went up in smoke in historic Lahaina Town in Maui, where blazes fueled by wind from a passing hurricane were concentrated. In addition, three wildfires were burning on the Big Island, though two of them were at least 60% contained.\n\nActing Gov. Sylvia Luke said residents had been preparing for Hurricane Dora, which skirted south of the islands, and had no reason to expect the quickly developing blazes.\n\n“We expect rain, sometimes we expect floods,'' she said. \"We never anticipated in this date that a hurricane which did not make impact on our islands would cause these type of wildfires.''\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement he has ordered “all available Federal assets” to help combat the wildfires, including Black Hawk helicopters provided by the Marines.\n\nCounty of Maui spokesperson Mahina Martin told USA TODAY the fires are affecting two areas of the island: Lahaina, a residential and tourist area with a commercial district in West Maui, and Kula, a residential area in the inland, mountainous upcountry region.\n\nOfficials said 2,000 travelers sheltered at Maui's Kahului Airport, and another 4,000 visitors wanted to leave the island. The Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu was being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 people displaced by the wildfires.\n\nLocals and visitors scrambled to get information and reach loved ones amid power blackouts and downed cellular and 911 service as well as phone lines in different parts of the islands.\n\nTiare Lawrence, who grew up in Lahaina, was trying to get in touch with her siblings while providing refuge at her home for 14 cousins and uncles who fled the heat, smoke and flames in Lahaina.\n\n“It was apocalyptic from what they explained,” she said.\n\nMaui county officials said multiple structures have burned and multiple evacuation orders are in place as emergency crews battle brush and structure fires. \"It's been an unprecedented incident striking large areas of our island, and it has been pretty much all hands on deck,\" Martin said.\n\nTourists turning around and leaving right after arriving\n\nThe sky over west Maui is hazy with smoke from the devastating wildfires still burning on the island, which continue to displace thousands.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, traffic was at a complete standstill on Honoapiilani Highway, the main road to access Lahaina, as it remains closed. Cars packed with people are parked along the side of the road waiting to return to their hotels or homes, but no time or date has been given yet.\n\nOn Tuesday night, more than 4,000 people − including residents and tourists from two hotels − evacuated to emergency shelters set up by the American Red Cross. On Wednesday, the organization said it was flying in additional volunteers and staff from the mainland to assist with the aftermath of the fires and get people safely to Oahu.Tourists arriving at Kahului Airport are turning around and trying to leave Maui. Alexis and Hector Palomar had their trip planned since May and landed on Wednesday morning.\n\n“We didn’t realize it was happening until we were on our way to the airport. We didn’t think it was that bad until we got here,” Hector Palomar said.\n\nThey immediately changed plans and booked a flight to Kauai, departing just three hours after they arrived on Maui.“Thankfully we’re able to get out,” he said. “I just don’t want to take resources from the locals since it’s an island.”\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\n'Everything is gone': Resident feels lucky, mournful after Lahaina escape\n\nLahaina resident Jordan Saribay knew how fortunate he and his family were to escape the flames around them alive, having merely lost items that could be replaced.\n\nSaribay had seen homes burst into flames “as tall as the buildings because they were engulfing them,’’ debris turn into dangerous projectiles as people whose cars had run out of gas trying to flee while carrying their prized possessions.\n\n“Everything is gone, every single one of our family homes,’’ Saribay said. “The entire Lahaina Town and the entire subdivision of Lahaina – gone.’’\n\nAnd much faster than anyone could have imagined. In a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated a town center that traced its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGetting out of the danger zone made for a surreal journey of trying to find an unclogged escape route amid blistering heat that caused another car to explode, injuring a woman inside it.\n\n“While driving through the neighborhood, it looked like a war zone,’’ Saribay said. “Houses throughout that neighborhood were already on fire. I’m driving through the thickest black smoke, and I don’t know what’s on the other side or what’s in front of me.’’\n\nWhen he made it out, Saribay felt a pang of emotion seeing Lahaina on his rear-view mirror, wondering what would be left to go back to. “Just praying that a miracle happens,’’ he said.\n\n− Ashley Lewis\n\nGovernor has contacted White House, says 'loss of life is expected'\n\nGov. Josh Green said in a statement Wednesday that he expects to request a Presidential Disaster Declaration from the White House in the next 36 to 48 hours once officials have a better understanding of the scope of the damage.\n\nGreen was planning to be out of state for personal travel until next week but is expected to return Wednesday night to address the crisis. He said while the \"heroic efforts\" of first responders have prevented many causalities, \"some loss of life is expected.\"\n\n“Our state appreciates the incredible outpouring of concern and prayers from the mainland. We won’t forget the aloha you have already begun to share with us,” Green said.\n\nLifelong Maui resident had 'never seen anything like this'\n\nKyle Ellison, born and raised in Maui, returned to his Kula home Wednesday morning and started stomping out flames on the property.\n\nThe previous morning, he heard trees fall down into the gulch behind his house and, when a popping sound went off, he figured it was coming from an electrical transformer.\n\n\"A minute later, I ask my wife if the internet is out and if she can smell smoke.\" Ellison said. \"I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this. I have friends in Lahaina who have lost everything.\"\n\nEllison and his family made it out with one truck full of belongings. Their house is still standing but their neighbors' is not. His wife and children went to the houses of three different friends to stay the night but kept having to move as evacuations spread.\n\n\"I think there are going to be a lot of people hurting,'' he said. \"We already have a housing crisis out here and we lost so many more homes.''\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\nHawaii National Guard activated\n\nLuke and Bissen have issued emergency proclamations in response to the fire. The Hawaii National Guard has been activated and is assisting the Maui Police Department at traffic control points, according to the Hawaii adjutant general.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Hurricane Dora, which was passing 500 miles south of the island chain, and a very strong high pressure north of the state produced powerful, damaging winds through the overnight hours.\n\n\"Very dry fuels combined with strong and gusty easterly winds and low humidities will produce critical fire weather conditions through the afternoon hours,\" the weather service said in a red flag warning for leeward areas issued Wednesday.\n\n'Chaos' trying to find shelter as people left with few possessions\n\nPeople in Lahaina described frantically trying to get to relative safety in one of the nearby emergency shelters. But they weren’t told by anyone where to go – just that they had to leave.\n\nThroughout the night, people were driving aimlessly and following other cars, just trying to head north, as police and firefighters dealt with growing flames.\n\nThe War Memorial Gymnasium in Wailuku opened to evacuees this morning. There is no capacity limit to how many people can stay there. The community has set up cots and are giving away clothing, food and pillows to evacuees. A medical team is checking for burns and smoke inhalation, and to aid anyone with existing conditions without access to medication.\n\nMauro Farinelli and his wife Judit arrived at the shelter around noon. They have lived right on Front Street in Lahaina for four years and described their evacuation as “chaos.”\n\n“No one told us we had to leave, it was getting bad and we had to leave with the clothes on our back,” he said. The couple went to the boat ramp where they were told they could jump into the ocean “if things got bad.” Farinelli said he can’t return home until the electric wires are assessed in Lahaina.\n\n“Nobody thinks it can happen to them,” he said. “Where I lived, it was like there’s no way a fire can get here because I’m not close to vegetation but the wind was so strong, it was like a blow torch.\"\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\n'We just lost a large part of our heritage,' official says\n\nWhile it’s still difficult to assess the damage, state Sen. Gilbert Keith-Agaran cited various landmarks that have reportedly been lost – historic businesses and buildings, temples and cemeteries where royal figures were buried.\n\n“It’s a real loss. Hawaii and Maui have tried really hard to preserve and protect those places for many, many years … not for the sake of tourism but because it’s part of our cultural heritage,” said Keith-Agaran, whose district includes Kahului in central Maui. Lahaina, where the largest fires are concentrated, was once the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom.\n\n“We just lost a large part of our heritage,” he said.\n\nBrush and wildfires are not unheard of in Hawaii’s leeward regions during the dry season. In 2018, Maui suffered a massive brush fire on the same side of the island, primarily on the slopes. “This is so much worse,” Keith-Agaran said, pointing to the scope of the current blaze.\n\n“No matter how much you prepare, you’re not going to be ready for something that moves as quickly and as big as this,” he said. “I don’t think we had enough equipment or people to be fighting fires upcountry, small fires in central Maui and then this huge fire on the west side.”\n\n− Alia Wong\n\nBurn victims sent to other islands\n\nSix patients were flown from Maui to the island of Oahu on Tuesday night, said Speedy Bailey, regional director for the air-ambulance company Hawaii Life Flight. Three of them had critical burns and were taken to Straub Medical Center’s burn unit in Honolulu, he said. The others were taken to other Honolulu hospitals. At least 20 patients were taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center, said Bailey, who was not aware of any deaths.\n\nLuke told CNN Maui's hospitals are overwhelmed with burn patients and people suffering from smoke inhalation and it's been difficult to transport people needing care to other facilities.\n\n“We are already in communication with other hospital systems about relieving the burden – the reality is that we need to fly people out of Maui to give them burn support because Maui hospital cannot do extensive burn treatment,” Luke said. “In addition to dealing with disaster, we're dealing with major transportation issues as well.”\n\nResident of nearby island searching for family in Maui\n\nLeomana Turalde's mother called him on the phone crying Wednesday morning, saying she never went to sleep on Tuesday night in Maui amid the massive fires.\n\nTuralde said he has several “aunties” who live on Maui, two blocks away from Lahaina’s popular Front Street. Wednesday morning, one of the women went missing, he told USA TODAY. It is impossible to get in touch with some people because cellphone infrastructure on Maui burned down, he said.\n\n“Lahaina Town is now burnt down to ashes,'' said Turalde, 36, who runs a sunscreen company. \"Most of the families on Maui, if you never made contact with your family before sunset last night, you’re still trying to figure out where they are.”\n\nHe said he is boarding a plane on Wednesday to Maui from where he lives on the island of Hawaii to help family members search for missing relatives near their homestead property, which he said burned down.\n\n“I’m going to go to the first place that everybody would go to when they’re in trouble, and that’s the house, even though the house isn’t there,” he said. “Home is usually the first place you should start if people are missing.”\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nAll roads to historic Lahaina closed as Front Street burns\n\nAll roads into Lahaina, a town of roughly 13,000, and West Maui have been closed to public use, except for emergency services, county officials said Wednesday. Photos shared by the county overnight showed a line of flames blazing across an intersection in Lahaina and flames leaping above buildings in the town, whose historic district is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\"Do NOT go to Lahaina town,\" officials warned.\n\nGreen said much of the area \"has been destroyed and hundreds of local families have been displaced.\"\n\nFront Street business owner Alan Dickar told CBS News buildings on both sides of the street in the popular tourist area were engulfed in flames. Dickar said it appeared the fire department was overwhelmed.\n\n\"Maui can't handle this,\" Dickar said. \"A lot of people just lost their jobs because a lot of businesses burned. A lot of people lost their homes. ... This is going to be devastating for Maui.\"\n\nLahaina’s historic Waiola Church and the neighboring Lahaina Hongwanji Mission temple were among the structures that caught fire Wednesday, the Maui News reported. The church was established in 1823, and its graveyard, believed to be the first Christian cemetery in Hawaii, is the final resting place for early members of the royal family of the Kingdom of Hawaii, according to its website.\n\nUncertainty for many residents\n\nBeatrice Hoopai drove for hours in the middle of the night trying to find shelter before ending up at the Warm Memorial Gymnasium. She, her husband, disabled son and two infants were living at Ka Hale A Ke Ola (KHAKO), which is low-income housing, in Lahaina waiting to be told to evacuate as the fires were approaching. A friend told Hoopai a nearby transformer caught on fire and to leave as soon as possible.\n\n“We packed up what we could and left,” she said. “KHAKO didn’t turn on their evacuation, we didn’t know we was going to be evacuated. Nobody told us nothing.”\n\nThe family got in Hoopai’s car and started driving but kept going around in circles as roads were closed. Branches were catching on fire and tin roofs blew past the car, she said. “You could see black smoke, the flames, everything was falling down,” she said. “If you looked back in the mirror, everything was burning.” The ocean was black and eerie.\n\nHoopai has lived on Maui for her entire life and just moved to Lahaina in May. “This is the first time I’ve ever seen anything like this.” Tourists, she said, can lose their luggage but still return back to their homes. But local residents lose their homes.\n\nShe’s worried about what’s next now that the shelter is gone but she’s thankful for her family’s safety.\n\n“You can lose everything but you cannot replace a life,\" she said.\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\nMaui fires map\n\nTrack the latest wildfire and red flag warnings here with data that is updated based on input from several incident and intelligence sources.\n\nNearly 2,000 people stuck at Maui airport\n\nMartin said the Kahului Airport in Maui has more than 2,000 visitors who have either canceled flights or had nowhere to go. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said Wednesday that about 1,800 people sheltered in place overnight in the airport with many highways on the island's west site still closed.\n\n\"HDOT worked with airlines/TSA to shelter passengers for safety's sake as wildfires continue to burn in Lahaina and upcountry,\" officials said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNearly 100 firefighters have been on duty, including 11 from state airport rescue personnel, county officials said.\n\nTen public schools in Maui were closed Wednesday, including one that is being used as an evacuation shelter, according to the Hawaii Department of Education.\n\nStudent boarders at Lahainaluna High School were moved Tuesday evening to Maui High School, which was being used as a shelter for evacuees to be picked up by family members or emergency contacts, officials said. The Lahainaluna campus remained closed Wednesday because of a lack of power, wind damage and brush fire evacuations.\n\nAs the brush fire spread to Kihei, officials announced Tuesday that four public schools in South Maui would be closed in addition to schools in West, Upcountry and Central Maui.\n\nHomes destroyed; residents evacuated\n\nThe Coast Guard has been responding to areas where residents are \"entering the ocean due to smoke and fire conditions,\" county officials said. A Coast Guard boat rescued 12 people from the waters off Lahaina, officials said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nLawrence told Hawaii News Now people were running for their lives. She said the homes of everyone she knows in Lahaina have been down.\n\n“It’s just so hard. I’m currently Upcountry and just knowing I can’t get a hold of any of my family members. I still don’t know where my little brother is. I don’t know where my stepdad is,” she said.\n\nIn Kula, at least two homes were destroyed in a fire that engulfed about 1,100 acres, Bissen told The Associated Press. About 80 people were evacuated from 40 homes, he said.\n\nThe Red Cross has opened several emergency shelters for residents. Martin said one evacuation center alone had more than 1,200 people.\n\n\"I am absolutely certain they are very anxious at our evacuation centers,\" she said.\n\nLocal resident could tell something was brewing\n\nAlice Carillo lives about five miles from the fire that erupted in Kula, in a hilly, bucolic region of Maui known as upcountry.\n\nThe 79-year-old woke up in the middle of the night Tuesday to the smell of something burning. She opened the door of her Makawao plantation home, where she’s lived for more than half a century, and “it was like fog out there, so covered with smoke.” She could see a fire above the Kula shopping center.\n\n10 schools closed, including one converted to evacuation shelter\n\nConditions had been especially windy in the days leading up to the blaze, in part because of Hurricane Dora moving south of the island. Carillo could sense something was brewing as the gusts picked up. Now, as she looks out at the mountain, the sky is clear.\n\n“You wouldn’t have even known there was a fire,” she said.\n\n− Alia Wong\n\nWildfire smoke map:See where fires are burning in Hawaii and across the US\n\nThousands without power; 911 service no longer available in West Maui\n\nMore than 14,000 customers in Maui County were without power, according to Poweroutage.us. County officials advised residents to stay at least 30 feet from downed power lines, which at one point restricted travel along parts of Honoapiilani Highway. Part of the highway was reopened Tuesday evening to allow access in and out of Lahaina, but motorists were told to expect traffic to move slowly through the bypass.\n\nIn West Maui, 911 service is no longer available. Martin said it's been \"very difficult\" to manage evacuation orders in Lahaina because the area does not have cell service and only landlines are functioning.\n\nThe island of Oahu, where Honolulu is located, also was dealing with power outages, downed power lines and traffic problems, said Adam Weintraub, communication director for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nStrong winds are fueling the flames\n\nIn Kula, winds were recorded at 80 mph, \"which greatly affected the speed and the movement of the fire,\" Martin said.\n\nBecause of the wind gusts, helicopters weren’t able to dump water on the fires from the sky – or gauge more precise fire sizes – and firefighters were encountering roads blocked by downed trees and power lines as they worked the inland fires, Martin previously told the Associated Press.\n\nA high wind warning and red flag warning for dangerous fire weather issued by the National Weather Service in Honolulu are expected to remain in effect through Wednesday.\n\nMaui fire officials warned that erratic wind, challenging terrain, steep slopes and dropping humidity combined with the direction and the location of the fire have made it difficult to predict its path and speed. The wind can also sends fire embers up and ignite sparks downwind, creating fires far from their source, officials said.\n\n“The fire can be a mile or more from your house, but in a minute or two, it can be at your house,” said Fire Assistant Chief Jeff Giesea. “Burning airborne materials can light fires a great distance away from the main body of fire.”\n\nFires also burning on the Big Island\n\nHawaii County officials said Tuesday that they were monitoring two brush fires burning in North and South Kohala. The fires prompted evacuations and power outages in the area.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday approved the state's request for a disaster declaration to provide assistance with \"the wind-whipped Kohala Ranch wildfire on the Big Island,\" according to a news release from the governor's office.\n\nThe fire, which began early Tuesday, threatened about 200 homes near the rural community of Kohala Ranch, a volunteer fire department, local electrical transmission lines and an AT&T cellular communications tower in the area, officials said The fire was uncontained and had burned more than 600 acres of land when the request for federal assistance was made.\n\nThe release said firefighters battling that fire and the two other uncontrolled fires on the Big Island and Maui \"have been hampered by the winds, which made it impossible to provide aircraft support for their efforts to contain the flames.\"\n\n“We’re trying to protect homes in the community,” Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth said of evacuating about 400 homes in four communities in the northern part of the island. As of Tuesday, the roof of one house caught on fire, he said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/11/maui-hawaii-fire-live-updates/70573053007/", "title": "Death toll in Maui disaster hits 80, deadliest in state history", "text": "Editor's note: This file is based on the news of the Hawaii wildfires on Friday, Aug. 11. For the latest news and updates on the Maui fire, check out our live updates file for Saturday, Aug. 12.\n\nThe number of deaths resulting from the fires on the island has risen to 80, according to a statement by Maui County on Friday.\n\nThe number of confirmed fatalities in the 9 p.m. announcement increased from the previous figure of 67.\n\nA fire that caused an evacuation in Kaanapali was completely extinguished by 8:30 p.m.\n\nThe fire occurred in an area where a county fueling station was set up to distribute about 3,000 gallons of gasoline and 500 gallons of diesel fuel for about 400 waiting vehicles. Fuel would not be distributed on Saturday, the county said in a statement.\n\nNew fire prompts Friday night evacuation on Maui\n\nPolice say a new fire burning on the Hawaii island of Maui has triggered the evacuation of a community to the northeast of the area that burned earlier this week.\n\nThe fire prompted the evacuation of people in Kaanapali in West Maui on Friday night, the Maui Police Department announced on social media. No details of the evacuation were immediately provided.\n\nTraffic was halted earlier after some people went over barricaded, closed-off areas of the disaster zone and \"entered restricted, dangerous, active investigation scenes,\" police said.\n\nIn an earlier post on Facebook Friday, police said many people were parking on the Lahaina Bypass and walking into nearby areas that were \"locked down due to hazardous conditions and biohazards.\" Police warned violators could face arrest.\n\n\"This area is an active police scene, and we need to preserve the dignity of lives lost and respect their surviving family,\" the post said.\n\nDeath toll in Maui fire disaster rises to 67 amid questions about warning system\n\nThe death toll from the Maui wildfire climbed to 67 Friday as Maui fire crews battled blazes still scorching parts of the island and rescue workers searched for about 1,000 people reported missing as questions began to swirl about Hawaii's emergency warning system.\n\nConfirmed deaths from the inferno that erupted Tuesday − fueled by winds from Hurricane Dora and exacerbated by overly dry vegetation from the ongoing drought − now officially make the Maui natural disaster the worst that Hawaii has seen since becoming a state in 1959.\n\nThere is still no end in sight. Cadaver-sniffing dogs were brought in Friday to assist the search for the dead, Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen Jr. said.\n\nThe death toll of 67 surpasses the state’s deadliest previous largest natural disaster, a 1960 tsunami that killed 61 people. An even deadlier tsunami in 1946, prior to Hawaii's statehood, killed more than 150 on the Big Island. The 1946 tsunami prompted the development of the territory-wide emergency system that includes sirens, which are sounded monthly to test their readiness.\n\nBut many fire survivors in this week's conflagration said in interviews that they didn’t hear any sirens or receive a warning that gave them enough time to prepare, realizing they were in danger only when they saw flames or heard explosions nearby.\n\n“There was no warning. There was absolutely none. Nobody came around. We didn’t see a fire truck or anybody,” said Lynn Robinson, who lost her home in the fire.\n\nThousands of people have been displaced, more than 1,700 structures have been destroyed, and the historic town of Lahaina was leveled.\n\n\"Without a doubt, it feels like a bomb was dropped on Lahaina,” Gov. Josh Green said after walking the ruins of the town with the mayor.\n\nGreen said the state is initially seeking 2,000 rooms for people and asked local hotels and others to help provide temporary housing for those in need.\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode. Search and rescue is still a primary concern,” said Adam Weintraub, a spokesperson for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nWidespread power and cellular outages have complicated evacuation efforts, and some residents who escaped the flames questioned why Hawaii's famous emergency warning systems didn't alert them as the blazes approached.\n\n\"We got warned, but the wind was faster,\" Leomana Turalde, a 36-year-old who runs a sunscreen company and has family who lived in Lahaina Town, told USA TODAY. \"I found out on social media. But there was no real warning.\"\n\nThomas Leonard, 74, told the Associated Press he didn't know about the fire until he smelled smoke. The retired mailman from Lahaina tried to flee in his Jeep but abandoned his vehicle when nearby cars started to explode. He took refuge behind a seawall for hours before being rescued by firefighters.\n\nHawaii AG announces 'comprehensive review' of wildfire decisions\n\nHawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez announced in a statement Friday that her office will conduct a “comprehensive review” of decisions and polices related to the wildfires this week.\n\n“The Department of the Attorney General shares the grief felt by all in Hawaiʻi, and our hearts go out to everyone affected by this tragedy,” Lopez said in the statement. “My Department is committed to understanding the decisions that were made before and during the wildfires and to sharing with the public the results of this review. As we continue to support all aspects of the ongoing relief effort, now is the time to begin this process of understanding.\"\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green told CNN earlier Friday that he had authorized a review of the state’s response, but power outages and phone network issues were disrupting the efforts.\n\nThe announcements come after some people in Maui said they didn’t hear alarms or warnings about the fire. There are also questions about whether the area had adequate resources to deal with the disaster.\n\nFriends and family still struggle to reach loved ones\n\nAnna Del Castello has been trying to learn more about the situation on the ground in West Maui, where she has a home and “quite a few” friends, but the San Francisco property manager told USA TODAY that Hawaii officials are not providing enough useful information, particularly for longtime residents on the ground who are “in a crisis right now.”\n\n“I’m finding out everything from Facebook and people’s comments, which is just crazy,” said Del Castello, 47, who visits West Maui every year. She has a family home two blocks away from Kapalua Airport that her father, a Pearl Harbor veteran, built in the 1980s.\n\nShe has not been able to get in touch with her tenant who lives there yet, she said. Del Castello believes the house is likely still standing because the fires stopped several miles south of it, according to the fire maps, she said. But cell service is still shoddy, she said, and residents near there have had to walk to nearby beaches just to text loved ones that they’re okay.\n\nDel Castello said emergency management officials need to get cellphone towers up and running more quickly and help devastated residents on the ground communicate with the outside world. “To me, it really feels like the priorities are not right,” she said.\n\nSome have taken to a crowdsourced online spreadsheet to locate hundreds of people created by resident Ellie Erickson and shared widely on social media. As of Friday, over 1,500 names on the list were still marked \"not located.\"\n\nLahaina residents return to devastated remains of town\n\nFor the first time since the raging wildfires, Lahaina residents were allowed back to their town on Friday – only to be met with a scene of ash-ridden devastation.\n\nNearly every building on Front Street, the economic center of the island and heart of the community, was leveled to debris, according to Associated Press journalists who saw the area. Burnt remains from dozens of cars that didn’t make it out of the fires stood still in a frozen traffic jam.\n\n“It hit so quick, it was incredible,” Lahaina resident Kyle Scharnhorst told the AP as he surveyed the damage to his apartment complex Friday. “It was like a war zone.”\n\nWest Maui remains without power and water, officials said, and search efforts continue in Lahaina for victims of the fire. Across the island, about 1,000 people remain missing, and parts of Lahaina are burned to the ground.\n\nThere will be a daily curfew from 10pm-6am Hawaii time in the historic Lahaina town and other areas affected by the fire, Maui County officials said in a statement. Access to Lahaina will be limited “until hazardous conditions improve.”\n\nResidents will be required to show identification to prove they live in West Maui, and visitors will be asked for proof of their hotel bookings. Access to Lahaina will be closed daily during curfew hours.\n\nWater in Lahaina, Upper Kula may be contaminated from fire damage, officials warn\n\nThe Maui County Water Department warned residents of Lahaina and Upper Kula that water may be contaminated from fire damage.\n\nStatements on Friday said people in Lahaina and Upper Kula should not use tap water for drinking, cooking, or brushing teeth. For showers, officials said to use lukewarm water, limit length and ventilate the area.\n\nThe warning comes after a swift blaze destroyed some structures in the water systems, officials said, and some areas lost water pressure, which can cause harmful contaminants to enter the system.\n\nPotable water tanks in Lahaina and Kula are available for residents to fill containers with a maximum capacity of five gallons.\n\nThe notice is in effect \"until test data is available,\" the statement said.\n\nCoast Guard rescues 17 people in search across water\n\nIn an hours-long search across more than 450 square nautical miles, the US Coast Guard said in a statement Friday that it has rescued 17 people after the blaze sent some people fleeing into the ocean to escape the fire.\n\nAnother 40 survivors were found and assisted to shore, the agency added. There are currently no confirmed missing people in the water.\n\nThe Coast Guard said it plans to “transition to other missions later this evening, unless additional information warrants continuing searches.”\n\nThe agency has been searching for people since initial emergency reports Tuesday evening. Coast Guard officials previously estimated up to 100 people had fled into the water, NBC News reported.\n\nAnyone with information about missing people in the water can contact Coast Guard Sector Honolulu Command Center at 808-842-2600.\n\nLahaina's wildfire risk prompted worry in previous study\n\nLahaina’s wildfire risk is well known. Maui County’s hazard mitigation plan, last updated in 2020, identified Lahaina and other West Maui communities as having frequent wildfires and a large number of buildings at risk of wildfire damage.\n\nThe report also noted that West Maui had the island’s second-highest rate of households without a vehicle and the highest rate of non-English speakers.\n\n“This may limit the population’s ability to receive, understand and take expedient action during hazard events,” the plan noted.\n\nMaui’s firefighting efforts may also have been hampered by a small staff, said Bobby Lee, president of the Hawaii Firefighters Association. There are a maximum of 65 firefighters working at any given time in the county, and they are responsible for three islands – Maui, Molokai and Lanai – he said.\n\nThe blaze is the deadliest U.S. wildfire since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 people and laid waste to the town of Paradise.\n\nPower could be out for weeks in some places\n\nWhile power was restored to some essential services by Friday, officials warned some areas of the island could face power outages for weeks.\n\nThe County of Maui said early Friday morning that power was restored to Upcountry water pumping stations, and that water would be restored in that area after the lines were flushed.\n\nBut Hawaiian Electric said West Maui residents should be prepared for the possibility of \"extended outages that could last several weeks in some areas.\"\n\nCrews would start damage assessments and repairs as soon as areas are safe to access, the electric company said Thursday afternoon. There were about 12,400 customers without power Thursday.\n\nWildfire expert: This was foreseeable\n\nThough officials have said the wildfires sparked and spread so quickly there was little time to warn people, one Hawaii wildfire expert said the tragedy was foreseeable.\n\nElizabeth Pickett, co-executive director of the nonprofit Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, told the Honolulu Civil Beat she co-authored a report nearly a decade ago that identified an increased wildfire risk to Maui, with Lahaina in an extreme risk area.\n\n“We keep hearing from certain elected officials and other people being quoted in the media, ‘we had no idea, this is unprecedented,’” Pickens told the outlet Thursday. “But actually, those of us in the wildfire community, meaning our fire agencies, our forestry natural resource management community, we have long been working to increase our risk reduction efforts.”\n\nPickett said many recommended actions from the report to prevent wildfires have been implemented since its release, but only partially, and much more could have been done.\n\n“It might not have been 100% preventable, but it could have been mitigated. It could have been lessened,\" she said.\n\nThousands flee as officials continue evacuating Maui\n\nAs crews continued to work to evacuate residents, thousands of tourists and visitors to the island left on flights by Thursday evening, officials said.\n\nNearly 15,000 visitors left Maui on airplanes as airlines added flights to their schedules. More than 1,200 people were evacuated from Kaʻanapali-area hotels to the airport.\n\nTravelers were urged to book flights directly with airlines to Honolulu, and to the mainland U.S. from there. The Hawaii Tourism Authority said visitors traveling for nonessential purposes should leave the island, and nobody should travel there unless necessary.\n\nMaui firefighters stretched thin, hampering efforts\n\nThe effort to keep the fires under control could have been hampered by the relatively small firefighting crew in Maui, said Hawaii Firefighters Association President Bobby Lee.\n\nThere are a maximum of 65 firefighters working at any given time, Lee said, out of a total of about 280 personnel. They are equipped with just over a dozen fire engines, with 14 fire stations in the county serving the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai, according to the county.\n\nCounty officials said in an update on Facebook early Friday morning that 21 firefighters, seven supervisory personnel and four vehicles from Honolulu were aiding crews in Maui, and an additional nine-member search-and-rescue team was also brought in to help.\n\nHawaii’s siren system didn’t sound during fires\n\nSurvivors of the fires and officials reported there was no activation of the state’s storied emergency warning system, which would have sounded blaring outdoor sirens.\n\nHawaii’s system, known as the All-hazard Statewide Outdoor Warning Siren System, is used to warn residents about emergencies including earthquakes, tsunamis, brush fires, flooding, lava, or terrorist events, according to the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThere are over 400 sirens spread throughout the islands, including 80 in Maui County. The state says it’s the largest outdoor warning system in the country and the “largest single integrated Outdoor Siren Warning System for Public Safety in the world.”\n\nHawaii Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Adam Weintraub told The Associated Press that records don’t show the system in Maui being activated Tuesday when fire took over. Instead, alerts were sent out through Maui County residents’ phones, televisions and radios. It’s not clear whether that happened before or after the island was hit with widespread power and signal outages.\n\nMaui Fire Department Chief Brad Ventura said the fire moved so quickly from brush to neighborhoods that it was impossible to get messages to the emergency management agencies responsible for alerts.\n\n“What we experienced was such a fast-moving fire through the … initial neighborhood that caught fire they were basically self-evacuating with fairly little notice,” Ventura said.\n\nIn 2019, Oahu and Maui residents were sent into a brief panic when the outdoor siren system was mistakenly triggered during a training – after a 2018 incident when the text message alert system falsely told the whole state to take cover for an incoming ballistic missile that didn’t exist.\n\nNone of the fires are 100% contained\n\nMaui County Fire Chief Brad Ventura said none of the fires were “100% contained right now.\" Ventura said there are several small fires in between the large fires burning in Lahaina, Pulehu and Upcountry.\n\nMaui County reported the most damaging of the three blazes, the one in Lahaina on the western part of the island, was 80% contained by Thursday morning, and that another one in Pulehu in central Maui was at 70% containment. There was no assessment yet about the fire in the mountainous Upcountry.\n\nVentura said there is still potential for “rapid fire behavior” with the weather and told people to remain out of the area.\n\nWildfires were also still burning on the Big Island, but no injuries or destroyed homes had been reported, Mayor Mitch Roth said.\n\nMaui wildfires death toll will likely continue to climb\n\nMaui County reported at least 36 people had died in the Lahaina fire Wednesday evening. By Thursday, the total had reached 55, and it's expected to continue rising as emergency workers reach parts of the island previously cut off by the fires and other obstructions.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday declared a major disaster in Hawaii, making federal aid available to support state and local recovery efforts. Green estimated damage to the area will likely cost billions and take years to repair.\n\nGreen said the disaster will likely become the deadliest since Hawaii became a state in 1959. He referenced the 1960 tsunami that hit the Big Island, killing 61 people, and said: \"This time it's very likely that our death totals will significantly exceed that, I'm afraid.''\n\nThe Maui fire is also the deadliest in the U.S. in five years. Not since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 and wiped out the town of Paradise, has a U.S. community endured such a tragedy.\n\nCelebrities including Oprah urge support for Maui\n\nThe BBC filmed Oprah Winfrey handing out supplies at the war memorial stadium earlier this week. \"I came earlier, just to see what people needed, and then went shopping because often you make donations of clothes or whatever, and it's not really what people need,\" Winfrey said. \"So, I actually went to Walmart and Costco and got pillows, shampoo, diapers, sheets, pillowcases.\" People magazine noted Winfrey is a part-time Maui resident.\n\n\"Fast X\" star Jason Momoa, who is Native Hawaiian, and Connie Britton, who starred in the first season of \"The White Lotus\" – which was shot in Maui – have also voiced their concerns for the island.\n\nProfessional golfer Collin Morikawa, whose paternal grandparents are from Hawaii, pledged to donate $1,000 to support the rescue efforts in Maui for each of his birdies in the FedEx St. Jude Championship as the tournament got underway Thursday in Memphis.\n\nBefore and after photos show Hawaii wildfires damage\n\nSatellite imagery and photos from the ground revealed the devastating damage wildfires have done to Maui landmarks, including Lahaina's iconic banyan tree, Front Street and Waiola Church.\n\nMaui fires map\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\nHow to help Maui fire victims\n\nMaj.

The toll will probably surpass 60 and make the disaster the deadliest since Hawaii became a state in 1959, Gov. Josh Green said.\n\nThe death count continues to climb and parts of coastal communities have been largely destroyed, including the historic town of Lahaina. He referenced the 1960 tsunami that hit the Big Island, killing 61 people, and said: \"This time it's very likely that our death totals will significantly exceed that, I'm afraid.''\n\nGreen also said \"maybe upwards of 1,700 buildings'' were destroyed by the fires, which now appear to be mostly under control. Roughly 1,000 people remain missing, according to Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier.\n\nBut some fires are still burning in Lahaina and surrounding areas. “Lahaina, with a few rare exceptions, has been burned down,” the governor said.\n\nAt an afternoon press briefing, Green said damage to the area is in the billions of dollars and that it will take years to bring about repair. “It’s a profound change of landscape,” Green said of the massive fire damage to the area. He said that footage from the fires will be released late Thursday.\n\nHe pleaded with local hotels and others to come forward and help with the unprecedented need for temporary housing for people in need. He said the state is initially seeking 2,000 rooms for people displaced in the fires.\n\n“If you have additional space in your home, if you have the capacity to take someone in from West Maui, please do,” Green said.\n\nMaui County reported the most damaging of the three blazes, the one in Lahaina on the western part of the island, was 80% contained by Thursday morning, and that another one in Pulehu in central Maui was at 70% containment. There was no assessment yet about the fire in the mountainous Upcountry.\n\nLater in the day, Maui County Fire Chief Brad Ventura said none of the fires are “100% contained right now,” and there are several small fires in between the large fires. There is still potential for “rapid fire behavior” with the weather and told people to remain out of the area.\n\nRescue crews searched for survivors Thursday amid the devastation left behind in Maui by the deadliest U.S. wildfire in five years, which injured dozens.\n\nEntire blocks of homes, businesses and a 200-year-old church were destroyed or damaged in Lahaina Town. In less than two days, neighborhoods from a community that dates to the 1700s turned into smoky rubble, with charred bodies inside burned-out cars and scorched boats in the harbor as the grim remnants.\n\nThe fires − fueled by wind from passing Hurricane Dora and exacerbated by overly dry vegetation from the ongoing drought − were so intense that the Coast Guard rescued 14 people who fled into the ocean to escape flames and smoke, including two children.\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode. Search and rescue is still a primary concern,” said Adam Weintraub, a spokesperson for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency. Officials said they will provide daily updates on all AM and FM radio channels at 9 a.m., noon, and 3 p.m. Hawaii time.\n\nNot since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 and wiped out the town of Paradise, had a U.S. community endured such a deadly wildfire. The Hawaii toll is expected to rise as rescuers get to parts of the island that have been been unreachable because of fires or obstructions.\n\nWildfires were also still burning on the Big Island, but no injuries or destroyed homes had been reported, Mayor Mitch Roth said.\n\nMaps, before-and-after images of the destruction in Hawaii caused by Maui fires\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode.

Before delivering a speech in Salt Lake City, Biden addressed the catastrophic fires and said: “We’ll get aid into the hands of people who desperately need the help. Anyone who’s lost a loved one or whose home has been damaged is going to get help immediately.’’\n\nFederal aid will be available to support state and local recovery efforts after Biden made the declaration.\n\n\"Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,\" according to a statement from the White House.\n\nBiden said he instructed FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, who is expected to arrive in the state Friday, to streamline help processes. He encouraged those who want to find out if they're eligible for federal help to get information at disasterassistance.gov.\n\nCrowdsourcing effort helps friends, relatives reconnect\n\nTwo days after rapidly spreading wildfires began tearing through areas of Maui, some families and friends still haven't heard from loved ones believed to be living or traveling there. They’ve taken to a crowdsourced online effort to locate hundreds of people as of Thursday morning because power outages and loss of cellphone signal have left them out of contact.\n\nA spreadsheet created by resident Ellie Erickson and shared widely on social media showed people from around the globe trying to reach those they know on the island, local station KHON2 reported.\n\n“I really hope that it can be kind of a place where if people are wondering about their friends, their loved ones, if they know somebody is safe they can come onto here and hopefully just give people peace of mind,” Erickson told the station.\n\nMany of the names on the list had been accounted for, scattered at emergency shelters, the airport or turning up with family members. But hundreds of people were still marked “not located” Thursday, and more were being added.\n\nAlexis Plume, a resident of Haiku – about 34 miles from Lahaina – was finally able to call her brother’s best friend in Lahaina Thursday morning. Plume said communication had not been possible with them because of disrupted cell phone service in the area.\n\n‘It’s a real big relief,” Plume said. “Everything is really hard to watch and we’re all just sort of trying to figure out what we can do.”\n\nNetblocks, a cybersecurity company, has been monitoring the network connectivity and found Lahaina still remains largely disconnected as of Thursday.\n\n“It's crucial to remain patient if you're trying to reach loved ones in the region,” Alp Toker, founder and director of the company, said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Connectivity challenges may make communication sporadic but rescue efforts are ongoing so don't lose hope.”\n\n− Jeanine Santucci & Itzel Luna\n\nFamilies with nowhere else to go; concerns for the homeless\n\nOn Thursday, Leomana Turalde was at Maui's Maalea Harbor, about 16 miles east of the worst damage at Lahaina, where he was headed to help find missing people. “In every parking lot on the island” it seemed there were families sleeping in their rental cars Thursday morning with nowhere else to go, he said.\n\nThere were still some small fires burning throughout Maui on Thursday, Turalde, 36, told USA TODAY. There was also heavy traffic around National Guard checkpoints and chain stores are shut down, he said.\n\nTuralde said he's most worried about friends and one cousin who are homeless.\n\n“They’re all devastated,” he said. “If I can help out those people, that’s kind of my main concern because nobody really cares about the homeless person with no ID.”\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nWhat travelers should know about the Maui wildfires\n\nHawaii's tourism arm is encouraging travelers with trips planned to areas impacted by the wildfires to reschedule if possible.\n\n“All nonessential travel to the Island of Maui is strongly discouraged,” acting Hawaii Gov. Sylvia Luke wrote in an emergency proclamation Wednesday, which extended the emergency period until Aug. 31.\n\nThe state of emergency is in effect for the entire state, though so far the fires have been limited to Maui and the northwest part of the Big Island of Hawaii.\n\nTravel to other parts of the Big Island is still welcome, as well as to Kauai, Oahu, Molokai and Lanai. Travelers can check with their specific hotels and airlines for special waiver policies amid the wildfires.\n\n− Eve Chen\n\nOfficials work to suppress fire, restore power\n\nEvacuation efforts have been complicated by power blackouts, a lack of cell service, the loss of 911 service and downed power lines in different parts of the islands. More than 11,000 customers remained without power Thursday according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, commander general of the Hawaii Army National Guard, said Wednesday night that officials were working to restore communication, distribute water and possibly add law enforcement personnel. He said National Guard helicopters had flown for 13 hours and dropped 150,000 gallons of water on the fires.\n\nCounty officials said three active fires on Maui remained unchanged at the end of the day Wednesday. Firefighters have been dealing with multiple flareups and have requested additional personnel from Honolulu.\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono said the priorities include fire suppression and restoring telephone access and electrical power as search and rescue efforts continue.\n\n“This is truly an all hands on deck situation,” Hirono said.\n\nTourists and residents fleeing to Maui airport\n\nAbout 11,000 visitors flew out of Maui on Wednesday, and at least another 1,500 expected to leave Thursday, according to Ed Sniffen, state transportation director. The Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu was being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 people displaced by the wildfires.\n\nLahaina resident Jordan Saribay saw homes burst into flames “as tall as the buildings because they were engulfing them.’’ Debris turned into dangerous projectiles as people whose cars had run out of gas tried to flee while carrying their prized possessions, he said.\n\n“While driving through the neighborhood, it looked like a war zone,’’ Saribay said. “Houses throughout that neighborhood were already on fire. I’m driving through the thickest black smoke, and I don’t know what’s on the other side or what’s in front of me.’’\n\nFirefighters could see some relief with winds letting up\n\nThe high winds fueling wildfires began to wane late Wednesday and will continue to ease during the day Thursday and into Friday, providing some much needed relief for firefighters battling the blazes, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr told USA TODAY.\n\nZehr said wind gusts Thursday could occasionally get to 30-35 mph; local peaks of 40 mph were possible. Later in the day and into Friday, that should ease further with gusts not getting over about 20 mph.\n\n“It should be better conditions now for today, easier for the firefighters to be able to do what they need to do and hopefully get some better control over these fires,” Zehr said.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nWhy devastated Lahaina Town is such a cherished place on Maui\n\nResidents and visitors are mourning the loss of cultural and religious sites in Lahaina Town that trace their roots back centuries.\n\nLahaina, which was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, has a population of around 13,000, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. Lahaina Town has also long claimed home to the largest banyan tree in the U.S., which was scorched by the fires.\n\nFor Francine Hollinger, a 66-year-old Native Hawaiian, losing Lahaina was \"like losing a family member.\"\n\nIn just a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated the town center, which traces its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n“Lahaina Town is now burned down to ashes, the whole entire town − hotels, buildings, the historic sites,'' said Leomana Turalde, who said his mother worked for years as a dancer at Old Lahaina Luau, considered a \"well-preserved epicenter of Hawaiian culture and storytelling,\" according to its website.\n\nHow drought helped fuel Hawaii wildfires\n\nMuch of the state is in varying levels of drought, and parts of Maui are affected by moderate and severe drought conditions, including some areas around Lahaina, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. An estimated 263,948 Hawaii residents are living in drought areas, the Drought Monitor said Thursday.\n\nThe duration and severity of droughts in Hawaii have increased over the last century, the National Integrated Drought Information System has warned.\n\nA drought dries out vegetation, adding power to a wildfire, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr told USA TODAY. That risk could continue, as there’s no rainfall expected soon for the part of Maui impacted by fire.\n\n“As long as you’re stuck in this pattern when you’re not getting a lot of rainfall, you’re going to continue to have these problems where it doesn’t take much to start a fire and it takes even less to make it spread,” Zehr said.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nAerial photos show damage in Lahaina, Banyan Court\n\nSatellite imagery and photos from the ground revealed the devastating damage wildfires have done to Maui landmarks including Lahaina's iconic banyan tree, Front Street and Waiola Church.\n\nThe banyan tree, planted in 1873 after being imported from India, was threatened by the fires and suffered damage to trunks and limbs but remains standing, the Honolulu Civil Beat reported.\n\nWhat caused the Maui fires?\n\nHigh winds and low humidity likely contributed to the fires, but officials know little else, Hara said at a briefing Wednesday. Hurricane Dora, a Category 4 storm in the Pacific Ocean, fueled the strong winds overnight in Maui, with gusts of 60 mph damaging homes and knocking out power.\n\nBut some experts said they suspect human development on the island is at least partly to blame for the destruction.\n\nWildfires have quadrupled in Hawaii in recent decades, and many scientists say the culprit is unmanaged, non-native grasslands planted by plantations and ranchers and others unfamiliar with the island's native ecosystems. The grass is dry and prone to fires.\n\n“There is no doubt that fire-prone grasses have invaded drier Hawaiian ecosystems and brought larger, more intense fires,” said Peter Vitousek, a professor of earth sciences at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nMaui death toll climbs\n\nAt least 36 people have died in the Lahaina fire in Hawaii, Maui County wrote in a statement posted to the county website Wednesday evening.\n\nSix patients were flown from Maui to the island of Oahu on Tuesday night, said Speedy Bailey, regional director for the air-ambulance company Hawaii Life Flight. Three of them had critical burns and were taken to Straub Medical Center’s burn unit in Honolulu, he said. The others were taken to other Honolulu hospitals. At least 20 patients were taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center, said Bailey.\n\nMaui fire map\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\n'Maui Strong': Here's how to help Hawaii fire victims\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, from the Hawaii State Department of Defense, asked those who want to donate supplies or volunteer to do so through the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency. James Kunane Tokioka, director of the department of business, economic development and tourism, said the governor has also asked people with vacant homes or vacation rentals to provide shelter for those in need.\n\nSeveral shelters are open to assist those on the islands and several local organizations are collecting donations. USA TODAY compiled resources for Americans to help people and animals in Hawaii here.\n\nBy Wednesday, the Hawaii Community Foundation said its Maui Strong Fund had raised more than $1 million to support residents affected by the wildfires. Funding will be used for \"evolving needs, including shelter, food, financial assistance and other services as identified by our partners doing critical work on Maui,\" the foundation said in a statement.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Ashley Lewis and Kayla Jimenez, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/15/maui-hawaii-wildfire-live-updates/70593905007/", "title": "Maui fire: Losses estimated in billions; first victims identified", "text": "The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday more than 3,400 survivors of the Maui fires have registered for aid and 1,200 of them have been granted payments worth a total of nearly $2 million.\n\nWhile more registrations and payments are expected in the coming days, recent estimates illustrate the enormous magnitude of the losses.\n\nThe Lahaina fire caused about $3.2 billion in insured property losses, said an assessment Tuesday by Karen Clark & Company, a prominent disaster and risk modeling firm. That doesn’t include uninsured property.\n\nThe blaze destroyed more than 2,700 structures in the historic town, according to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green, who said in a video posted late Sunday that “an estimated value of $5.6 billion has gone away.’’\n\nHis figure is in line with the $5.5 billion rebuilding cost projected by the Maui Emergency Management Agency and experts at the University of Hawaii.\n\nFEMA has not released a damage assessment, but Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he wants Congress to help Hawaii by approving a supplemental spending package that includes $13 billion to replenish federal disaster funds “as quickly as possible” once lawmakers return after Labor Day.\n\n\"Together with our state and federal volunteer partners, we’ll continue to do everything we can for the people of Hawaii who have lost so much,’’ said Keith Turi, FEMA's Deputy Associate Administrator for Response and Recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, officials raised the death toll to 106 late Tuesday, and released the first names of people killed by wildfires.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n◾ Saying he doesn't want his presence to disrupt recovery and cleanup efforts, President Joe Biden said he and first lady Jill Biden will travel to Hawaii \"as soon as we can'' to survey wildfire damage in Maui.\n\n◾Green said more than 500 hotel rooms and 1,000 Airbnb rentals were becoming available and that thousands of people will need housing for at least 36 weeks. There are also 473 listings in the state with the Hawaii Fire Relief Housing Program, according to the governor, which aims to connect property owners who wish to house people with those in need. \"We want everyone to be able to leave the shelters and go into stable housing, which is going to take a very long time,\" Green said.\n\n◾ Green announced that the road to Lahaina would open to all motorists starting Wednesday at 6 a.m.\n\n◾ As of late Monday, the Lahaina fire was 85% contained, the Upcountry Maui fire was 65% contained and the Pulehu/Kihei fire was 100% contained but not yet extinguished.\n\n◾ Maui Police Chief John Pelletier has overseen the response to a major disaster before. He was the incident commander for the 2017 mass shooting at a Las Vegas country music festival that left 58 people dead.\n\n◾ The South Korean government has pledged to send $2 million in humanitarian aid to Hawaii, the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in a press release Tuesday. The aid will include supplies like water and food purchased through the Korean market and sent to Hawaii, and cash donated to local relief groups, the ministry said.\n\nWeekend weather forecast: Storms expected in Maui\n\nStormy weather is forecast for the weekend in Maui, a mixed blessing for an island where fires are still burning. The expected rain could help douse them, but windy conditions − a major factor in last week's devastating blaze in Lahaina − could contribute to the flames spreading. The weather could also impact search efforts.\n\n“I want the rain, ironically, but that’s why we’re racing right now to do all the recovery that we can, because winds or heavy rain in that disaster setting, which it’s showing right now, it will make it even harder to get the final determination of who we lost,” Green said.\n\nOfficials are pondering whether to implement preemptive power shutoffs that may prevent another catastrophe but could also impact water pumps, hinder cleanup efforts and put those who rely on specialized medical equipment at risk.\n\nThe local power company has been criticized for not shutting off power last week as strong winds blew through a parched area under high fire risk, although it's not known whether the utility’s equipment ignited the flames.\n\nOfficials release first names of people killed by wildfires\n\nAuthorities released the first names of people killed by the devastating fires Tuesday night, a week after the deadly blazes scorched the historic town of Lahaina.\n\nSo far, two people's names have been released after their bodies were identified and families were notified. Robert Dyckman, 74, and Buddy Jantoc, 79, both of Lahaina, were the first confirmed victims of the fire disaster.\n\nMaui County said in a statement three other individuals have been identified, and officials are in the process of notifying their families.\n\nAs of Tuesday, 106 “human remains” have been recovered and are awaiting identification, the county said.\n\nAmong those assisting in finding and identifying the dead are members of a special federal Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team, deployed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Other search-and-rescue teams from the mainland United States, including Colorado, Los Angeles and Indianapolis, have been sent and are picking their way through downed power lines, melted cars and collapsed buildings.\n\nWith 25% of the search area covered as of Monday, officials said at least 99 people were confirmed dead. That number will increase significantly, according to Green, who said children are among the hundreds missing.

Green said he does not want Maui residents to rush to return to damaged areas, citing safety concerns. Government officials said this week they are working to secure temporary housing for displaced people, as well as for emergency responders working in Maui.\n\nAs frustration mounts among longtime residents, Green said he wants \"a lot of understanding about traveling into the zone where the fire occurred,\" due to safety risks from partially collapsed buildings.\n\nWarning sirens believed to be 'immobilized' by heat, governor says\n\nIn the days after the massive fires swept across large swaths of west Maui, residents have demanded to know why Hawaii's longtime hurricane and tsunami emergency warning system did not alert people to the fire.\n\n\"The sirens were essentially immobilized, we believe − we believe − by the extreme heat that came through,\" Green said in a CNN interview Monday.\n\nAs part of the review of the how the emergency alert system responded to the fire, officials will take a look at testing that was done on the sirens in early August, Green said.\n\nContributing: Minnah Arshad, Trevor Hughes, N'dea Yancey-Bragg, and Elizabeth Weise, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/12/us/kobe-bryant-crash-photos-award-ceremony/index.html", "title": "Kobe Bryant crash scene photos were shared during awards ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPhotos taken at the scene of the fatal helicopter crash that killed NBA legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter and seven others were shared by a Los Angeles County firefighter during the cocktail hour at an awards ceremony a month after the crash, according to witness testimony.\n\nOn Wednesday, the trial was launched for a federal civil lawsuit filed by Bryant’s widow, Vanessa Bryant, who claims that photos from the January 2020 crash were shared by county fire and sheriff’s department employees in settings irrelevant to the investigation, including at a bar.\n\nFormer emergency medical technician and wife of a Los Angeles firefighter, Luella Weireter, testified in court on Friday that during the Radio and Television News Association of Southern California’s Golden Mike awards in February 2020, she saw LA County firefighter Tony Imbrenda share photos of Bryant’s remains and other images from the crash site with ceremony attendees.\n\nMany firefighters attended the media event, which was also honoring fire department public information officers for their work informing the public about wildfires.\n\nAfter a small group of people at her table convened to look at images on a cell phone, in what Weireter characterized as being like a party trick, she testified about seeing one firefighter break away from the group, saying, “I can’t believe I just looked at Kobe’s burnt up body, and now I’m about to eat.”\n\nAfter that comment, Vanessa Bryant could be seen in the courtroom with her head in her hands, rocking back and forth, crying.\n\nWeireter is the cousin of Keri Altobelli, who, along with her husband John and daughter Alyssa, also perished in the helicopter crash.\n\nAbout two weeks after the awards ceremony, Weireter drove to a county fire station in Malibu and filed an official complaint with a battalion chief, she testified. That same day, the LA County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone called her to follow up.\n\nAlso Friday, Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department Deputy Doug Johnson testified that he was instructed to document “the entire scene,” including taking photos of human remains.\n\nJohnson, who was the first of two deputies to arrive at the crash scene, said he took about 25 photos at the site on his personal cell phone because he was not issued a work phone, and about one-third of the images contained human remains.\n\nPhotos shown to the courtroom were graphic in nature, depicting severed limbs and deceased children.\n\nJohnson said it is a common practice to text close-up photos of dead bodies to other deputies, and he had received numerous similar photos throughout his career without ever being disciplined.\n\n“I know I didn’t do anything wrong,” he testified, adding that he does not regret what he did and wouldn’t have done anything differently.\n\nHe sent the photos to the command post and airdropped them to a fire department “supervisor” he was unable to identify. This person has not been identified by anyone else in the court up to this point, leading the plaintiff attorney to suggest the photos could still be accessible somewhere.\n\nJohnson said he deleted the photos he took the night of the crash once he got home as well as the text thread with a deputy at the command post with whom he had shared the photos.\n\nVanessa Bryant was not present for Johnson’s testimony.\n\nBartender describes seeing photos\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Vanessa Bryant walked out of court during testimony that described photos taken at the scene of the crash. She became emotional when Victor Gutierrez, a bartender, was asked if he had seen the body of her daughter, Gianna Bryant, in the images. Gutierrez had been describing what he saw in the photos shown by a Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputy at a bar on a prior date.\n\nVanessa Bryant cried, stood up and her attorney asked the presiding judge permission for her to leave the courtroom.\n\nBryant did not return for the remainder of Gutierrez’s testimony, which continued with a series of surveillance clips from the bar he was working at on January 28, 2020 – two days after the crash and a month before the awards ceremony. Gutierrez described wincing at the photos and then admitted to telling the condition of the victims’ bodies to five sets of people.\n\nThe trial is expected to last about two weeks and witnesses will likely include Vanessa Bryant and LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva. The suit, which was filed in September 2020, seeks undisclosed damages and claims civil rights violations, negligence, emotional distress and violation of privacy.\n\nA jury of six women and four men was selected for the case.

The Justice Department has already appealed that decision, which prosecutors had vigorously opposed and had opened up Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, to criticism from some legal analysts, including Trump’s own former attorney general, William Barr.\n\nLast week, the DOJ asked Cannon to reverse her decision to bar the FBI and DOJ prosecutors from using material taken from Trump’s home until the special master – a third party appointed to oversee evidence – had vetted it. It argued that the prohibition posed an unacceptable threat to national security. Monday morning, lawyers for Trump urged Cannon to reject the Justice Department’s attempt to continue to review seized documents.\n\nAnd as a separate joint filing made clear on Friday, neither side can even agree on who the special master should be, what they should examine, how long the review should last and who should pay for it.\n\nMore legal filings could push the probe closer to the 2024 presidential campaign – a sensitive political matter since Trump is giving every sign he intends to be a candidate and has claimed the drama is a politically motivated attempt to keep him from winning a second White House term. In a reminder of the stakes involved, a forthcoming book by New York Times reporter and CNN political analyst Maggie Haberman reveals that Trump, in the aftermath of the 2020 election, said he would remain in the White House rather than let incoming President Joe Biden take over, a shocking disregard for longstanding American political precedent.\n\nTrump is within his rights to fight for a special master, even if many legal experts argue that it’s clear the information he had belongs to the government and not him. But the former President also has a long record in his political and business career of exhausting the system of appeals to the fullest extent of the legal system, often in order to delay a moment when he might face accountability. His latest gambits and some of Cannon’s own writings in the case have sparked criticism that he’s getting special treatment.\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for instance, warned Sunday that he should be treated just like any other citizen.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear how Hillary Clinton thinks DOJ should treat Trump 02:39 - Source: CNN\n\n“I do think that, just like any American, if there is evidence, that evidence should be pursued,” Clinton, whom Trump defeated in 2016, told CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\n\nIn Cannon’s order last Monday, she had said that while prosecutors could not use material taken from Trump’s resort until they had been reviewed by the special master for legal and executive privilege issues, a review by intelligence agencies into possible damage to national security could continue. The DOJ, however, argued that was impractical.\n\nIn its filing late Thursday, which added up to a comprehensive critique of Cannon’s reasoning, the department argued that it and the FBI’s work on the criminal investigation could not be separated from the parallel probe by the intelligence community. In essence, they argued that the FBI and the DOJ are an integral part of the intelligence community. And they warned that the loss of the ability to examine whether critical intelligence had been jeopardized by Trump could cause grave damage.\n\n“The government and the public are irreparably injured when a criminal investigation of matters involving risks to national security is enjoined,” the department argued when giving its notice of an appeal. And it also served notice that the DOJ will seek the intervention of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals if Cannon does not grant its request to suspend parts of her ruling by September 15.\n\nSenate intelligence committee expects briefing\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Warner, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that key congressional leaders had still not been briefed on potential intelligence vulnerabilities at Mar-a-Lago because of the tussle over the special master going on in Cannon’s court.\n\n“We have not been briefed. We expect to be briefed,” the Virginia Democrat told Bash. “I think we’ll get some clarity on that in a couple days, and we expect to get that briefing,” he added.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Bash asks Senate Intel chair for answers on Mar-a-Lago search 06:21 - Source: CNN\n\nBut the latest legal wrangling between Trump’s team and the DOJ is to some extent obscuring the core question about the case: why did Trump keep classified documents, some bearing the designations of the government’s most closely guarded secrets in apparently unsecured conditions at a private home?\n\nThe mystery became even more acute when the Washington Post reported last week that the documents taken away from Mar-a-Lago by the FBI included details of a foreign power’s nuclear program. The way that Trump kept such documents, in a storage room or in his office with personal memorabilia, according to unsealed court documents, could be deeply consequential. In some circumstances, even the possibility that classified information was compromised could cause intelligence agencies to shut down operations abroad to protect sources and methods or even foreign assets who may need to go dormant or be extracted from vulnerable positions.\n\nA Monday morning deadline\n\nCannon had given Trump’s legal team until Monday at 10 a.m. to file a formal response to the DOJ’s request that she suspend parts of her special master order.\n\n“The application of the injunction to classified records would thus frustrate the government’s ability to conduct an effective national security risk assessment and classification review and could preclude the government from taking necessary remedial steps in light of that review – risking irreparable harm to our national security and intelligence interests,” the DOJ wrote in its request for a stay.\n\nThe department also argued that the injunction prevented the FBI from identifying any additional classified records that were not being properly stored at Mar-a-Lago and pointed to empty folders marked with “classified” banners that were found during the FBI’s search of Trump’s residence.\n\n“The FBI would be chiefly responsible for investigating what materials may have once been stored in these folders and whether they may have been lost or compromised – steps that, again, may require the use of grand jury subpoenas, search warrants, and other criminal investigative tools and could lead to evidence that would also be highly relevant to advancing the criminal investigation,” the DOJ said in its filing to the judge.\n\nThe department’s argument implicitly makes the point to the judge that classified documents are in themselves the property of the US government and not of the former President. Some of Trump’s allies have suggested that he had previously declassified all the documents found at Mar-a-Lago. But there is no evidence that this ever took place. In fact, 18 former top Trump administration officials told CNN they never heard any such order issued during their time working for Trump, and that they believe the claim to be false.\n\nAnd even if Trump had declassified material, US law states that presidential documents are not the property of the person who sat in the Oval Office but should be sent to the National Archives when a presidency ends.\n\nTrump’s legal team countered: “In what at its core is a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control, the Government wrongfully seeks to criminalize the possession by the 45th President of his own Presidential and personal records.”\n\nTrump has not been charged with a crime. But the unsealed FBI search warrant of his home revealed the investigation is related to at least three potential violations of the law – including of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records.\n\nClinton takes a swipe at Trump\n\nThe extraordinary spectacle of a former President’s home being searched by the FBI – after prolonged efforts by the government to get classified and other material back – has renewed questions of whether Trump could face criminal charges. This is hardly the only investigation involving the former President. The Justice Department also has a separate investigation into events leading up to and surrounding the Capitol insurrection. And there is yet another probe under way in Georgia into the alleged efforts by Trump and his team to overturn Biden’s victory in a critical swing state.\n\nThe possibility of Trump’s potential criminal liability was taken up on Sunday by Clinton, whom Trump frequently said should be locked up after some classified material was found on her private email server dating to emails sent to her by staff when she was secretary of state.\n\nThe FBI said in 2016 that of 30,000 emails Clinton provided to the State Department from her server, 110 contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. Then-FBI Director James Comey criticized Clinton for carelessness but concluded that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against her on the basis of evidence found and applicable laws.\n\nWhile Trump’s supporters have argued he should get the same treatment as Clinton, the cases do not appear directly analogous.\n\n“He’s not the president and we do have some special exceptions for someone actually in the office,” Clinton said on “State of the Union” referring to the former President. “So, I do think that, just like any American, if there is evidence, that evidence should be pursued,” Clinton said.\n\n“I know it’s not an easy call. And so, I don’t want to inject my opinion into that difficult calculation. Because I don’t know all the facts. And unlike people who jump to conclusions, I don’t want to do that,” Clinton said.\n\n“But if the evidence proves or seems to show that there are charges that should be leveled, then I think the rule of law should apply to anyone.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/09/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/30/us/hawaii-mauna-loa-kilauea-eruption-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Lava spills toward a highway, but governor says it's safe to visit the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe world’s largest active volcano is shooting fountains of lava more than 100 feet high and sending a river of molten rock down toward the main highway of Hawaii’s Big Island.\n\nThe leading edge of the lava flow gushing out of Mauna Loa is about 3.6 miles away from Saddle Road, also known as Daniel K.

David Ige said it’s still safe to visit the Big Island.\n\n“We would encourage everyone who has plans to visit the island to continue,” Ige told CNN on Wednesday.\n\n“It is completely safe. The eruption site is high up the mountain, and it’s in a relatively isolated location,” he said.\n\nBut distracted drivers gawking at the lava flows could cause problems, Ige said.\n\n“We are concerned because visitors and residents are stopping along the highway, and sometimes drivers are not paying attention fully,” he said.\n\n“So we are concerned about traffic control on the highway.”\n\nParking along the road is prohibited between mile markers 16 to 31, and any vehicles left there could be towed.\n\nIf the highway is closed, commuters won’t have any pleasant options.\n\nEmmanuel Carrasco Escalante, a landscape worker, said he would then have to decide between the northside or southside coastal roadways to get from Hilo to Kona.\n\n“It’s a hassle to drive all the way around the island,” he told CNN. “If the road closes, that would add almost two hours, more gas, and more miles so hopefully it (lava) doesn’t cross that road.”\n\nCarrasco Escalante said he usually leaves for work at 3:30 a.m. to arrive at 5 a.m. but is worried rerouting even then will take him into traffic jams.\n\nThe state’s emergency management agency tweeted there are no evacuation orders in place and if it becomes necessary to close the highway, there will be time to alert the public in advance.\n\n‘The concern is about dangerous gases’\n\nWhile officials have said there’s no imminent threat to property, a spate of potential health hazards could linger in the air.\n\nVolcanic gas, fine ash and Pele’s Hair (strands of volcanic glass) could be carried downwind, the geological survey said.

And the most dangerous is sulfur dioxide,” Ige said Wednesday. “Observing the volcano should occur at a distance.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the change was needed after just seven states – Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas – accounted for 70% of monoclonal antibody orders in the country. “Given this reality, we must work to ensure our supply of these life-saving therapies remains available for all states and territories, not just some,” the department said in a statement. The seven states are also among those that have the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday that federal officials told states providers would no longer be able to order the drugs directly but would have to place those orders through state health departments. “We are really sorry to say there are probably going to be some patients who aren’t able to access that drug who thought they were going to have that available to them,” Harris said. Doctors continue to emphasize that vaccination, rather than a secondary treatment after the fact, is the best way to prevent severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nAlaska\n\nJoint Base Elmendorf-Richardson: Military leaders on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson have declared a public health emergency and encouraged all personnel to avoid places that do not require masks or social distancing in response to increasing COVID-19 cases across the state, officials said. “We’ve all seen COVID-19 cases continue to spread rapidly across our nation, the state of Alaska and in our local community,” U.S. Air Force Col. Kirsten Aguilar, 673rd Air Base Wing and JBER commander, said in a statement Friday. “After close consultation with JBER mission commanders, I have decided to declare a Public Health Emergency.” Aguilar said the declaration will remain in effect for 30 days but could be shortened or extended based on cases and community transmission of COVID-19. The base has also transitioned to Health Protection Condition Bravo, which means Aguilar will be able to implement additional measures to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, “including restricting access to off-base establishments,” the statement said. Hospitalizations and COVID-19 cases throughout the state have increased as a result of the highly contagious delta variant. Alaska on Friday reported more than 1,200 newly confirmed cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Board members overseeing Arizona’s most populous county reached an agreement Friday evening with the Republican-controlled state Senate that will end a standoff over a Senate demand that they hand over computer routers for use in an unprecedented partisan election review. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors announced that a special master will take questions from the Senate’s election review contractors and provide them with information contained on the routers that they say they need to finish the election review. Supervisor Bill Gates said the deal will protect sensitive information contained on the routers while avoiding a massive penalty the county faced if they had not complied. Gates called the deal “a win for transparency, and it’s also a win for protecting sensitive data in Maricopa County.” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a decision last month that the county must comply with the subpoena issued by Republican Senate President Karen Fann or lose about $700 million in yearly state funding. The county agreed to drop a $2.8 million claim it filed with the Senate after election equipment it handed over to the auditor was decertified and needed to be replaced.\n\nArkansas\n\nRussellville: A former sheriff’s deputy was charged Friday with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists. A special prosecutor announced the felony charge against Michael Davis, a former sergeant with the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office, in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain. Davis faces between three and 10 years in prison if convicted. Davis shot Brittain during a June 23 traffic stop outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, a city of about 26,000 people roughly 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. Davis told investigators he shot Brittain once in the neck after the teen reached into the back of his truck and did not comply with his commands to show his hands, according to the arrest affidavit. Brittain was holding a container – which his family members have said held antifreeze – and no evidence of firearms was found in or near the truck, the affidavit said. A passenger with Brittain said he and the teen had been working on the transmission for Brittain’s truck. The passenger told investigators he never heard Davis tell the teen to show his hands. Davis, who is white, was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley in July for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThree Rivers: Hot, dry weather Sunday added to the challenges facing firefighters battling to keep flames from driving farther into a grove of ancient sequoias, where the base of General Sherman, the world’s largest tree, has been wrapped in protective foil. Fire officials warned that stronger winds were also contributing to “critical fire conditions” in the area of the KNP Complex, two lightning-sparked blazes that merged on the western side of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning through Sunday, saying gusts and lower humidity could create conditions for rapid wildfire spread. The fires forced the evacuation of the park last week, along with parts of Three Rivers, a foothill community of about 2,500 people. Crews have been bulldozing a line between the fire and the community. More than 34 square miles of forest land have been blackened. The National Park Service said Friday that flames had reached the westernmost tip of the Giant Forest, where it scorched a grouping of sequoias known as the “Four Guardsmen” that mark the entrance to the grove of 2,000 sequoias. Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires – fueled by climate change – can overwhelm the trees.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A civil rights investigation that was launched amid outrage over the death of Elijah McClain – a Black man put into a chokehold during an encounter with suburban Denver police two years ago – found a deeply ingrained culture of racially biased policing within the department, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. He said Wednesday that the investigation found the Aurora Police Department has long had a culture in which officers treat people of color, especially Black people, differently from white people. He said the agency also has a pattern of using unlawful excessive force, frequently escalates encounters with civilians, and fails to properly document police interactions with residents. It’s the latest mark against the Aurora department since Weiser’s office indicted three officers and two paramedics on manslaughter and other charges this month in connection with McClain’s death. “These actions are unacceptable. They hurt the people that law enforcement is entrusted” to serve, Weiser said. Police stopped McClain, a 23-year-old massage therapist, as he walked home from a store Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed “sketchy.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington: The town’s police force is warning residents to stay away from aggressive minks. In a recorded message sent to residents, Capt. Todd Olson of the Stonington Police Department urged people to stay away from a mink if they see one, The Day of New London reports. Olson said that even though they resemble a pet ferret, minks are territorial and are not friendly. One of them chased a person Wednesday, he said. Olson said the department’s animal control officer notified the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection about the minks, and the agency is looking into the situation. A mink farm once operated in the town.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: African folk music played through the Herman M. Holloway Sr. Park as the community gathered Saturday to participate in the 25th African American Family Festival. The festival, designed to celebrate “everything African,” also serves as an opportunity to raise awareness about social issues – including COVID-19. “We want to do good things for the people in our community so they don’t feel like all good things happen in majority-white neighborhoods,” said Harmon Carey, the event organizer. “A lot of African American festivals have moved away from the community, near white communities, or they have completely stopped doing events.” The aroma of African cuisines filled the park as children playfully jumped in a bounce house, and adults gathered around jewelry and clothing stalls, adorned with traditional African stones and colorful fabrics. A Mobile Health Unit set up by the Life Health Center conducted coronavirus tests and encouraged people to get vaccinated. “It is kind of a hit and miss, but every time I come out, I cross my fingers and hope that we get a good response,” said Kyme McCleary, a nurse at the mobile unit. The unit focused on vaccinating children ages 12 and up during the first half of the event, followed by adults for the later part of the day.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than 660,000 white flags are waving in the air on the National Mall, each honoring one American life that has ended due to COVID-19. The installation, called “In America: Remember,” covers more than 22 acres in 143 sections near the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, WUSA-TV reports. Volunteers from Ruppert Landscape installed the flags over the course of three days, completed Friday. The installation will be up for a total of three weeks, lasting until Oct. 3. Visitors are invited to get involved in the memorialization, come to the mall and personalize a flag for someone they have lost. Those who can’t make it in person can dedicate a flag virtually on the installation’s website. Artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg conceived the idea, beginning last fall with 267,080 flags placed outside RFK Stadium in Northeast D.C. Firstenberg – described as a “social action artist” based in the D.C. area, according to the installation’s website – has also spent 25 years participating in hospice volunteering.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: The mayor says officials will revamp a program that allowed police officers to notify landlords when their tenants had been arrested, even in cases in which charges were later dropped. The decision to reform Tampa’s Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program was announced by Mayor Jane Castor on Saturday following an investigation by the Tampa Bay Times that showed police officers were reporting tenants after arrests for misdemeanor crimes and the arrests of juveniles, and about 90% of the 1,100 people flagged by the program were Black tenants. Under the announced changes, the city will inform landlords only about “certain serious drug and violent felonies.” A police captain must sign off on notices sent, and landlords will be notified only about arrests that happen on their properties. The program was created in 2013 with the goal of stamping out drug and gang crime in apartment complexes. At its peak, about 100 apartment complexes were enrolled. While Castor touted the program as having “improved the safety and quality of life for tens of thousands of people,” Yvette Lewis, president of the Hillsborough County NAACP, said it could still violate a renter’s civil rights by resulting in an eviction based solely on an arrest. “This program needs to be stopped,” she said. “You’re treating housing as though it’s a privilege.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A disaster relief organization founded by actor Sean Penn is boosting the state’s drive to inoculate people against COVID-19, though some of its pop-up vaccine clinics have struggled to attract people. CORE has offered COVID-19 shots at hundreds of sites in big and small communities around the state, including schools, farmers markets and meat plants. But it has had few takers at some locations – a likely reflection, at least in part, of skepticism about vaccines in Georgia. The percentage of people who are fully vaccinated in the state is well below the national average, and that’s a big factor in Georgia’s nearly three-month surge in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. On a recent weekday, one person came in to get inoculated over six hours at an Atlanta church where CORE was offering the Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. State health officials say regardless of how many people show up at each site, the group has been a key partner in their mobile vaccination efforts. “We feel like every opportunity is not wasted if we can get a shot in an arm,” said Chris Rustin, a senior adviser to the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: At least seven people were injured Saturday in the collapse of a large tree branch in Waikiki, Hawaii News Now reports. A large branch of a banyan tree came crashing down about 12:15 p.m. at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the heart of the popular tourist district, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services told Hawaii News Now. The seven people who suffered multiple injuries included some with serious head injuries and multiple cuts. Four of the seven were treated and transported to a nearby hospital, Honolulu EMS said. Among those seriously injured were a 50-year-old man, a 22-year-old woman, a 28-year-old woman and another woman whose age was not disclosed, according to Hawaii News Now. Three others evaluated at the scene refused to be transported. The banyan reaches a height up to 100 feet and spreads laterally indefinitely, with its branches dropping new roots to the ground, creating a structure that can appear to be composed of many separate trees. Hilton Hawaiian Village said in a statement after the incident: “Our thoughts are with those who have been affected and their families. Our hotel team along with several guests responded immediately and the proper authorities were contacted. The wellbeing, safety and security of our guests and team members are of paramount importance.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Republican state officials are warning President Joe Biden of legal action if his proposed COVID-19 vaccine requirement for about 100 million Americans goes into effect. Gov. Brad Little, Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, House Speaker Scott Bedke and Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Winder said in a letter Friday that there appears to be no legal basis for the requirement. “If you choose to continue to move forward in this direction, the State of Idaho will have no choice but to take the necessary legal actions to uphold its sovereignty, check the overreach of power by federal bureaucracy, and uphold the system of checks and balances our Constitution guarantees,” they wrote in the letter to Biden. Many Idaho Republican lawmakers are angry with the vaccine mandate that requires employers with more than 100 workers to require the workers either to be vaccinated or to be tested for the coronavirus weekly. The officials’ letter comes a day after the entire state entered crisis standards of care because of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 patients filling hospitals. The standards allow health care providers to give scarce resources, such as ventilators, to the patients most likely to survive. The letter also comes as Republicans jockey for position ahead of the GOP primary early next year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A kind of bird that not that long ago was so rare in Illinois that people traveled hours just to catch a glimpse of one has lately been winging its way through the Chicago area. Snow-white 30-pound birds called the American white pelican are on their semiannual migration through Illinois right now. The trip means hundreds of them stop to rest near the Four Rivers Environmental Education Center in Channahon, 50 miles southwest of Chicago. Thousands more stop for a bit about 150 miles beyond Channahon at the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge in Lewistown. Among reasons this might be happening is that decades of wetland restoration across the country have helped increase the number of birds from about 40,000 in the 1960s to 180,000 today. As to why Illinois has seen so many more, American Birding Association webmaster Greg Neise told the Chicago Tribune that perhaps the birds that traditionally breed in Canada and the Great Plains and migrate to the Gulf Coast every winter started breeding in northern Wisconsin. He said another possibility might be that Asian carp that have invaded Illinois waterways in recent years are, as the pelicans have discovered, good eating.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s largest hospital system says more than 100 workers are no longer employed with the health network after they did not comply with its mandate for all employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Indiana University Health said Thursday that 125 employees had departed from the hospital system after a two-week unpaid suspension period that ended Sept. 14. Officials did not say whether those workers quit or were fired, saying in a statement that they “chose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and have left the organization.” IU Health did not provide details on what kinds of positions were affected or whether any of the employees worked in bedside care. The 125 former employees were a small percentage of IU Health’s work force of about 36,000. IU Health announced in June that it would require all its doctors, nurses and other employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 1. The health system operates 15 hospitals and dozens of outpatient clinics around the state. Two weeks ago, IU Health said suspended employees would be allowed to return to work if they attested to partial or full vaccination. At the time, it said that fewer than 300 workers had been suspended, according to the Indianapolis Business Journal.\n\nIowa\n\nBurlington: Paint-A-Thon participants are hoping the goodwill it brings to the community each year will spread much like the virus that resulted in the cancellation of last year’s event. Each year, hundreds of Burlington and West Burlington residents work with their neighbors, co-workers and friends to paint houses for those most in need. “It’s like a good virus,” said Mark Rosenburg, team leader for Bethany Lutheran Church, who was painting a house on Elm Court. “It goes to the community and spreads.” The Burlington/West Burlington Paint-A-Thon is hosted each year by Two Rivers Bank and Trust in collaboration with Diamond Vogel Paint and Community Action of Southeast Iowa. One of the program’s goals is to beautify the homes of those who cannot afford a fresh coat of paint. This year’s event marks the 28th annual Paint-A-Thon. Last year’s was canceled because of COVID-19. When Paint-A-Thon first started in Burlington, an organizer reached out to all the churches in the city asking for help. Since then, it has become an annual tradition for many houses of worship. Individuals can apply to have their home painted or can be nominated by someone else. Community Action goes through a selection process in which members seek out the neediest homeowners to receive assistance.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Sit-ins and marches have followed alleged sexual assault on two major university campuses in the state. Dozens of University of Kansas students staged a sit-in in front of the chancellor’s office Friday in an ongoing protest of the handling of allegations that a fraternity member sexually assaulted another student. A spokesman for Phi Kappa Psi has said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. Protesters are demanding that university officials take action against the fraternity as well as the alleged perpetrator, The Kansas City Star reports. They changed a placard at the entrance of the office of the chancellor, renaming it “Office of the Complicit,” and taped other signs with messages to the glass windows at Chancellor Doug Girod’s office. Meanwhile, more than 200 people marched to the Wichita State University police station to protest the handling of a reported rape in a dormitory. The Wichita Eagle reports students gathered Friday at Shocker Hall, where the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred Sept. 12. They then marched to the campus police station. Some carried signs reading: “We deserve a rape-free campus,” and “WSU, do better.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A $21 million project at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport will install geothermal wells to heat and cool the facility. Crews will drill 648 vertical geothermal wells that go 500 feet deep on the east side of the airfield. Geothermal wells use the earth’s natural temperature to heat and cool. The new system will cut carbon emissions by 80% and use 40% less energy than traditional systems, the airport said. “Not only will this innovative technology make systemwide improvements and increase efficiencies, but we are also setting an example in the industry to reduce carbon emissions and energy use,” said Dan Mann, executive director of the Louisville Regional Airport Authority. Airport officials held a formal groundbreaking Thursday for the project, which is part of a larger set of improvements to the airfield and terminal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Garbage and debris are piling up along many streets almost three weeks after Hurricane Ida pounded southeast Louisiana as residents react with increasing anger and, in some cases, dark humor. Several residents told a City Council committee Friday that they haven’t had their garbage collected since days before the storm hit Aug. 29. “I was at the point of naming every maggot in my garbage, and I was going to put them on my income tax as dependents,” a woman told council members at City Hall. “This is not good government. This is just incompetence.” Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration has said much of the problem arises from labor shortages that have plagued the city for months, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and, then, the storm. The city sought bids from companies wanting to supplement its two main waste contractors, officials said Thursday. A Sept. 8 deadline was extended to Sept. 13 due to a lack of response. After the later deadline, one contractor was hired to aid trash collection efforts Thursday in part of the city. Another contractor who bid on another area had 20 trucks available – but no labor. On Thursday, Cantrell’s office announced a plan to use workers and equipment from various city agencies to supplement trash pickup.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The public gets an opportunity Monday to weigh in on Democratic and Republican proposals for reshaping the border of Maine’s 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts. Both proposals released Thursday focus on Kennebec County, and both parties agree on moving Augusta, the capital city, to the state’s northern district. There’s disagreement, however, on reshuffling a dozen other towns. Democrats want to move both August and Waterville, along with several other Democratic-leaning towns. Republicans targeted a different grouping of towns. Based on the 2020 election, the Republican proposal would have meant nearly 900 additional votes for President Joe Biden and the Democratic proposal would mean about 6,200 extra votes for Biden in the district, according to an analysis by the Bangor Daily News. Former President Donald Trump won the vote in the 2nd Congressional District, picking up one of Maine’s four electoral votes. Sen. Rick Bennett, R-Oxford, who is serving on the commission for Senate Republicans, said he’s optimistic the differences can be ironed out. “I think we are pretty close, at least on the congressional side,” he told the Portland Press Herald. The state’s bipartisan redistricting commission is racing to meet a Sept. 27 deadline.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Legislative auditors found that glitches in the cashless tolling infrastructure at the state’s bridges, tunnels and express lanes overbilled motorists thousands of dollars. The Baltimore Sun reports the Office of Legislative Audit’s report on the Maryland Transportation Authority comes about a year after the state announced it permanently ceased cash toll collections – put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic – and moved to fully electronic tolling systems. “We received allegations on our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline alleging that MDTA was not taking sufficient action to detect and address the overbilling of customers for electronic tolling due to issues with its new toll equipment,” Legislative Auditor Gregory Hook wrote in a letter to the legislature’s Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee. “Our audit disclosed that MDTA was inconsistent in its actions related to the impact of issues with its electronic toll collection system on its customers and potential customer overbillings.” The report identified tolling issues at the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the Intercounty Connector in Montgomery County and the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge in Cecil County.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: The city known for its witch trials more than three centuries ago will require a negative coronavirus test for people to attend some large Halloween events, officials said as they brace for the typical influx of visitors in the weeks ahead of the holiday. The Salem Board of Health voted Friday to require people to have a negative test taken within 72 hours to attend indoor events with more than 100 people at a public space. The requirement goes into effect Oct. 1 and lasts through Nov. 1. Masks are required inside all public businesses through mid-November. “The delta variant is so transmissible. We are seeing an increase in COVID case counts in Salem,” Mayor Kim Driscoll said. “Thankfully, more people are vaccinated, so we’re not seeing the crush of hospitalizations. But those numbers are up, too.” Details about rapid testing in the area will be announced soon. Vaccine mandates are in place for some events like the Horror Fest, which includes 50 indoor movies throughout October. “We’ll do whatever it takes to keep our audience safe,” said Kay Lynch, of Horror Fest. “We’ve capped our audience. We’ve required vaccination. Masks are required indoors.”\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: After hearing from critics, including the homeless, city officials have rejected an ordinance that would have cracked down on panhandling. The measure would have stopped people in Jackson from asking for money by speech or sign near banks, building entrances or outdoor dining or on public transportation. A violation would have carried a $100 fine. Kevin Hardman, who said he’s homeless, told the Jackson City Council that finding solutions to poverty would be a better step. “To penalize me or anyone because I’m poor, I don’t dress nice – if you see somebody in that condition, why won’t you help them?” Hardman said. A first reading of the ordinance was defeated 5-2 on Tuesday, MLive.com reports. Council member Karen Bunnell, who voted for the ordinance, said panhandling is a serious issue downtown. “Those are not just my constituents. Those are also my business owners,” she said. Mayor Derek Dobies, who opposed the ordinance, said it violated free speech. “The city can’t say it’s OK for the Salvation Army or firefighters to collect donations in some of these places but not allow poor people to ask for spare change,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Regulators have ordered Enbridge to pay more than $3 million for allegedly violating state environmental law by piercing a groundwater aquifer during construction of the Line 3 oil pipeline replacement. The state Department of Natural Resources said Enbridge, while working near Clearbrook in January, dug too deeply into the ground and pierced an artesian aquifer, which resulted in a 24 million-gallon groundwater leak. “Enbridge’s actions are a clear violation of state law, and also of the public trust,” said Barb Naramore, DNR deputy commissioner. “That is why we are using all of the tools in our authority to address the situation.” Enbridge said in a statement that it was reviewing the DNR’s order and would work with the agency on a resolution. It wasn’t until mid-June that the DNR discovered something was wrong after speaking to independent construction monitors who had observed water pooling in the pipeline trench near Clearbrook. The DNR has ordered Enbridge to put $2.7 million into escrow for restoration and damage to nearby wetlands. Enbridge is also required to pay $300,000 to mitigate the lost groundwater and $250,000 for long-term monitoring of the wetlands. Enbridge’s 340-mile Line 3 replacement pipeline, opposed by environmental groups and some Ojibwe tribes, is nearly complete.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An interactive exhibit prompts visitors to speak aloud the names of people who were killed in acts of racist violence in the United States during the civil rights era – incantations in a darkened room to honor some 150 men, women and children whose lives were cut short. The names appear on lighted glass panels, backed by images of trees. Next to each name is a code that visitors can scan with their cellphones. “Say his name to begin his story,” or “Say her name to begin her story,” says the recorded narrator, journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who made history in 1961 as one of the first Black students to enroll in the University of Georgia. The traveling exhibit, “Un(re)solved,” was created by PBS Frontline with artist, filmmaker and technologist Tamara Shogaolu. It is on display until Oct. 24 at the Two Mississippi Museums, which houses the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and Museum of Mississippi History under one roof. The exhibit opened in downtown Jackson on Aug. 28 – 66 years to the day after Emmett Till, a Black teenager from Chicago, was abducted, tortured and killed in the Mississippi Delta after witnesses said he whistled at a white woman. “Un(re)solved” focuses on the federal investigation of more than 150 cold cases under a law enacted in 2008, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Mississippi has 56 names in the exhibit – more than any other state.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A crowd gathered Saturday to celebrate the state’s bicentennial, with a World War II nurse leading the parade. KTVO reports Edith Harrington waved to the crowd from a military jeep, followed by about 100 entries that highlighted the history of the Show-Me State. The 98-year-old Harrington joined the United States Cadet Nurse Corps in 1943. The festivities also marked the election of state officeholders in 2020 whose traditional inauguration events were delayed because of the coronavirus. Missouri turned 200 years old last month. Territorial residents first sought statehood in 1818, but the request became bogged down in Congress by a dispute over whether slavery should be allowed. In March 1820, President James Monroe signed legislation known as the Missouri Compromise. Maine was allowed into the union as a free state and was allowed to draft a constitution as a slave state, so long as no other new slave states formed north of Missouri’s southern border. Missourians thought they had become a state, but the parties were premature. Missouri’s first constitution, which sought to exclude free “Negros or mulattoes” from the state, prompted further opposition in Congress. After a second compromise, Monroe signed legislation finally making Missouri the 24th state on Aug. 10, 1821.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Interior Secretary Deb Haaland signed the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes water rights compact Friday, settling a decades­long battle over thousands of individual water rights in Montana and on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The deal also created a $1.9 billion trust to settle claims and refurbish the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project. The tribes have claims to more than 10,000 water rights beyond their reservation land. The compact offered a deal in which the tribes relinquished their claims to most of the water outside of the reservation. In exchange, the tribes will receive 211 water rights on their reservation, 10 water rights outside the reservation and co-ownership of 58 other water rights, along with the funding. “Our elders continually remind us to protect our water, and this day marks the beginning of the water compact implementation that will protect the water for all generations to come,” Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes Chairwoman Shelly Fyant said in a statement. Montana lawmakers passed legislation approving the compact in 2015. Under the compact, the federal government will initially provide the tribes with $90 million over a 10-year period to rebuild the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project, which was built in the 1900s.\n\nNebraska\n\nAlvo: A massive, flammable mountain of scrap tires that had grown to more than twice the size allowed under state environmental rules in a small eastern Nebraska town now appears to be in compliance. The Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy said a report that B-Rose Tire Recycling of Alvo had made significant progress in coming into compliance with a Sept. 1 deadline to bring its inventory below 160,000 passenger tire equivalents, according to the Omaha World-Herald. In April, the business signed a consent agreement with state regulators to drastically reduce its pile of shredded tires or face fines or other sanctions. By the middle of last year, the business’ pile of tires in the town halfway between Lincoln and Omaha had grown to as much as 323,228 passenger tire equivalents. B-Rose fell short of benchmarks in the agreement for July and August, but after a warning letter from the state agency Aug. 9, B-Rose reported hauling out 123,176 passenger tire equivalents to the landfill during August, exceeding the number of tires hauled out in the months of May, June and July combined. Officials at the State Fire Marshal’s office said Wednesday that they hadn’t yet conducted an inspection to determine if the business had created fire lanes for emergency vehicles between the tire piles.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A fire burned the main building of the Mount Charleston Lodge in a forest area that is a popular retreat from summer heat for Las Vegas residents. A fire official and a representative of the company that owns the business said the building that houses the lodge’s restaurant was a total loss, but cabins used for lodging weren’t damaged. No injuries were reported, officials said. The fire was reported about 4:45 a.m. Friday. Its cause wasn’t immediately known. Photos posted online showed flames flaring from the building, and Clark County Assistant Fire Chief Thomas Touchstone said the lodge’s dining area was fully engulfed when the first units arrived about 5 a.m. The lodge was built in the 1960s after a previous lodge on the site that had been operating since at least 1948 was destroyed by a fire in December 1961, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Since 2018, the property has been operated by Ellis Island Hotel & Casino. “The Lodge was a beloved landmark, and we plan on rebuilding and recreating the atmosphere and charm that so many were able to enjoy throughout the years,” Christina Ellis, the company’s marketing director, said in a statement. Touchstone said it appeared the fire started inside the building when no employees were there, and it was too dangerous for firefighters to enter the building to battle the blaze.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The head of the state’s health department on Friday accused a Republican lawmaker of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette was telling the Legislature’s fiscal committee that 90% of those hospitalized in New Hampshire due to the coronavirus are unvaccinated when she was interrupted by Rep. Ken Weyler of Kingston. “That is in doubt,” he said, adding that he has heard from emergency room workers who say 90% of those admitted have been vaccinated. “That is incorrect, and that is misinformation,” Shibinette told him, according to video of the exchange shared by WMUR-TV. “I have no idea why someone would say that, but that is incorrect, and that is the problem that we are having in increasing our vaccination rate: spreading misinformation about the COVID vaccine.” Republican members of the committee voted to table $27 million in federal virus relief funds that would have gone to the state’s immunization program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge who suggested to a domestic violence suspect that men are “in control” has been suspended without pay two years after he made the comments. The state Supreme Court announced Friday that it adopted the recommendation of a panel on judicial conduct to suspend Municipal Court Judge Steven Brister for one month, beginning Wednesday. The panel wrote in 2019 that Brister, who has served in both East Orange and Newark, told the man that men “can’t punch; you can’t hit. At best, you treat as if you’re holding a feather, just to let them know you’re the man, and you’re in control.” The panel wrote that the comments violated conduct rules, were disparaging to women and could create the perception of bias. It also wrote that Brister allowed his personal religious beliefs to influence his judicial role because he referred to women as being created “with the curve of the rib of Adam.” In a subsequent response to the panel’s report, Brister didn’t deny the remarks and called them “well-meaning but undeniably misguided” and said he had completed several ethics courses. An email message seeking comment was left Friday with an attorney who represented Brister.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s film industry has come roaring back to life this year and so far managed to avoid significant COVID-19 outbreaks. Many credit the stringent protocols put in place by the industry, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Film and TV productions in New Mexico got the green light to resume in September 2020. According to the New Mexico Film Office, from Sept. 1, 2020, through Sept. 1, 2021, there have been 176,598 coronavirus tests administered throughout the various productions. Of those, 183 were positive. “This is a testament to the film industry, as they want to mitigate and remain safe,” said Amber Dodson, director of the New Mexico Film Office. “There have been less than eight productions that have paused for their own safety during the last year.” As of Aug. 31, there were 18 film and 24 TV productions in various phases currently in the state. When the film industry paused in March 2020, leaders spent months developing protocols that would be put in place when it resumed. In June 2020, a white paper was created by a task force of the Industry-Wide Labor-Management Safety Committee describing health and safety guidelines to resume film and TV production.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Most nonviolent parole violations will not result in jail time under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The “Less is More” law largely eliminates New York’s practice of incarcerating people for technical parole violations, including being late to an appointment with a parole officer, missing curfew, or failing to pay fees or to inform a parole officer of a change in employment. Starting in March, people on parole will land back behind bars only for drug or alcohol use if they were convicted of driving under the influence of those substances. Supporters of the law say that New York has one of the the nation’s highest rates of incarcerating people for technical parole violations and that the practice is costly and fuels the cycle of people landing behind bars again after serving their time. Criminal justice advocates applauded the law but urged Hochul and lawmakers to make it effective immediately. The move means an estimated 5,000 people who are behind bars for technical parole violations could eventually be eligible for release. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will be releasing “hundreds and hundreds of people the right way.” The governor also said she would sign off on the release of 191 eligible inmates from the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail complex, troubled by years of neglect.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Judges struck down the state’s latest voter photo identification law Friday, agreeing with minority voters that Republicans rammed through rules tainted by racial bias as a way to remain in power. Two of the three trial judges declared the December 2018 law is unconstitutional, even though it was designed to implement a photo voter ID mandate added to the North Carolina Constitution in a referendum just weeks earlier. They said the law was rushed and intentionally discriminates against Black voters, violating their equal protections. The law “was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters,” Superior Court Judges Michael O’Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their 102-page order. “Other, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate nonracial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence.” The majority decision, which followed a three-week trial in April, will be appealed, Republicans at the Legislature said. A state appeals court had previously blocked the law’s enforcement last year. The law remains unenforceable with this ruling.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Air Force Base has been selected for a military satellite mission, the state’s U.S. senators announced Friday. Republican Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer said the base will be home to a Space Networking Center, which is part of the Pentagon’s Space Development Agency’s new low-Earth orbit mission. NASA defines low-Earth orbit as having an altitude of 1,200 miles or less. Hoeven said the mission serves as the backbone for all U.S. military communications. “Grand Forks is the ideal location to house this new Space Networking Center,” Hoeven said in a statement. The mission “provides essential support for our national security and will help our nation stay ahead of our adversaries in developing critical new technologies,” he said. Hoeven’s office said a military installation in Alabama also was selected as a center for the mission.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As Republican lawmakers try to limit drop boxes and early voting, a new report shows rural Ohio voters want more flexibility in how they can cast their ballots. A poll commissioned by the nonpartisan election group Secure Democracy found that roughly three-quarters of rural voters support allowing counties to provide multiple early voting and ballot drop-off locations, as well as expanding the types of acceptable voter identification. They also back 24-hour drop box access and the use of a secure website to request an absentee ballot. The poll comes as legislators push separate bills that would alter the state’s rules for conducting elections. Supporters say the changes are necessary to prevent fraud, but opponents contend they would sow confusion and suppress votes. One proposal would eliminate in-person voting on the Monday before Election Day, limit drop boxes to 10 days before Election Day and require Ohioans to request mail-in ballots no later than 10 days before an election. A stricter measure would ban drop boxes entirely and significantly reduce the number of days for early voting, among other provisions. Officials with Secure Democracy say the bills could hurt voters in 17 rural counties who relied on voting flexibility even before the pandemic drove people toward absentee and early voting.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court will expedite an appeal of an injunction limiting a ban on mask mandates in public schools. The court, in an order dated Wednesday, placed the appeal on its fast-track docket, giving Attorney General John O’Connor 20 days to file briefs in the case and opponents 20 days to respond. The appeal argued the law passed earlier this year by the Legislature is constitutional. “The Legislature may reasonably exercise its … power over public schools without regulating private schools,” the filing said. The appeal also said the state is immune from the lawsuit filed by the Oklahoma State Medical Association and four parents. District Judge Natalie Mai cited the fact the law did not apply to private schools in approving the temporary injunction. Mai’s ruling allows for exemptions to mask requirements for medical or personal reasons, which Oklahoma State Medical Association President Dr. Mary Clarke said some schools have adopted. “It’s disappointing to see the Attorney General appeal a decision that even Gov. Stitt supported,” Clarke said in a statement. “We’ve seen several schools implement masking programs with opt-out clauses.”\n\nOregon\n\nBend: About two dozen people have contacted the state’s poison center after self-medicating against COVID-19 with a drug used to treat parasites, with five becoming hospitalized and two winding up in intensive care units, authorities said Friday. The drug they used was ivermectin, which has no proven use against the coronavirus and is instead approved to treat some parasites in people and some animals. “COVID-19 is a devastating disease and can be very frightening, but the public does not need to use – nor should it use – unproven and potentially dangerous drugs to fight it,” said Robert Hendrickson, medical director of the Oregon Poison Center at Oregon Health & Science University. Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 14, the Oregon Poison Center at OHSU managed a total of 25 cases. Five of those cases involved hospitalization, and two people were so severely ill that they had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for antiviral efficacy would require administration of doses of the drug up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans, the National Institutes of Health said. The Oregon Poison Center said its recent cases involved people experiencing mental confusion, balance issues, low blood pressure and seizures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Democrats in the state Senate sued Friday evening in a state court to block a Republican-approved subpoena seeking voter information and to put a stop to what Republicans call a “forensic investigation” of last year’s presidential election. Democrats had said they would sue within days after the GOP-controlled Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee voted Wednesday to issue a subpoena that seeks detailed state election records, including communication with counties and the names of who voted in last year’s presidential election, their birth dates, addresses, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers. The subpoena is an outgrowth of former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims that he was cheated out of victory last November and ongoing pressure by Trump and his allies for battleground states where he lost to investigate the election. “The latest ploy by the Senate Republicans is unprecedented and completely unwarranted,” Democrats said in a statement. “All aspects of the certified 2020 election have been thoroughly reviewed and adjudicated in the courts with no findings of irregularities or fraud. The timeframe to contest the 2020 certified election results is long overdue.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A group of parents and grandparents has filed a legal challenge to Gov. Daniel McKee’s statewide school mask mandate. The lawsuit filed in Providence Superior Court on Thursday alleges the Democratic governor violated state law and the state constitution in both signing the K-12 mask mandate and declaring a new state of emergency due to the delta variant of the coronavirus, WPRI-TV reports. The 16 parents and grandparents from Glocester, Smithfield, North Smithfield and Warwick argue there is a double standard because the state no longer requires masks in restaurants, retail shops and other indoor spaces. They also question the science of mask-wearing, which state and national experts have said helps slow the spread of the virus. “Often, it appears that those at highest risk for the effects of COVID-19, the elderly, the obese, and those with multiple comorbidities, are willing to force the young and healthy, who are little affected by COVID-19, to suffer these irreparable harms on unproven science,” the complaint says. McKee spokesperson Alana O’Hare, citing the pending litigation, declined to comment. In the suit, the plaintiffs also say masks make it difficult for their children to breathe, hear and communicate, hampering the learning process.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The capital city will not allow people to carry guns in the open during protests, festivals or other events that need a city permit. The resolution passed unanimously earlier this month by the Columbia City Council also bans the open carrying of guns in city-owned buildings without written permission from the city manager, The State newspaper reports. The South Carolina General Assembly passed a law this year allowing people with a concealed weapons permit to carry those guns openly. But the law allowed local governments to ban open carry for specific events for a limited period of time. Columbia’s resolution will keep people safer, Mayor Steve Benjamin said. Concealed weapons permit holders “are incredibly responsible with the use of firearms, and I’m thankful for that,” Benjamin said. “But the ability for a good, hard-working police officer to be able to ascertain who’s who when someone has a sidearm on fully exposed is very difficult.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislative leaders on Friday distributed a petition to lawmakers asking them to support a special session to consider impeaching Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg for a car crash last year that killed a pedestrian. House Speaker Spencer Gosch released the text of the petition. Two-thirds of both the Republican-controlled House and Senate must sign on to convene the special session. Lawmakers would meet in November, the day after they are scheduled to hold another special session to consider new legislative districts. The petition says the special session would be called for “investigating and evaluating whether the conduct of Jason Ravnsborg … surrounding the death of Joe Boever, involved impeachable offenses.” Gosch has said that if the special session is approved, he will appoint a committee to investigate the conduct of the attorney general, a Republican whose term runs through 2022. The South Dakota Legislature has never tried to impeach an official as powerful as an attorney general. It would require a simple majority of the House to approve articles of impeachment, while two-thirds of senators must vote to convict and remove him from office. The attorney general pleaded no contest to a pair of misdemeanors last month, and prosecutors dropped a third misdemeanor.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge has indefinitely blocked Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County, saying Friday that evidence shows Lee’s order prevents children with health problems from safely going to school during the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the preliminary injunction after parents of students with health conditions argued that the Republican governor’s executive order endangered their children and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing others to opt out of a mask mandate. “It is that unmasked presence that creates the danger to these Plaintiffs,” the judge wrote Friday. Meanwhile, two families in Williamson County, just south of Nashville, sued in federal court Friday, also challenging Lee’s order. In Shelby County, Lipman had already issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 3 stopping schools from allowing parents to opt out. It was set to expire Friday. The preliminary injunction continues blocking Lee’s order as the federal lawsuit proceeds. The injunction applies to all seven public school districts in Shelby County, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Shelby County Schools is Tennessee’s largest, with 100,000 students.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A man linked to the “boogaloo” movement who livestreamed threats to kill police was sentenced Friday to 50 years in prison after being convicted of attempted murder of a peace officer. On Thursday, a jury in Bowie County found 38-year-old Aaron Caleb Swenson guilty of attempted capital murder of a peace officer and found he’d violated the Texas Hate Crimes Act, the Texarkana Gazette reports. On Wednesday, before testimony began before the judge, Swenson had pleaded guilty to terroristic threatening and evading arrest. The newspaper reports that on Friday, the jury sentenced him to 50 years in prison for attempted murder, 20 years for terroristic threatening with a hate crime enhancement and 10 years for evading arrest. Prosecutor Kelly Crisp said the terms will run concurrently. The jury also assessed maximum fines on each of the three charges for a total of $30,000. Swenson testified he was trying to be killed by police in April 2020 when he made the threats and never intended to hurt anyone when he streamed on Facebook Live while driving in Texarkana, Texas, that he was searching for a police officer to kill. Texarkana crime scene analyst Spencer Price testified about the two pistols, 12-gauge shotgun, handmade sword and 156 rounds of ammunition found in Swenson’s truck.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Salt Lake: The Wasatch Youth Center is no more. Demolition crews began work last week tearing down the former long-term, secure lockup for child offenders. A backhoe knocked down brick walls and tore off the roof of a gymnasium. A stray office chair was picked up with some debris and thrown into the back of a dump truck. The juvenile detention facility is no longer necessary. “Because of some of the shifts in reforms in Utah in juvenile justice, this is a space where we don’t need this capacity anymore,” said Brett Peterson, the executive director of Utah’s Division of Juvenile Justice Services, told Fox13. “We’re able to reinvest our dollars in serving youth in their home, schools and communities.” It’s a result of a series of laws the Legislature passed beginning in 2017 dubbed “juvenile justice reform.” Instead of incarceration, the state has placed more of an emphasis on rehabilitation and community oversight for youth offenders. Funding has been shifted to ensure there are proper services to keep children facing what are termed “low risk” offenses out of detention facilities. The Utah Division of Juvenile Justice Services had actually planned to expand Wasatch Youth Center prior to the reform legislation. Instead, the land will be given back to the state for other needs.\n\nVermont\n\nSpringfield: The state plans to spend $25 million of its own funds to help redevelop old industrial sites. Historically, the costs of cleaning up former industrial sites that may be contaminated from previous industrial or commercial activities, known as “brownfields,” have been funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Vermont officials traveled Thursday to Springfield, where they highlighted that some of the state funds will be used to help redevelop the 270,000-square-foot former Jones & Lamson Machine Co. building that once employed 1,500 factory workers. Other sites that will be redeveloped with some of the money are in St. Albans and Burlington. “It’s an understatement to say this is just another brownfield site,” said Bob Flint, the executive director of the Springfield Regional Development Corp., which owns the 14-acre property. “This beats them all.” The projects were announced by Gov. Phil Scott. “This presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address longtime challenges and finally make good on the promise to increase economic equity from region to region and bring growth to all areas of the state, not just Chittenden County,” Scott said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Residents have a new digital option for proving they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Virginia Department of Health has added QR codes, barcodes that can be scanned with smartphones, to state COVID-19 vaccination records, officials announced Thursday. People will be able to prove they’ve been inoculated by showing a digital or printed QR code instead of a paper card, and they won’t need a special app. As more employers and businesses require employees and customers to be vaccinated, officials said this will boost the consistency and security of vaccination information while protecting individual privacy. Anyone vaccinated in Virginia can visit the department’s Vaccinate Virginia website to obtain their free vaccination record with QR code, which can then be saved to a phone gallery or printed out. The codes contain the same information as paper records, but the format offers more security, and the information is only available if a person chooses to share it, officials said. Because the digital records are digitally signed by the Department of Health, officials said they can’t be altered or forged. Businesses and employers can use a free app to scan the codes.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe has filed a class-action lawsuit against the city on behalf of its members and the public, saying the electric utility’s green power claims are misleading and hurting the tribe. The lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court on Friday seeks to stop Seattle City Light from claiming that it’s a fish-friendly, green and environmentally responsible utility until Seattle provides fish passage at its three Skagit River dams. “Until that happens, they are not as green as they say they are,” said Nino Maltos, chairman of the tribe. More than 80% of City Light’s energy comes from hydropower, which doesn’t directly emit climate-warming carbon dioxide. The city of Seattle is in the midst of a relicensing process for the dams. The tribe insists the utility can’t claim its dams are green while they block salmon passage on the region’s premier salmon river. Julie Moore, spokeswoman for Seattle City Light, said the utility won’t comment on litigation. But she said the relicensing process “gives us the opportunity to update the research and determine what additional measures may be necessary to protect fish moving forward. This includes looking at fish passage.” Native wild Chinook salmon, steelhead and resident bull trout within the Skagit River drainage all are threatened with extinction.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic this month has already doubled the total from August. There have been 286 reported deaths from COVID-19 in September and at least 3,370 since the start of the pandemic, according to state health data. The September total includes at least 32 virus-related deaths added to the count after being reconciled with official death certificates. Deaths during the pandemic peaked in January, when there were 654 reported from Jan. 4 to Jan. 31. They slowed to 49 total deaths in July but picked up again in August with 148. “We’re going to have a bunch more die. That’s all there is to it,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a news conference Friday. “And the only way we can stop it from being a bunch more and then a whole lot more on top of that, in my opinion, is one thing, and that’s to get vaccinated. I’m going to continue to plead with you to do that because I don’t know anything else we can do.” Justice lifted a statewide indoor mask requirement in June as the number of cases dropped, and he’s balked at issuing a mandate vaccination or new mask requirements. He has said mandating masks is “penalizing” some people, but he’s not convinced it’s going to significantly help as the pandemic goes unchecked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The return of a popular annual music festival wasn’t what some vendors expected. After the event was canceled last year due to the coronavirus, Summerfest 2021 ended with mixed reports. Sellers who set up shop for the first time generally marked it a success, while longtime vendors saw it as a “total bust.” Vendors said during Saturday’s final day of the two-week concert that the crowds had picked up a bit more from the start but remained low compared to previous years. Surging cases of the delta variant of the virus and new pandemic protocols were cited as possible factors. “This was not what I expected,” said Kagan Tate, owner of Butterfly Connection. “A total bust.” Tania Espinoza Bonilla, owner of T for Textile, was selling for the first time at a large festival. Although she didn’t see the crowds she had hoped for, she said she was thankful for the exposure and connections she made for her business. “I’m sure the vaccine rule made a lot of people angry, but I supported it,” she said. Even before the pandemic, Summerfest had already experienced reduced attendance and in 2019 saw the lowest participation since 1986 with just more than 718,000 festivalgoers. Officials have not provided daily attendance numbers and would not comment on the numbers while the event was running.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Human remains found in a reservoir on the Wyoming-Idaho state line have been identified as a kayaker who drowned in 1995, investigators said. Kyle Martin, 24, was kayaking on the Hoback River when a companion lost his paddle. Martin went ahead but was never seen alive again. Relatives of Martin and sheriff’s officials briefly saw Martin’s body after a helicopter dislodged his kayak from a snag in the river a couple of days later, Teton County sheriff’s deputy Dave Hodges told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “He separates, and he’s on the surface, but I didn’t expect him to then submerge almost as quickly as he emerged,” Hodges recalled. Last winter, Hodges saw an entry in Forensics Magazine about human remains found in Palisades Reservoir, downstream from the Hoback River. A DNA sample from Martin’s mother confirmed they were her son’s remains. Hodges called Martin’s brother with the news Sept. 10. “It was an incredible moment to call family after 26 years and say that your son and your brother is finally coming home,” Hodges said. “We both had a moment of tears. It was a sense of closure for a family that’s been waiting so long to have their son and their brother home.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/20/us/washington-dc-shooting-sunday/index.html", "title": "Gunfire near a concert in Washington, DC, kills a 15-year-old and ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA shooting near an unpermitted concert Sunday evening left a 15-year-old boy dead and several others wounded, according to police in Washington, DC.\n\nSeveral hundred people had gathered to hear music played from a truck on a street sidewalk, DC Police Chief Robert Contee told reporters.\n\nBefore the deadly melee, he said, two other incidents had already caused panic and trampling at the concert.\n\nOfficers responded and contained the area, ultimately shutting down the concert, Contee said. He did not provide details of the incident but said “people started to scatter at that point.”\n\nSeveral people suffered leg or ankle injuries as the crowd dispersed, the police chief said. He said emergency personnel recovered an illegal firearm from one person as they tended to the injured.\n\nAfterward, gunfire broke out near 14th and U Streets Northwest, close to the concert site. The 15-year-old boy was killed, and three adults were wounded, including a police officer, Contee said.\n\nThe officer and two adults were hospitalized in stable condition, he noted.\n\nSeveral firearms were discovered from the scene, including a handgun on one of the adults who was shot, Contee said.

To this day, we continue to deal with that.\"\n\nIn Delaware, most vacant homes are in New Castle County, and neighbors have to deal with the eyesores, drop in property values and other issues.\n\nIn an attempt to reduce the number of vacant properties, county officials are about to take up legislation that gives it the authority to add derelict and vacant homes to a registry and charge their owners a $1,000 fine atop a fee that escalates as the home remains unused.\n\nThe thinking is the fines will motivate the owners to sell to someone who will occupy the properties.\n\nLocal code enforcement officials have identified some 1,300 vacant homes in unincorporated areas of the county, but they said the total number is likely higher given that the rate of foreclosures in Delaware ranks third in the nation.\n\nPopo is the volunteer director of the Edgemoor Revitalization Cooperative Inc., a nonprofit civic group that links residents with social services and helps them become more financially stable through community programs. She said the community was hit especially hard by the housing crash of 2008, which proliferated vacancies. Nationally, housing values have nearly recovered, but values in her neighborhood haven't, she said.\n\n\"Vacancies definitely change the climate,\" Popo said.\n\nSuch homes are also a magnet for property crimes and squatters.\n\n\"Some of our vacancies have had issues with fires. I know of at least two incidents where fires were started in vacant homes,\" Popo said. \"That is a huge risk for neighborhoods and neighbors that are adjacent. It is terrifying.\"\n\nSuch homes are also a \"sign of the downward spiral for communities,\" said County Land Use General Manager Rich Hall.\n\nVacant homes also cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars each year as code enforcement officials often become the \"defacto property manager\" cutting the grass, fixing the roofs and in some cases demolishing them, Hall said.\n\nSTORY: New Castle County seeks remedies for 'zombie' homes\n\nSTORY: New Castle County creates vacant property registry\n\nFor years, the county has sought to get a handle on such properties.\n\nLawmakers created a registry two years ago that called for owners of vacant properties to register the homes and pay fees. But only a few hundred homes have been added, so the county now wants to be able to proactively list vacant homes and assess fines.\n\nThe legislation would give the county the authority to legally identify homes that have been vacant for more than 90 days through signs like property upkeep violations, delinquent taxes, disconnected utilities and other evidence. The new rules also build in safeguards to ensure a long vacation or active effort to sell a home doesn't get misconstrued as the abandonment of the building.\n\nThe rules would apply to commercial property as well.\n\nOnce a vacant property is identified, the county would try to give notice to the owner that registration to its database is required within 10 days. If that doesn't take place and no appeals are filed, the property owner would be assessed a $1,000 fine.\n\nThat is on top of fees that start at $100 for the first year of vacancy escalating to $5,000 if the property has been vacant for 10 years. That fee structure existed with the voluntary registry, but the fines are being increased to help cover the cost of maintaining vacant properties.\n\nThe point is not only to have more money for upkeep but also keep a better handle on who actually owns the vacant homes. Some banks often stall the foreclosure process, booting residents but not completing the change in ownership, making the process of assessing fines difficult, said Councilman David Tackett, who is sponsoring the legislation.\n\nSTORY: New Castle prom dress donation drive helps kids in need\n\nSTORY: Union heat defers action on NCCo bidding rules\n\n\"The majority are in this zombie state,\" Tackett said.\n\nThe new rules would apply a timeframe for a company that holds a mortgage to report that the property will become vacant if the mortgage is in default.\n\nPushing the banks\n\nThe updated registry is part of a number of changes the county is pushing to more efficiently move vacant homes to occupancy or sheriff sale.\n\n\"At the end of the day, money is a driver,\" Tackett said. \"If a bank starts to see major fees and fines racking up on a parcel, they are going to step up and take care of it.\"\n\nIf they don't, the county can use the accumulation of fines to move the property to sheriff sale, Tackett said.\n\nCounty Executive Matt Meyer said only a handful had moved to sheriff sale in recent years, and the county has a new goal of seeing 75 vacant homes through that process in the near future.\n\n\"We are taking what is a very serious problem and trying to turn it into an opportunity for neighborhoods,\" Meyer said.\n\nStatewide legislation is currently being discussed to prequalify bidders who might look to purchase a vacant home through sheriff sale.\n\nThe idea is to give priority to those who will quickly see the home reoccupied, rather than selling it to a speculator who might sit on it for years, said Carrie Casey, a manager within the county's Department of Community Services.\n\nRecent years have seen the county use state and federal grant money and other resources to flip vacant houses to groups like Habitat for Humanity. The county also has used housing grants to subsidize loans for residents to purchase vacant homes.\n\nCasey said the county wants to see more vacant homes moved through the sheriff sale process to a similar outcome.\n\n\"You don't want to keep that cycle of vacancy going,\" Casey said.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

Eugene Young, a former aide to New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, said city officials should work with community members to find solutions that work for them.

Mayor Dennis P. Williams and state Sen. Bob Marshall declined invitations.\n\nThroughout the question-and-answer session, candidates offered their visions. Young suggested a climate impact study to \"see what is upon the horizon.\" Former City Councilman Norman Griffiths said state, city and private sector should collaborate to invest in green technology like solar panels and preparation for sea level rise.

DelDOT projects that will increase to 1,205 trucks per day by 2040, which equates to about 20 percent of the traffic on that road. Officials say that is higher than average for similar roads in Delaware.\n\nWinzenried, who lives on Park Avenue near the intersection of U.S. 9, says the project calls for widening the road to include 10-foot shoulders on each side in his neighborhood. He says that will take a good chunk of his front yard and create even more truck noise, which he can clearly hear already.\n\n\"DelDOT says I'll be compensated for the land it takes, but that does nothing for the value of my real estate,\" he said. \"I don't think Route 9 should be a truck route at all. DelDOT should be removing truck traffic from residential and putting it in rural areas and that wasn't even on the table.\"\n\nREAD MORE: As Dogfish Head's old brewpub comes down, new courtyard coming\n\nDelDOT project manager John Caruano said the project is in the environmental assessment phase and will go right into a 30-day public comment phase before initial design takes place in spring 2018.\n\nConstruction on the Park Avenue Relocation project is set to begin in 2022 and will take two years to complete. The total cost estimate including construction, utility relocations, right-of-way and environmental mitigation is approximately $33.8 million, Caruano said.\n\nSussex County needs\n\nPark Avenue is just one of Sussex County's top transportation priorities.\n\nWith new commercial development occurring in the county’s industrial park, truck traffic along the Route 9 Truck Bypass will continue and increase in the years to come.\n\nCounty officials believe that beyond truck traffic, a project to realign and make other improvements along U.S. 9 would provide an opportunity for the state to enhance this route to improve safety for through-traffic and local motorists as well.\n\nIt could serve as the base of a future Georgetown bypass to accommodate through-traffic to and from the beaches, Sussex County officials said, as well as along the U.S. 113 corridor, which functions as a critical travel link for daily commuters.\n\nWhile Sussex County officials say the Park Avenue/U.S. 9 Truck Bypass east of Georgetown sits near the top of the county's list of critical projects, others might be equally pressing.\n\nThe FY18-FY23 Capital Transportation Program contains approximately $272 million in estimated state and federal funding for improvements to the county’s network of east-west routes. There is approximately $7 million in the budget for FY18 alone.\n\nProjects targeted for funding include preliminary engineering for Del. 24 improvements, continued improvements to the U.S. 9 corridor, construction of the North Millsboro Bypass, and construction of grade-separated intersections on Del. 16, Del. 18/404, and U.S. 9.\n\nIf current travel patterns continue as predicted, increased and frequent congestion will further interfere with local residents’ mobility in many areas.\n\nSussex County is Delaware’s largest county, with 938 square miles of land within its borders. Within that broad expanse is more than 37 percent of the state’s 6,281 miles of public roadway.\n\nThe most heavily traveled roadways are U.S. 13 and Del. 1 – each carrying more than 30,000 vehicles daily – followed by U.S. 113 with more than 24,000 vehicles daily.\n\nAt the same time, the major east-west routes also are heavily traveled, though these are less capable of extensive traffic. Congestion due to the movement of summer visitors often compounds traffic problems.\n\nDel. 24 is one of Sussex County’s primary east-west corridors. East-west routes are critical to allowing local motorists and destination drivers access to homes and commercial centers in the resort area.\n\nIn more recent years, these two-lane roads have been insufficient to safely and efficiently move traffic into and out of the area, particularly during peak summer months and evacuations.\n\n\"These roadways are antiquated and can't handle the current traffic,\" said Georgetown resident Donna Reynolds. \"Traffic flow into Five Points near Lewes is terrible.\"\n\nRELATED: Residents upset with Route 54 development, traffic pack town hall\n\nFive Points is located at the junction of U.S. 9, Del. 1, and Del. 404 about five miles west-northwest of Rehoboth Beach.\n\nThe Del. 404/18 corridor, which connects with U.S. 9 at Georgetown, is the principal means of east-west movement in Sussex County. This route, which connects to Route 404 in Maryland, is the gateway for beach-bound traffic during summer months, but a primary artery for local commuting traffic year-round.\n\nLawson says high traffic volume often limits this two-lane road’s capacity.\n\n\"Maryland is widening its portion of the route to accommodate east-west traffic to and from Delaware,\" he said. \"You can see the difference at the Delaware-Maryland border. That's going to be a problem. It will create a bottleneck for sure.\"\n\nSearching for solutions\n\nLawson spoke onstage Thursday before a crowd of more than 150 in the auditorium at Indian River High School in Dagsboro, during a town hall addressing another Sussex County transportation woe — traffic on Route 54.\n\nFor the first 30 minutes of the meeting, Lawson gave a presentation that outlined the role government entities play in matters of development.\n\nLawson explained the Planning and Zoning Commission dictates how an area will be zoned, and not much can be done by the county to change the roads.\n\n\"It just means that we have to follow the rules, and the rules are set forth for us by the laws of Delaware and code of Sussex County,\" he said.\n\n\"It's almost designed for failure,\" said Councilman Arlett. \"The county is in charge of the land use, but we're not in charge of the roads.\"\n\nMany residents expressed frustration that Thursday's town hall was scheduled the same time a Sussex County Planning and Zoning Commission meeting took place in Georgetown.\n\n\"One of their solutions for all of this is to get involved in the comprehensive planning and zoning process,\" said Kurt Schaab of Dagsboro. \"We couldn't be at both.\"\n\nBy the meeting's final hour, DelDOT chief engineer Rob McCleary took the stage to discuss what his department can do.\n\n\"There are a lot of folks that think DelDOT has the authority to stop development,\" he said. \"If I deny access to somebody who has the right to develop their property, I am denying access to the road, I'm denying their ability to develop.\"\n\nMcCleary explained that is public taking — a violation of a constitutional right and an expensive decision, considering developers would need to be compensated.\n\n\"It's their right to put up a Starbucks or a Dunkin Donuts,\" he said, noting developers still need to submit a plan for approval at the county level and the state level at DelDOT. \"We have laid out very clearly what standards they have to meet. If they show that on the plans, then it gets approved.\"\n\nBut, McCleary said, DelDOT could do something with Route 54 now.\n\n\"We can look at better synching of lights, we can look at if the turn lanes appropriate,\" he said. \"We can look at operational-type improvements. All of the entrances that come out onto the highway, they all create that side friction — that impacts the capacity of the road. We could do some things to channelize them.\"\n\nIn response, many residents called for widening Route 54 or creating another evacuation route, citing anxieties triggered by footage of Floridians attempting to flee as Hurricane Irma approached in September.\n\nMcCleary explained widening that route is \"expensive and extremely impactive to the community.\"\n\n\"The answer to evacuation is to leave early,\" he said.\n\nAs the meeting continued, many residents began to trickle out, shaking their heads and meeting outside the auditorium to vent.\n\nFor Nancy Flacco, a homeowner along Route 54 since 2000, the fight for change appears to be over.\n\n\"After burying two nieces from car accidents in New Castle County, we came down here,\" Flacco said. \"Now, another one's gonna happen — that has influenced me to leave. I don't want to be the next one in my family to die of a car accident.\"\n\nRon Lewis, of Fenwick Island, said he has seen traffic conditions worsen along Route 54, but acknowledges it's an issue without a simple answer.\n\n\"People want a moratorium on building, but the county and state depend on property transfer taxes in order to keep our taxes low,\" he said. \"These poor guys from DelDOT are being asked to address issues that are not their responsibility — I feel bad for them.\"\n\nThe town hall ended around 8:45 p.m., capping more than three hours of discussion, leaving many residents feeling unsatisfied.\n\n\"Everybody's pointing in the other direction as to whose problem it is,\" said Mike Harding, a resident along Route 20 of five years. \"We're not opposed to growth, but there needs to be control of the amount of growth.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/09/06/politics-gums-up-new-castle-county-projects/633998001/", "title": "Politics gums up New Castle County projects", "text": "A clash of politics and public safety has New Castle County government at an impasse unseen in decades.\n\nLast week, five members of New Castle County Council voted to withhold authority for County Executive Matt Meyer's administration to borrow money for planned sewer, street, stormwater and public safety projects for this year.\n\nGranting that ability has been typically been routine but has been withheld from Meyer in a conflict that has both sides howling about backdoor politics.\n\n\"A minority of County Council are playing this old-school, I-scratch-your-back-you-scratch-mine game,\" Meyer said. \"I'm refusing to play.\"\n\nSpecifically, Meyer is referring to Councilmen Bill Bell and Bill Powers, who represent the county south of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal and have led the effort to deny the bonding authority. They contend Meyer is \"disrespecting\" the wishes of County Council by considering relocating a planned paramedic station at Boyd's Corner to elsewhere.\n\n\"I don't know why, when this thing was properly planned, we have to consider putting it somewhere else,\" Bell said. \"There are clearly things that are going on, and have been going on, behind our backs.\"\n\nBoth sides say they are being motivated only by the best interests of the people who live south of the C&D Canal, creating a stalemate that has lasted all summer.\n\nAbout once every two years, the county borrows money to complete major public works projects like sewers, libraries and government facilities. Long-tenured government officials say this is the first time in decades such borrowing authority has been withheld.\n\nMeyer contends council members are taking an unrelated issue and holding hostage county projects scheduled to be started this summer. Last week, his administration presented a list of projects originally scheduled to be started in the first quarter of this year that are being delayed because the county can't borrow money.\n\nSTORY: Growing Middletown to add paramedic station\n\nSTORY: Southern NCCo ambulance services expanding\n\nThose include replacing the play equipment at three local parks and security upgrades to three other parks. It also includes the replacement of the air conditioning system in the county's 911 Center and repairs and rehabilitation of various county sewer lines and stormwater basins in seven neighborhoods.\n\nIn all, county officials have said about $7 million in projects have been delayed. These projects were approved as part of the county's capital budget earlier this year, though another approval is needed to borrow the money to execute that spending plan.\n\n\"They are saying the county executive needs to do this — completely unrelated to the bonding authority — to get my vote,\" Meyer said. \"It is an old-school game, and we are not playing.\"\n\nThe granting of borrowing authority requires a supermajority, or 10 votes, of the County Council. Bell and Powers have been supported in their effort by different council members at different times.\n\n\"I have no other mechanism to send a message loud and clear,\" Bell said. \"... This paramedic station was well thought out.\"\n\nThe county's advanced life support paramedics operate out of a former police substation in Middletown, which county officials have said is inadequate to support growth and requires paramedic supplies to be stored in vehicles that are parked outside a temperature-controlled garage.\n\nThe county had previously set aside more than $4 million to design and build a new station. Last year, County Council approved spending $718,000 to purchase five acres for a new paramedic station at the intersection of Boyd's Corner Road and U.S. 13 east of Middletown.\n\nThat came after multiple false-starts at other proposed locations.\n\nPowers and Bell said officials settled on Boyd's Corner so emergency responders will not be caught in Middletown's traffic. Prior to the council vote, the location was endorsed by public safety officials including Chief of Emergency Medical Services Lawrence Tan.\n\nThis week, Tan said the Boyd's Corner location was appropriate for the size of the station the county had planned and also had attractive access to major highways nearby.\n\nSTORY: County park proposal would derail housing project\n\nSTORY: Delaware Sports Complex in Middletown files for bankruptcy\n\n\"Boyd's Corner would meet the needs,\" Tan said.\n\nThe transaction is still pending final execution and Meyer has said he will not be \"held hostage\" by a prior administration's decision.\n\nHe's said he wants to look at data showing where calls for service most frequently come from. He said he's received feedback from those who feel the station should be at Boyd's Corner and those who feel it should be elsewhere.\n\nBell said Meyer is ignoring the wishes of County Council, which in a symbolic vote last week reaffirmed its support for the Boyd's Corner location with only Councilwoman Lisa Diller not voting.\n\n\"I'm a little fed up,\" Bell said. \"Somewhere, somehow we have to be respected a little more.\"\n\nPowers has accused Meyer of listening too closely to Middletown Mayor Ken Branner, who supported Meyer during last year's election. Branner hasn't answered questions about where he feels the station should be located or returned phone calls seeking comment.\n\nMeyer denies Branner has any influence over the decision.\n\nWhile Boyd's Corner would meet the need, Tan said he didn't think it was unusual for a new executive to re-evaluate major projects.\n\n\"This particular project has been something we have been working on a number of years through three or four different administrations,\" Tan said. \"This is not something new to me quite frankly.\"\n\nKathy Jennings, Meyer's chief administrative officer, emphasized that Meyer was simply taking a \"fresh look\" and that the administration \"hopes\" to have a decision on the location within the next few months.\n\nCouncilman George Smiley said it needs to happen soon.\n\n\"You are elected by the residents and they all have different opinions,\" Smiley said. \"At the end of the day, we are elected to make the tough decisions and it is time for him to make one on this issue and put it behind us.\"\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

Bobby Marshall, D-Wilmington, outlined the funding Thursday, saying he wants the investments to be implemented quickly so that city residents can soon see the benefits.\n\nMayor Dennis P. Williams said in a statement that he appreciates state lawmakers’ investment in Wilmington.\n\n“The administration hopes to continue engaging in an open dialogue with the city delegation and state legislators to find solutions to budget challenges, while maintaining the necessary support for cities and local municipalities throughout the state,” Williams said.\n\nThe funding includes:\n\n• $1 million for renovations to Frawley Stadium.\n\n• $750,000 for the Wilmington Police Department to implement a Real Time Crime Center.\n\n• $500,000 for three park improvement projects championed by West Side Grows Together and the individual communities around the parks.\n\n• $400,000 for the renovation of the Boys and Girls Club on Jackson Street in the city’s Hedgeville neighborhood.\n\nFrawley Stadium\n\nThe city’s minor league baseball team announced plans to renovate the stadium in December, but have not released details about what the improvements will entail or when they will begin. At the time, owners Clark Minker and Dave Heller said they expected the refurbished ballpark to be opened for the Blue Rocks’ 25th anniversary season in 2016.\n\nA spokesman for the team said he was not authorized to comment when reached by phone Thursday night and a call to Minker was not returned.\n\nMarshall said the renovations are much needed at the stadium and are in order to finalize a deal with a new minor league team to make their home at the field.\n\n“This would be an appropriate time to commit state funds to the renovation so that we can get that Double-A team in Wilmington,” Marshall said.\n\nState Sen. Greg Lavelle, R-Sharpley, said the Republican caucus felt the priority for funding in the legislature should have been on public safety concerns, including funding for police in Sussex County or for foot patrols in Wilmington, not on the stadium.\n\n“In terms of priorities, I thought that was a misplaced priority,” Lavelle said, adding he doesn’t mean to say the stadium shouldn’t have received public money.\n\n“It was a very difficult year,” Lavelle said. “It is very easy to say in a $3.9 million budget, ‘I didn’t like this.’”\n\nPublic safety\n\nAlthough Attorney General Matt Denn was unsuccessful in securing funding to continue overtime foot patrol units in Wilmington, the state did support funding to the city’s police department. An allocation of $750,000 was included to fund the creation of a Real Time Crime Center. The city had initially requested $1 million for the center, which will be a hub for monitoring surveillance video and police activities.\n\nWilliams said while the city did not receive the full amount requested, he believes the department can use what money was allocated to move forward with the center. Councilman Mike Brown, chairman of the council’s public safety committee, agreed, saying the crime center is an important piece to improving safety.\n\n“We were looking for a million, but three quarters of a loaf are better than none,” Brown said.\n\nThe center is modeled after one used by Camden County, New Jersey, police to observe incidents and direct police officers to locations. The Camden County crime center was funded through about $4.5 million of federal, state and local funds, according to Dan Keashen, spokesman for Camden County.\n\nThe New Castle County Police Department in April unveiled a similar facility, the J. William Bell Fusion Center, which uses real-time data and video feeds from up to 16 sources. The center is in the Paul J. Sweeney Public Safety Building in Minquadale.\n\nWest Side parks\n\nThe city was also awarded $500,000 to fund improvements to three separate community parks in the West Side: Connell Street Park, Fourth Street Park and Father Tucker Park.\n\nThe projects have been planned, but the city did not have enough funding to complete the community supported plans, said Christian Willauer, director of community and economic development with West Side Grows. West Side Grows has been helping the community groups around the parks champion for improvements.\n\nLottie Lee-Davis, a pastor at Be Ready Jesus Is Coming Church at Fourth and Rodney streets, said the investment is welcome news to her and the community members who have been working to change the park.\n\n“Right now it is used by the very wrong people for drug use, prostitution, open sales, open use and a lot of trash,” Lee-Davis said. “We are looking forward to turning it into a park that children will feel safe to come to.”\n\nJackson Street Boys and Girls Club\n\nThe shuttered Jackson Street Boys and Girls Club was also given a chance at revival through state funding allocated this year, Marshall said. At his request $400,000 was placed in the state bond bill to go to the club, which is in need of many renovations before it can reopen.\n\nThe club was closed five years ago because the club could not afford renovations, Marshall said.\n\n“We had an estimate of about $300,000 to do the renovation work, but I thought it appropriate that we increase the amount of money to $400,000 to allow for any cost overruns,” Marshall said, adding he believes the club has allocated money for operating costs if the building does reopen.\n\nNeighbors in the Hedgeville community, where the club is located, said reopening the building would be a positive change.\n\n“All the kids, they have nothing to do,” said Niki DeAngelo, who runs a community garden across the street from the club. “They are just running around. I think if they had activities and if it was run well it would be a good thing.”\n\nContact Jenna Pizzi at jpizzi@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2837.

That is unless the County Council approves a waiver to exempt a project from those rules.\n\nThe waiver granted by the County Council will allow the private school to move forward in its application to build three, three-story buildings on a 41-acre cornfield at Beaver Valley Road and Concord Pike in Brandywine Hundred.\n\n\n\nDevelopment plans are still awaiting final approval, but Wendie Stabler, attorney for the university, told the County Council last week that granting the waiver provides a \"safety valve\" through traffic rules that have stymied other developments, frustrating the local development community.\n\n\n\nWhen projected traffic from a development pushes traffic congestion beyond acceptable levels at a nearby intersection, the developer is typically required to pay for sometimes expensive road improvements to allow the project to move forward. An intersection is considered failing when it takes more than 55 seconds to pass through at peak traffic hours. Left-hand turns usually are the longest.\n\nIn the university's case, the intersection of Naamans Road and Concord Pike will be congested beyond acceptable levels under county rules.\n\nStabler said the traffic problem could have been mitigated in the short term by converting one of the through lanes on Naamans Road across Concord Pike into a left-hand turn lane onto Concord Pike. She said state traffic planners didn't like that solution because it would have caused additional congestion at the intersection in the coming years.\n\nAnother solution would have been widening Naamans Road to make room for the additional left-hand lane. She said state planners didn't like that solution because it would have negatively impacted the entrances and exits to businesses near the intersection.\n\n\"They felt that because of the mitigation proposed which would address a lot of concern ... that on balance it was much better to approve the traffic waiver instead,\" Stabler said.\n\nTo receive the waiver, the university had to agree to take steps to lessen its traffic impact during rush-hour times in mornings and evenings by 15 percent. Stabler said 85 percent of the facility's class times will be scheduled to avoid putting cars on the road during peak traffic hours.\n\n\"The beauty of this particular project is we are uniquely situated to manage traffic,\" Stabler told the County Council's Land Use Committee last week.\n\nOPINION: Wilmington University best choice for Concord Pike site\n\nSTORY: TNJ Poll - Townsend, Rochester lead House race\n\nThe school also will provide students and employees real-time information about bus routes and transportation options other than cars. Stabler said the university will provide other incentives for those who come to school together or take transit and provide opportunities for employees to work remotely.\n\n\n\nThe university also must pay a bond to the state that can be tapped if efforts to reduce traffic burdens are not taken.\n\n\n\nCouncilman Bob Weiner, who represents the area, said he believes the mitigation efforts will make the university's impact on traffic congestion minimal.\n\n\n\n\"The intersection has one failing turning movement, but because of the mitigation plan we are taking an intersection that is problematic but not really making it any worse,\" Weiner said.\n\n\n\nCouncilman John Cartier, who represents nearby portions of Brandywine Hundred, said the development is worthy of the waiver because it will contribute to the area.\n\n\"I’ve watched, for years, potential development at this intersection that would have had absolutely devastating impact,\" Cartier said during a committee meeting last week. \"This use, and their ability to shift demand with classroom time, is a perfect fit.\"\n\nThe plot has been eyed by developers in the past as open space along Concord Pike becomes rarer. In 2007, Stoltz Real Estate Partners proposed a 237,000-square-foot mixed-use shopping center with a Whole Foods, 86 residences and 120-room hotel site on the plot. That proposal was eventually torpedoed by traffic concerns.\n\nThe traffic rules are outlined in county building code and have been an ongoing source of friction with business leaders and developers.\n\nOnly three waivers have been granted since the county reformatted the process in 2000. Christiana Care Health System in 2002 received one to accommodate a 1.1 million-square-foot expansion of Christiana Hospital. Two years earlier, DuPont Co. was also granted a waiver for its Experimental Station in Alapocas.\n\nWeiner sponsored legislation that outlined the traffic mitigation and monitoring agreements. He said previous waivers were given out \"on a political basis like candy.\"\n\nIn 2000, AstraZeneca received a waiver to build its Fairfax headquarters larger than traffic rules would have allowed.\n\nThe plans represent an eight- to nine-year build-out that will likely be constructed in three phases. The timing of those phases will be dictated by the university's growth, Stabler said.\n\nStabler said the school seeks to start construction by the end of the year.\n\nThe full designs dictate that buildings, parking lots, roadways and sidewalks will occupy about 12 acres of the property, with open space remaining on 29 acres of the 41-acre tract. Plans call for three buildings framing an existing wooded area and pond. The university wants to maintain that wooded and wet area as something pleasant for students to look at, officials have said. The university's Du Pont Highway campus near New Castle will remain the main campus and host top administrative offices.\n\nThe campus is being planned on a parcel that was owned for decades by Woodlawn Trustees Inc. of Wilmington, in an area that has seen rapid growth and business development.\n\nLocal preservation groups have criticized Woodlawn for allowing the planned development of land in the nearby Beaver Valley and neighboring the First State National Historic Park.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

It has since been changed, as the organization remains nonpartisan.\n\nAt-Large seat\n\nTashiba A. Graham, 40, Townsend\n\nBackground: Tashiba Graham is vice president of operations and innovation for a healthcare system in Pennsylvania. The mother of two has a youngest son in the Appoquinimink School District.\n\nIssues: According to Graham, the focus of her campaign is advocating for students with special needs, school safety and teacher retention. She shared her intention to introduce regular assemblies to combat bullying and violence in schools and address general mental wellness among students.\n\nGraham has stated her support for paying teachers and staff members a more competitive salary and improving incentives for new candidates while also evaluating what factors are working to keep staff members in the district. Engaging family members on resources available for students is another priority of hers.\n\nIn response to ACLU-DE voters guide questionnaire regarding national movements restricting certain curriculum material, Graham remains adamant that policies must be put in place to keep the district’s curriculum factual and comprehensive and protect the rights and inclusion of LGBTQ+ students. Graham has been supported by Appoquinimink Educational Support Professionals, First State Action Fund and more.\n\nEducation roundup:Delaware is 1 of 5 states to get $1 million for tutoring in schools\n\nTimothy W. Johns, 57, Middletown\n\nNote: This candidate did not return any requests for contribution from Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nBackground: Timothy Johns is an entrepreneur and co-founder of Heaven’s Gate Ministries, which he runs with his wife, Monique, in Newark. As co-founder, Johns oversees nonprofit charity work and established a leadership institute, where he has worked as an educator for 12 years. The U.S Army veteran is a father of four adult children.\n\nIssues: Johns says he's mainly concerned with bridging the achievement gap between students of different backgrounds and accessibilities, while setting students up for success in the global marketplace with leadership skills.\n\nJohns has stated during a public Q&A session that he believes conversations related to sexual orientation and gender identity are “family matters\" and should be left out of the classroom. He proposes setting up a public forum where debates about curriculum censorship can take place and be evaluated fairly.\n\nRestorative justice is another hallmark of Johns’ campaign, he told ACLU-DE in its voter guide, which includes training staff members and SROs about de-escalation techniques. He also proposes enhancing parent participation within the district by holding parent education classes focused on child development and communication.\n\nRaymond J. Petkevis, 45, Middletown\n\nBackground: Raymond Petkevis is a real estate broker for Keller Williams Realty around the Middletown area and recently started a position as Delaware’s principal broker for REAL, a virtual-based real estate company. His two children are students in Appoquinimink.\n\nIssues: Petkevis has mainly expressed concerns about violence in schools, citing outreach from community members worried about student safety. To combat this, reevaluating measures of rule enforcement and the district’s code of conduct have been suggested by the candidate.\n\nThe district’s teacher shortage and dwindling test scores are intertwined with issues related to violence in the district, according to Petkevis. In response to Citizens For Delaware Schools', he also recommended potentially soliciting funding from local developers to go toward the district’s resources and implementing financial responsibility into the curriculum for high school students.\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nAlfred G.

The alumna of Red Clay Public Schools holds a bachelor's degree in dance, as well as another bachelor's degree in English and a master's in education from the University of Delaware. Gilbert is a certified teacher, with experience from K-12 special education to high school English Language Arts, though currently a stay-at-home mother to her four children. Her two daughters and two sons attended private schools in Delaware.\n\nIssues: “Let me be clear,\" wrote this candidate on her Facebook page, operating as a landing pad for other campaign materials. \"The school’s role is to educate, NOT indoctrinate. Reading, writing, mathematics (not Common Core), true history (not Critical Race Theory or whatever name they’ve morphed it to).”\n\nGilbert said plummeting test scores in the district motivate her to run, alongside hopes to boost graduation rates and college readiness. She lists safety, effectiveness, curriculum and transparency as her priorities on her website. Among top-of-mind issues, she also noted parents and guardians \"will have their voices heard.\"\n\nLearning loss concerns:What’s the cost of failing math? Well, for Delaware kids it could be $66 billion\n\nDouglas Danger Manley, 38, Newark\n\nBackground: Manley works at a cybersecurity startup as a software engineer, an industry and occupation he’s found himself in for about 17 years. The Newark resident is also a volunteer firefighter with Mill Creek Fire Company, where he’s been for the past decade. He’s now its president, after having served on the board for three years.\n\nManaging a $3-4 million budget with Mill Creek, Manley told The News Journal/Delaware Online he’s used to dealing with a fixed amount of funding from state and local governments — which leave a “need to squeeze every bit of value out of that funding as we can to provide our services.”\n\nIssues: Manley has no children, and he sees that as an asset. He says this will allow him to maintain a public-service perspective. The candidate shared his focus on supporting resources for Christina School District, sharpening communication and community engagement. He also said protecting students will be a priority, especially gay or transgender children — but he hopes the district “focuses on its mission of education and doesn't get lost in the mire” of various culture wars.\n\nDistrict E\n\nY.F. Lou, 36, Newark\n\nBackground: The single father of two children, enrolled in Christina, works with the state’s health department, where he said his work focuses on improving healthcare for the most vulnerable in long-term care facilities. He also serves as a volunteer firefighter for Aetna Hose, Hook and Ladder Company. Lou's family moved to Delaware from China when he was young, an experience the candidate believes will allow him to advocate for Christina's diverse student body, as he said in a late-March candidate forum. He attended public school in Lewes, graduated from the University of Delaware, and has been a full-time Newark resident since 2012. Lou also attended both University of Southern California and Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health for graduate degrees.\n\nIssues: With an 8-year-old at West Park Elementary — and a 5-year-old headed there in the fall — Lou finds himself motivated by three key issues: safety, community engagement and a goal to \"broaden our students’ horizons.\"\n\nFor Lou, safety includes keeping guns out of schools, \"fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all of our students especially those most vulnerable,\" as well as monitoring environmental health and safety, such as lead. Community and stakeholder engagement, as he put it, focuses on how the pandemic created opportunities to capitalize on for information sharing and family engagement. In terms of broadening horizons, the candidate hopes to see more support of art programs to keep students \"curious and innovative.\"\n\nYong Peng, 53, Newark\n\nBackground: Peng works for the federal government as a software engineer, having previously worked for companies like Delmarva Power and Bank of America. Peng, in one candidate forum, called himself a “happy immigrant” focused on giving back to Delaware. Peng was born in China and came to the U.S. to study. The 15-year resident of Newark has a doctorate in physics, having worked in research and teaching at a few universities before his current line of work. Peng said he has also worked as a math tutor in Wilmington.\n\nIssues: Peng said he sees a “crisis in public education.” Two issues are top-of-mind for the father of two. One, he perceives too much focus on topics that are “ignoring the core curriculum,” which are reading, writing and math. He didn't elaborate. Two, he believes school policies are failing at “enhancing the parent's right to oversee their children’s education.” Peng said his daughter used to study in Christina School District, though no longer, and now he is running for the future of the community.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nPulaski Elementary School , 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington\n\n, 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington The Bancroft School , 700 N.

Before that, English-Wynn worked in the Department of Labor as a deputy principal. This career, the candidate said, meets more than 10 years of experience in mentorship and advocacy connected to K-12 education and the community. A \"proud alumna\" of Red Clay schools herself, English-Wynn also has a young child entering the district this fall. She said the Wilmington district prepared her for later degrees from Wilmington University and Delaware State.\n\nIssues: The alumna said the impact of both \"a supportive community and quality education\" are keys to students succeeding. She noted three issues motivating her campaign: equity and access, parent engagement and support for educators.\n\nWilmington:They struggled during Ida. Now one Wilmington community is finding a better way to respond\n\nJohn Shulli, 50, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Born and raised in Wilmington, Shulli returned to his home state after 26 years in the U.S. Army and Department of Defense — 22 of which were spent overseas. He works in a civilian job on A.I. policy for the Pentagon, as well as teaches part time as a colonel in the Army Reserve. He graduated from John Dickinson High School before attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.\n\nIssues: Shulli said he's motivated to run by the \"severe\" learning loss faced since the pandemic and highlighted in state and district's statistics. The district must, as he sees it, \"restore our children’s academic standings so they can compete in a local, regional, national and global jobs market.\"\n\nDistrict D\n\nCarlucci Coelho, 53, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Coelho said he came to the U.S. hoping to work as an artist. He has worked in real estate since 2017, as well as the nonprofit sector. He earned a two-year degree in fashion business, according to his website, alongside a parallel degree in costume and set design while studying in Portugal. Though he doesn't have kids enrolled in the district, Coelho said he's been close to the community for over 30 years. Coelho also ran for state representative as a Republican last year, but did not secure a win in District 13.\n\nIssues: Coelho stressed that he is against any kind of bullying, citing that protecting safety in schools is paramount in his platform. Another motivating issue is budgeting, making sure money is distributed \"to those schools and programs who need the most.\" He also said he supports strong academics alongside more vocational training in every school.\n\nIn other background, in response to a question for the ACLU-DE voter's guide about the teaching of U.S. history and whether students have the right to learn free of viewpoint-based censorship, Coelho said parents should have \"the choice of accepting or denying what their own kids have the right or not to read. These children have parents who have different views about life and we must respect all parents views.\" Also when running for state representative, the candidate expressed support for a failed 2022 bill aimed at barring transgender athletes to compete in school sports, saying: \"Woman sports is woman sports.\"\n\nJose Matthews, 27, Elsmere\n\nBackground: Matthews has represented District D on the Red Clay School Board since 2018. Working in the healthcare field in different capacities over the last six years, his day job is working a community liaison for Rockford Center, a community mental health organization. The incumbent lives in Elsmere with his husband, who is a teacher.\n\nIssues: Matthews said he wants to keep up his work. In his first term, he said, the board tackled many issues related to equity around the pandemic, one being transparency. He said he \"was one of the biggest supporters on the board to make sure we continue to provide a Zoom option both to watch the meetings and to participate in public comment.\" If elected, he hopes to continue to offer that access.\n\nRed Clay has fallen behind other northern New Castle County districts, Matthews said, in terms of keep up with building maintenance and competitive salaries. He plans to make that competitiveness a priority, even if it means the district's first referendum in nearly a decade. He also aims to maintain a focus on family and parent engagement.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nActivity Center at Hockessin PAL , 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin\n\n, 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin AI DuPont High School , 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington\n\n, 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington Baltz Elementary School ,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington\n\n,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington Cab Calloway School of Arts , 100 N.

For four years, she's handled zoning variance requests on the town of Smyrna's Board of Adjustment. She’s a member of the Alpha Beta Gamma sorority at Delaware Technical Community College, the Holly’s Club and the Boys and Girls Club board.\n\nIssues: Fontaine St. Pierre decided to run for the board because she wants to serve as “a liaison between parents, teachers and the community, providing the best resources for our children's education, and allowing parents to have the most influence in their children's life.” She wants to recognize and prioritize instructors' interests and concerns.\n\nShe said the most important issues in the district are continuing to push for high-quality, intellectually-rigorous education to prepare students for the competitive labor market, providing safe schools, confronting bullying and cyberbullying and expanding self-esteem initiatives for students.\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “An inclusive educational system offers various advantages, including enhanced educational quality for all students and assisting students in becoming more responsive to an inclusive attitude. This could also help with behavioral issues, self-esteem, social skills, and community involvement. All students have the right to a challenging core education and outstanding instruction from well-trained educators. Students should be allowed to have an open and honest discussion about America's past, and they deserve to see themselves and the issues that impact them reflected in their classrooms and books.”\n\nShe encourages parents to attend board meetings to address issues and share comments and insights.\n\nBobbi Jo Webber, 44, Kenton\n\nBackground: A farmer for over 25 years along with her husband on their family’s farm, she has two children, a son who is a freshman at Smyrna High School and a daughter in sixth grade at Clayton Intermediate School. She’s volunteered for 10 years at Sunnyside Elementary and at Clayton Intermediate School, running fundraisers, helping teachers in classrooms and hosting free field trips at her family’s farm.\n\nIssues: Webber wanted to run for school board to improve safety, success of students, transparency and teacher compensation. She believes teachers and staff should hold students accountable for misconduct and follow through with consequences, but also favors hiring constables “who will help pull some of that responsibility off of the teachers so that they can focus on education.” She wants the administration to notify parents “about important issues that occur in the schools – the good and the bad.” She favors competitive pay: “We cannot lose these amazing educators we have to neighboring districts because of financial reasons.”\n\nIn regard to issues like critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “All races and groups should be represented in our classes. Our students should be exposed to a well-rounded curriculum. Bias and unfounded opinion do not belong in the classroom.”\n\nOn transgender policies, Webber said, “I believe that students can express themselves in a way that they feel is appropriate, although personal expression cannot become a distraction for other students. I do not approve of transgender students using the locker room or restroom of their choice of gender. I feel it could develop into an unsafe and distracting situation for other students.\"\n\nIn curriculum decisions, she said parents and community members should have their opinions represented, but they also need to trust educators to make decisions that will benefit students’ education.\n\nPolling places, open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/11/12/legoland-ny-seeks-early-opening-as-covid-19-cases-rise-coronavirus/6261855002/", "title": "Legoland NY seeks to open as soon as November as COVID-19 ...", "text": "GOSHEN – The Town of Goshen Planning Board on Wednesday night granted Legoland New York permission to partially open early.\n\nBut that permission is contingent on approval from state authorities during the pandemic and the park meeting building, traffic and site safety standards.\n\nThe amusement park's owner, U.K.-based Merlin Entertainments, wants to open for up to 1,400 visitors per day, sometime between November into January, according to planning board chairman Lee Bergus.\n\nBefore the pandemic, park leaders projected up to 10,000 visitors per day between Legoland's peak months of April to October.\n\nThe planning board on Wednesday night voted 6-0 to sign off, pending state approval and other site safety requirements such as cordoning off construction areas, for invitation-only guests.\n\nLegoland New York's invited guests could include individuals who purchased season tickets for what had been a planned spring opening until the coronavirus pandemic postponed it, Bergus said.\n\nThe planning board's conditional approval came on the same day that Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that, with coronavirus cases rising, New York leaders are adding new restrictions for bars, gyms, restaurants and home social gatherings.\n\nSet to take effect Friday night, the new state restrictions include no more than 10 people being allowed for home gatherings and restaurants and gyms closing by 10 p.m.\n\nMore:Legoland NY nears completion, but challenges abound, including when state will let it open\n\nMore:Legoland construction continues\n\nThe Goshen planning board’s conditional approval permits the park to open the Bricktopia Restaurant and Brick Street; the Bricktopia and Build and Test attractions, the Lego Robotics area, the Factory Tour Ride; the Duplo Train; DJ's Dizzy Disco Spin; the Lego Big Shop (a store); the Lego Bakery and Café; the park’s ticketing and guest services area; a carousel and the Goshen portion of Miniland, which features Lego brick versions of Goshen landmarks, according to documents submitted by Legoland to the planning board.\n\nCoronavirus cases continue rise\n\nLeaders of the $500 million amusement park, located just off state Route 17’s Exit 125, have told the planning board that Legoland New York's full opening could occur in the spring, perhaps around Memorial Day or May 31, Bergus said.\n\nBut, as with the planning board’s Wednesday conditional approval, the date for that full opening of what will be the largest of eight Legolands worldwide also is contingent on state leaders signing off during the pandemic.\n\nLocally, the town planning board did not have the authority to prevent the park from opening due to pandemic-related safety – only whether Legoland’s traffic plans, construction site, buildings and lighting, among other factors, were safe, Bergus said. A new Exit 125 along state Rt. 17 has yet to be completed.\n\n“Legoland does not have a blanket approval to open early,” Bergus stressed. “It absolutely must meet the state Department of Transportation, the state Department of Health and the governor’s approvals” for safety.\n\nNeither Gov. Cuomo’s office nor a Legoland spokesman initially responded to requests to comment by deadline Thursday. Goshen Supervisor Doug Bloomfield, a staunch Legoland supporter, was unavailable to comment, his assistant said.\n\nLate Thursday afternoon, Legoland spokesman Matt Besterman released a statement acknowledging that “the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic (necessitate) further approval” by state leaders for the park to hold any “sneak peek” opening.\n\n“At this time, an (invitation-only opening) event in the immediate future would not be permitted, but we are open to the possibility when the time is right,” Besterman wrote.\n\nCuomo recently said New York had 4,820 new COVID-19 infections statewide, as of Tuesday, a nearly 3% positive rate, along with 1,628 hospitalizations and 21 fatalities. At different points before the recent case surge, statewide and in the Hudson Valley, positive rates had dipped to 1 percent or lower.\n\nDr. Marina Keller, an infectious disease doctor with Middletown Medical, a large multi-specialty practice, was surprised at the news of Legoland trying to open early.\n\n“I haven’t seen their (coronavirus) safety plan, (but) from an infection control standpoint, New York is looking at decreasing the number of people gathering,” Keller said. “We want people to stay put, not to gather and travel. Large facilities like amusement parks attract people from a long distance, including potentially from other states” with higher COVID-19 rates.\n\nChris Miele, a leading local citizen activist and president of Concerned Citizens for the Hudson Valley, accused Legoland of “putting its financial situation ahead of the concerns of the children it makes its money off of.”\n\nOther amusement parks allowed to open?\n\nGoshen Town Councilman Ken Newbold, a Democrat and an opponent of Bloomfield, a Republican, in the last Goshen supervisor election, agreed with Miele.\n\n“It’s an insult to the community to request having that many people in Goshen,” Newbold said. “Why would you ask to bring up 10,000 people per week into town in the middle of a pandemic while schools are closed?”\n\nMore:The Castle Fun Center, a 28-year-old local landmark, up for sale, another pandemic victim owner says\n\nMore:COVID-19 has some New York water parks giving up on summer. Others hold out hope.\n\nBefore opening, Legoland must “present a plan to address public health concerns that the state would have to approve” in consultation with county health authorities, said Justin Rodriguez, an Orange County government spokesman.\n\nState and local authorities must apply their decisions evenhandedly, said Brian Leentjes, owner of the Castle Fun Center, a beloved, 28-year-old amusement park – located four miles away in Chester – that’s struggled mightily due to pandemic-related opening restrictions.\n\n“If Legoland can open up, that means our doors can open up,” Leentjes said.\n\ndaxelrod@th-record.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/maryland/2022/10/24/wicomico-county-board-of-education-candidates-2022-qa-book-bans-crt-school-safety/69575112007/", "title": "Wicomico County Board of Education candidates 2022 Q&A: book ...", "text": "The Local News Network at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism and Capital News Service\n\nHot button topics in education have made national headlines this year. And those issues have surfaced in what's become hotly contested school board races.\n\nIn Wicomico County, where an elected school board is still fairly new, the Board of Education contests have followed that path, taking tones from national conversations.\n\nThe Local News Network at the University of Maryland's Philip Merrill College of Journalism and Capital News Service compiled school board candidate Q&As. In all, 155 local boards of education candidates in Maryland were surveyed, 102 of which responded.\n\nIn Wicomico County, nine of the 14 candidates for Board of Education responded. Wicomico's school board is nonpartisan.\n\nCandidates were asked about the most important issue facing schools, concerns they have about school safety, concerns about how history is taught and about the removal of books from school libraries, among other issues.\n\nHere are the answers for Wicomico County Board of Education candidates:\n\nMeet the candidates\n\nAt-large (2 seats): George Demko, Bonnie H. Ennis, Kristin N. Hazel, Darren J. Lombardo\n\nDistrict 1: Luc Angelot, Allen C. Brown Sr.\n\nDistrict 2: Gene Malone, Karin Miller\n\nDistrict 3: Leonard Arvi, Susan W.

Ennis, Kristin N. Hazel, Darren J. Lombardo, Susan W. Beauchamp, Jake Blank.\n\nResponding candidates bios — and additional Q&A responses — appear at the bottom of this article.\n\nPRIMARY Q&As:Wicomico school board: What candidates say about school safety, test scores, curriculum\n\nAt large\n\nGeorge Demko\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\n\nEncouraging families and teachers to work together to improve schools.\n\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\n\nVery. Our SROs are doing a good job, but we need to improve psychiatric services to ID potential problems.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district’s schools, and if so, what are they?\n\nMy chief concern is that some groups are trying to prevent honest teaching of our history.\n\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\n\nParents and caregivers should be responsible for what their kids read, not politicians.\n\nDistrict 1\n\nLuc Angelot\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\n\nPresently, the No. 1 issue facing the district is learning loss due to COVID restrictions. I plan to expand tutoring and make the mental health of our students, teachers and staff a priority, all to ensure that we can move forward. 'As for the No. 1 issue facing the school board, like most in the community, I agree they're out of touch. Getting elected is the No. 1 solution. We could also look into term limits and age limits.\n\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\n\nI am very concerned about school safety. I was 9 years old when the Sandy Hook shooting took place. My generation grew up fearing a possible shooting happening at any moment.\n\nFrom my plan to make mental health a priority, to continuing to work with local law enforcement, retrofitting our buildings to be well secured and taking social media threats seriously, we can do things to make sure students feel safe.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district’s schools, and if so, what are they?\n\nI do not have many concerns; however, as a history nerd and Afro-Latino, I notice our history glosses over what people who looked like me went through. Let's teach the good, the bad and the ugly. No one should learn more about history on social media than in school.\n\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\n\nWe already have a process for approving books and removing obscene books. I do not believe books should be removed from our school libraries because they have LGBT topics or are heavily race-based.\n\nNo one forces a student to check out a book from the library. Some people take books entirely out of context and demand they are banned. As a pastor’s son, I always urge people to read Ezekiel 23:20. If someone only read that excerpt with no context of what is going on in the rest of the book, there would be people demanding it is taken off of the shelves.\n\nAllen C. Brown Sr.\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\n\nCurrently, there are two most important issues facing our schools today. They are school safety and maintaining and recruiting a highly skilled workforce. I will continue to work toward advocating for the necessary funding to improve these two areas.\n\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\n\nI am very concerned about school safety. I will continue to seek to acquire monitoring equipment throughout all of our schools at their entrance and exits. Also, I will continue to support training for students and staff for emergency situations, which would include such practices as fire drills, intruders in the building and other community threats.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district’s schools, and if so, what are they?\n\nYes, I have concerns about the way history is taught in our district's schools. I would like to see a revision of our history textbooks to be more reflective of historical events and more inclusive of all persons involved.\n\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\n\nYes, I think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries. Any books that do not follow our county guidelines and requirements for the Blueprint for Maryland Schools should be removed.\n\nMARYLAND SCHOOL BOARD RACES:School board candidates cite learning loss, student performance as biggest issues\n\nDistrict 2\n\nGene Malone\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\n\nThere are several important issues facing us today. But I have to say school safety ranks No. 1 for me. If our faculty, staff, students and parents do not feel safe in our school, then it is nearly impossible to accomplish our other goals. Students can't learn and teachers can't teach if they do not feel safe. See next answer for what I will do, if elected again.\n\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\n\nI am always concerned about school safety. In my tenure on this board, we have successfully secured all school entry vestibules, air-conditioned the remaining schools (which allows all doors and windows to remain closed and locked) and provided many hours of safety training for all school personnel. My next step, if reelected, is to \"push\" for school resource officers in all schools, not just middle and high schools.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district’s schools, and if so, what are they?\n\nI do not. All curriculums must be and are approved by the Board of Education. Therefore, I am comfortable with what is being taught. I also have visited classrooms and seen firsthand what we are teaching.\n\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\n\nIf we are apprised of a book that a parent or other citizen believes is in a school library and should be removed; we have a policy and process in place to review said book. The policy states the book is reviewed by a committee of parents, teachers and other citizens, and they make a recommendation to the superintendent and the board of whether it should be removed. As a board member, I believe we should abide by their decision.\n\nKarin Miller\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\n\nBridging the achievement gap that has been exacerbated by the pandemic is the most important issue. My experience as a teacher in creating curriculum, implementing curriculum and using data to inform my instruction will inform my questions for our school leaders and the decisions I make as a board member. How policies will impact what happens in the classroom will be foremost in all of my decisions.\n\nIncreasing student achievement requires attracting/retaining quality teachersk so we need to work with schools to improve the climate for all stakeholders so that our teachers want to stay. Creating a safe environment where students are able to learn without distraction improves learning outcomes for all.\n\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\n\nSchool safety is a concern throughout the country. We need to make sure our buildings are safe, but we also need to address the mental health crisis within our student population. It should not be a question of school resource officers OR social workers; they both have a role to play in creating a safe atmosphere within our schools.\n\nIncreasing the number of social workers available as well as programs that help students learn to regulate their emotions beginning in kindergarten will both reduce school violence as well as classroom disruptions. Making sure our SROs have the training they need to form positive relationships with our students is equally important.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district’s schools, and if so, what are they?\n\nI do not have any concerns about the way history is taught in my school district. Maryland content standards have been established for every grade level and those content standards should continue to be taught. Teachers should remain politically neutral in their teaching and students should be encouraged to develop critical thinking skills.\n\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\n\nWe have a process for approving books that requires parents, teachers, students and board members to actually read the books in question. Books that are approved based on that criteria should not then be removed.\n\nSAFETY:Holly Grove adds school resource officer amid increase in nationwide school violence\n\nDistrict 3\n\nLeonard Arvi\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\n\nMental health wellness and behavioral issues need the greatest attention. The WCPS must hire more social workers, behavioral health specialists to ensure the wellness of students, staff and teachers' morale. Working with the state, regional and community organizations in ensuring social deficiencies are addressed proactively and creatively.\n\nPost-pandemic-related life disruptions, be they socio-economic, psychological, cultural, are the reasons for poor education outcomes. Especially when there is a significant digital divide, lack of family support in online learning has led to notable learning losses across all grades.\n\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\n\nEvery student must be able to attend school without any fear or anxiety of being caught up in a fight. The arduous reporting system to discipline problematic students is the leading cause of teacher burnout, attrition and general dissatisfaction. Enforcing a student code of conduct, providing alternative restorative justice mediation, will be helpful.\n\nTeachers, administrators must be empowered to discipline students who create an unsafe environment through restorative justice mediation. Repeat offenders must be suspended from schools to safeguard the rest of the students.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district’s schools, and if so, what are they?\n\nNo. There is a well-funded misinformation movement that spreads lies about what is taught in schools. We have such candidates contesting in this election. This is very concerning.\n\nIt is no brainer that students must be taught by teachers free of any sort of interference. Teachers know best and leave it to them to do their jobs in the best manner possible.\n\nAcademic freedom is the reason that the U.S. continues to excel in innovation. Any laws, mandates curtailing this are myopic, regressive and detrimental in developing empathetic, critically aware citizens.\n\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\n\nStudents must be exposed to all kinds of books. Banning books is infringing on the individual right to read. I do not support any sort of book ban.\n\nIt would be a disservice to students, parents if any censorship is imposed. Students can and will learn to think critically and make well informed decisions.\n\nBanning books is regressive, myopic and detrimental to society as well. Banning books is a fascism and has no place in democratic, open society.\n\nDistrict 4\n\nDavid Plotts\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\n\nThe most important issue is the implementation of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future. The legislation contains many of my priorities, such as increased staff retention and salaries, expanded pre-kindergarten, mental health support, and college and career readiness pathways (including career and technology education). Our board will need to properly implement Blueprint or risk reduced state funding in subsequent years.\n\nHowever, there are other equally important issues such as addressing discipline, safety, and educator retention and attraction. There are a multitude of volunteer opportunities in every school that I’d like to see fulfilled by our community members.\n\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\n\nAs a parent of current students, and a friend of teachers, I have firsthand experience in the concern for all students’ and staff safety, which ranges from discipline to active shooters. In my conversations with stakeholders, I have found that the county's code of conduct is either not being enforced or not being enforced equitably.\n\nWe need to reevaluate our code of conduct and (take) progressive discipline steps to ensure it fits the needs of our students and educators, and can be enforced. At the same time, we also need to keep our schools safe from mass shootings and other threats of violence using evidence-based and expert-endorsed actions.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district’s schools, and if so, what are they?\n\nI believe that teaching complete and accurate history is necessary. Doing so can help students develop empathy for other people and find commonality with them. Additionally, I believe we need to ensure our history textbooks and classroom materials are accurate and not whitewashed.\n\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\n\nI believe that books in school libraries should offer a broad background of information, including opposing sides of controversial issues and a global perspective, to foster critical thinking by students along with promoting diversity and inclusion. School libraries are an important resource for those who lack access to county libraries. As long as books are age appropriate and meet all policy requirements, they should not be removed from any school library.\n\nAnn Brittingham Suthowski\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\n\nOur parents want more local control over curriculum, scheduling and selection of library books. We are working with them on these problems. However, with The Blueprint For Maryland’s Future, the state will be controlling much of what will be going on in our schools.\n\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\n\nWe are doing a great job in Wicomico County. Our entrances to all of our buildings are closed and monitored. We have cameras throughout all of our buildings and SROs in all of our middle and high schools.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district’s schools, and if so, what are they?\n\nI currently sit on the curriculum committee. My greatest concern is that there is no longer a seperate course in Maryland history being taught. Our curriculum is good, if the teacher stays with it and doesn't bring in their personal issues.\n\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\n\nWe had an issue in March with the book “All Boys Aren't Blue.” We found two copies in two high school libraries and removed them. We had no objections about their removal. However, we had about a hundred attendees at the BOE meeting objecting to the book.\n\nDistrict 5\n\nJohn Palmer\n\nWhat is the most important issue facing your school board, and what would you do about it if elected?\n\nCritical Race Theory has been around for years. Getting CRT ideology out of all schools is a must. Deal with it through school policy and state legislation. Evoke parental help.\n\nHow concerned are you about school safety, and what if anything should be done to improve it?\n\nI divide safety into two areas. One is physical safety, which in our county could help solve with the appropriate number of school resource officers. The other is mental safety, which is being exerted on our students by Critical Race Theory. It is a battle for our students and we must, must succeed.\n\nDo you have any concerns about the way history is taught in your district’s schools, and if so, what are they?\n\nYes, I have deep concerns about the way U.S. history is being changed and deleted by the woke movement. I'm concerned that the citizens do not have the resolve for the task of ridding our society of this Marxist threat. I pray that I'm proven wrong.\n\nDo you think there are circumstances when books should be removed from school libraries, and if so, what kind of books should be removed?\n\nYes, there are many circumstances in curriculum, library and media centers. There are topics that should be taught by school and some by parents. Gender issues, pornography, same-sex marriage, dating and other similar issues should not be taught in schools.\n\nBios\n\nGeorge Demko (at large)\n\nAge: 80\n\n80 Employment: Retired\n\nRetired Education: Ph.D.\n\nPh.D. Why are you running for the school board?

Nelson\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel\n\nThe smells of popcorn, beer, tacos and barbecue wafted through Miller Park on Wednesday as the Milwaukee Brewers showed off their revamped concession stands — with a heavy emphasis on local eateries and beverages.\n\nThe Brewers say the $20 million concession makeover is the largest upgrade that has been made to the 16-year-old stadium.\n\nThe team says the project will \"completely transform\" the food and beverage offerings at Miller Park, and include 11 new concession stands with a heavy focus on local brands. The renovations were paid for by the Brewers and Delaware North, the team's concession partner.\n\nTacos and mac and cheese are among the new offerings awaiting fans.\n\nThe new concession stands feature familiar area restaurants including Zaffiro's Pizza, AJ Bombers, Smoke Shack, and Holey Moley doughnuts. The restaurants are operated by Hospitality Democracy, a local group which is co-owned by Marcus Investments.\n\nSome of those names previously had a presence at Miller Park but in out-of-the-way locations. This brings them front and center in the park's most important gathering areas.\n\nThe food and beverage offerings are a critical part of the fan experience at the ballpark, and were due for an upgrade, said Brewers Chief Operating Officer Rick Schlesinger.\n\n\"We were a little late to the party, quite frankly,\" he said, calling the upgrades \"a lot of changes to the ballpark in one year.\"\n\nThe renovations include new \"First Base Ward” and “Third Base Ward” on the Field Level, and two new full-service bars also on the Field Level.\n\nThere's also a new “Local Brews” bar on the right-field side of the Loge Level. That stand features 30 beer taps with offerings from smaller state breweries including Lakefront, Central Waters, Hinterland, Tyranena and O'so. Prices range from $10 to $14 for a 16-ounce cup.\n\nSchlesinger said \"local\" was the key theme behind the changes.\n\nMilwaukee-area restaurants include some \"very sophisticated and very cutting edge\" options, he said. \"We need to keep up with it and meet it.\"\n\nThat point was strongly evident on the Loge Level, where the local brews were flowing just a few feet away from a new Zaffiro's Pizza stand. (A pepperoni will set you back $10, while an antipasto salad is $8.)\n\nA $9 basket of two chicken tacos and chips received strong reviews, said Robin Lantz at the J. Agave Tacos stand in right field on the Field Level.\n\n\"I don't know if it's the avocado or the lime. But people really like them,\" she said.\n\nFans looking for a margarita can find one at the same stand for $12, $14 or $16, depending on the choice of tequila.\n\nWith the new stands, Miller Park now offers about 35 different kinds of beer, said Ken Graber, Delaware North general manager for the stadium.\n\nBeer prices range from a high water mark of $14 for a 5th Element Rye India Pale Ale from One Barrel Brewing Co. in Madison to $5.50 for a Hamm's in the highest, Terrace Level, concourse.\n\nThe event attracted local officials, including Mayor Tom Barrett, County Executive Chris Abele and Ald. Michael Murphy.\n\n\"This feels a little bit like it did when Miller Park first opened,\" Abele said.\n\nHe said the Brewers were smart to strengthen their connections with local businesses, adding, \"There's a lot of good beer being made here.\"\n\n\"The new food and beverage program is inspired by the Brewers organizational mantra to 'cherish our fans,' and will enhance Miller Park’s status as one of baseball’s top entertainment destinations,\" the Brewers said in a statement.\n\nFans can have their first look at the renovations Friday night when the Brewers host the Chicago White Sox in an exhibition game at 7:10 p.m. The two teams meet again Saturday at 1:10 p.m.\n\nThe first pitch of the 2017 regular season comes at 1:10 p.m. Monday when the Brewers face the Colorado Rockies.\n\nRELATED: Brewers start $20 million concessions revamp\n\n\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/09/12/newark-shopping-center-marks-grand-re-opening/72168718/", "title": "Newark Shopping Center marks grand 're-opening'", "text": "Scott Goss\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe shopping center will be filling out the remaining vacancies with new restaurants and retail shops by next spring.\n\nNewark Natural Foods moved into a renovated anchor store that formerly housed Newark Department Store and opened a new eatery called Café 67 next door\n\nMarilyn Minister headed to work at the Newark Shopping Center on Saturday morning, just as she has every weekend for decades.\n\nOnly this day was special – both for the 85-year-old owner of Minster’s Jewelers and the shopping center her business has called home since 1955.\n\nSaturday marked the grand “re-opening” of the Newark Shopping Center – a celebration of the strip mall’s 60th anniversary and the conclusion of a two-year, $10 million renovation project designed to restore the plaza to its former glory.\n\n“I couldn’t wait to come in today,” said Minster, the only original tenant still leasing space at the shopping center. “What you see out there are my dreams and my prayers coming true at long last.”\n\nWith no fewer than seven owners since 1986, Newark Shopping Center had fallen into serious disrepair over the years.\n\nRoofs leaked, potholes riddled the parking lot and storefronts sat empty for years. The neglect eventually attracted crime, while shoppers avoided the area in favor of indoor malls and newer stores elsewhere.\n\nFor Minster, things finally began to change in 2012 when David Ross walked into her jewelry store and introduced himself as the president of Atlantic Realty, the Virginia-based property management company that had just bought the shopping center.\n\n“He told me they wanted to re-do the whole thing and asked if I would help,” she said. “Of course, I didn’t believe him, because I had heard the same thing from at least three other owners. But he had a vision and he kept his word.”\n\nMinster, in turn, helped lobby Newark City Council to approve the project, including a controversial proposal to build a six-story, 220-unit apartment building on the site of the former Blue Hen Lanes bowling alley.\n\nThe Bainbridge Companies of Bethesda, Maryland, bought that portion of the property and is now pre-leasing units in the One Easton apartment building set to open next summer.\n\n“To invest $10 million dollars in s facility like this that’s not going to attract high-dollar rent-payers, we had to find sources of revenue that would allow us to achieve our goals,” Ross said. “I think you can see it worked and the shopping center turned out even better than we envisioned.”\n\nThe renovations at Newark Shopping Center included facelifts for some shops and major overhauls for others. Water and sewer lines were upgraded, leaky roofs repaired, potholes filled, landscaping improved and new bike racks installed.\n\nA new cut-through also was added in one of the buildings, providing easy access to the Pomeroy and Newark Rail Trail – a hiking and biking thoroughfare from downtown to White Clay Creek State Park.\n\nThose upgrades, in turn, allowed Atlantic Realty to attract new tenants to the 16-acre plaza that long struggled with vacancy.\n\nIn April, Newark Natural Foods moved into a renovated anchor store that formerly housed Newark Department Store and opened a new eatery called Café 67 next door.\n\nThe co-op is helping to attract new shoppers to the plaza, such as Leslie Piper, a 45-year resident of Newark.\n\n“I probably wouldn’t have come here if the co-op were somewhere else,” she said. “But I’m glad Newark Shopping Center is picking back up because it seemed like it was dying.

Delaware Department of Transportation engineers had estimated it to cost $18.8 million. The contract was awarded Friday.\n\n“Obviously, $10 million is not something that is insignificant, but we realize it is the cost to make this project a reality at this time,” said Mark Tudor, a DelDOT project development director. “You always want to have the most competition in terms of best price for the public…but we’re comfortable with the bid.”\n\nThe span will connect the southern edge of the redeveloped and booming Riverfront with Wilmington’s Southbridge, a neighborhood with poorly-maintained streets and a depressed economy. Officials hope the bridge – which will feature two 11-foot-wide vehicle lanes, along with 14 feet of bicycle and pedestrians pathways – will nudge Riverfront prosperity over the city's principal waterway and prompt growth in Southbridge.\n\nThe span will also ease congestion on the chronically clogged roads that lead to the Riverfront from I-95 and U.S. 13, said Tudor. It will extend from the current end of Justison Street at the southern edge of the Riverfront, over the Christina River to James Court at U.S. 13.\n\n“It will definitely provide a different way to get to the Riverfront,” he said. “It has been talked about for many years as a key transportation link to make accessibility better in this area.”\n\nOfficials first conceived of a plan to span the Christina River at the Riverfront in 2003 after scrapping proposals to build a new ramp to I-95. But years of delays followed as planners struggled to secure funding.\n\nThe concrete bridge is scheduled to open by 2019 before crews begin rebuilding the I-95 viaduct in Wilmington. When complete, the bridge will be jointly maintained by the city of Wilmington and DelDOT.\n\nInitial construction should begin in about two to three months, Tudor said.\n\nSTORY: $10K sidewalk repair bill upsets Lewes condo owners\n\nSTORY: Carney calls for 75 more officers, new equipment in prisons\n\nThe News Journal contacted numerous state road contractors to gather opinions about the discrepancy between final costs and engineer estimates for the Christina River project. Tom Hutt, chief estimator for bridge-builder JJID Inc., questioned why DelDOT did not reject the original bids, as prices were more than 50 percent above the engineer's mark.\n\n“We’ve been a lot closer to the estimate and they rejected bids in the past,” Hutt said. “I don’t know why they awarded it … it could have been a bad estimate.”\n\nDelDOT has rejected bids for at least 10 construction projects since 2015.\n\nTudor said it would be “speculative” to assume the cost of the Christina River Bridge would turn out to be lower if DelDOT had rebid the contract.\n\nRay Petrucci, a former DelDOT project manager, said the construction market can change rapidly. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately estimate costs, he said, particularly for a “specialty” project, like the Christina River Bridge.\n\nJJID did not bid on the bridge-building project, Hutt said, because its complexity would require more resources than the company had available. Its crews are currently constructing another multi-million dollar span across the Christina, roughly three miles up from the Riverfront. JJID's bid for that bridge, which is designed only for pedestrian and cyclists, was approximately $400,000 over an engineer estimate of $18 million.\n\nDuring the upcoming year, DelDOT also will award a massive contract to reconfigure roads leading to each side of the Christina River Bridge. It will establish an “urban grid system of streets\" at a cost of $41 million, according to the state's Capital Transportation Plan.\n\n\"We’re still in final design on that…Our goal is to get that advertisement for bids later this year and we would expect that project would start about a year from now.”\n\nAnother Wilmington bridge across the Christina River on James Street will be rebuilt in the coming years, according to state plans. Crews will replace its existing, structurally deficient superstructure with new steel beams and a concrete deck for approximately $6.8 million.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

Set to be two towers of apartments, commercial space for shops, a riverside restaurant and a public boathouse, the waterfront lot will completely transform from the river's industrial upbringing.\n\nMayor Jake Day said that through the years of industry in Salisbury, the water was basically treated like an alley. That mentality has only recently begun to shift as empty buildings and properties now line the banks.\n\n\"There are waterfront uses that people want,\" Day said. \"They want public access to the water. They want waterfront dining. They want to be able to walk along the riverfront. All of those things are sort of part of the evolution of how we've treated our waterfront.\"\n\nEstimated as an $8 million to $10 million project, the development is months away from breaking ground, having been on paper since about 2014.\n\nFollowing the riverside, Fitzwater Street is also in for a complete overhaul, as one of the city's few sewage pump stations will move from the marina site to another lot up the street.\n\nA major re-engineering project, the $5.5 million reconstruction, according to the mayor, will result in a new streetscape for the road, which he said was probably in need of repairs for more than 20 years.\n\nDay emphasized the street will not face closure during the process.\n\nTogether, the two projects are set to shake up the fabric of a neighborhood that hasn't seen as much economic vitality as Day believes it could.\n\n\"You look at an asset like that,\" Marina Landing architect Keith Fisher said of the river's edge. \"You say, 'Well, how can we how can we make it more, so that the public and everybody can engage and be a part of one of the most incredible resources that this town has — breath new life into it.'\"\n\nThis vision comes at a time when the city has no shortage of construction in the works.\n\nMORE:Salisbury has big changes coming in 2019\n\nDowntown changes:Salisbury: $1 million town square project breaks ground with incoming food truck landing\n\nWater and sewer main work will be expanding from Main Street.

You're going to see a landscaped area between you and these bike lanes that run along the water side. The visual information you collect is going to say, 'This is a this is a nice neighborhood.' \"\n\nThough the pump station move is the driving factor behind the Fitzwater Street construction, when it concludes in under two years, Day will be excited to see the street have a similar style as the renovated downtown.\n\nIts neighbor will aim for quite the curb appeal.\n\nLead architect Keith Fisher said he looked to make Marina Landing \"something different.\"\n\n\"This piece of property always took me back a little bit,\" the Salisbury-based architect said. \"It was such an incredible piece of property that was waterfront, that nobody ever really realized what it could be.\"\n\nPaired with a developer, the vision began to take shape — with two towers of 28 apartments ranging from two to three bedrooms, a public boathouse with slips to rent, restaurant space yet to be claimed and a large open-lawn concept with a large projector screen facing the river's edge.\n\n\"The lawn share of the waterfront courtyard will be there for anybody that just wants to come hang out, sit there or watch the river,\" Fisher said. \"The boathouse piece will tie into the canoe and kayak launch that's already there. And again, all that will be open to the public.\"\n\nThough parts would likely open in increments, Fisher said it's realistic that the project could wrap up in three years.\n\nThe project's self-proclaimed \"biggest cheerleader\" for about six years, working with the city to deliver the right vision, Fisher said he imagines he'd be hard-pressed to find anyone against his project.\n\nLeigh Hanna Weatley, an owner of Brew River, a bar and restaurant just feet away from both of the incoming projects, said it would only help her business.\n\n\"Even if it is another restaurant, you know, it’s gonna be more than just us sitting over here,\" said Hanna Weatley, whose family opened the business in 2000. \"It’s gonna be other buildings, nicer things, better things to offer.\"\n\nNEW:Taco Bliss brings authentic taqueria flavors to Salisbury\n\nPHOTOS:Freight train returns to Snow Hill\n\nHanna Weatley said the apartments coming in are undoubtedly a great thing for the entire area — and she looks forward to something \"prettier to look at\" along the river.\n\nShe added that the incoming project, alongside other construction sprinkled throughout downtown adds to a sense that Salisbury is growing.\n\nBut that growth might not be good for everyone.\n\nWhat happens to the Fitzwater Street neighborhood?\n\nA recent report from City Lab, mapping gentrification across the country, indicated zero displacement of lower-income citizens from 2000 to 2016 in Salisbury.\n\nAs Amal Ali, a Salisbury University professor in the department of geography and geosciences, wrote in an email, \"The project and other downtown projects will increase the land value of surrounding neighborhoods, including Fitzwater Street.\"\n\n\"Gentrification will emerge, and low-income groups may be unable to afford to live there,\" she added, although not able give a concrete estimate without more data.\n\nDay, amid his excitement for rejuvenating the riverfront, said he is well-aware of the potentially negative impact.\n\n\"It could have theoretical impact on the neighborhood adjacent,\" Day said. \"We want to see an impact on the neighborhood adjacent. But we want to guide that that impact in a way that is cautious and also cares for the people who want to be there in the long term.\"\n\nThe mayor said he is looking at many ways to prevent harsh displacement, such as agreements or legislation requiring incoming developers to build a certain number of affordable housing units.\n\nDay said some might worry that could halt development, but he said with Salisbury currently maintaining about a 1.4% vacancy in apartments — 20% being considered healthy — he's not too worried.\n\nFisher said another key factor is called \"smart growth.\"\n\n\"So in terms of the socioeconomics of the development, you're creating something that's going to bring everybody together. Everybody can use it, everybody can come see it,\" he said of Marina Landing, set to have public spaces alongside the businesses throughout the property. \"That's how smart growth works. That to me is how you make a project sustainable.\"\n\nAli also said change like this is inevitable, and \"we cannot deny that gentrification can have positive effects for the city as a whole.\"\n\nThe professor said projects like these will increase foot traffic and bring with it an increased sense of safety.\n\nDay would love to see that ripple throughout the area with more projects headed to the city, sprouting new life on the banks of the Wicomico River.\n\nChanges will not come overnight.\n\n\"It's a mindset that needs to change,\" Fisher said of future projects on the river's edge. \"That trend, I think, absolutely needs to do continue because it only it only makes Salisbury more of a destination for people.\"\n\nMORE:'Changing the skyline': Downtown Salisbury to be reshaped by high-rise apartment complex\n\nSitting in a corner booth in Brew River, Hanna Weatley said she's always struggled a little to answer the go-to question of out-of-towners: \"So what can you do here?\"\n\n\"Over the years, I didn’t know what to tell them — 'Go to the movies.

Act project", "text": "Richard Sharkey\n\nrsharkey@thetowntalk.com, (318) 487-6490\n\nAmbitious plans for R.I.V.E.R. Act projects by the city of Alexandria would need significant outside sources of funding. How that will happen has yet to be determined, but new taxes aren't on the list.\n\nAmong the projects in the air is a proposed mixed-use facility that would include a “destination museum” — possibly housed in the vacant Weiss & Goldring building on Third Street downtown — which has a projected price tag of $10 million in construction costs and another $2 million for an “endowment for future needs.”\n\nThe city would look to only spend $1 million if it proceeds with the museum project and recruit the rest of the funding from other sources.\n\nAn updated R.I.V.E.R. Act document shows the breakdown of the projected total funding of $12 million as: city match, $1 million; community match, $1 million; foundations, $2 million; and federal, $8 million.\n\nThat destination museum could be a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math education) museum geared towards children; a facility to highlight the area’s military legacy; or possibly even a museum with an outdoor theme since Alexandria has been named a Top 100 Adventure Town by National Geographic Magazine.\n\nAlexandria officials have long maintained that the city would seek to leverage its funds to get a match of 3-to-1 or better from the private sector, foundations and/or state and federal agencies for projects through the Riverfront Improvement Venture and Essential Recreation Act, known as the R.I.V.E.R. Act.\n\nIn September, the council agreed for the city to spend up to $5 million over 10 years on R.I.V.E.R. Act projects to enhance the riverfront and the downtown area near it.\n\nMayor Jacques Roy’s administration has offered some R.I.V.E.R. Act options for the City Council to consider in the updated document, which can be found on the city’s website at www.cityofalexandriala.com.\n\nWhile the document discusses potential projects such as the destination museum and repurposing of the Chase Building at Murray and Fourth streets, Roy said the city is still determining what is feasible.\n\nMuch of that vetting will be done in-house to save money, but some expertise for a market analysis will be needed.\n\n“Our approach has been very careful and not pie in the sky,” Roy said during a briefing. “Our approach has been pick of the existing grand visions that exist for the city those things that are consistent with grand-scale work but are projects that can be done now, funded now, completed now — and don’t break the bank.”\n\nThe city has issued a “request to bargain (for assistance)” related to its previous request for qualifications/request for information on possible public-private R.I.V.E.R. Act initiatives. Details on that also are on the city’s website.\n\nThe mayor described it as a “very informal attempt to just start bargaining with local people on the expertise they can provide to the act itself.”\n\nA more defined timeline for the R.I.V.E.R. Act process is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2016, but Roy said the city has made good progress in the past year.\n\nThe updated R.I.V.E.R Act Guiding Principles document says a destination museum could have a “big punch” but also comes with risks.\n\nThe proposal for the Chase Building is to convert it into a multi-purpose building that would be tied to Central Louisiana Technical Community College, which is relocating its Alexandria campus from South MacArthur Drive to downtown.\n\nThe Chase project, with an estimated $6 million price tag, could be done “if it would fit in a campus configuration that involves all of those multiple partners for economic development and workforce development,” Mayor Jacques Roy said.\n\nHe said the Chase Building is already being partially used but holds potential for even better use if connected to CLTCC, which will have its relocated campus nearby.\n\nOutside sources would be sought to help fund the Chase Building renovation if that project proceeds, but the document indicates the city might be willing to put up most of the money — up to $5,000,000 — with the expectation of a “return on investment.”\n\n“ ... The $5,000,000 is not a grant but an investment, for a public purpose, with an expected measurable return. That return is measured by student successes, entrepreneurial expansion, and other public deliverables,” a footnote in the document says.\n\nThe Weiss & Goldring building is “more of the visual, ‘you better do something about me now’ kind of project. It is getting to be in bad shape,” Roy said.\n\n“We are going to continue to focus on how do we accent the recreation assets we have with a strong eye toward how do we bring in commercial development to support the recreation,” the mayor said of R.I.V.E.R. Act projects.\n\nR.I.V.E.R. Act spending limited to $5M over 10 years\n\nThe updated Guiding Principles document says the “three principal developments” in determining more time is needed for research are upgrades and construction associated with the CLTCC; the need for parking and transit changes, especially in light of the CLTCC relocation project; and “the opportunity to fund, plan, implement and operate a destination museum or museum complex, with new structures and existing museums, and/or create a STEM-level children’s learning center associated with the museum complex or destination learning center.”\n\nCity officials are looking into which path forward is the most feasible, especially considering what private and federal funding would be available.\n\nThe document says research so far “tend to demonstrate a destination learning/museum complex in the downtown is ‘doable.’”\n\nIt’s possible the T.R.E.E. House Children’s Museum could be incorporated into a STEM museum if that is the direction a destination museum takes, Roy said.\n\nA footnote relative to the potential funding for the project says: “The private sector, the public education sector, and other partners would be expected to cover any capital needs above $2,000,000.\"\n\nEven though it would be expensive to build a destination museum, Roy said, “believe it or not, that’s the easier side. … It’s the operating and maintaining it for its life cycle that is the daunting task.”\n\n“We can’t do it without having the dollars to run it,” he said, which is why proper vetting is needed on feasibility.\n\nThe administration is looking at potential funding options, and “it does not include a new tax,” he said.\n\nMilitary museum may be coming to downtown Alexandria\n\nThe City Council will have the final say on funding any specific projects for the R.I.V.E.R. Act.\n\nCity Council President Lee Rubin said the council will look at R.I.V.E.R. Act funding options during the council’s deliberations on the fiscal 2016-17 budget, and the public will have opportunities to comment on them. The new fiscal year begins May 1.\n\nSome R.I.V.E.R. Act projects are expected to have recreational aspects, such as a boardwalk.\n\nOther priority projects mentioned in the administration’s update are development of a Civil Rights Memorial Park in the vicinity of Lee Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, near Interstate 49; and improvements to downtown parking by adding more parking spaces and/or using existing spaces more efficiently.\n\nRoy said those projects are in the early stages.\n\nHe said parking spaces are underutilized downtown, but there is a perception that’s hard to overcome that the city doesn’t offer enough parking.\n\nIn seeking additional expertise for planning purposes for R.I.V.E.R. Act projects, the mayor’s office noted in a document that the “initial pre-approved budget” for certain listed projects included $100,000 broken down as $40,000 for architectural and engineering assistance; $25,000 for DBE/community outreach assistance; $20,000 for market study updates; and $15,000 for “other expert assistance (e.g., appraisals, main street activity).”\n\nThe document also says the mayor’s office will be available to those seeking to provide expert assistance “and will hold workshops to jumpstart any qualified assistance awarded under this request to bargain.”\n\nRoy said another project that the administration plans to eventually recommend is “a way to make the approach up the Murray Street (overlook toward the Red River) and on to the levee into more of a boardwalk atmosphere.”\n\nAlso under study is an orchestra “shell” at the Alexandria Levee Park Amphitheatre to provide some protection from “mildly inclement weather” for bands and other performers. It’s possible it could be a retractable shell so as not to block the view of the river when it wouldn’t be needed during good weather conditions.\n\nThe city would seek to partner with the Red River Waterway Commission on the boardwalk and amphitheatre projects.

He expects it will enhance the zoo from an in-state favorite into a regional magnet. No timetable is set for the rain forest's completion, with fund-raising now in planning stages.\n\nThe massive blueprint for the zoo's future marks its rebound from last summer's low point.\n\nIn less than two weeks, a tree fell on the Monkey House and another tree crushed the commissary.\n\nThe commissary has been rebuilt, but Peacock announced Thursday that the Monkey House, under evaluation since its July damage, has been deemed too severely damaged to be saved.\n\nThe tree falls created the worst natural disaster in the zoo's 109-year-history, said Bill Montgomery, executive director of the nonprofit Delaware Zoological Society, which supports the zoo.\n\nHe and others used hand nets and pet carriers to rescue 24 tiny monkeys and a baby toucan from the crushed building as staff and volunteers wept at the sight.\n\nLater that summer, the crew put wet towels over their faces after a smoky dryer fire forced them to evacuate the monkeys from another building used to house them before out-of-state emergency placements through an inter-zoo pact.\n\nWith those woes in the past, he said Thursday, \"we're building the zoo's future now.... We've got a lot we're doing in a short period of time.\"\n\nMontgomery said there is no facility like the planned rain forest between Baltimore and Buffalo, New York. Along with the shorter-term projects, he said, the expansion is expected to significantly grow the zoo's yearly attendance from the current 80,000.\n\nThe monkeys that survived the tree-fall unhurt – almost all returned from other zoos – ultimately will live in the rain forest, along with the toucan and other animals now in the zoo and to be acquired.\n\nIn coming years, Peacock said, a jaguar will star as the rain forest's \"marquee animal.\"\n\nAn area for special events, meetings and parties will overlook the habitat, he said.\n\nConstruction is to start in days on a short-term habitat for the popular monkeys, so they can return to exhibition this summer.\n\nThe raccoon-like baby panda sisters – born at the Detroit Zoo and placed here for future breeding – will be introduced to the public this summer with a party for their first birthday.\n\nGov. Jack Markell on Thursday unveiled the sign on their new habitat, shrouded during their quarantine. They arrived at the zoo Wednesday night after animal keepers Laura Martin and Leah Newman flew to Detroit and drove them back after meeting their parents and keepers there.\n\nMarkell got a brief peek at them. \"They're really cute,\" he said with a smile. \"I think people are going to love to have the opportunity to see red pandas right here in Delaware.\"\n\nAlso unveiled was Eagle Ridge, a home for two bald eagles – a baby-feathered one that can't fly after its wing was broken in a Pennsylvania tornado last year, and a mature one disabled by lead poisoning from ingested hunting shot and fishing weights.\n\nEagle Ridge, designed by zoo board member/architect Robert A. Grove, will include the otter pool and add accessibility to the one zoo area that is not yet wheelchair-friendly.\n\nDuring a hard-hat tour of the roofless Monkey House – said to date from the Depression era with later changes – Peacock said it had more damage after the tree. Its water was off, but a sprinkler system last winter flooded the shell, he said.\n\nOptions for its site soon will be shown for public comment, said Delaware State Parks Director Ray Bivens.\n\nPossibilities include rebuilding the Monkey House for office space with more surface parking, creating a plaza from its salvaged bricks with signs to honor the building and zoo history, and rebuilding the Monkey House and/or adjoining education center for office and program space over expanded parking.\n\nContact robin brown at (302) 324-2856 or rbrown@delawareonline.com.

The draft builds on initial plans from 2011.\n\n\"We see the opportunity for not only research and office functions there but retail, in particular because the train station is there,\" said Alan Brangman, UD's vice president for facilities, real estate and auxiliary services.\n\nConstruction of the Newark Regional Transportation Center off South College Avenue was expected to start by this fall, after the plans won a competitive $10-million federal transit grant in 2012.\n\nProgress on the $35 million project stalled over the last year as negotiations dragged on between the state and the railroad, Norfolk Southern Corp. Norfolk Southern has a busy freight yard next to the STAR Campus, and is concerned how the train station would affect its operations.\n\n\"We've been delayed about a year, and that's been worked into our plan,\" Brangman said. \"Everyone's still at the table, and we're working toward getting a potential solution.\"\n\nNorfolk Southern declined to discuss the train station proposal at this stage because it's \"not the appropriate time,\" spokesman David Pidgeon said Wednesday by email.\n\nIn September, Norfolk Southern President and CEO Charles W. \"Wick\" Moorman visited Newark and toured the site with U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, Gov. Jack Markell and Transportation Secretary Shailen Bhatt, Bhatt said.\n\n\"He instructed his folks to get the engineers together to come up with a plan that allows the freight movements that they need in order to maintain their business,\" Bhatt said.\n\nThe Newark yard has become a key property in Norfolk Southern's network since early 2013 when the railroad began ramping up crude oil deliveries to the Delaware City Refinery.\n\nCrude-by-rail deliveries to Delaware are averaging 130,000 barrels a day, according to refinery owner PBF Energy. The Newark yard is along Norfolk Southern's busiest rail route to the refinery.\n\nBhatt said state officials have worked hard to come up with a model that meets everyone's needs, but funding is a major constraint. He expects to see a new offer from Norfolk Southern as early as Thursday, he said.\n\nThe urgency of reaching a solution increases by the day: Delaware could lose its federal grant if the project isn't complete by a deadline in 2018. That's a concern considering the amount of engineering to be done and permits to be secured, Bhatt said.\n\n\"We're really running up against that schedule,\" Bhatt said. \"We don't want to get into a situation where we've expended federal funds, the station doesn't happen, and then for some reason the feds come back and say, 'Uh, we don't have a station, and we need our money back.'\"\n\nBhatt added he hopes it doesn't come to that, but \"if we can't come up with a design that works for [Norfolk Southern] and is not cost prohibitive, then we are where we are.\"\n\nAmtrak has also imposed a deadline requiring the Newark station be accessible to wheelchair users by 2018 \"or its trains will no longer stop in Newark,\" Brangman said. The requirement is part of a Federal Rail Administration initiative to improve accessibility at all Amtrak stations.\n\nA major goal of redeveloping the station is to allow for more frequent Amtrak and SEPTA commuter rail service in Newark in part by adding high-level platforms and a pedestrian bridge for passengers to reach them. The project also aims to reduce conflicts between freight and commuter trains that cause a train-stacking bottleneck at Newark.\n\nTransportation officials also want to link the SEPTA and MARC commuter lines in Newark. The lines are now separated by an 18-mile gap between Perryville, Md., and Newark.\n\n\"Newark's not getting any smaller. The idea that we don't have connective rail service with Maryland is ridiculous,\" said Dave Gula, a transportation planner with the Wilmington Area Planning Council. \"To make that happen, we have to have an upgraded Newark station.\"\n\nEconomic engine\n\nOfficials hope the rail and transit center would act as a catalyst for economic-development opportunities and boost Delaware's attempts to draw business from the growing military operations at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Harford County, Maryland.\n\nA new street, Station Boulevard, would be built as one of the main entrances to the STAR Campus from College Avenue. The boulevard would serve as the primary means for accessing the station, and as the primary commercial street on the campus.\n\n\"The first 20 years will probably see more like a million square feet of development on those 65 acres. We see as many as 10 to 12 buildings in what is that initial build-out for the site,\" Brangman said. \"We really want to focus on the distance between the train station and the Health Sciences Building.\"\n\nHe described a mix of hotel, research, residential uses and a conference center in that area.\n\n\"This site is really to provide an opportunity for researchers, students for partners on this site to collaborate, and the only way to collaborate is to literally being in buildings right next door to each other,\" Brangman said. \"Building to building – much like you would see in a traditional urban downtown.\"\n\nDeveloper Ernie Delle Donne, who worked on the Health Sciences building, has a likely tenant for the bulk of the 100,000 square feet left to fill in that space, and potentially the next building he erects, Brangman said.\n\nAlso proposed is a 10,000-square-foot business incubator that could be located at the campus to serve startup companies in need of wet-lab space for materials development, UD President Patrick Harker said. UD hopes to attract both start-up and legacy companies to the site.\n\n\"We need that mix: Both the space for the established, the Fraunhofers of the world, and technology-enabled enterprises,\" Harker said. \"This is just a continuum of what the University of Delaware's been doing for a long time at the Delaware Technology Park.\"\n\nResidential space is also a possibility but not dormitories, Brangman said. Christiana Care has expressed interest in housing for its interns, and UD has discussed housing for graduate students or junior faculty, he said.\n\n\"There certainly might be the opportunity for the buildout of a residential community over time,\" Brangman said. \"Again, with a full-service train station, that will change the way that whole site will develop.\"\n\nStaff reporter Jeff Montgomery contributed to this report.\n\nContact Melissa Nann Burke at (302) 324-2329, mburke@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @nannburke.\n\nCOMMUNITY MEETING ON STAR\n\nWHAT: Public forum on the University of Delaware's revised Science, Technology & Advanced Research Campus master plan draft\n\nWHO: Members of the community are invited to attend and provide feedback\n\nWHEN: 2 p.m. Thursday\n\nWHERE: Trabant University Center Theatre\n\nCONTACT: Suggestions and comments may be sent to the STAR steering committee at star@facilities.udel.edu", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/11/05/covid-iowa-government-losing-tourism-convention-investments-honey-creek/6046692002/", "title": "After paying millions for hotels, convention centers, arenas, Iowa ...", "text": "Four years ago, the state handed over the keys to Honey Creek Resort on the shore of Rathbun Lake to a New York-based global resort and casino operator.

When Hillary Clinton spoke, they mostly were quiet.\n\nThere were nearly 50 of them sitting in the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Center on the campus in Dover, part of a night organized to promote political discourse. Most already had their minds made up before Trump and Clinton took their places on the stage in Las Vegas for the third presidential debate, but they came for issues-based talk.\n\n“The only thing that has been in the headlines is the slander they’re throwing at each other. If you look at the different policies they’re trying to discuss, the only foreign policy that I’ve heard from Trump is the wall, which is not going to make America progress,” said Shantell Brightful, a 19-year-old political science sophomore.\n\nBrightful and her fellow students were part of a nationwide collection of public gatherings, common spaces where Americans now have gathered three times to watch the country’s most important reality show.\n\nThe final debate of the presidential race, hosted at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was billed as do-or-die for the candidates.\n\nIt was expected to get nasty — and it did.\n\n“That’s because he’d rather have a puppet for a president,” Clinton said of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s apparent attempts to influence the election in Trump’s favor.\n\n“You’re the puppet,” Trump retorted.\n\nThey said what? Fact-checking the final debate between Clinton and Trump\n\n2016 Poll Tracker - USA TODAY\n\nClinton and Trump both visited Delaware in the lead-up to the April state primary, which they each won.\n\nClinton is favored to win the reliably blue Delaware and its three electoral votes. The last GOP presidential candidate to secure the state was George Bush in 1988 over Democrat Michael Dukakis.\n\nA University of Delaware poll in early October of 762 likely voters said 51 percent would vote for Clinton, 30 percent for Trump and the rest for third-party candidates or would not take part. The poll was conducted in mid-September, before the release of a tape in which Trump talked about grabbing women.\n\nThe debate focused on immigration, the Supreme Court, the economy and each candidate’s fitness for office. Most of the early portion of the discussion featured few of the insults that dominated the first two debates.\n\nTrump, who has fallen behind in polls, in the early part of the debate said he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\n\"That will happen automatically, in my opinion. Because I am putting pro-life justices on the court,\" he said.\n\nClinton said she did not want to limit abortions further, saying she felt that the government should not be allowed to intrude in such decisions.\n\n\"You can regulate [abortion] if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account,\" Clinton said.\n\nThe debate later shifted to the GOP nominee’s treatment of women, a focus of the contest since the release of a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" video in which Trump bragged about kissing and groping women against their will. Women have been coming forward to accuse Trump of sexual harassment.\n\nAnd in keeping with his new favorite talking points, Trump would not promise to accept the results of the election because he believes it’s being “rigged” against him.\n\n“I will look at it at the time,” Trump said. “I will tell you at the time. I will keep you in suspense.”\n\nClinton said those answers were “horrifying.”\n\nThe WikiLeaks issue came up quickly during the debate, and Clinton was on the defensive about questions concerning open borders drawn from a leaked speech. Clinton said the comments were about an international energy grid and tried to deflect by calling on Trump to denounce Russian influence.\n\n“That was a big pivot off the fact she wants open borders,” Trump said. “She wants open borders. People are going to pour into our country.”\n\nIt was the kind of question – and the kind of response – people like Hunter Dworsky wanted to hear. A Newark Trump supporter, Dworsky joined roughly 50 people watching the debate at Gallucio's Italian Restaurant in Wilmington.\n\n“We have a great, great guy who’s doing the debate, [moderator] Chris Wallace,” Dworsky said. “We won’t be getting questions about what Mr. Trump did 10 years ago when he was in the entertainment world.”\n\nBut that wasn’t so. Wallace asked about the women accusing Trump of sexual assault about a half-hour into the debate.\n\nTrump said those stories had been “largely debunked” and Clinton most likely was behind them.\n\n“I didn’t even apologize to my wife because I didn’t do anything,” Trump said.\n\nHis response included references to a new video that suggested a Democratic operative planned to incite violence at Trump’s rallies, but Clinton didn’t take the bait and ignored the reference.\n\n“Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don’t think there’s a woman anywhere who doesn’t know what that feels like,” Clinton said.\n\nJazmin Calhoun, a 19-year-old Delaware State psychology sophomore, said she’s been watching Trump since his history began to be painted as one full of sexually aggressive behavior. She said he’s made a fool of himself attacking Clinton and her husband, the former president.\n\n“Even if I did like his policies, it’s just as president and a representative to the United States you have to hold yourself to a higher standard. You have to act a certain way,” Calhoun said.\n\nEven Robert Arlett, chairman of the Trump campaign in Delaware, said the issues associated with “locker room talk” has been a weak point for the Republican. Arlett wanted to see three issues he hopes to see discussed during the debate — illegal immigration, economic policies and national unity.\n\n“Where [Trump] has gotten off track is when the other side has accused him and bashed him based on his personality,” he said between greeting Trump supporters at Gallucio's.\n\nThe debate party took place in two rear rooms at the restaurant. A U.S. flag hung next to one television as supporters raised wine, beer and soda glasses, cheering when Trump mentioned paid speeches that Clinton gave to Wall Street banks.\n\nThey booed when Clinton talked about Planned Parenthood funding and abortion. Mary Davis sat sternly, quietly next to her husband, as Clinton said Trump’s abortion comments were “scare tactics.”\n\n“I’m very pro-life and I’m very glad the evangelicals support him,” she said.\n\nBefore running for president, Trump had stated he was pro-choice. That doesn’t bother Davis. Trump is the pro-life candidate today.\n\n“I want things to change now,” she said.\n\nGabi Ionescu walked through, a glass of wine in hand, with a red purse strung over her shoulder. She proudly emphasized she immigrated to the United States from Romania “with $20 and a suitcase, and I’ve never been on welfare.”\n\nIt was easier to get a job then, she said. But her support for Trump is more a result of a dislike for Bill and Hillary Clinton, who she describes as kryptonite. The country needs someone who isn’t a “career politician,” she said.\n\n“I don’t like [Clinton] because she’s a liar,” she said.\n\nClinton’s Delaware debate party, held at the campaign headquarters at the Riverfront in Wilmington, was more subdued than its counterpart across town. The nearly 50 people grumbled when Trump said, “We need to repeal Obamacare.”\n\nRosanne Tanzola, a Catholic nun from Newark, said while some people pay more under the Affordable Care Act, those with means should support others less fortunate.\n\n“As far as I’m concerned, I’m a Gospel person, and I think we should make sacrifices for people who have less than we do,” she said. “Is it socialism? I don’t know, but I think it’s fair.”\n\nThose in the Delaware State crowd also kept their voices low but weren’t shy when they had to express what candidates’ comments made them feel. They applauded when Clinton called for more affordable college and debt relief for those with student loans, but to some, she’s a flawed candidate.\n\n“I do not see a candidate who will benefit me personally as a college student and as a black woman,\" Brightful said. \"I don’t see either one of them benefiting me. Honestly, at one point I did not want to vote because neither one of them appealed to me.”\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329. Follow him on Twitter @kbaker6.

Experts also refer to this as \"toxic stress,\" in which a child frequently experiences hardship, such as divorce, witnessing violence and living with an adult with mental illness or suffering from addiction.\n\nWilmington University has been working with a select group of Department of Health and Social Services employees this winter on \"trauma informed care\" that encompasses the idea of understanding trauma, its impact and the recovery process when providing services. These 26 people will go on to train 1,000 employees in Social Services, Child Support Services and State Services Center.\n\nThese employees are often on the front lines of helping Delawareans who are in a crises, state officials said.\n\nThe hope is that if employees approach their work through this lens, and frame their questions and responses differently, it could lead to faster interventions and improve trust among Delawareans. The training comes at a time when Delaware is feeling the effects of the opioid crisis and the city of Wilmington leads the country in teen shootings.\n\n\"So many people in our world now are living with toxic stress and adverse childhood experiences,\" said Marilyn Siebold, the Wilmington University professor leading the training. The university currently offers a certificate in trauma-informed approaches.\n\n\"We're talking about how do we use a trauma informed lens,\" she said. \"How do we think differently on what's going on in people's lives?\"\n\nIn Delaware, 50.4 percent of children have experienced at least one adverse childhood experience, state officials said. In Wilmington, it is 60.5 percent of children, compared to the national rate of 47.9 percent.\n\nReport: Delaware's unplanned pregnancy rate likely declining, thanks to IUDs\n\nThe idea of \"trauma informed care\" recently made national news when journalist Oprah Winfrey reported on how a similar technique was being used with children in Milwaukee in a \"60 Minutes\" episode.\n\nDuring the Delaware training, the employees will learn about the concept, how to apply it and what outcomes to look for, Siebold said. There will be a focus on creating more nurturing relationships, providing a feeling of safety in their environment and giving residents a sense of choice.\n\nPeople who face toxic stress often don't think clearly or make the best decisions, Siebold said.\n\n\"Instead of thinking and then saying, 'Why did you do this,' and focusing on all the things that are wrong with a person, it's asking them what happened and really understanding the context,\" Seibold said.\n\nAn example of this, she said, could be working with a person who has missed several meetings with his or her probation officer. Instead of making assumptions, employees should say, \"Tell me what happened,\" she said.\n\n\"You might find out they missed the meetings with the probation officer because they're involved in a domestic violence situation and felt unsafe to leave the house,\" Seibold said\n\nThe training will also emphasize the importance of the employees practicing self-care. Since these employees are often learning and hearing about other people's trauma, they \"can absorb some of that,\" she said. The training will teach employees about potential risk factors and how to deal with it.\n\n\"You can't be a good service provider unless you take care of yourself,\" she said.\n\nState fears there's more pregnancy-related deaths than have been reported\n\nRenée Beaman, director of the Division of State Service Centers who has undergone the training, said state employees have to \"learn to change our conversation.\" They need to ask critical questions instead of reading basic questions off of a standard assessment sheet, she said.\n\nIf state workers are providing temporary housing for the homeless, Beaman said as an example, employees need to dig deeper to find out the reason why these Delawareans are homeless.\n\n\"We now have to look through that different lens to weed out and pull some of the layers off that cause individuals to remain in this crisis state,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not going to be overnight, but it's going to bring the staff together and look at the community differently.\"\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH STORIES\n\nReport: Sussex is the healthiest county in Delaware\n\nState fears there's more pregnancy-related deaths than have been reported\n\nSaint Francis expanding use of Uber Health to get patients to, from hospital\n\nContact Meredith Newman at (302) 324-2386 or at mnewman@delawareonline.com.

He proposes setting up a public forum where debates about curriculum censorship can take place and be evaluated fairly.\n\nRestorative justice is another hallmark of Johns’ campaign, he told ACLU-DE in its voter guide, which includes training staff members and SROs about de-escalation techniques. He also proposes enhancing parent participation within the district by holding parent education classes focused on child development and communication.\n\nRaymond J. Petkevis, 45, Middletown\n\nBackground: Raymond Petkevis is a real estate broker for Keller Williams Realty around the Middletown area and recently started a position as Delaware’s principal broker for REAL, a virtual-based real estate company. His two children are students in Appoquinimink.\n\nIssues: Petkevis has mainly expressed concerns about violence in schools, citing outreach from community members worried about student safety. To combat this, reevaluating measures of rule enforcement and the district’s code of conduct have been suggested by the candidate.\n\nThe district’s teacher shortage and dwindling test scores are intertwined with issues related to violence in the district, according to Petkevis. In response to Citizens For Delaware Schools', he also recommended potentially soliciting funding from local developers to go toward the district’s resources and implementing financial responsibility into the curriculum for high school students.\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nAlfred G.

The alumna of Red Clay Public Schools holds a bachelor's degree in dance, as well as another bachelor's degree in English and a master's in education from the University of Delaware. Gilbert is a certified teacher, with experience from K-12 special education to high school English Language Arts, though currently a stay-at-home mother to her four children. Her two daughters and two sons attended private schools in Delaware.\n\nIssues: “Let me be clear,\" wrote this candidate on her Facebook page, operating as a landing pad for other campaign materials. \"The school’s role is to educate, NOT indoctrinate. Reading, writing, mathematics (not Common Core), true history (not Critical Race Theory or whatever name they’ve morphed it to).”\n\nGilbert said plummeting test scores in the district motivate her to run, alongside hopes to boost graduation rates and college readiness. She lists safety, effectiveness, curriculum and transparency as her priorities on her website. Among top-of-mind issues, she also noted parents and guardians \"will have their voices heard.\"\n\nLearning loss concerns:What’s the cost of failing math? Well, for Delaware kids it could be $66 billion\n\nDouglas Danger Manley, 38, Newark\n\nBackground: Manley works at a cybersecurity startup as a software engineer, an industry and occupation he’s found himself in for about 17 years. The Newark resident is also a volunteer firefighter with Mill Creek Fire Company, where he’s been for the past decade. He’s now its president, after having served on the board for three years.\n\nManaging a $3-4 million budget with Mill Creek, Manley told The News Journal/Delaware Online he’s used to dealing with a fixed amount of funding from state and local governments — which leave a “need to squeeze every bit of value out of that funding as we can to provide our services.”\n\nIssues: Manley has no children, and he sees that as an asset. He says this will allow him to maintain a public-service perspective. The candidate shared his focus on supporting resources for Christina School District, sharpening communication and community engagement. He also said protecting students will be a priority, especially gay or transgender children — but he hopes the district “focuses on its mission of education and doesn't get lost in the mire” of various culture wars.\n\nDistrict E\n\nY.F. Lou, 36, Newark\n\nBackground: The single father of two children, enrolled in Christina, works with the state’s health department, where he said his work focuses on improving healthcare for the most vulnerable in long-term care facilities. He also serves as a volunteer firefighter for Aetna Hose, Hook and Ladder Company. Lou's family moved to Delaware from China when he was young, an experience the candidate believes will allow him to advocate for Christina's diverse student body, as he said in a late-March candidate forum. He attended public school in Lewes, graduated from the University of Delaware, and has been a full-time Newark resident since 2012. Lou also attended both University of Southern California and Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health for graduate degrees.\n\nIssues: With an 8-year-old at West Park Elementary — and a 5-year-old headed there in the fall — Lou finds himself motivated by three key issues: safety, community engagement and a goal to \"broaden our students’ horizons.\"\n\nFor Lou, safety includes keeping guns out of schools, \"fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all of our students especially those most vulnerable,\" as well as monitoring environmental health and safety, such as lead. Community and stakeholder engagement, as he put it, focuses on how the pandemic created opportunities to capitalize on for information sharing and family engagement. In terms of broadening horizons, the candidate hopes to see more support of art programs to keep students \"curious and innovative.\"\n\nYong Peng, 53, Newark\n\nBackground: Peng works for the federal government as a software engineer, having previously worked for companies like Delmarva Power and Bank of America. Peng, in one candidate forum, called himself a “happy immigrant” focused on giving back to Delaware. Peng was born in China and came to the U.S. to study. The 15-year resident of Newark has a doctorate in physics, having worked in research and teaching at a few universities before his current line of work. Peng said he has also worked as a math tutor in Wilmington.\n\nIssues: Peng said he sees a “crisis in public education.” Two issues are top-of-mind for the father of two. One, he perceives too much focus on topics that are “ignoring the core curriculum,” which are reading, writing and math. He didn't elaborate. Two, he believes school policies are failing at “enhancing the parent's right to oversee their children’s education.” Peng said his daughter used to study in Christina School District, though no longer, and now he is running for the future of the community.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nPulaski Elementary School , 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington\n\n, 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington The Bancroft School , 700 N.

Before that, English-Wynn worked in the Department of Labor as a deputy principal. This career, the candidate said, meets more than 10 years of experience in mentorship and advocacy connected to K-12 education and the community. A \"proud alumna\" of Red Clay schools herself, English-Wynn also has a young child entering the district this fall. She said the Wilmington district prepared her for later degrees from Wilmington University and Delaware State.\n\nIssues: The alumna said the impact of both \"a supportive community and quality education\" are keys to students succeeding. She noted three issues motivating her campaign: equity and access, parent engagement and support for educators.\n\nWilmington:They struggled during Ida. Now one Wilmington community is finding a better way to respond\n\nJohn Shulli, 50, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Born and raised in Wilmington, Shulli returned to his home state after 26 years in the U.S. Army and Department of Defense — 22 of which were spent overseas. He works in a civilian job on A.I. policy for the Pentagon, as well as teaches part time as a colonel in the Army Reserve. He graduated from John Dickinson High School before attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.\n\nIssues: Shulli said he's motivated to run by the \"severe\" learning loss faced since the pandemic and highlighted in state and district's statistics. The district must, as he sees it, \"restore our children’s academic standings so they can compete in a local, regional, national and global jobs market.\"\n\nDistrict D\n\nCarlucci Coelho, 53, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Coelho said he came to the U.S. hoping to work as an artist. He has worked in real estate since 2017, as well as the nonprofit sector. He earned a two-year degree in fashion business, according to his website, alongside a parallel degree in costume and set design while studying in Portugal. Though he doesn't have kids enrolled in the district, Coelho said he's been close to the community for over 30 years. Coelho also ran for state representative as a Republican last year, but did not secure a win in District 13.\n\nIssues: Coelho stressed that he is against any kind of bullying, citing that protecting safety in schools is paramount in his platform. Another motivating issue is budgeting, making sure money is distributed \"to those schools and programs who need the most.\" He also said he supports strong academics alongside more vocational training in every school.\n\nIn other background, in response to a question for the ACLU-DE voter's guide about the teaching of U.S. history and whether students have the right to learn free of viewpoint-based censorship, Coelho said parents should have \"the choice of accepting or denying what their own kids have the right or not to read. These children have parents who have different views about life and we must respect all parents views.\" Also when running for state representative, the candidate expressed support for a failed 2022 bill aimed at barring transgender athletes to compete in school sports, saying: \"Woman sports is woman sports.\"\n\nJose Matthews, 27, Elsmere\n\nBackground: Matthews has represented District D on the Red Clay School Board since 2018. Working in the healthcare field in different capacities over the last six years, his day job is working a community liaison for Rockford Center, a community mental health organization. The incumbent lives in Elsmere with his husband, who is a teacher.\n\nIssues: Matthews said he wants to keep up his work. In his first term, he said, the board tackled many issues related to equity around the pandemic, one being transparency. He said he \"was one of the biggest supporters on the board to make sure we continue to provide a Zoom option both to watch the meetings and to participate in public comment.\" If elected, he hopes to continue to offer that access.\n\nRed Clay has fallen behind other northern New Castle County districts, Matthews said, in terms of keep up with building maintenance and competitive salaries. He plans to make that competitiveness a priority, even if it means the district's first referendum in nearly a decade. He also aims to maintain a focus on family and parent engagement.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nActivity Center at Hockessin PAL , 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin\n\n, 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin AI DuPont High School , 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington\n\n, 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington Baltz Elementary School ,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington\n\n,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington Cab Calloway School of Arts , 100 N.

For four years, she's handled zoning variance requests on the town of Smyrna's Board of Adjustment. She’s a member of the Alpha Beta Gamma sorority at Delaware Technical Community College, the Holly’s Club and the Boys and Girls Club board.\n\nIssues: Fontaine St. Pierre decided to run for the board because she wants to serve as “a liaison between parents, teachers and the community, providing the best resources for our children's education, and allowing parents to have the most influence in their children's life.” She wants to recognize and prioritize instructors' interests and concerns.\n\nShe said the most important issues in the district are continuing to push for high-quality, intellectually-rigorous education to prepare students for the competitive labor market, providing safe schools, confronting bullying and cyberbullying and expanding self-esteem initiatives for students.\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “An inclusive educational system offers various advantages, including enhanced educational quality for all students and assisting students in becoming more responsive to an inclusive attitude. This could also help with behavioral issues, self-esteem, social skills, and community involvement. All students have the right to a challenging core education and outstanding instruction from well-trained educators. Students should be allowed to have an open and honest discussion about America's past, and they deserve to see themselves and the issues that impact them reflected in their classrooms and books.”\n\nShe encourages parents to attend board meetings to address issues and share comments and insights.\n\nBobbi Jo Webber, 44, Kenton\n\nBackground: A farmer for over 25 years along with her husband on their family’s farm, she has two children, a son who is a freshman at Smyrna High School and a daughter in sixth grade at Clayton Intermediate School. She’s volunteered for 10 years at Sunnyside Elementary and at Clayton Intermediate School, running fundraisers, helping teachers in classrooms and hosting free field trips at her family’s farm.\n\nIssues: Webber wanted to run for school board to improve safety, success of students, transparency and teacher compensation. She believes teachers and staff should hold students accountable for misconduct and follow through with consequences, but also favors hiring constables “who will help pull some of that responsibility off of the teachers so that they can focus on education.” She wants the administration to notify parents “about important issues that occur in the schools – the good and the bad.” She favors competitive pay: “We cannot lose these amazing educators we have to neighboring districts because of financial reasons.”\n\nIn regard to issues like critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “All races and groups should be represented in our classes. Our students should be exposed to a well-rounded curriculum. Bias and unfounded opinion do not belong in the classroom.”\n\nOn transgender policies, Webber said, “I believe that students can express themselves in a way that they feel is appropriate, although personal expression cannot become a distraction for other students. I do not approve of transgender students using the locker room or restroom of their choice of gender. I feel it could develop into an unsafe and distracting situation for other students.\"\n\nIn curriculum decisions, she said parents and community members should have their opinions represented, but they also need to trust educators to make decisions that will benefit students’ education.\n\nPolling places, open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2017/03/29/college-readiness-slow-climb-delaware/99773990/", "title": "Report: 41% of Delaware graduates not ready for college", "text": "Jessica Bies\n\nThe News Journal\n\nEven as Delaware expands access to college-level courses such as dual enrollment and Advanced Placement classes, 41 percent of public high school graduates are entering in-state colleges and universities unprepared, according to a report released Wednesday.\n\nThe news was put out by the state Department of Education during a large conference at the Chase Center in Wilmington. Held by Delaware Pathways, the event explored how students can gain workplace experience while still in high school, graduate with a head start on a college degree or gain the qualifications needed to go to work immediately.\n\nIn Delaware – as is the case across the country – many students are graduating high school unprepared for the level of rigor necessary in a college course, the new data shows. Acceptance to college does not guarantee readiness for college, DOE stressed.\n\nSTORY: Legislative bills could pave way for Dover Mall road\n\nSPORTS: Delaware native Kuhl secures his spot in the big leagues\n\nSo though college enrollment for the class of 2015 increased three percentage points to 61 percent, remediation rates remained flat. That means that though more students are getting into college, many of those students are being forced to take and pass noncredit, remedial courses before taking the college-level courses required for their degrees. Remediation rates are the highest for special education, African-American and other minority students.\n\nShana Payne, director of Delaware's Office of Higher Education, said the report is part of a larger conversation focused on what stands in the way of students entering college ready for credit-bearing courses.\n\n\"We're not saying every student needs to go to the University of Delaware and get a bachelor's degree,\" she said.\n\nThe skills taught in remedial college courses are the same skills students need to get a technical degree or certificate, Payne said. Those higher level math and literacy skills are also needed for many middle-skill, entry-level jobs, she said.\n\n“What the remediation rate is telling us is that students are graduating from high school without those skills,\" Payne said. \"So even if they don’t intend to get a bachelor’s degree, they still need those skills.”\n\nAreas of focus\n\nThe report — which includes school- and district-level data — outlined recommendations to better prepare all students for college success.\n\nChief among them was that high school students should — at a minimum — be prepared to take a college algebra course upon graduation.\n\nCurrently, 36 percent of students are not ready for college-level math, the report said. That's despite the fact a majority of students take not only Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 but geometry before their senior year.\n\nThe report suggests that some high school math classes — like those labeled \"college prep\" — may not be rigorous enough. Reading comprehension and writing skills are another weakness, with 24 percent of the class of 2015 having to take remedial English classes upon entering college. Even students that took college prep or honor-level English need remediation — one-third of those students weren't up to snuff, according to the report.\n\nPayne said the problem isn't with Delaware's education standards, but with how they are implemented.\n\n\"Even college prep, the lowest (level class), should be preparing them for college,\" she said.\n\nHonors, dual enrollment and AP classes should place them ahead of the curve with college credit.\n\nThe report says 3 in 10 students who require remediation never graduate college with a bachelor's degree, making the consequences of not being college-ready that much more severe.\n\nOf the 4,969 students in Delaware’s class of 2015 who enrolled in college, 70 percent chose to enroll in a Delaware public or private college. Forty-one percent of these students required remediation courses in college.\n\nMaking the connection\n\nDelaware Pathways' steering committee released a strategic plan Wednesday that outlines its path for the next several years.\n\nIts goal is, by 2025, for 65 percent of Delaware’s workforce to earn a college degree or professional certificate and for every student to graduate from high school prepared for continuing education and a career.\n\n“We’ve just got to figure out a way to better prepare young people for the economy we’re moving into,” said Bob Schwartz, from Jobs for the Future and Harvard’s Graduate School of Education.\n\nDelaware Pathways does not sell college as the only option – some students may be better served by getting a technical certificate or two-year degree, Schwartz said.\n\nBut Schwartz added, “I think our message has to be for all young people … to get a job in today’s labor market, you’re going to get a certificate or degree beyond high school.”\n\nFOOD: Leo & Jimmy's closing after 87 years in Wilmington\n\nPayne said Delaware Pathways could play a role in lowering remediation rates because it helps students understand how college and careers connect and may inspire kids to take upper-level math courses in order to better prepare themselves for life after high school.\n\nOne student who is already thinking about her future career is Beatriz Ramirez, of William Penn High School. As part of the culinary arts program there, she was placed in a job at Buckley’s Tavern in Centreville with chef Tom Hannum this year.\n\nStudents from the program also get state ServSafe certification, which is needed by at least one person in every professional kitchen and can get students college credit.\n\nRamirez is graduating soon and plans to go to either Johnson & Wales University or the Culinary Institute of America.\n\nShe said through Delaware Pathways, she has found her passion.\n\n“I was never interested in anything until I found culinary at William Penn,” she said. “When you walk into the kitchen, you don’t feel like one more student; you feel like you actually belong there.”\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

Those reductions began last week when now-permanent CEO Edward Breen laid off as many as 100 workers in the company's Sustainable Solutions business – including some in Wilmington – and halted a planned IT upgrade project, ending work for 300 contract workers.\n\nIn the coming months, Delaware could lose thousands of well-paid, highly educated workers, downsizing that could put a significant dent in the state's economy.\n\nOr, bioscience leaders say, this could be the opportunity Delaware needs to grow its next big employers.\n\n\"The one unique thing Delaware has right now is access to available talent,\" said Chris Yochim, chair of the Delaware BioScience Association. \"If you can create real incentives for entrepreneurs in this space and foster a culture of innovation, a lot of that talent will stay here and become part of the next wave of economic growth.\"\n\nThe big question now: Will Gov. Jack Markell and the General Assembly have the stomach to bet on unproven bioscience startups – particularly if those gambles mean chasing fewer potential jackpots in the manufacturing and financial services sectors?\n\nA renewed focus on the life sciences could stem the immediate impact of job losses at AstraZeneca, DuPont and Chemours, by continuing the state's legacy of innovation and increasing high-paying employment, said Mike Bowman, president of the Delaware Technology Park and a central figure in the state's bioscience industry.\n\n\"Startups can be risky, but those investments are less expensive than the whale hunting the state's doing now,\" Bowman said. \"That bigger stuff, going out and trying to bring existing companies here, I can't think of one thing that has worked.\"\n\nMarkell said his strategy has worked to \"bring plenty of companies from outside.\"\n\nThe governor pointed to some recent examples, including a $1.9 million grant approved in 2014 that encouraged Wilmington financial services company Navient to add 200 jobs, bringing its Delaware employment to about 800. Other successes, Markell said, include Uzin Utz, a German flooring company that plans to add 25 jobs near Dover thanks to $418,000 grant approved in 2013 and ABGroup Packaging, an Irish bag manufacturer approved for a $253,000 grant this year to bring nearly 90 jobs to the Newark area by 2017.\n\nYet the state also once provided space for startups, partnerships with universities and a stream of seed funding that helped bioscience companies establish a foothold here. But during the past decade, bioscience leaders say, the state has largely neglected the sector in favor of propping up the manufacturing and financial service sectors hard hit by the Great Recession.\n\nDuPont: A legacy of startups\n\n\"We could have taken that same money and made 20 smaller plays on the organic growth game that, in my opinion, fits the kind of Delaware most people actually want,\" Bowman said.\n\nBernice Whaley, director of the Delaware Economic Development Office, insists the Markell administration has supported the state's bioscience industry – while also fighting to recover thousands of jobs lost to the recession.\n\nTwo of DEDO's 20 largest Strategic Fund allocations under Markell went to bioscience companies: An $11.1 million grant in 2011 to Incyte, a Wilmington-area cancer drug maker, and a $3 million award in 2012 to Fraunhofer USA Center for Molecular Biotechnology in Newark.\n\nIn the current fiscal year, Markell has only $10 million in the state's Strategic Fund, used by DEDO to attract new companies, retain existing businesses and spur job creation.\n\n\"Investing in life science is great, but it's not going to be an immediate job creator,\" Whaley said. \"And when your focus is getting people back to work, you have to look a little more short term.\"\n\nJobs in bioscience come only after a company survives the financial challenges of developing a product, overcomes regulatory hurdles and proves scalability, Bowman explained.\n\n\"That's my problem with the state metrics,\" Bowman said. \"It's all one note related to jobs. Where's anything else?\"\n\nNow is the time to invest, he said – before highly skilled workers flood the market.\n\n\"It's all about having more bets on the table,\" he said. \"The more bets you make, the more likely one of them will hit.\"\n\nA shining example\n\nBioscience companies have helped absorb DuPont layoffs once before.\n\nIncyte, a pharmaceutical company headquartered in Alapocas, is widely hailed as one of the state's biggest success stories. The company expects to end 2015 with more than $500 million in net product revenue from sales of Jakafi, the first and only drug approved in the United States to treat patients with two rare blood cancers – myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.\n\nIncyte employs about 525 people at the former Wanamaker building off Augustine Road, and plans to hire another 400 in a new office building the company wants to build nearby. Those employees pull down an average salary of about $150,000.\n\nBut Incyte, founded in California in the late 1980s, didn't come to Delaware fully formed. And it wasn't lured by high-dollar incentives from DEDO.\n\nIn 2001, it came looking for talent.\n\n\"Incyte started as a genetic information business and basically sold databases to researchers working in gene therapy,\" said Paula Swain, the company's executive vice president of human resources.\n\nOnce that business began to wane, the board of directors sought to transform Incyte into a fully integrated drug discovery company.\n\nTheir first move was to hire CEO Paul Friedman, the former president of DuPont Pharmaceuticals Research Laboratories, who became available after DuPont sold the business to Bristol-Myers Squibb for $7.8 billion.\n\nFriedman said it only made sense to launch Incyte's new business model on the East Coast.\n\n\"Hiring good medicinal chemists is very difficult,\" said Friedman, who led the company until early 2014. \"But I knew there was a lot of available talent right here. They worked for me at DuPont Pharma and many of them didn't want to go to Bristol Myers. I knew who was good and who wasn't, so we were able to build our roster very quickly.\"\n\nTapping into a talent pool of former DuPonters proved to be the key to Incyte's success.\n\n\"Incyte had about $500 million in its bank account, but no amount of money alone would have done it,\" Friedman said. \"You need good experienced people and we were able to find them here. That gave us a huge leg up.\"\n\nFirst, the new business had to find space and Incyte initially was unable to find anything suitable in Pennsylvania or Delaware.\n\nCompany officials eventually settled on an unused building at DuPont's Stine-Haskell Research Center in Newark, yet the two sides were unable to come to terms on a lease. Bowman, a former DuPont executive, and Bob Dayton, the current head of Delaware Bio who then worked for the state economic development office, called in a favor from former governor and newly minted U.S. senator Tom Carper.\n\n\"At that time, I was like a recovering governor,\" recalled Carper, who managed to broker a deal between the two companies.\n\nTen former DuPont Pharma employees soon joined Friedman and Swain, who previously led the division's human resources department. Within a year, the company added another 60 biologists and chemists.\n\nIn 2002, Incyte secured $1.2 million in state grants to equip its new laboratory and research facility. But it would take nearly a decade before those research efforts paid off, with Jakafi in 2011 winning approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn late 2012, Incyte received a second grant from the state – $11.12 million to help fund 266 new jobs, nearly doubling the company's workforce.\n\nThe investment remains one of the Markell administration's largest outlays from the Strategic Fund.\n\nBut by that point, Bowman noted, \"Incyte was an obvious play. Most of these life science companies need 5 years to scale up and 10 years before you know whether they've arrived or plateaued.\"\n\nThat's why elected officials, who tend to measure time in four-year political terms, have not made bioscience a larger piece of Delaware's portfolio, Bowman and Yochim contend.\n\n\"If you're going to build a life science industry, it's a very long-term commitment,\" Yochim said. \"It can't be one-and-done by any means. That's not to say you shouldn't have some desire for quick wins, but you've got to have staying power if this space is ever going to pay off.\"\n\nRise of an industry\n\nIncyte is far from Delaware's only success in the bioscience sector.\n\nMore than 350 bioscience facilities, collectively employing about 8,200 workers, were tallied in a 2014 report commissioned by the international trade group Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO).\n\nThose businesses include research and testing laboratories, medical device and lab equipment makers, genetic therapy pioneers, early-stage drug developers and companies that provide those business with chemicals and biological agents.\n\nSome have experienced tremendous growth in recent years.\n\nQPS, a bio-analytical contract lab in Newark's Delaware Technology Park, was launched by DuPont Pharma alum Ben Chien in 1995 with three employees. Today, the $120 million company employs 260 in Delaware and another 1,170 worldwide at offices in Europe, India and Asia.\n\nMany more are small shops with 10 employees or less. But even the smallest tend to pay well. The average annual wage offered by Delaware's bioscience industry is about $118,000, the BIO study found.\n\nThat's nearly four times Delaware's per capita income of about $28,000. By comparison, workers in the state's finance and insurance sector average $90,000 per year, while Delaware factory workers average $58,000.\n\nIt was bioscience's growth potential – rather than salaries – that convinced the Carper administration to pursue the sector in the 1990s, giving the first big push to what was then a relatively non-existent industry in Delaware.\n\n\"One of the economic principles we tried to abide by was the need to diversify,\" said Carper, who now serves as Delaware's senior U.S. senator. \"At the time we were so heavily dependent on DuPont, autos and financial services. We wanted to broaden the base of our economic activity so no matter what happened to the economy globally, we would be able to maintain our employment.\"\n\nRobert Coy, who led DEDO from 1993 to 1998, said bioscience seemed like a natural fit, given the wealth of assets in the region.\n\n\"There were a number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies headquartered in around Philadelphia that we thought we could attract,\" said Coy, who now leads an Ohio-based venture capital firm called CincyTech. \"We knew there was talent in the area because DuPont still had a pharmaceuticals division and was just beginning to develop a new agriculture-focused biotech business. And we felt southern Delaware's ag sector would be able to benefit from any developments in biotech.\"\n\nDEDO generated seed funding for the new industry by investing in venture capital firms that could evaluate and finance promising companies. The agency then encouraged many of those fledgling businesses to locate in the new Delaware Technology Park.\n\nThe park was launched in 1991 in a single building off Wyoming Road in Newark to provide affordable space and mentoring for startups. Today, it consists of five buildings and houses about 50 small companies. Over the years, tenants in the park have created more than 16,000 jobs with 25 companies \"graduating\" to their own locations.\n\nThe Carper administration also attracted the Fraunhofer facility that is now the largest of seven research institutes throughout the country operating under the Fraunhofer USA umbrella, employing about 100 scientists and pharmaceutical manufacturing experts.\n\nThe University of Delaware began developing the Delaware Biotechnology Institute in the late 1990s. Located in the Delaware Technology Park, the institute houses more than two dozen faculty members and facilities for five of the school's colleges. It also promotes academic and industrial partnerships, coordinates high school science competitions and helps train science teachers throughout the state.\n\nCarper also helped convince the newly formed AstraZeneca to establish its North American headquarters in Fairfax in 1999, thanks to a $40.7 million package of grants and tax credits, along with $70 million in road improvements near the facility. In exchange, AstraZeneca pledged to increase its workforce at the site from 2,400 to 4,000 by 2004.\n\nThe pharmaceutical company's employment hit a peak of 5,000 workers in 2005, only to have patent loses and a global recession lead to a major restructuring. Today, AstraZeneca has about 2,400 workers in Delaware,\n\n\"Bioscience really can pay off but you have to have the patience for it,\" Coy said.\n\nA shifting foundation\n\nDelaware may have lost much of its patience for the slow developing bioscience sector on Sept. 15, 2008, the day financial services firm Lehman Brothers' submitted the largest bankruptcy protection filing in U.S. history, sending the Dow Jones into a tailspin. By then, the state already was reeling from AstraZeneca's contraction combined with the loss of 400 jobs at Invista's nylon plant in Seaford in 2004. Another 3,000 job losses followed MBNA's acquisition by Bank of America in 2005.\n\nThe bleeding continued after Markell was elected.\n\nChrysler's Newark assembly plant shut down in late 2008 following a year of gradual layoffs – ultimately putting 2,100 workers out of jobs.\n\nBy the time the new governor took office, Delaware's unemployment rate was just under 8 percent. That rate would top out at 10 percent in late 2009 after General Motors' Boxwood Road plant near Newport closed, resulting in 550 job losses.\n\n\"At the beginning of this administration, the effort was to diversify,\" said Whaley, who served as deputy director for her predecessor, Alan Levin. \"But the downturn was so severe, we quickly welcomed any opportunity for jobs that presented itself, particularly in the areas where so many people were becoming unemployed.\"\n\nOne of the main tools the state used to turn the tide came in the form of $213 million in jobs-related grants and loans extended through the Strategic Fund since 2009.\n\nAs of March, three out of every four dollars, roughly $162.7 million, had been awarded to just 20 companies. More than half of that amount was approved for manufacturers, while nearly a quarter was approved for banks and insurance companies.\n\nThose investments did result in some wins.\n\nThe Delaware City Refining Company, for instance, received $42 million in state grants and loans – incentives that facilitated the shuttered refinery's sale from Valero to PBF Energy, which eventually restored about 600 jobs that had been lost in early 2010.\n\nBut the high-dollar outlays also led to some failures.\n\nFisker Automotive pocketed $21.5 million in taxpayer funds before filing for bankruptcy protection in late 2013. The 2,500 jobs the company promised to create at the former General Motors plant near Newport never materialized, even though the company opened a manufacturing plant in California this summer.\n\nNewark fuel cell maker Bloom Energy has consistently missed hiring targets set when it was approved for a $16.5 million taxpayer-funded grant in 2012. Last month, the company confirmed that only 224 workers have been hired – well short of the 600 it had promised to create by 2015.\n\nLegislation approved in 2011 gave Bloom a 21-year guarantee of minimum revenues from Delmarva Power for all output from a 30-megawatt fuel cell operation in Delaware. In exchange, the company accepted economic development requirements that included building a fuel cell manufacturing plant in Newark.\n\nWhile Bloom's job targets have not been met, the premiums cost Delmarva's roughly 305,000 customers in Delaware $37.1 million during the first year of full-capacity service in 2014 – adding $54.65 to typical residential bills that year.\n\nOngoing support\n\nMarkell and Whaley said the state's improved unemployment rate – 4.9 percent in September – demonstrates how its investments in manufacturing and financial services have paid off.\n\nJPMorgan Chase recently announced it would bring 1,800 jobs with an average annual salary of $65,000 to Delaware by 2019. DEDO promised to award JPMorgan Chase $9 million in Strategic Fund grants over three years after the bank refurbished a former AstraZeneca building off of Concord Pike to handle back-office operations.\n\n\"Look at our job growth versus other states in the region,\" the governor said. \"It's not even close.\"\n\nDelaware's job numbers have grown 11.6 percent since January, 2010, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Maryland, Pennsylvania and New Jersey all recorded growth of less than 10 percent in the same period.\n\nDelaware's investments in finance do not mean bioscience has gone untended, Whaley said. Since 2009, the administration has provided $35 million to Delaware's bioscience sector in addition to the Strategic Fund grants extended to Incyte and Fraunhofer.\n\nThose funds include:\n\nA $3 million, 10-year loan extended to Bowman's Delaware Technology Park for a 10,000-square-foot \"wet lab\" incubator built in the Phase II building at the University of Delaware's Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) campus on the site of the former Chrysler plant. That project is the first expansion of the technology park in nearly 16 years.\n\nA $3 million, 12-year loan to Delaware State University for the Optical Science Center for Applied Research. The 28,000-square-foot facility that opened last month houses laboratories where researchers are helping to search for life on Mars, find treatments for sickle cell anemia and better detect early-stage cancers.\n\nHologic, a Massachusetts-based women's health company with labs in Glasgow, was approved for a $1.1 million grant in 2012 to help fund a $14.8 million expansion that was slated to bring the local employment to 160. Hologic declined to release its current employment numbers in Delaware.\n\nCD Diagnostics was approved for a $500,000 grant the same year to move from Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, to Claymont in exchange for a vow to reach 170 employees by 2016. The company now employs about 100 workers split evenly between Delaware and Maryland.\n\nUp to $1 million a year to Fraunhofer and Delaware Biotechnology Institute's CAT Program, which connects researchers with industry.\n\nAnnual contributions of $1 million a year to university-hospital partnerships largely funded by the National Institutes of Health. Those organizations include the Delaware Center for Translational Research, a group that recruits new investigators and develops community outreach programs, and the IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE), which helps expand research activities across basic, translational and clinical areas throughout the state.\n\nLast year, Markell signed a bill that doubled a state tax credit to help small businesses with the cost of inventing new products and processes.\n\n\"I don't blame the bioscience industry for wanting more,\" Whaley said. \"But it's been a rough couple of budget years, so we've had to look at revenue neutral things and use the Strategic Fund to support them where we can.\"\n\nMarkell noted his administration has increased the state's investment in the Biotech Institute and made a \"significant investment\" in the wet lab incubator space at STAR Campus.\n\n\"From what I'm told, it's already filling up,\" he said of the wet lab. \"Maybe we ought to be doing more of that.\"\n\nBut, he said, tough choices have to be made with limited resources.\n\n\"No one can say they're doing everything,\" he said. \"We live in a world where we have to make choices. We don't have the resources to do everything.\"\n\nCalling for a new approach\n\nThat current level of support won't be enough if the administration wants to take full advantage of the talent pool likely to spill out of DuPont, Chemours and AstraZeneca, Bowman said.\n\n\"I don't think they get life science,\" he said. \"Jack [Markell] is a business guy, but he's not really a life science guy. Alan [Levin] certainly wasn't. I don't think he ever loved this space.\"\n\nBowman said the state's strategy should be less about grants and loans for job creation and more focused on developing a critical density of bioscience companies.\n\nProviding more lab and office space with subsidized leases would lower the hurdle many startups face while still in their infancy, he said.\n\nSmall loans with lengthy repayment terms – based on solid science rather than job creation or net income – would allow early-stage pharmaceutical companies to bridge the funding gap between clinical trial phases, Bowman said.\n\nDelaware lawmakers, he said, also should be willing to consider bold, sweeping changes similar to the state's 1981 Financial Center Development Act, which eliminated ceilings on interest and fees for consumer loans and made the state a national hub for the financial services sector.\n\n\"We made a huge bet on banking once,\" said Tracy Shickel, a former Gore executive who now runs the bioscience marketing firm GreenKite. \"If you have a legacy of changing laws, what's to say you can't do that again?\"\n\nYet Delaware may be falling behind when it comes incentives offered to bioscience companies.\n\n\"I do think Delaware is late to the party when it comes to adopting the kinds of statewide economic development programs that are readily available in Pennsylvania and growing in state like Ohio and Maryland,\" said Stephen Tang, CEO of the University City Science Center in Philadelphia.\n\nFormer and current organizations at the Science Center have created more than 40,000 jobs in the Greater Philadelphia region, generating $64.5 million in annual city and state tax revenue. Much of the Science Center's success, Tang said, is attributable to state programs applied to certain geographic areas.\n\nThe Keystone Opportunity Zone, for instance, provides eligible companies with significant state and local tax exemptions, while the Keystone Innovation Zone provides eligible startups with up to $25 million in tax credits that can be applied to their own tax bill or sold to other companies, providing an invaluable source of revenue before a marketable product or process has been developed.\n\n\"Entrepreneurs are very shrewd and looking to locate in places that are not only attractive from a tax standpoint but also somewhere that's going to give them a clear advantage when it comes to growing bigger,\" Tang said. \"I think if Delaware wants to make strides in that market, it's got to be more competitive.\"\n\nBob Dayton, Delaware BioScience Association's executive director, said he will meet with legislators in the coming weeks to discuss legislation enacted in other states, such as angel investor tax credits and a program similar to the Keystone Innovation Zone.\n\n\"We're making some progress and have some bi-partisan support,\" he said. \"We have to be patient because sometimes it takes a little while, but I feel we have a 50-50 shot of getting something through [the General Assembly] in 2016.\"\n\nBowman is less optimistic.\n\n\"We go down to Dover every summer and hold a luncheon for the General Assembly,\" he said. \"This year, we had maybe one or two legislators stop by. It was sad.\"\n\nState lawmakers, he said, have little interest in the bioscience sector, while the governor's office does little to champion the industry.\n\n\"The administration isn't beating our drum and the General Assembly doesn't understand us,\" he said. \"When the state is silent – I mean really silent – that's a real concern.\"\n\nContact business reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nWhich industry is Delaware's best bet for job growth?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/06/12/who-is-running-for-office-in-delaware-elections-2024/70302805007/", "title": "Delaware 2024 election: Who is running for office?", "text": "Even though elections are a year and a half away, statewide and local races are already heating up across Delaware.\n\nBefore U.S. Sen.

She eventually landed on DSU's dean's list, all while participating in a slew of extracurricular activities.\n\n\"My back was up against the wall. I had to succeed. I like to say, 'Good things come to those who wait; great things come to those who work,'\" she says. \"I knew it was all or nothing. When I'm focused on something, it's life or death. My focus as a child was my talent, not school. Now that had changed.\"\n\nDuring her DSU years, Mustafa was crowned Miss Middletown and Miss Delaware State University. She also grew close to her mentor, Vince \"Chelli\" Ciammaichelli, the university's mass communication technology director who helped her learn the ins and outs of television production.\n\nAfter graduating in 2015 with a degree in mass communication, Mustafa slowly started getting jobs in television, starting with a local Comcast broadcast before doing interviews for ESPN at the 2016 Entertainer's Basketball Classic at Rucker Park in Harlem.\n\nThat same year, Mustafa began working for BET, where she was writing, producing and acting in several programs for both television and digital, including \"BET Breaks.\" She also hosted and did interviews for iHeartMedia, including red carpet chats during special events.\n\nThese days, she spends a lot of her time working for MTV. She began as a panelist on the show's \"Power Rank Live\" segment and has grown into a co-host on the show, which got its start with Carson Daly as host in 1998.\n\nThe first version of the show rode the success of boy bands, pop stars and Eminem until 2008 when it was canceled.

Her dream life would be to work on a film each year, which holding down a job in television as well, perhaps as a talk or game show host.\n\nShe still visits home often, seeing her mother and father, Wilmington's longtime Superintendent of Recreation Rashid Mustafa. Her family is also close to former city councilman and community organizer Norman Oliver, who she refers to as her uncle.\n\n\"Even though I live in New York now, Wilmington is always close to my heart,\" she says.\n\nWilmington is where her mother Andrea realized she had to make a major sacrifice if her daughter was going to break into television. She gave up her career in the banking industry when it became clear that audition calls came at all hours and she couldn't work and be an on-demand chauffeur.\n\n\"She sacrificed so much for me at a young age,\" Mustafa says of her mother, who worked at Kohl's department store as one of her early overnight jobs. \"I knew she was on the verge of getting fired sometimes and would still bring me on auditions.\n\n\"She knew I had a shot to get out of Delaware and she was willing to sacrifice it all while my dad worked to keep a roof over our head.\"\n\nAs Andrea Mustafa puts it, \"I saw her potential and changed everything for her.\"\n\nOne of the earliest television gigs for Mustafa came at the age of 13 — a children's-themed Philadelphia Eagles show for WTXF-TV.\n\nInstead of just acting, she now had to ask questions. And she's never looked back.\n\nShe remembers interviewing former Eagles tight end L.J. Smith one day and it went so well that Smith told her she was going to be the next Oprah Winfrey.\n\n\"I was like, 'What's an Oprah?' I thought it was a food or something,\" she says, still laughing at the memory.\n\nThese days, Mustafa is fully aware who Winfrey is.

Let’s improve their working conditions,” said the individual, who requested anonymity to protect their career.\n\nWith work crews tearing up sub-floors and adding the latest telecommunications connectivity in the Dover building on South Bay Road, lawmakers a mile away, at Legislative Hall, are wading through the state's deepest budget hole in nearly a decade.\n\nAs they review every dollar spent in state government, the apparent lack of transparency about DelDOT's renovation signals a troubling turn for an agency that oversees the disbursements of hundreds of millions of state and federal taxpayer dollars each year.\n\nThe question to consider, said a government ethics expert from Georgetown University, is whether DelDOT hid the true intent of the project.\n\n“To purely conceal the central purpose of your action, then it moves into the area of deceptiveness and that makes me nervous, and that should make public officials nervous, too,\" said Mark Carl Rom, a professor at Georgetown's McCourt School of Public Policy.\n\nCohan said her agency was absolutely transparent.\n\n\"ADA was the epicenter,” Cohan said.\n\nIn early February, an agency spokesman told The News Journal the reason for the construction – which began in January and is scheduled to be completed this summer – is to meet ADA standards, a legal requirement that has caused DelDOT in past decades to rethink how it plans transit, roads and even public meetings.\n\nThe law, signed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, prohibits discrimination and mandates that people with disabilities have the same opportunities and access as anyone else.\n\n\"The most significant ADA issues being addressed are accessibility in eight restrooms, the lobby/reception area, some offices, parking spaces/walkways, water fountains and signage,\" DelDOT spokesman Bud Freel said in an early-February email.\n\nIn the weeks since, The News Journal collected statements and emails from DelDOT staff that illustrate that was not the impetus for the multimillion-dollar project.\n\nWhen introducing the project to staff a year ago in an email, Cohan said the goals were to improve working conditions and morale. She did not mention ADA.\n\nWhen introducing the project to media in February, Freel said the project was prompted by the ADA. He did not mention morale.\n\nEmails sent by Freel to DelDOT executive staff following media inquiries show him peppering a colleague with questions as he \"was trying to come up (with) the justification for this project now.\"\n\nThe construction, focused at the headquarter's East Wing, includes $1.9 million for new furniture, carpets and cubicles, and another $1.8 million for things like rebuilt meeting rooms and new offices for human resources staff.\n\nThe total cost from three primary contracts totals $3.72 million, plus an additional $430,000 for moving expenses and a temporary lease at the Blue Hen Corporate Center. The East Wing, built in the 1960s, was last renovated in 1992.\n\nMixed messages\n\nFrom a window office adorned with Delaware license plate art, Cohan told The News Journal in March the remodel of the headquarters will transform the Dover building into an exemplar of ADA compliance.\n\nAny assertion the project is an unwise use of funds is “ridiculous,” she said as construction sounds echoed nearby.\n\nDelDOT's public-facing buildings must comply with every stipulation of ADA because the agency, through its civil rights section, also is an enforcer of the law, she said, noting ADA upgrades have occurred at dozens of other state buildings.\n\n\"It’s kind of absurd to have the agency responsible for ADA enforcement not be ADA-compliant itself, especially at our headquarters,” she said.\n\nImproved spirits among employees simply would be a welcome byproduct of the remodel, she said.\n\n\"We want to have a place that talented people want to come and work, and having a good work environment is critical to that,” she said.\n\nAccessibility issues were brought to her attention, Cohan said, after DelDOT's former ADA coordinator John McNeal carried out an accessibility study in 2016. It was that study that led to the renovation, she said.\n\nBut McNeal remembers it differently. He oversaw the ADA study, which was conducted by a consultant, after a planned remodel had already been decided upon, he said.\n\n\"It wasn’t the ADA that pushed the renovations,” he said. “The renovations were simply because the building was old.”\n\nThe study, however, did turn up scores of recommended upgrades, ranging from signs that lacked braille lettering to office and bathroom doors that were too narrow for a wheelchair to pass through. Navigating through the building \"could be a challenge at times,” said McNeal, who uses a wheelchair.\n\nWhile ADA might not have been the motivation, making the building more accessible for people with disabilities was \"just a good practice,\" he said. Under Cohan, he said, DelDOT increased annual spending on ADA improvements along roads and at state facilities by tenfold.\n\n\"The department has made a substantial investment in ADA compliance. For instance, increasing the annual ADA budget, or pedestrian improvement budget for ADA improvements from $300,000 to $3 million a year,\" he said.\n\nAgencies were not required by the 1990 law to immediately make ADA improvements to already existing building and sidewalks. As a result, there are numerous sidewalks along state-managed roads that lack ramps and many roads with no sidewalks at all. The gradual process to upgrade that infrastructure is ongoing.\n\nSTORY: Protect yourself from paving scams, DelDOT warns\n\nSTORY: U.S. 301 quickly becoming reality near Middletown\n\nDaniese McMullin-Powell, an advocate for people with disabilities, said while she appreciates the work at DelDOT's headquarters, the department should focus more on accessibility issues on sidewalks and transit, citing the inability of people in wheelchairs to access numerous streets and bus stops in Delaware.\n\n“Most (disabled) people take transportation on a daily basis, and it's a lot more people than the one or two who might be employed at (DelDOT),” said McMullin-Powell, who uses a wheelchair.\n\nCohan argues ADA issues should not compete with each other, that accessibility upgrades can happen concurrently. Her agency has conducted ADA upgrades at numerous other DelDOT facilities, she stressed, including a half-million-dollar upgrade to bathrooms at the Smyrna rest area.\n\n“We don’t have to choose between ADA compliance in our headquarters buildings and ADA compliance out on the street. Both should happen,” she said.\n\nThe funds for the headquarters construction come from DelDOT's facility line in the Capital Transportation Program. The CTP, as it's known, is a six-year priority list of infrastructure projects across the state.\n\nWhen pressed whether the remodel is a good use of funds for ADA, McNeal stated, “Again, my understanding of the needs for the renovation ... were because of the challenges of the building being older and deteriorating, and with regards to the working space being friendly to the employees.\"\n\nThe original construction idea was to renovate the entire headquarters, McNeal said, but “budget challenges” limited it mostly to the older east building.\n\nCohan said the idea for the reconstruction went back to at least 2015. That was also the year lawmakers gave DelDOT an injection of dollars for capital projects from an increase in fees imposed at the Division of Motor Vehicles. Sen. Colin Bonini, R-Dover South, said that money was intended for roads, but he has noticed how Cohan takes employee morale very seriously.\n\n\"We were told it is important to raise (fees) because all of the projects that were backlogged, he said. \"They (brought) out these statistics about X number of our bridges are failing. We did not get a statistic saying our headquarters is failing.\"\n\nHis colleague, Senate Minority Leader Gary Simpson, R-Milford, said if the true purpose is, in fact, ADA, then DelDOT has little discretion. They must improve conditions because \"it is a lawsuit waiting to happen.\"\n\n\"If somebody came to me and said we can either take $4 million and upgrade this road and fix the cracks ... or we can use it to make this building ADA-compliant, I say we got to do the ADA first,\" he said.\n\nWhile planning the project, Cohan was keenly aware of financial concerns if the project cost grew too high, said Hugh Curran, former DelDOT finance director, who now works at Denver International Airport.\n\n“Secretary Cohan was very sensitive about cost, and it’s a large space,” Curran said. The building “felt like 'That 70's Show' within an endless maze of cubicles.”\n\nIn an email, he echoed McNeal's statements, stating although the building needed ADA upgrades, project goals were “safety, talent retention and attraction, increased productivity, collaboration/innovation and increased esprit de corp.”\n\nThe East Wing's massive, open-floor spaces, particularly on its second floor, was crowded with scores of cubicles, as staff from multiple divisions type and talk within earshot of each other. The atmosphere was not conducive to employee innovation, Cohan said.\n\nSimpson said the space has been in terrible shape for years.\n\n\"As long as I've known the building, it is a drab, dreary space filled with cubicles,\" he said.\n\nAn official from the Delaware Office of Management and Budget, which approves capital projects planned for state government buildings confirmed the project began before McNeal's accessibility study. But the ADA needs pushed it forward.\n\n\"ADA really spurred the project because it involved the entire building inside and out. And to accomplish some of the requirements to make it accessible, parts of the other projects had to be done. Furniture needed to be reconfigured,\" said Mike Svaby, director of facilities management at the Office of Management and Budget.\n\nBeing transparent\n\nA year ago, Cohan told DelDOT staff in an email the reason for the project was to create an office \"that is safe, is conducive to hiring and retaining talented employees, increases productivity, enables collaboration and innovation, (and) builds morale.\" She did not mention ADA.\n\nThe News Journal obtained the communication through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe project also would be partially a collaborative effort, she said, and asked employees for suggestions for upgrades through an employee survey.\n\nIn a string of emails obtained by The News Journal, employees requested personal improvements that had nothing to do with ADA.\n\nFor instance, while asking for an upgrade to her work area, Theresa Vander Schel, DelDOT manager of application support, said, \"As new furniture is being ordered for the sit/stand desks, can we please incorporate those into the basement?\"\n\nIn October, after employee surveys were filled and funding secured, Cohan formally announced plans to her staff in an email, which again contained no mention of ADA.\n\n“We hope you and your colleagues are excited about having a more efficient, collaborative and healthier work space in 2017,” she wrote.\n\nToday, as sections of the East Building have been turned into a construction zone, much of its central staff are working temporarily at the Blue Hen Corporate Center, a former mall that sits across Bay Road from the Dover headquarters. It frequently is used as temporary shelter for government operations.\n\nDelDOT signed a lease with property owner Pettinaro for 55,000 square feet of office space, totaling $373,450 over seven months. Another $33,461 was paid to Hopkins and Sons Inc. to move desks, refrigerators and other equipment from the headquarters to the Blue Hen Corporate Center.\n\nBut as moving was set to commence in January, DelDOT employees found leaks in the roof of the temporary space. In an email to DelDOT's acting Finance Director Shante Hastings, Nathaniel Delesline noted the air quality in the building was \"very poor.\" Officials delayed the move for days as flaws in the temporary office were fixed, leading to grumbling from staff.\n\nCohan admitted the move has created \"some upset employees.\"\n\nWorker frustration is not uncommon in state government. Employees from DelDOT and other state agencies have told The News Journal numerous times during past years that the dearth of pay raises since the 2008 financial crisis has caused unease among staff members.\n\nFrom correctional officers to highway workers to social service providers, pay has been a constant gripe.\n\nWhen asked if a pay raise would make DelDOT employees happier, Cohan stated rhetorically, “If you got a raise, would it boost your morale?”\n\nWith the state facing a projected $386 million budget deficit, raises appear unlikely. Convincing legislators like Bonini to vote for a tax increase proposed by Carney to maintain government at current levels will be challenging enough.\n\nTo build goodwill, Bonini said, agencies should be completely clear about their multimillion-dollar expenditures.\n\n\"I'm sure there's not a state agency out there that wouldn't like an upgrade to its building,\" he said. \"But if you're spending the money to upgrade the building, then tell us you're spending the money to upgrade the building.\"\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

The state website for mass layoff announcements initially neglected to include salaried workers.\n\nOne of Delaware's biggest polluters will be shutting down its New Castle County plant this fall, resulting in potential job losses for about 100 workers.\n\nFormosa Plastics informed state officials on Tuesday it plans to halt operations at its 50-year-old plant near Delaware City on Sept. 30 and decommission the facility by the end of the year.\n\nFormosa manufactures a polyvinyl chloride resin at its 400-acre Delaware City property. The resin is then sold to manufacturers who use the plastic to make a wide range of products, including floor tiles, sealants, adhesives, oil filters and traffic cones.\n\nThat production capability will be moved to a \"newer and more cost-efficient\" plant in Point Comfort, Texas, the Taiwanese-owned company said in a release.\n\n\"This action will allow the business to focus on growth opportunities, including new product innovation and modernization,\" according to the statement.\n\nA company spokeswoman said workers at the plant were notified of the impending closure \"recently\" but declined to comment further.\n\nDelaware City Refinery receives controversial permit, gets four years to study fish kill\n\nUnemployment rate down to 4 percent in Delaware; lowest unemployed total in 10 years\n\nLayoffs looming at Capital One after sale of brokerage business\n\nThe announcement marks the second large manufacturer to announce it will be pulling out of the state in the last 60 days. PPG Architectural Coatings informed state officials in June that it would be laying off more than 65 workers when the company shutters its Dover plant and distribution center in 2019.\n\n\"I think these are two different and unrelated business decision,\" said Paul Morris, co-chair of the Delaware Manufacturing Association trade group. \"But the job loss is definitely a concern.\"\n\nFormosa has built up a long record of violating environmental regulations since purchasing the already heavily polluted Delaware plant from Stauffer Chemical in 1981.\n\nThe property was classified as a Superfund site by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 1983 and has been ranked as one of the nation's top sources of vinyl chloride emissions for decades.\n\nVinyl chloride is a known carcinogen closely tracked by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It can cause respiratory and reproductive problems and other damage, particularly for employees exposed to high workplace levels over long periods.\n\nFormosa's Delaware operating permit was revoked for two weeks in 1985 following repeated pollution releases.\n\nThe company has since paid at least $880,000 in state and federal fines for polluting the air and water, violating workplace safety rules and mishandling hazardous waste. It also agreed to undertake $850,000 worth of upgrades to settle state and federal pollution lawsuits in 2005.\n\nThe impeding closures of Formosa and PPG come at a time when unemployment in Delaware has been improving.\n\nJune's unemployment rate of 3.9 percent sets a high-water mark not seen since 2008 and the first time since early 2017 that Delaware's jobless rate outpaced the nation, according to preliminary data from the state labor department.\n\nDelaware has added an estimated 6,800 jobs since this time last year, including 200 new positions in manufacturing. The state's estimated 26,200 manufacturing jobs is now at the highest level since 2010, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nBut that's still a long way off from nearly 45,000 manufacturing jobs that were here in the mid-1990s.\n\nMuch of that recent decline is directly related to four plant closures that collectively resulted in 3,700 job losses. They include DuPont nylon plant outside Seaford in 2003, the Newark Chrysler Assembly Plant in 2008, the GM plant in 2009 and the Claymont Evraz Steel factory in 2013.\n\nGov. John Carney last year signed legislation aimed at stemming that tide by enacting the first major change to the Delaware Coastal Zone Act in its nearly 50-year history.\n\nPassed in 1971, the Coastal Zone Act sought to protect the Delaware Bay and the state's shoreline from the encroachment of heavy industrial development. Fourteen industrial operations in existence at the time – including the plant now owned by Formosa – were allowed to continue their grandfathered functions, but the sites were limited to those exact footprints and uses.\n\nThe measure passed by the General Assembly created a conversion permit that would allow those sites to be redeveloped for new heavy industrial uses.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control is working to craft regulations for that new permit by next year. In the meantime, DNREC can issue those permits but has yet to do so.\n\nMorris, who also serves as vice president for workforce development and community education for Delaware Technical Community College, said he hopes those conversion permits will result in the reuse of the Formosa plant and other vacant industrial sites.\n\n\"Manufacturing is by no means dead in Delaware,\" he said. \"Some of the big employers might be gone but I think we are going to continue to see growth among the small- and medium-size companies out there.\"\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/23/read-delaware-gov-john-carneys-full-2020-state-state-address/4554411002/", "title": "Read Delaware Gov.

Hall-Long, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tem, members of the 150th General Assembly, members of the Cabinet, distinguished members of the Judiciary, invited guests and my fellow Delawareans: Thank you for inviting me into the chamber today.\n\nA point of personal privilege before I begin. I’d like to recognize and welcome my mother, Ann Carney. Mom is here with my brothers Mike and Joe, Joe’s wife Gail, my brother-in-law Brendan and my sister Claire. The gang’s all here! Well, almost all of them.\n\nI want to start with a special thank you to my wife, Tracey, for all she’s doing for our state.\n\nFinally, I’d like to recognize one of my oldest friends in the legislature, Sen. Harris McDowell.\n\nLEARN ABOUT YOUR LAWMAKERS:Introducing 'Know Your Legislator,' a tool for learning more about your state lawmakers\n\nAs you all know, he will be retiring at the end of this year. Harris is someone who has left his mark on this state in more ways than can be counted. And his absence will be deeply felt in the Senate chamber and back in our district in Wilmington. Join me in thanking my state Sen. Harris McDowell, for his tremendous service to our state.\n\n2020 State of the State - Governor John Carney - State of Delaware\n\nThis is the fourth time I’m addressing this body as your governor. And as we start the last year of my first term, it feels appropriate to take stock.\n\nOf where we were three years ago.\n\nOf the promises we made.\n\nOf the promises we’ve made good on.\n\nOf the work we have left to do.\n\nThree years ago, I promised Delawareans that at the end of my term, our economy would be stronger.\n\nThat middle- and working-class Delawareans would be better off.\n\nThat there would be better-paying jobs.\n\nThat we would feel safer in our neighborhoods and in our cities and towns.\n\nThat more of our children would be graduating ready for what comes next, with a sense of promise about the future.\n\nAnd that our state’s finances would be strong and in order.\n\nToday, I have good news to report.\n\nCompared to when I took office, 20,000 more people go to work every day in Delaware.\n\nPROTECTING DOGS FROM ANIMAL CRUELTY:Delaware Senate to consider new law to protect dogs from cruelty, life-threatening weather\n\nIn fact, more Delawareans are working than at any point in our state’s history.\n\nAnd with a strong economy, it’s the right time for us to invest in our future.\n\nMore than half of Delawareans working are employed at small businesses. They’re the engine of our economic growth.\n\nOur future success depends on finding ways to grow our small businesses. So last spring we started a new grant program: Encouraging Development and Growth Expansion, or EDGE for short.\n\nWe’ve awarded nearly $1.5 million in EDGE grants to 20 companies.\n\nOne of those business owners is Santiago Rojas-Carbonell with W7energy. He and his team are developing battery technology for zero-emissions electric vehicles.\n\nSantiago is here with us today. Let’s give him a round of applause.\n\nGulftainer, the new private operator of the Port of Wilmington, is investing as much as $600 million in the port. That includes a new state of the art container terminal at Edgemoor.\n\nThe ILA has already signed up 500 new members in anticipation of those opportunities. They’ve leased Elbert-Palmer Elementary in Southbridge to build a workforce training facility for port workers. This investment will translate into hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of new jobs.\n\nThanks to the Delaware Prosperity Partnership, there are over 1,000 new jobs in Delaware.\n\nAnd over 1,000 jobs stayed here in Delaware instead of moving out of state.\n\nWith your help, we’ve invested $10 million in a new Transportation Infrastructure Fund. When companies are deciding where to locate, we’ll be able to move quickly and decisively to help them.\n\nDelawareans also expect to be able to get to and from work quickly and safely. That’s why we’re investing $4.5 billion over the next six years to modernize our roads, bridges and public transit.\n\nNew investments in our technology infrastructure have already brought high-speed internet to the areas around Laurel, Seaford and Bridgeville — where service was spotty or nonexistent.\n\nThis is also helping family-owned businesses like Ellis Farms, a poultry and grain business in Millsboro. They rely on high-speed internet to collect data and drive farming operations.\n\nProjects are scheduled in Kent County in the coming weeks.\n\nKimberly Hopkins is an educator in Seaford.\n\nWithout access to high-speed internet, Kimberly couldn’t grade papers online at night. Her son with autism couldn’t get his videos to buffer.\n\nKimberly participated in our broadband pilot and is here with us today. She’s representing the thousands of Sussex and Kent Countians who now have access to this crucial 21st-century technology.\n\nPlease stand, Kimberly, and let us recognize you. Our technology investments are having an impact in other ways as well.\n\nThis past year, we launched Delaware OneStop. It’s a convenient, centralized platform that allows small businesses to easily get licensed with the state. We should also make it easier for everyday Delawareans to interact with their state government.\n\nWe need a OneStop for Delaware citizens — where you can buy your park pass, register to vote, renew your license or check for snow closures. I’ve asked our Chief Information Officer, James Collins, to lead a new effort to connect state government with Delawareans through technology. This will be a game-changer for our state.\n\nTogether, we’ve also invested over $30 million in the Higher Education Economic Development Fund. We want colleges and universities to help drive economic growth in Delaware.\n\nExciting projects are already underway.\n\nAt the University of Delaware’s Star Campus, we’re helping build a national research center for biopharmaceuticals. It will encourage scientists and entrepreneurs to innovate right here in Delaware.\n\nAt Delaware Tech, an automotive center in Georgetown and a training center in Middletown will help meet the workforce needs of our employers.\n\nAt Delaware State University, they have the first and only HBCU aviation program in the country. We’re replacing and expanding the aircraft fleet used to train students.\n\nI want to give a special welcome to Dr. Tony Allen, who was sworn in this morning as Delaware State’s new president.\n\nOur focus through all this has been to make Delaware’s economy more agile, more innovative and more sustainable.\n\nAt the end of three years as your governor, I’m pleased to report that the state of our state is strong, and getting stronger.\n\nBut we’re not stopping there. In my budget next week, we’re proposing $50 million in capital investments to further strengthen our economic infrastructure.\n\nThese investments are all designed to shift our economy into a higher gear.\n\nMany emerging companies have outgrown the experimental station or the Star Campus. So we’re investing in lab space where they can keep growing here in Delaware.\n\nWe’ll create a Site Readiness Fund, so we can quickly convert existing properties to meet the needs of prospective employers.\n\nAnd we’ll expand the EDGE grant program, to encourage even more small businesses to grow and innovate.\n\nOur goal is simple: We want companies to start here, to stay here and to grow here.\n\nWhile strengthening our economy has been a high priority, that hasn’t been our only focus.\n\nThree years ago, we promised to make Delawareans feel safer in their neighborhoods, and in our towns and cities.\n\nThanks to Rep. Bentz and members of the General Assembly in both parties, we passed the Beau Biden Gun Violence Prevention Act and another, similar red flag law.\n\nWE POLLED OUR READERS:Delaware Online survey shows strong appetite for gun control, $15 minimum wage, legal weed\n\nThe idea behind both pieces of legislation was really simple. We should keep firearms out of the hands of those intent on harming themselves or others. Family members and mental health providers can now raise a concern, and a judge decides whether to intervene.\n\nThese laws have already been used 35 times to date. And they have helped save lives.\n\nBut we know we can do more. I encourage every member in this chamber to support legislation that would ban so-called ghost guns and high capacity magazines.\n\nBANNING HOMEMADE GUNS:Bill to ban homemade 3D-printed guns heads to House floor\n\nThese bills are just common sense.\n\nWe’re also working with you to strengthen our school safety infrastructure.\n\nOver the past two years, we worked with Rep. Jaques, Rep. Short and others to invest $10 million in a new School Safety and Security Fund. Districts are training their personnel and using the latest technology to keep our children safe in school.\n\nWe shouldn’t lose sight of the progress we’ve made. Over the last decade, violent crime in Delaware has fallen by 27 percent, and property crime is down 25 percent.\n\nBut we all know we can do better.\n\nThrough the Family Services Cabinet Council, we’re partnering with Mayor Purzycki, Wilmington Police Chief Tracy, and Attorney General Jennings. The initiative is called Group Violence Intervention.\n\nWe’re talking directly to Wilmington’s most violent offenders, but with a new and different approach. We’re challenging them to put down their guns and offering an alternative to a life of crime and violence. We need a similar approach here in our capital city.\n\nAttorney General Jennings. Mayor Purzycki. Thank you for everything you do to keep our neighborhoods strong and safe.\n\nJoin me in giving them a round of applause.\n\nLast year, I signed an executive order to help ex-offenders more successfully re-enter their communities.\n\nThis year, all inmates sentenced to more than a year in custody get individualized plans as soon as they enter prison. The plans focus on drug treatment, education and job skills.\n\nIt’s in everyone’s interest that these individuals leave prison better off than when they entered.\n\nWe’ve made a lot of investments in our correctional system over the past three years. Commissioner DeMatteis is committed to continuing those improvements, starting with the prison healthcare system.\n\nNo one is working harder than Lt. Gov. Hall-Long to combat our opioid epidemic. Through the Behavioral Health Consortium, the lieutenant governor and others have given naloxone to more than 7,000 Delawareans.\n\nShe and a committed group of volunteers led by Dr. Sandy Gibney knock on doors and visit homeless encampments in the middle of the night to deliver naloxone. Dr. Gibney is here with us today.\n\nBecause of the lieutenant governor’s leadership on the Behavioral Health Consortium, thousands of Delawareans have gotten a second chance at life.\n\nWe’ve also established the first overdose system of care in the nation, expanding access to treatment for those who are ready to seek help. There is much more work to do. But thanks to our lieutenant governor and Dr. Walker, we are becoming a model for the country.\n\nI want to take a moment to highlight the good work of my wife, Tracey. Tracey’s First Chance Initiative focuses on hunger, trauma and early literacy. She also wanted me to acknowledge everyone, people in this room and outside this room, who is working with her on these issues.\n\nIn partnership with the Food Bank, our libraries and other nonprofits, Tracey is leading efforts to ensure that our children come to school ready to learn and thrive.\n\nOne of the best ways to achieve that is a simple one: Give children books.\n\nI’m proud to announce that with the leadership of State Librarian Annie Norman, we’re launching a pilot of the Dolly Parton Imagination Library.\n\nParticipating children will receive one book each month from birth to 5 years old – free of charge. The program will be centered in 13 public libraries covering thousands of children in five targeted school districts. We’re also working with Delaware’s pediatricians to get books to families right from the start.\n\nThese efforts will help families build home libraries that could span generations.\n\nThrough Tracey’s efforts, we’ve also received a $10,000 grant to build on Delaware’s success in promoting school breakfast. Every school in Delaware that provides free lunch now offers breakfast. And we’re working on making food available for students in after school and summer programs.\n\nThere’s a lot more to say about Tracey’s First Chance Initiative, and Tracey wanted me to tell you that she hopes to have the “chance” to talk to each of you directly about her work.\n\nThank you, Tracey, for everything you’re doing for the children of our state.\n\nI think we can all agree that our children should be our focus. And there are perhaps no children more vulnerable than those in our foster care system.\n\nMayda Berrios is in the audience today. Mayda spent several years in foster care and graduated from St. George’s. Today, she’s a sophomore at Delaware State and president of a campus organization that mentors children in foster care. Mayda has had to pull together the funds to pay for college.\n\nIn keeping with Tracey’s goal of giving every child a “First Chance” of success, we’re working with Reps. Griffith and Longhurst and Sens. Poore and Lockman to help students like Mayda. Our proposal will waive tuition and fees at Delaware Tech, Delaware State or the University of Delaware for students who age out of foster care.\n\nNothing causes more fear or anxiety than when you or a loved one gets sick. Thanks to legislation sponsored by Rep. Siegfried, we reduced rates on the ACA health insurance marketplace by almost 20 percent this year.\n\nBecause of that – while ACA enrollment rates have declined nationally – we saw a more than 6 percent increase in Delawareans buying health insurance on the exchange.\n\nWe have seen significant progress since the passage of the Affordable Care Act a decade ago. Today, almost 95 percent of Delawareans have health insurance.\n\nThat’s a big deal.\n\nWith the Lieutenant Governor's Challenge 2.0, Lt. Gov. Hall-Long is making sure children and adults are developing habits that will help both their mental and physical health.\n\nAccess to quality healthcare is also about having doctors in your community. In some areas of our state, we simply don’t have enough physicians. And so, in partnership with Rep. Bentz, we will create a healthcare provider loan repayment program. We want to attract some of the best and brightest young doctors to areas where they’re needed the most.\n\nA healthier Delaware starts with our most basic and valuable resource: water.\n\nIt’s critical that we protect that resource for future generations. From the Brandywine to Rehoboth Bay to Trapp Pond, we have beautiful natural areas in our state. And we all agree that families in Blades, here in Dover — and across our state — deserve to know that the water coming out of their faucets is clean.\n\nThat’s why we’re partnering with Rep. Longhurst and Sen. McBride to invest $50 million in clean water.\n\nBuilding off the work of Sen. Townsend’s Clean Water Task Force, we’ll create a Clean Water Trust Fund, and we’ll have a special focus on low-income communities.\n\nCLEAN WATER DEAL:Delaware officials propose $50 million investment for clean water needs\n\nTaking care of our environment is one of the most important obligations we have as elected officials. This is a historic investment that will make a big difference in the lives of Delawareans, in our economy and in our environment.\n\nI hope you’ll join me in making this a priority.\n\nEven when you’re governor, making Delaware better starts with the little things.\n\nIt drives my security detail crazy, but if you see me walking down the street, you’ll often see me stopping to pick up a Wawa bag or an empty bottle of soda.\n\nWe have a litter problem in Delaware. And I’m determined to stop it.\n\nLast year, we launched the Keep DE Litter Free campaign to get cities, towns and community groups on board. Secretary Cohan and her team partnered with Goodwill to start the Work a Day, Earn a Pay program. We hire folks struggling to get back on their feet to pick up litter several days a week in all three counties.\n\nThrough DelDOT’s leadership last year, we picked up close to 50,000 bags of trash.\n\nStarting next year, thanks to Rep. Brady and others, single-use plastic bags will be a thing of the past in Delaware. I think that deserves a round of applause.\n\nThis year, we are taking our commitment to the environment a step further. Over the next decade, we will plant 1 million trees across Delaware. That’s a tree for every Delawarean.\n\nDelaware has made great strides over the last decade to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, and we should continue to be a leader on this issue. We plan to work with my friend Sen. McDowell to set a new Renewable Portfolio Standard. By 2035, we want 40 percent of Delaware’s energy to come from renewable sources.\n\nAnd finally, thanks to all of you, we’ve preserved 134,000 acres of farmland. 25 percent of Delaware’s family farms are now preserved forever.\n\nDelawareans and visitors alike take pride in our natural environment – from our beaches, to our inland bays, to our award-winning park system.\n\nIn 2018, we welcomed a record 9.2 million visitors to our state. That translates into $3.5 billion coming to Delaware, also a record.\n\nYou all know one of my favorite parts of being governor is telling folks about the cool stuff there is to do here.\n\nThis year, I took a boat tour on the Nanticoke River with Rep. Short and ate oysters at the Leipsic Oyster Festival with Rep. Carson.\n\nI toured the Firefly concert grounds and sampled homemade ice cream at Hopkins Farm Creamery.\n\nI played corn hole at Crooked Hammock Brewery in Lewes and played disc golf at Killens Pond State Park.\n\nI went to the first Blue Coats game at the 76ers Field House and watched the Little League Senior Softball World Series in Roxana.\n\nSo, let’s hear it for a really fun year.\n\nWe’ve got something really cool happening this spring that everyone here will want to be part of.\n\nWarships named after the First State have sailed under a U.S. flag dating back to the Revolutionary War. But it’s been over 100 years since we’ve had a Navy ship named Delaware. That’s going to change this spring, when a USS Delaware, a brand new Virginia class nuclear submarine, is commissioned at the Port of Wilmington.\n\nTo help me market the state, I’ve got some marketing material to hand out here to the Speaker and the Pro Temp. There’s one for the rest of the General Assembly waiting for you when you leave the Chamber. These water bottles are reusable!\n\nWhile I’ve been having fun touring through Delaware, I’ve also spent time with state employees. The fact is, over the next five years, more than 40 percent of pension-eligible state employees will be able to retire.\n\nWe need to recruit a new generation of public servants into state government. For two years in a row, we’ve funded raises for correctional officers, teachers and social workers who help Delaware families all across our state.\n\nWe’ve funded renovations to the Carvel building that were decades overdue. And we’ll be including funding to advance the construction of Family Courthouses in Kent and Sussex Counties.\n\nWe passed the nation’s best parental leave policy for state workers and educators. More than 200 state employees have been able to spend 12 weeks at home with their newborn babies. Thank you, Rep. Heffernan, for leading the way on that.\n\nIn addition to helping their fellow citizens, many of our state employees put their lives on the line to protect all of us. Our National Guardsmen and women set an example of selflessness and sacrifice. Since I took office in January 2017, 1,280 members of the Delaware National Guard have deployed overseas and at home.\n\nWith us today is Capt. Joel Steinbrunner. During his 23 years of service in the Air National Guard, Capt. Steinbrunner has deployed six times in support of the war on terror. He’s also deployed to help after Hurricane Katrina, and with disaster relief in Puerto Rico.\n\nSpecialist Toussaint is also here with us today. She emigrated from Haiti to Delaware and is now enrolled in college. Join me in thanking Capt. Steinbrunner and SPC Toussaint for their service to our state and our country.\n\nThe promise we made three years ago to our children is probably the most important of all. We promised that at the end of our term, more children would be graduating ready for what comes next. And with a sense of promise about the future.\n\nToday I can report that graduation rates for low-income students and English learners are the highest they’ve been in 10 years.\n\nToday, for the first time in our state’s history, we’re targeting resources toward these students who need our help the most. We call it Opportunity Funding.\n\nDistricts are already putting the money to good use.\n\nAppoquinimink is expanding pre-K enrollment.\n\nIn Red Clay, Dorrell Green and his team are reducing class sizes and providing additional mental health supports.\n\nLaurel educators are placing a specific focus on behavioral health in the classroom.\n\nLaurel is represented today by Jessica Nowacki, their behavioral health coordinator.\n\nJessica was hired through Opportunity Funding. Public schools across the state are using this funding to hire more than 200 new educators and professionals focusing on low-income and English learners.\n\nLet’s give Jessica and all of our educators a big round of applause.\n\nMy budget will continue this investment, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but because the future of our state depends on the success of our children.\n\nWe know that an early start is key to this success. That’s why, over the next three years, we’ll increase state-funded ECAP pre-K seats by 50 percent statewide.\n\nWhile students across our state need our attention, students in the City of Wilmington need our help the most.\n\nRED CLAY SCHOOL BUSES COULD TICKET YOU:Delaware passes bill to let schools ticket drivers who pass buses illegally\n\nThat’s why, just yesterday, we announced our plan to invest $50 million to build a new school on the East Side of Wilmington. And to renovate Bayard on the West Side.\n\nAll across Delaware, from Dover to Middletown to Rehoboth, we’ve built or renovated nearly 30 beautiful schools in the last three years.\n\nOur children in Wilmington deserve no less.\n\nThree years ago, we promised Delawareans we’d make investments that move our state forward, while getting our state’s finances in order.\n\nAfter digging out of a $400 million deficit, we’ve had two years of stronger revenues.\n\nAnd we’ve been disciplined about how we’ve spent it. Today, we’ve built a $200 million surplus, and have $126 million in additional reserves.\n\nThe budget I’ll propose later this month will limit spending to sustainable levels and dedicate one-time revenue for one-time infrastructure projects.\n\nI will also propose the largest infrastructure plan in our state’s history, for the second year in a row.\n\nWe’re building state-of-the-art schools across our state. We’re rebuilding our water infrastructure to make sure every Delawarean has access to clean water.\n\nWe’re preserving open space and investing in our downtowns.\n\nAnd we’re supporting our small businesses and the working families of this state.\n\nFolks come up to me all the time and ask, “How are things going?” I’ve taken to borrowing a phrase from our senior Sen. Tom Carper. “Compared to what?”\n\nAs I start my fourth year as your governor, and compare things now to how they were when I took office, things are really looking up.\n\nAll of us in this room are keepers of the public trust.\n\nWhen we make promises, we have to keep them.\n\nAnd that is what we’ve done.\n\nWhen people have confidence in their government, it helps give them hope for the future.\n\nInspiring that hope is our job too.\n\nThere are some things we can do in government that don’t require a new program, or new spending, or even a new idea.\n\nAnd yet, they can inspire that same hope, and faith in government.\n\nWe had just such an opportunity a few months ago, when right across the hall, the Senate confirmed Delaware’s first African American Supreme Court justice, who is here with us today.\n\nJustice Montgomery-Reeves’ swearing in before a crowd of hundreds at Howard High School was a moment I won’t soon forget.\n\nAnd so let’s continue to work together over the next year.\n\nTo build on the promises we’ve made.\n\nTo give people faith in their government.\n\nAnd to give them hope for the future.\n\nThank you, God bless you, God bless the state of Delaware, and God bless our great United States of America.\n\nLAWMAKERS SET NEW DEADLINE FOR BILLS:Delaware lawmakers are setting a new deadline for the legislative year\n\nOFFICIALS FEAR THE END OF WESLEY:Wesley's future could depend on whether state approves yet another round of funding", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/23"}]}

New technologies that use a different kind of cellular connection will add to the demand.\n\nHomeland Towers, the company that proposed the Mount Kisco tower locations, also has proposals in Bedford as well as in Putnam County's Putnam Valley, Nelsonville and Phillipstown. The Danbury, Connecticut, company leases space on its towers to providers such as Verizon and Sprint.\n\nTARRYTOWN: MTA to dismantle cell tower by playground and low-income apartments\n\nLAWSUIT: Wireless provider's suit against Rye City dismissed again\n\nMOUNT KISCO: HomeGoods property on the market for $7.45 million\n\nYorktown already hosts several cell towers to serve its 36,000 residents in the 39-square-mile town. The Town Board on Feb. 5 approved Homeland's plan to install another at Yorktown's water towers on Quinlan Street.\n\n\"It's a big issue,\" Yorktown Supervisor Ilan Gilbert said. \"We're a hilly town and there are dips and valleys, and areas that are challenged, quite challenged, in terms of cell phone reception.\"\n\nThe push and pull over cell towers was evident at a Jan. 28 Mount Kisco Board of Trustees meeting, which included discussion of Homeland Towers' proposals to build a tower near the Mount Kisco Chase housing development or in Leonard Park. Some said a tower at either location would create an eyesore, while acknowledging their own reliance on cell service.\n\n\"We're not trying to deny people coverage for their communication,\" said resident John Stockbridge, who said his opposition focused on preserving the nearby 156-acre Marsh Sanctuary that's popular with hikers.\n\nPower to locate tower\n\nFederal law places limits on a local municipality's power to reject cell towers.\n\nNelsonville officials denied a proposed 110-foot pole on 9.6 acres on Rockledge Road, and Homeland Towers sued. The company cited cellular service gaps and challenged the village's ruling, saying that the proposal met Nelsonville's own regulations.\n\nThere are exemptions to local oversight. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority faced community pushback when it constructed a 150-foot tower next to a Tarrytown playground and housing complex in September 2018 with no public notice. The tower would not have been permitted if the agency had to go through the standard approvals process. After a series of reports by lohud's Tax Watch and community outcry, the MTA removed the tower.\n\nSome localities are trying to get ahead of conflicts. Bedford has established a hierarchy for future cell tower locations: \"co-locating\" on an existing tower should be the first option; after that, preferred site locations are, in descending order, municipal property, industrial property, light industrial, and then in the business district.\n\n\"We want to be proactive so that we can identify areas where we have (cell service) issues and try to address those issues before a cell carrier or a tower developer comes in with an application that we may not agree with,\" said Bedford Supervisor Chris Burdick.\n\nHomeland's founder and president, Manuel Vicente, had told Bedford Town Board members that a proposal to construct a tower at the municipal offices on Cherry Street could provide the town with lease revenue and space for a emergency responder communications system.\n\nThat's what Yorktown plans for a cell tower that will be installed at its water tower. Its emergency communication system will be installed, free.\n\nFuture changes\n\nAs cell tower controversies brew in some communities, they will also face the coming \"5G\" technology expected to roll out over the next few years. The new network uses smaller structures, called small cells, that attach to things such as utility poles and streetlights.\n\nAccording to the Wireless Infrastructure Association, 5G needs both small structures and larger cell towers to accommodate future cell phone use demand.\n\n\"Mobile data traffic is expected to increase seven-fold over the next five years,\" said Matt Mandel, WIA's head of legislative affairs.\n\nBut the small structure design can also support current cellular service. Greenburgh officials want to take advantage of that now to boost service in Irvington. The hamlet's east side lacks cell reception, but residents opposed a proposed 130-foot tower.\n\nGreenburgh Supervisor Paul Feiner said a cell service void is more than an inconvenience, it's a safety concern.\n\nThe small-antennae system wouldn't accommodate 5G, but would allow reliable reception in a small area.\n\n“Forget Gs,\" said Garrett Duquesne, Greenburgh's community development and conservation commissioner, \"they don't have service, period.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/05/24/keep-up-latest-businesses-coming-and-going-delaware/9779461002/", "title": "Keep up with the latest on businesses coming and going in Delaware", "text": "We've all driven past a construction site and wondered what it will become.\n\nWe hope that this collection of our development coverage will produce answers to some of those questions.\n\nThe stories listed below detail the explosion of warehouse space in Delaware, the ceaseless debates between preservation and growth unfolding across the state and some of the most anticipated stores and businesses coming soon.\n\nConsider bookmarking this page as the list will be updated throughout the summer.

Legislation being crafted by state Rep. Stephanie Bolden, D-Wilmington East, would change that.\n\nBut county lawmakers are pushing back, fearing the potential for a city land grab.\n\nWilmington officials say the change is not being motivated by a specific property that they have their eyes on. Instead, they say it is necessary to continue to grow the city's population and tax base. While there have been no high-profile fights between the city and county for control of land in recent memory, Wilmington officials said the county's ability to veto city annexations has limited such proposals.\n\n\"We have not tried to [annex] because we know we are going to be stopped in our tracks because of these restrictions,\" said City Council President Theo Gregory. \"There are benefits when you annex. You expand your possibility for housing development and commercial development for land contiguous to the city limits.\"\n\nA draft of the bill has not been filed for debate in Dover but has been circulated among local lawmakers. Bolden said she wants to fine-tune the draft with further conversations with city officials before it is filed.\n\n\"It is about fairness and whether the city of Wilmington is being discriminated against,\" Bolden said, adding she has no firm timeline for filing the legislation.\n\nIn order to annex land, the city must receive approval from its council and mayor. After that, the proposal must be approved by the County Council and county executive. Once those approvals have been met, residents inside the land being annexed must approve the move in a special election.\n\nAll other municipalities do not require approval from the county they are in. Draft legislation circulated by Bolden's office would remove the county's say in the annexations along with the special election approval requirement.\n\nThe General Assembly crafted the special annexation rules for cities with more than 50,000 people, which only applies to Wilmington, in 1987.\n\nBolden said she has met with city officials in recent months about the rules, which she considers unfair.\n\n\"The city of Wilmington, being the largest city in the state of Delaware, should have the same options that smaller cities have,\" Bolden said.\n\nOnce introduced, the legislation could prove controversial among county lawmakers, some of whom fear the changes could lead to a city land grab that would decrease county tax revenue.\n\nIf Wilmington were to annex land containing a large employer, it could benefit city coffers through the wage tax and could hurt county coffers because properties in the city pay less county taxes.\n\nThrough a spokeswoman, New Castle County Chief of Staff James D. McDonald said the county administration looks forward to reviewing the bill once it is filed. He offered no further comment.\n\n\"It would give the city of Wilmington carte blanche authority for land grabs,\" said Penrose Hollins, who represents part of Wilmington and is running for the at-large County Council president seat.\n\nHollins said there needs to be some fairness in how the city is allowed to annex property, but said the draft bill would give the city too much authority. He said that taking residents' voices out of proceedings is also problematic.\n\n\"I think the annexations that we have seen in other jurisdictions have not amounted to major land grabs of property,\" Hollins said. \"You should have a comprehensive approach to annexation, I think the approach [being discussed] is not the right approach. It will further take away from the county's ability to plan and, frankly, survive.\"\n\nThe county is currently at odds with town government in Townsend over sewer service and annexation.\n\nThe city is working to annex a 6-acre property near Downing Drive and Governor Printz Boulevard for an industrial park.

Previous proposals to develop the property have ensnared local politicians and been fought all the way to the Delaware Supreme Court.\n\nThe point of the February meeting is to offer the public an opportunity to comment before the development-approval process, said Mike Hoffman, a land-use attorney with the firm Tarabicos & Grosso who represents Pettinaro.\n\nThe new plan\n\nDetails regarding the new proposal are scarce, but the redevelopment will consist of a mix of uses.\n\nThat includes some 313,000 square feet of non-residential space. That space will include \"modern\" office facilities and shops \"anchored\" by an unspecified \"high-end\" grocer.\n\nThe development will also include 33 \"upscale\" townhomes and some 80 \"luxury\" flats. The proposal does not seek a rezoning.\n\nHoffman declined to comment more specifically about the proposal.\n\nIn an interview originally published by Town Square Delaware and on his firm's website in 2016, Pettinaro said he envisions a mixed-use development at the site that is not as big as previous proposals to build on the land.\n\n\"I absolutely think the area is right for a mixed use development providing you don’t make it too big,\" Pettinaro said in the interview. \"I personally don’t feel it can handle two million square feet of space. However, a smaller combination could be one of the best places in New Castle County.\"\n\nHis new proposal will still need to be approved by county land planners. What kind of traffic study the proposal will require is also unclear.\n\nHoffman's firm had not filed preliminary plans with the county's Department of Land Use as of Monday.\n\nA decade of controversy\n\nThe property was the subject of numerous lawsuits and failed development plans over the past decade.\n\nStoltz Real Estate Partners, headquartered in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, bought the 92-acre former office complex from the DuPont Co. in 2007 for $94 million.\n\nThe company, headed by Keith Stoltz, touched off the most contentious battle in Greenville history a year later when it proposed three massive projects along the Del. 141 corridor, including a $525 million redevelopment of the Barley Mill Plaza.\n\nThe plan called for 700 apartments or condominiums, 1.8 million square-feet of office space and 731,000 square feet of retail space included stores, restaurants, a fitness center and a hotel.\n\nSeveral wealthy and powerful residents of Greenville formed a well-funded group called Citizens for Responsible Growth that opposed the projects, arguing the plans would cripple traffic and forever change the bucolic landscape.\n\nBackground:\n\nBarley Mill sold for about $40 million less\n\nStoltz sells off last of Barley Mill Plaza land\n\nDel. Supreme Court hears Barley Mill Plaza case\n\nA compromise was reached in 2010 that dropped the scale of the Barley Mill Plaza development to 1.6 million square feet of shops and offices, while eliminating the residential component. A rezoning of 37 acres along Del. 141 from office to commercial use was approved in 2011.\n\nThat led to the creation of Save Our County, a new group that sued New Castle County and property owner Barley Mill LLC in late 2011, claiming the rezoning violated state law.\n\nCurrent County Executive Thomas P. Gordon joined the battle against Barley Mill Plaza after returning to office in 2012, a year before Delaware Chancery Court invalidated the rezoning and two years before the Delaware Supreme Court upheld that decision.\n\nLand changes hands\n\nStotz sold off 35 acres of the Barley Mill Plaza property to Odyssey Charter School shorty after. The school developed a portion of the property.\n\nA source with knowledge of the transaction said the school paid about $25 million for their portion of the complex.\n\nIt's the remaining 56 acres Pettinaro now seeks to develop.\n\nHe bought the remainder of the complex from Stoltz in 2016.\n\nReal estate transfer tax records indicate Pettinaro likely paid about $27 million for the land and office buildings.\n\nTransfer tax records are not always a perfect indication of sale price, but a $52 million return on the land from the Pettinaro and Odyssey deals would mean Stoltz could have lost about $42 million.\n\nThe property is unique because of its location along two major thoroughfares as well as being one of the last, large-scale properties in the monied Greenville area ripe for redevelopment.\n\nHoffman said it is a challenge his client takes seriously.\n\n\"Since purchasing the property, Greg Pettinaro and his team have tried to find a good balance of uses to create a good synergy to revitalize this property,\" Hoffman said.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

Action items for economic revitalization, improved health and increased youth programming are all detailed within the proposal.\n\nThe release of the plan comes as Southbridge residents are calling for equal investment in the face of the Riverfront East development – the counterpart to Wilmington's Riverfront on the other side of the river that is slated to bring $100 million to the area surrounding this community.\n\nRIVERFRONT EAST:Southbridge residents call for equal investment in $100M Riverfront East plan\n\nWhile residents and leaders are supportive of the development, they say they want the neighborhood to be included in the upcoming growth of the Riverfront.\n\nYouth programming\n\nTwo new, state-of-the-art turf fields near Southbridge – built by prominent Delaware developer Buccini Pollin Group Inc. – already began offering sports programming to the neighborhood’s youth on Sept. 25, when a community day was held.\n\nThe fields, which are an expansion to the Chase Fieldhouse nearby, serve as a welcome first step for the requests of residents who have long asked for increased youth programming for their children.\n\n“We fully expect to engage the Southbridge community,” said Steve Cavalier, general manager for BPG │SPORTS – the operating and owning company of the fields and the Chase Fieldhouse.\n\n“We'll build from there with the rec leagues, flag football and things like that to get the kids from that community to help participate in the different activities that we have.”\n\nCavalier worked with Wilmington’s City Council and Hanifa Shabazz, a 40-year Southbridge resident and former Wilmington City Council president, to help develop the fields.\n\n“The city negotiated to give them that privilege to build two more fields, which are right in the backyard of Southbridge,” Shabazz said.\n\nCurrently, the only entrance to the fields is a gravel path that can be accessed only by driving off of A Street, across from the Delaware Humane Association.\n\nShabazz said that she was working diligently with the city to construct a walking path from Southbridge to the fields in order to make it more accessible to the neighborhood’s youth.\n\nCOMMUNITY RESPONSE:Mass shooting in Southbridge stuns community leaders, prompts calls for action, investment\n\nCity Councilwoman Michelle Harlee, who represents Southbridge, presented the legislation that proposed building the new fields near her community after realizing the benefit they would have on the surrounding area.\n\n\"When I found out the benefit for the community and for some of our marginalized and underprivileged children to have opportunities to have access to the field, I thought that it would be beneficial for the community to have those fields there,\" she said.\n\nHarlee emphasized the importance of BPG following through on its promises and providing more access to the community. She added that there were plans to make the upcoming community event a monthly staple for Southbridge.\n\nEnvironmental health\n\nThe path to the fields would also lead to the long-awaited 14-acre wetland park, which would help alleviate flooding in Southbridge and create a new community park. The low-lying neighborhood has long been plagued by flooding, due to its sewer system that combines sanitary and stormwater.\n\nWETLAND PARK:Wilmington hopes wetland park will stop flooding in low-income neighborhood\n\nRising sea levels have made flooding only worse.\n\nBut the wetland park has yet to be finished despite a projected completion date of early this summer.\n\nAdditionally, Southbridge was identified in 2017 as one of seven communities in New Castle County that are at a much greater risk for cancer and respiratory illness as a result of environmental pollution. Yet in 2019, Delaware officials cleared the way for the construction of a slag-grinding facility near Southbridge despite fierce opposition from residents.\n\nThere have also been attempts to put a state prison and a cattle-housing facility in the neighborhood.\n\n'IT'S OUR TURN':Southbridge residents say they're tired of being a dumping ground\n\nIn response, the neighborhood action plan calls upon the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control to implement impact assessments that would consider the health and environmental repercussions that potentially polluting industries would have if they were placed in Southbridge.\n\nThe assessment would take the potential repercussions into consideration before issuing a permit to a new industry in the neighborhood.\n\nEconomic revitalization\n\nThe plan details the creation of a referral system that would provide a pool of qualified applicants from the neighborhood for new jobs created with the upcoming Riverfront East development.\n\nAdditionally, it calls upon Gulftainer – a global logistics company that is leasing the now-shuttered Elbert-Palmer Elementary School in Southbridge – to implement the promised job training programs, computer training classes and credit union into the community building.\n\nThe company’s plans have been delayed due to COVID-19, but have recently been reinvigorated with calls from the community for increased upkeep of the school, given that the conditions have led to vandalism, squatters and trash buildup.\n\nGulftainer has since cleaned up the area surrounding the school and has implemented 24/7 security.\n\nSTATE OF DISREPAIR:How Southbridge's shuttered Elbert-Palmer school fell into a state of disrepair and what lies ahead\n\nThe neighborhood plan serves as an update to the 2006 proposal and was put together by multiple Southbridge-related organizations alongside an outside consulting firm. The Southbridge Civic Association, the South Wilmington Planning Network and Healthy Communities Delaware helped design the plan with input from numerous neighborhood residents and leaders.\n\nWith a slew of changes and development set to arrive in and around Southbridge, the neighborhood action plan provides a blueprint for what the community wants and needs.\n\nAfter receiving input from residents, a finalized version of the report is set to be released in late October.\n\nContact the reporter at jcastaneda1@delawareonline.com or connect with him on Twitter @joseicastaneda.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/11/18/port-purchase-edge-moor-future-expansion/94067638/", "title": "Wilmington port expansion leaps forward with land buy", "text": "Xerxes Wilson\n\nThe News Journal\n\nOfficials have a $10 million deal to buy Edge Moor, a former chemical plant on the Delaware River\n\nPort officials will now solicit proposals from private investors to fund expansion\n\nFuture of former Boxwood Plant in Newport could hinder plans for port expansion\n\nThe Port of Wilmington took a major leap forward in its decade-long effort to expand the state's shipping economy Friday, announcing an agreement to purchase Chemour's shuttered Edge Moor chemical plant for $10 million.\n\n\n\nIn the coming month, the Diamond State Port Corporation, a quasi-public board that operates the current port, will seek potentially billion-dollar proposals from private investors. They expect to hear how they'would expand the current port facility as well as build new container shipping docks at Edge Moor and/or another site on the Delaware River, Secretary of State Jeffrey Bullock, who chairs the board, said on Friday.\n\nThe purchase of the 114-acre Edge Moor facility, which sits on the Delaware River off I-495, will be finalized next spring. The land is being bought using $5 million in the port's cash reserves as well as a $5 million private loan, Bullock said. Chemours closed the facility last year.\n\nBullock said the move is a commitment toward reimagining the current facility as well as significantly expanding the state's maritime economy at Edge Moor or Riveredge, a piece of land just south of the Delaware Memorial Bridge that has been eyed by local officials.\n\n\n\n\"Going forward, the Edge Moor site will be marketed with Riveredge as Diamond State Port Corporation's two primary options for expansion,\" Bullock said. \"It is my hope that two sites will be built.\"\n\nThe current port was founded in 1923 and sits at the confluence of the Christina and Delaware rivers. The facility employs about 2,000 and serves about 400 vessels annually. But officials say the current facility is outdated, has no room to grow, is not always profitable and requires annual injections of millions of dollars from taxpayers to pay for facility repairs.\n\nExpansion of the port's operations have been discussed for years, but any major expansion of container traffic will require more land and the modernization of the current facility, which will need hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nThroughout the summer, Bullock and other officials have met with potential investors. On Friday, he said they will solicit formal proposals next month.\n\n\"People come in and say we are interested,\" Bullock said. \"Now we are at the point where we are out there saying 'structure a deal for us.

That is not the issue,\" Bullock said. \"The issue is if we get a proposal that meets all of our criteria.\"\n\nThose criteria include protecting the port's existing business, creating new business and minimizing the cost to Delaware taxpayers for future port operations.\n\nThe deal the state seeks will likely involve more than a $1 billion in private investment and be a 20 to 40-year venture. Port officials want to couple the redevelopment and expansion of the current port facility with any new container terminal at Edge Moor or Riveredge, Bullock said.\n\nThe port's master plan study, completed this year, found the current port will need $300 million in investment to meet the growing demands of its current customer base over the next two decades. While container shipping is a part of what the current port facility does, it is seen as a niche port. Fruit and juice concentrates as well as bulk cargo comprise a significant part of its business.\n\nConsultants also looked at the potential for a new container shipping facility on the Delaware River.\n\nOf the sites examined, Edge Moor was the least expensive to develop and also has the quickest potential to be operational as a container port. The study found that a container port facility could be built with $500 million and take four years to be operational.\n\nBullock said an opinion from Attorney General Matt Denn stated a container port operation would not run afoul of Coastal Zone Act rules that limit industrial activity on the Delaware River.\n\nThe $10 million price could rise as officials expect some cost associated with environmental contamination on the land that was a chemical manufacturing site for more than 80 years. The DuPont Co. first purchased the facility in the 1930s. It operated under the DuPont banner until Chemours was spun off in July 2015. What those costs will ultimately be will be predicated by exactly how an investor wants to develop the container terminal, Bullock said.\n\nBullock said the purchase does not give Edge Moor priority over Riveredge for future expansion and that the purchase was predicated by the market.\n\n\n\n\"The Edge Moor site was going on the market,\" Bullock said. \"Therefore the board had to make a decision as to whether we were going to secure that property or let it go away.\"\n\nLocal longshoremen and New Castle County Executive Thomas P. Gordon have been advocating for a container facility on 176 vacant acres that are part of the Riveredge Industrial Park. That site was evaluated by the port’s consultants who estimated it would cost about $882 million.\n\nSTORY: Chemours Edge Moor plant closing is 'ominous' sign\n\nSTORY: Mystery carrier could boost Wilmington port traffic\n\nBullock said it is necessary to market all the potential expansion areas as part of one deal to avoid cannibalizing the current port's business or any business generated by development of one of the new sites.\n\nPort officials and local politicians see broadening the state's port business as a way to bolster its lagging industrial economy. There are both short-term and long-term actions that lead officials to believe such an expansion would be profitable to private investors.\n\nFederal officials are scheduled to complete the deepening of the river's shipping channel to 45 feet later this year, allowing for traffic from larger container ships. The push to expand onto the Delaware is also bolstered by the hope population serviced by ports on the eastern seaboard will continue to grow and Delaware will be able to capture shipping traffic from that growth.\n\nPort officials and local longshormen and Gordon have at times been at odds over which land should be given priority in conversations about port expansion. On Friday, Gordon cheered the purchase of Edge Moor and said the matter is in the port corporation's hands. Gordon will leave office in January and has spent more than a year advocating for and putting taxpayer money behind the potential development of Riveredge.\n\nLast month, he, Bullock and other state and union officials met with officials from China Gezhouba Group, a Chinese construction company, about investing in the state's maritime economy.\n\n\"I don't know what is happening in China, but they have a lot of money they want to use here,\" said Ronald \"Kimokoh\" Harris, business agent with International Longshoremen's Association Clerks and Checkers Local 1883. Those members load and unload cargo and have been one of the primary supporters of the Riveredge concept.\n\nA potential hangup exists at the former General Motors Boxwood Plant near Newport. The plant was most recently sold by Fisker Automotive to Wanxiang America Inc., a Chinese company, in early 2015.\n\nLast month, Wanxiang tapped the local office of national brokerage firm CBRE Inc. to find a buyer for the property that has sat mostly dormant since General Motors vacated the plant in 2009. Gordon sees the property as a potential future distribution center and a key asset in the viability of port expansion.\n\nSTORY: Officials see variety of uses for Fisker site\n\nSTORY: New Castle County considering study for new port\n\nHe said its potential sale is concerning.\n\n\"I'm concerned that GM could be sold and could not be utilized for its potential,\" Gordon said. \"I think it is the state's goal to have that incorporated in the future expansion of the port.\"\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

This time, the rapper is Takeoff of Atlanta’s platinum hit machine, Migos, who was slain early Tuesday in Houston, according to a source close to the group.\n\nHouston police responded to the scene of a downtown shooting at a bowling alley and pool hall, finding one person dead, the department said. Two other victims were taken in private vehicles to hospitals.\n\nTakeoff’s death is the latest in a trend that stretches back to 2018. Each year since then, gun violence – whether through robbery or disagreement – has killed at least one rapper who was either already famous or on the cusp of crossover fame.\n\nThe 28-year-old rhymesmith, who was born in Lawrenceville, Georgia, had just released a project with his uncle and Migos bandmate, Quavo, titled, “Only Built for Infinity Links,” the album’s name a shoutout to the 1995 debut solo effort from Wu-Tang Clan’s Raekwon. Quavo and Takeoff had recently announced they’d be performing under the moniker, “Unc & Phew.”\n\nHours before he was killed, Takeoff tweeted the video to the single, “Messy,” off the project. On the track, Takeoff rhymes, “Wanna know my moves and all my spots, but I move clever/Wanna know my stash, how much I got, but I ain’t gonna tell ‘em.” On Friday, he tweeted about performing in Miami.\n\nLast month, he and Quavo appeared on the podcast, “Drink Champs,” and in response to praise for his lyricism on “Infinity Links,” Takeoff told listeners, “It’s time to pop it, you know what I mean? It’s time to give me my flowers, you know what I mean? I don’t want them later on when I ain’t here. I want them right now, so …”\n\nIn addition to his work with Quavo and Migos, Takeoff released a solo album in 2018, “The Last Rocket,” which hit No. 4 on the US charts.\n\nFrom left, Takeoff, DJ Mustard and Quavo perform at the BET Awards in Los Angeles in 2019. Kevin Winter/Getty Images North America/Getty Images\n\nNews of Takeoff’s killing rocked hip-hop, but his loss is being felt well beyond the bounds of music as many chimed in to offer condolences and praise, while others questioned what needs to be done to stop the scourge of rappers being killed.\n\n“Too many young men of color are killing each other,” tweeted Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner. “Resolving their disputes by pulling their guns and shooting one another regardless of fame or fortune. Crazy. And in a few second a life is gone, families and friends are left grieving. STOP!”\n\nJournalist Jewel Wicker offered some additional career insight from an interview with Takeoff’s uncle, writing, “Takeoff, the then-kid who convinced his uncle (Quavo) to start rapping then helped change the flow of rap. The undisputed best rapper in Migos (his uncle told me so himself just a few months ago). What a loss.” She further reported Takeoff earned his stage name from his ability to “just launch into his verses and record everything in a single, pristine take.”\n\nFellow writer Jemele Hill added, “I was in college when Biggie and ‘Pac were killed and thought there was no way we’d ever experience anything remotely close to that again. Now it’s happening so frequently that you barely have time to recover before someone else killed. RIP Takeoff.”\n\nRapper Ja Rule felt similarly, writing, “this s**t has to STOP,” while fellow rap star, Lecrae, wrote, “No hot takes. No profound thoughts. Just sad that another rapper, son, brother, and friend has been killed. God be with all those who feel the loss.”\n\nRolling Stone Editor-in-Chief Noah Shachtman tweeted out a 2015 article in which Takeoff spoke of his dedication to his craft.\n\n“You couldn’t tell me I wasn’t going to be who I was,” he said. “I knew I was going to be here.”\n\nTakeoff now joins the list of rappers who were victims of gun violence. Here are some other notable artists killed since 2018:\n\n2018: XXXTentacion\n\nXXXTentacion, seen here in 2017, found fame after going viral on social media. Larry Marano/REX/Shutterstock\n\nXXXTentacion was gunned down June 18, 2018, in an apparent robbery as he left a motorsports store in Deerfield Beach, Florida.\n\nFour men were arrested that year in connection with the rapper’s killing. They were indicted on murder and other charges, and one suspect pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and is expected to testify against the other three, CNN affiliate WPLG reported.\n\nThe 20-year-old was wildly popular at the time of his death. He rocketed to fame after his song, “Look at Me,” went viral on social media and SoundCloud in 2016.\n\nHe went on to be featured in XXL magazine’s 2017 Freshman Class alongside other up-and-coming artists. His album “?” premiered at No. 1 when it was released in March 2018, according to Billboard.\n\nThe album’s single “Sad!” peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 and spent 15 weeks on the charts, according to Billboard.\n\nRight after his death, “Sad!” moved from No. 52 to No. 1 on Billboard ‘s Hot 100 chart. The song was the first posthumous No. 1 for a lead soloist since The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Mo Money Mo Problems” in 1997, according to Billboard.\n\nThe rapper was not without controversy: He was accused of homophobia after telling a story on a podcast of choking and severely beating a cellmate he suspected was gay while they both were housed in a juvenile detention center. He had also been awaiting trial for a domestic violence incident involving his pregnant girlfriend.\n\n2019: Nipsey Hussle\n\nNipsey Hussle was fatally shot in March 2019 near a clothing store he owned. Shutterstock\n\nNipsey Hussle, an award-winning hip-hop artist and philanthropist, was shot at least 10 times on March 31, 2019, in Los Angeles.\n\nThe rapper’s last message on Twitter read: “Having strong enemies is a blessing.” It was later found that a conversation about snitching preceded his fatal shooting, according to grand jury testimony.\n\nAuthorities said Eric Holder fired the shots that killed Nipsey and wounded two other people. Holder, 32, was found guilty of first-degree murder in the rapper’s death. According to numerous hip-hop publications, his September sentencing date was postponed to this month.\n\nNipsey had been well-known on the underground circuit, and he was gaining a mainstream following just before his death.\n\nA year earlier, he launched the first Marathon Clothing smart store in Los Angeles. Nipsey also owned The Marathon Agency marketing company, investment firm SC Commercial Ventures and the record labels Proud 2 Pay and All Money In No Money Out Records, according to Press Atlantic Records.\n\nThe 33-year-old was nominated for best rap album during the 2019 Grammys for the only studio album he ever released, “Victory Lap.” He lost to Cardi B.\n\nBeyond his music and businesses, Nipsey was a member of the Rollin 60s Neighborhood Crips but spoke out against rappers who would boast of purported gang affiliations to stunt or look cool – not because he wished them any violence, but to remind them that for too many young people, joining a gang was about survival.\n\n2020: Pop Smoke\n\nPop Smoke died the month before he was scheduled to go on tour. Claudio Lavenia/Getty Images\n\nNew York rapper Pop Smoke was fatally shot during a home invasion at a Hollywood Hills, California, residence February 19, 2020.\n\nSeveral people were detained and released following the rapper’s death. Witnesses told investigators that between two and six people broke into the home, one of them wearing a mask, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Steve Lurie said.\n\nFive people were arrested in connection with the slaying, two of whom were identified as juveniles.\n\nThe 20-year-old was enjoying the success of his sophomore mixtape, “Meet the Woo 2,” the week before his killing. The project debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 album charts.\n\nPop’s “Meet the Woo” tour was scheduled to kick off with a sold-out show in Washington, DC, on March 2, 2020.\n\nHis posthumous album, “Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon,” was released in July 2020.\n\nIn a 2019 New York Times profile, the artist talked about his life before he found fame, describing his teen years as “high-risk, high-reward.”\n\n2020: King Von\n\nRapper King Von was killed outside a hookah lounge in Atlanta, Georgia. Prince Williams/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nChicago rapper King Von was one of two people fatally shot November 6, 2020, during an early morning exchange of gunfire outside an Atlanta hookah lounge, authorities said.\n\nTwo groups of men had been arguing in a parking lot around 3:30 a.m. and shots were fired, authorities said.\n\nFour other people were wounded by gunfire, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which investigated the shooting because police officers also fired their weapons.\n\nTimothy Leeks, 22, was arrested in connection with the rapper’s death. The Atlanta Police Homicide Unit had arrest warrants against Leeks for felony murder. Two other men were also taken into custody in connection to the shooting, according to CNN affiliate WXIA-TV.\n\nA week before his death, Von had released his debut studio album, “Welcome to O’Block.” His posthumous sophomore album, “What It Means to Be King,” was released March 4, 2022, and debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, according to Billboard.\n\n2021: Young Dolph\n\nRapper Young performed during the Astroworld Festival on November 9, 2019 in Houston, Texas. SUZANNE CORDEIRO/AFP via Getty Images\n\nMemphis-based rapper Young Dolph was fatally shot while buying cookies November 17, 2021.\n\nThe 36-year-old rapper was at Makeda’s Homemade Butter Cookies in Memphis when someone drove up and shot him, police said at the time.\n\nThree men were arrested in connection with Dolph’s death. Authorities identified them as Justin Johnson, 23, Shondale Barnett, 27, and Cornelius Smith, 32.\n\nMemphis Police Chief C.J. Davis said additional arrests were possible as the investigation into Young Dolph’s death continues. Citizens’ tips were key in capturing the suspects, she said.\n\nDolph, a Chicago native who grew up in Memphis, released his debut album, “King of Memphis,” in 2016.\n\nHe went on to perform several hits, including “Blue Diamonds” and “RNB” featuring Megan Thee Stallion. His fifth studio album, 2020’s “Rich Slave,” rose to No. 5 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nIn 2017, he was nearly killed in a shooting incident in Hollywood. He spent weeks hospitalized after sustaining three gunshot wounds.\n\nDolph told The Guardian in a 2018 interview that he wasn’t “a person that lives in fear.” He is survived by two children.\n\n2022: PnB Rock\n\nPnB Rock performs during a 2019 festival in Anaheim. Scott Dudelson/Getty Images/File\n\nThe death of rapper PnB Rock in Los Angeles stunned the hip-hop community but brought up familiar conversations that have been taking place for years.\n\nThe rapper was shot September 12 while eating with his girlfriend at Roscoe’s House of Chicken ‘N Waffles in what appears to be a robbery, according to Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore. Notably, Moore said a picture of the pair’s meal had been posted on Instagram, with the location tagged.\n\nIn September, police announced they had charged three people in connection with the killing, including a father and his minor son, who were charged with murder, conspiracy to commit robbery and second-degree robbery, according to the local prosecutor. A woman was charged with being an accessory after the fact.\n\nThe minor appeared in juvenile court Thursday and is set to return for a preliminary hearing on October 19. The woman is expected to be arraigned Thursday afternoon.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/entertainment/pnb-rock-killing-suspects-arrest\n\n“The ppl around these rappers gain so much.
