Kevin McCarthy clinched the election to become the 55th person to serve as speaker of the House after a marathon 15 rounds of voting since Tuesday and a series of concessions that moved power from his new position to a cadre of hard-right lawmakers.\n\nHis election came two years after the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the Capitol – a day when McCarthy, his top deputies and 19 of the 20 holdouts he negotiated with to win all voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOn that day two years ago, McCarthy reportedly called former President Donald Trump, imploring him to call off his supporters who were ransacking the Capitol. Today – and all week – McCarthy was begging for votes from some of Trump’s biggest supporters. That includes Rep. Matt Gaetz, who nominated and voted for Trump as House speaker.\n\nIt has been a grueling week of negotiations. This is the first time the process of electing a speaker took more than one ballot in more than 100 years.\n\nLatest developments:\n\nHe did it: House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy survived one of the longest and most chaotic speaker elections since the Civil War after winning over conservative naysayers within his own party.\n\nHouse Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy survived one of the longest and most chaotic speaker elections since the Civil War after winning over conservative naysayers within his own party. House GOP agenda: After two years of Democratic control in both chambers, allowing for an 18-month congressional investigation into the Capitol attack, the GOP has vowed to fight back on narratives around the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, COVID-19 and Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden.\n\nAfter two years of Democratic control in both chambers, allowing for an 18-month congressional investigation into the Capitol attack, the GOP has vowed to fight back on narratives around the Jan. 6, 2021, attack, COVID-19 and Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden. House honoring January 6 anniversary: Before the House reconvened Friday, Democrats and Republicans remembered the Jan. 6 anniversary in press conferences to honor those impacted by the violent attack two years ago.\n\nStay in the conversation on politics:Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nMembers sworn into office\n\nMcCarthy, in his new role as speaker, administered the oath to all members-elect early Saturday morning.\n\nHe officially swore in the members of the 118th Congress and kicked off the start of legislative business in the lower chamber after a marathon speaker vote since Tuesday.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nMcCarthy takes the gavel: ‘That was easy, huh?’\n\nDemocratic Rep. Hakeem Jeffries handed over the speaker’s gavel to McCarthy after officially welcoming members to the 118th Congress and emphasizing the unanimity of the Democratic Congress.\n\n“That was easy, huh?” McCarthy said as he took the podium following chants of \"U-S-A\" from his caucus. “I never thought we’d get up here.”\n\nMcCarthy touched on spending, inflation, the national debt, jobs and immigration in his first speech as speaker.\n\n“My father always told me, it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish and now we need to finish strong for the American people,” he said.\n\n“It’s night time here in Washington, but in some ways it’s also like a new beginning, a fresh start,” he added.\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is inflation?:Understanding why prices rise, what causes it and who it hurts most.\n\nJeffries hands gavel to McCarthy\n\nBefore House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries passed the gavel to newly elected Speaker Kevin McCarthy, he excoriated Republicans for a weeklong fight to elect their majority leader.\n\nHe said the change from a Democratic-held House to a Republican-led House means a shift from “a year of accomplishment to a year of ambiguity.”\n\nJeffries called McCarthy’s predecessor, Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a “defender of democracy” and a “no-nonsense negotiator” who will go down as the “best speaker of all time.”\n\nHis introduction to McCarthy sounded at times like a campaign speech, and the longer it went on the more Republicans called on him to wrap it up, eventually booing.\n\nJeffries said of Democrats in the new Congress: “We will not compromise our values.”\n\nSome Republicans in the chamber retorted: “Neither will we!”\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nMoney and politics:These House lawmakers received campaign money from Kevin McCarthy, then voted against him\n\nBiden congratulates McCarthy and challenges him to work together\n\nPresident Joe Biden quickly issued a statement congratulating newly elected House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – and just as quickly issued a challenge.\n\n\"The American people expect their leaders to govern in a way that puts their needs above all else, and that is what we need to do now,\" Biden said in a statement released by the White House.\n\nBiden promoted his economic record and said he is prepared to work with Republicans \"when I can.\" He added: \"And voters made clear that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me as well.\"\n\nMcCarthy and the Republicans made Biden the issue during last year's campaign to win control of the House. The new speaker has repeatedly said Biden is leading the nation in the wrong direction.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nThe week that was:Without rules, House speaker debate opens chamber to cameras, video chronicling chaos\n\nHouse speaker ballot 15: McCarthy wins 216 votes\n\nA bruised Kevin McCarthy finally got over the top in the wee hours of Saturday, recording 216 votes and becoming speaker of the House after days of rancor, reversals and deal-making with opponents.\n\nThe win came on a post-midnight 15th ballot that only took place after a group of Republicans defeated a motion to adjourn and convinced enough colleagues to change their votes.\n\nIt turned out that six Republicans who had opposed McCarthy during 14 previous ballots voted \"present\" on this one, lowering the magic number McCarthy needed to claim a majority.\n\nIn addition to McCarthy's total of 216, the House clerk officially reported that Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries again won 212 votes from party colleagues.\n\nThe six Republicans who voted \"present\" were Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, Bob Good and Matt Rosendale. All had been involved in this week's effort to block McCarthy from ascending to the speakership.\n\n– David Jackson and Rachel Looker\n\nWho is the next speaker?:Kevin McCarthy was once rejected for a House internship. Now he could become the next speaker\n\nHouse speaker vote 15: McCarthy appears to have the votes\n\nOn a record 15th ballot, Kevin McCarthy tentatively racked up the votes to become speaker of the House on Friday, picking up sufficient votes from Republicans who signed onto an agreement over rules, committee assignments, and other perks.\n\nThe new McCarthy supporters had voted for other people during the three previous days but went with the Republican leader he made concessions that essentially give more power to the conservative critics who opposed him.\n\nThe tally from ballot 15 must still be confirmed and made official by the House clerk.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMore votes to go:McCarthy House speaker drama signals more fights no matter who holds gavel, lawmakers say\n\nGaetz votes present on 15th ballot\n\nFlorida Republican Matt Gaetz, in many ways the face of the anti-McCarthy movement, voted present which gives the GOP leader a needed edge.\n\nBy the time Gaetz had voted four Republican holdouts were voting present as well.\n\n—Phillip M. Bailey\n\nPhillips nominates Jeffries in 15th vote\n\nRep. Dean Phillips nominated House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries for speaker in the 15th round of voting this week, with the latest round of voting stretching into early Saturday morning.\n\n“I rise to say, ‘Wow,’” Phillips quipped in a nod to the late night.\n\nDemocrats haven’t missed an opportunity to highlight their unity all week, pointing out that Jeffries has received the unanimous 212 votes of his full caucus 13 of the 14 previous votes. Rep. David Trone missed the 12th vote for shoulder surgery Friday morning but had returned in time for the 13th vote Friday afternoon.\n\n“We the people still find ourselves without a constituted government,” Phillips said.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nRound 15: McCarthy backer gives a short nomination speech\n\nRepublican Rep. Bruce Westerman of Arkansas got right to the point as he nominated Kevin McCarthy on a 15th ballot.\n\nHe said the new Congress needs less talk and more action and urged his colleagues to finally put McCarthy over the top.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRepublican chant ‘one more time’\n\nRepublicans began chanting “one more time” on the House floor Friday night after switching votes against adjournment to remain in the chamber for a 15th ballot.\n\nAt one point cheers erupted from the caucus and Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz received hugs and high fives from his colleagues.\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nAdjournment fails; on to ballot 15\n\nAfter a dramatic 14th ballot — which almost got physical on the House floor at one point — failed to hand Kevin McCarthy the speaker's gavel, GOP leadership made a motion to adjourn until Monday.\n\nBut that maneuver was blocked by bipartisan group of lawmakers in a late night vote Friday.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nHouse speaker 14th vote: McCarthy polls 216 votes – needed 217\n\nIt's official: McCarthy came up a single vote shy of becoming speaker of the House, according to the official tally of a notably tense 14th ballot.\n\nMcCarthy recorded 216 votes, but six Republicans would not give him that one last vote.\n\nAs he has throughout the week, Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries had 212 votes from colleagues.\n\nAnother six Republicans voted for Jim Jordan and Andy Biggs, or voted \"present\" – none gave McCarthy the single vote he needed to become speaker.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMcCarthy standoff:A visual guide to a House speaker deadlock not seen for a century\n\nHouse floor gets heated as McCarthy appears in gridlock\n\nIn the vote that could have given the speaker’s gavel to McCarthy, Republican supporters of former President Donald Trump supporters have prevented the California representative from winning the ballot.\n\nAides of McCarthy and Rep. Matt Gaetz, who voted present in the latest round, held animated discussions on the floor.\n\nThe tension of the situation resulted in what appeared to be an altercation on the floor involving Alabama Rep. Mike Rogers, who charged at the group and walked out of the chamber.\n\nThe chaos happens on the two year anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol where the two holdouts-- Gaetz and Boebert-- refuse to vote for McCarthy are strong Trump supporters.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat's to come:McCarthy House speaker drama signals more fights no matter who holds gavel, lawmakers say\n\nMcCarthy in a better position to win\n\nAbout halfway through the historic 14th vote for speaker, the House Republican Leader was in his best position of the week.\n\nOne of his biggest detractors, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, voted present, giving him one fewer vote against him compared to previous rounds.\n\nAnother detractor, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, missed his vote. He could come back at the end of voting to cast a ballot, but if he doesn’t vote it will lower the total of voting members McCarthy needs to clinch the speakership.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nJeffries nominated a 14th time\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries was nominated for a 14th time, and once again the nomination came from House Democratic Chair Pete Aguilar.\n\nDemocrats have touted their unity all week, pointing out that Jeffries has received the unanimous 212 votes of his full caucus 12 of the 13 previous votes. Rep. David Trone missed the 12th vote for shoulder surgery Friday morning but had returned in time for the 13th vote Friday afternoon.\n\nOn Friday night, Aguilar used much of his speech to thank everyone for whom the Capitol is a workplace and called out Republicans for two years ago objecting to the 2020 presidential election and peaceful transfer of power.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nThe Democratic leader:Who is Hakeem Jeffries in Congress? What to know about the Brooklyn Rep. set to replace Pelosi\n\nRep. McHenry nominates McCarthy in 14th ballot\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry nominated McCarthy in the 14th ballot.\n\nMcHenry, who said he served with Kevin in his entirety of tenure in the House, said McCarthy’s leadership style has been lacking in the House for too long and called the California representative “unflinchingly optimistic” and relentless.\n\n“Over these last few days, Kevin McCarthy has allowed this process to work among House Republicans and has empowered members to come together to find consensus on behalf of conservative policy and a greater involvement of all voices throughout the conference,” he said.\n\n“The man does not quit,” McHenry added.\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nWho is the GOP leader?:Kevin McCarthy was once rejected for a House internship. Now he could become the next speaker\n\nThey're off: House begins night session\n\nThe House kicked off a night session Friday with apparent confidence that Kevin McCarthy will finally be elected speaker.\n\nEven the House chaplain expressed optimism that \"at last\" they are on \"the threshold of a new Congress.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWho is House Clerk Cheryl Johnson?\n\nAccording to her official bio, Johnson is the 36th person to serve as clerk and was first sworn in by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2019. She is the first Black woman to preside over the House chamber.\n\nA New Orleans native, Johnson has worked for the House for nearly two decades, serving as chief investigative counsel and spokesperson for the Committee on Education and the Workforce. She was also counsel for the committee with oversight over the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution, where she worked for 10 years liaising with congressional committees with jurisdiction over its funding.\n\nA journalism and mass communication graduate of the University of Iowa, Johnson got her law degree from Howard University and graduated from the senior management program at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nRep. Gaetz: ‘We’ll see how it goes’\n\nFlorida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who previously nominated former President Donald Trump for speaker, told reporters outside the House floor that he is excited about the changes that have been made in negotiations.\n\n“We’re still negotiating on spending, on the rules, and we'll see how it goes tonight,” he said.\n\n-Rachel Looker\n\nGaetz and more:Who are the Republicans balking at Kevin McCarthy as a House speaker?\n\nMcCarthy: ‘We’ll get it done tonight’\n\nMcCarthy told reporters after the 13th ballot that he will have the votes needed tonight to win the speakership.\n\n“We’ll get it done tonight,” he said, later adding, “it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish.”\n\nMcCarthy said the breaking points in the negotiations were getting his dissenters together and finding the ability to work together.\n\n“I think at the end if the day we’re going to be more effective, more efficient,” he said.\n\nHe added because the vote for speaker took this long, “now we’ve learned how to govern.”\n\n-- Rachel Looker\n\nDay 2 of 4 (so far):McCarthy keeps losing, Biden mocks House GOP: 5 takeaways from Day 2 of the new Congress\n\nVote to adjourn underway\n\nAfter a thirteenth round of voting once again failed to produce a new speaker of the House, GOP Rep. Steve Scalise moved to adjourn until 10 p.m. tonight.\n\nDemocrats were vocally opposed, and members are now voting on the motion. If passed, the House would gather back in less than seven hours for the fourteenth vote in four days.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nThe process explained:What happens after McCarthy loses multiple speaker votes? Here's how it works.\n\nSpeaker of the House vote 13: McCarthy still a few votes away\n\nMcCarthy and his allies were unable to win the speakership.\n\nThe 13th ballot again gave McCarthy 214 votes, according to the official House tally, three less than he needed to claim the House Speakers' job.\n\nSix Republicans continued to vote for Jim Jordan, denying the majority to McCarthy.\n\nDemocrat Hakeem Jeffries again recorded 212 votes from minority party colleagues.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMcCarthy standoff:A visual guide to a House speaker deadlock not seen for a century\n\nMcCarthy inches closer, but appears to fall short again\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy is closer to holding the speaker’s gavel, but he still doesn’t have the votes.\n\nMcCarthy appeared to pick up 15 votes in his favor after two rounds of voting—the 13th round overall.\n\nThe Republicans he flipped are Reps. Josh Brecheen, Dan Bishop, Mike Cloud, Andy Clyde, Byron Donalds, Paul Gosar, Andy Harris, Anna Paulina Luna, Mary Miller, Ralph Norman, Andy Ogles, Scott Perry, Chip Roy and Keith Self. And Victoria Spartz switched her vote from present to McCarthy.\n\nHe is still a few votes short because of a small group of conservatives still voting against him: Reps. Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, Eli Crane, Matt Gaetz, Bob Good and Matt Rosendale.\n\n--Candy Woodall\n\nDay one recap:House adjourns without a new speaker as McCarthy loses three rounds of voting\n\nComer nominates McCarthy for round 13\n\nRepublican James Comer stepped up to nominate McCarthy for the 13th ballot, arguing Democrats have failed to hold President Joe Biden accountable.\n\n“In a Republican majority under Speaker Kevin McCarthy the forgotten, working men and women’s voices will finally be heard and represented,” he said.\n\nComer, of Kentucky, will be chairman of the House Oversight Committee in the 118th Congress.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nPopcorn and penalty kicks:McCarthy's push to become House speaker is sparking jokes on Twitter\n\nNew McCarthy backers hint at compromise framework\n\nA group of GOP lawmakers, who were among the McCarthy dissenters who flipped their vote to McCarthy in the 12th ballot, told reporters that the party has agreed to a framework as ongoing conversations continue.\n\n“It is the framework of an agreement in good faith that allows us to keep moving forward,” said Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry.\n\nThe group would not provide specifics, but said the framework involves the motion to vacate, spending and “conservative representation.”\n\n- Rachel Looker and Sarah Elbeshbishi\n\nThe holdouts:Who are the Republicans balking at Kevin McCarthy as a House speaker?\n\nBallot 13: McCarthy now unopposed by any Republican nominee\n\nThis may be the big vote for House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy - critics did not nominate an alternative to run against him, the first time that has happened during this week-long standoff.\n\nMcCarthy fell just a few votes short in the most recent vote, and a new vote is underway.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nIntern to speaker -- maybe:Kevin McCarthy was once rejected for a House internship. Now he could become the next speaker\n\nMcCarthy gets close to being speaker - very close\n\nThe official tally on McCarthy's best ballot: 213 votes, just a few short of what he needs to become speaker of the House.\n\nMcCarthy's specific magic number is uncertain: It could be 217 or 216, depending on how many House members vote; some members are absent or may choose not to vote on a future ballot.\n\nA 13th ballot is expected soon.\n\nRepublicans are now pressuring the seven holdouts who voted for McCarthy alternatives; Jim Jordan received four votes and Kevin Hern took three, and both of them are supporting McCarthy.\n\nDemocratic leader Hakeem Jeffries pulled 211 votes from colleagues – the first time he has not led the balloting this week.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nThe process explained:What happens after McCarthy loses multiple speaker votes? Here's how it works.\n\nWho are the Republican vote McCarthy flipped?\n\nHouse GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had his best showing of the week on Friday, flipping 14 of his 20 detractors in his historic bid for speaker.\n\nThe Republicans he flipped are Reps. Josh Brecheen, Dan Bishop, Mike Cloud, Andy Clyde, Byron Donalds, Paul Gosar, Anna Paulina Luna, Mary Miller, Ralph Norman, Andy Ogles, Scott Perry, Chip Roy and Keith Self. And Victoria Spartz switched her vote from present to McCarthy.\n\nThough McCarthy flipped more than half of his opposition, he still has some hardline conservatives against him: Reps. Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, Eli Crane, Matt Gaetz, Bob Good, Andy Harris and Matt Rosendale.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nKey votes in the House:Who are the Republicans balking at Kevin McCarthy as a House speaker?\n\nMcCarthy momentum: Would-be House Speaker picks up votes, falls just a little short\n\nKevin McCarthy finally picked up some momentum Friday, winning at least 14 new votes on the week's 12th ballot and getting very close to the majority he needs to claim the speaker's job.\n\nWith the official results still being tallied, McCarthy tentatively won at least 214 votes, just short of the House majority he needs to become speaker. That number is a moving target of 217 or 216 because some members are not casting votes.\n\nThe new McCarthy supporters had voted for other people during the three previous days, but went with the Republican leader he made concessions to them over rules and committee assignments.\n\nMcCarthy and allies hope the new numbers will pressure remaining opponents to cave and end this impasse.\n\nAnother vote is likely to happen soon.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nGaetz nominates Jordan, saying 'McCarthy doesn't have the votes'\n\nGaetz nominates Jordan, saying \"McCarthy doesn't have the votes\"\n\nAfter stating that Rep. Kevin McCarthy would still not have enough backing for the role of speaker, Rep. Matt Gaetz nominated Rep. Jim Jordan in the twelfth round of voting.\n\n\"Mr. McCarthy doesn't have the votes today. He will not have the votes tomorrow. And he will not have the votes next week, next month, next year,\" Gaetz said.\n\nIn his address, Gaetz called the Ohio Rep. \"the Lebron James of fundraising.\" Gaetz had previously nominated Jordan on the first day of voting, despite Jordan consistently casting his own vote for McCarthy in each round. Jordan was not nominated again Wednesday or Thursday.\n\n-- Savannah Kuchar\n\nClyburn evokes Jan. 6 when nominating Jeffries\n\nSouth Carolina Democrat James Clyburn was the first lawmaker to remind colleagues about the 2-year anniversary of the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol when rising to nominate colleague Hakeem Jeffries for the speakership.\n\n“Exactly two years ago today our resolve was tested when a violent mob of insurrections attacked our Capitol, threatened the integrity of this democracy and undermined our Constitution,” he said.\n\nEarlier on Friday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers honored those impacted, injured and killed during the riot.\n\nClyburn, a veteran Democratic leader, also bemoaned how the chaos of the week has paralyzed Congress, saying Jeffries is “prepared to lead” and will protect democracy.\n\nThe 212 House Democrats have remained united behind Jeffries, of New York, during the entire saga.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nMcCarthy backer laments “dentistry of last few days”\n\nIn re-nominating McCarthy for the speaker's job, Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Cal., opened Day Four with a vivid and painful metaphor for the process.\n\nThe \"dentistry of last few days” has been painful for everybody, Garcia said ahead of a 12th ballot in the speaker's race.\n\nRepublicans are still trying to drill down to a resolution.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nMost of McCarthy’s detractors received campaign money from him\n\nThirteen of the 20 people who keep voting against Kevin McCarthy for speaker received campaign money this cycle from McCarthy’s political action committee, Majority Committee PAC, according to records from the Federal Election Commission.\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/06/kevin-mccarthy-campaign-money-speaker-race/10996257002/\n\nThey include Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, leader of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, and Byron Donalds of Florida, who at first voted for McCarthy but then switched his vote, and ended up becoming a candidate for speaker himself.\n\nSeven of the 20 received no money from McCarthy’s main fundraising PACs. They include Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Lauren Boebert of Colorado.\n\n— Erin Mansfield\n\nHouse speakership still undecided\n\nAs the first week of the 118th Congress comes to a close, a House speaker has not yet been selected.\n\nThough House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy has consistently won a majority of Republican votes, some 20 conservatives refuse to cast votes in his favor, preferring candidates like Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., or Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla. Without those votes, McCarthy is short of the votes needed to win the powerful position.\n\nDemocrats have remained united around leader Hakeem Jeffries, all 212 voting in his favor in all 10 votes.\n\nThe situation has left Congress stymied, since no member of the House of Representatives can be sworn in and no rules can be adopted until someone is selected for the role.\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nWhat to expect on Day 4\n\nWhen the House gavels in at noon Friday, it will become evident if Thursday negotiations were fruitful for House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy who has lost 11 consecutive votes for speaker.\n\nLawmakers and political analysts in both parties discussed last night the possibility of a deal that could appease 20 rebels in his right flank and whether at least 16 of them would be swayed to McCarthy’s side.\n\nOn the fourth day of a new Congress without a speaker and sworn-in members, all eyes will be on the competing GOP factions of McCarthy and his 200 allies and his 20 detractors led by Reps. Matt Gaetz, Chip Roy, Scott Perry and Andy Biggs.\n\nThe math allows McCarthy to lose four of the 20 in his bid for speaker. But after days of a cumbersome process, any movement to his side would be seen as a huge momentum shift for the caucus leader.\n\nIt’s possible a historic 12th vote could begin at noon, or some members could push for an adjournment until Monday, leaving Congress without a House speaker or sworn-in representatives for the weekend. McCarthy is not in favor of adjourning for the weekend and has said the House shouldn't leave if its work isn't done.\n\n“Progress” has been the magic word all week, with both McCarthy allies and opponents telling reporters an agreement was near.\n\nFriday could prove them right or wrong.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nHouse to honor Jan. 6 anniversary\n\nBefore the House reconvenes Friday, Democrats and Republicans will remember the Jan. 6 anniversary in press conferences to honor those who were killed, injured and impacted by the violent attack two years ago.\n\nAt 9:30 a.m. on the House Triangle, Democratic Reps. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Dean Phillips of Minnesota will mark the anniversary and highlight the recently passed Electoral Count Reform Act they say “will help preserve the integrity of our elections and protect democracy.”\n\nAt 10 a.m. on the House steps, Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries will hold a bipartisan remembrance with Republicans, recognizing two years since the attack.\n\nMany House members serving today were there on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob stormed the Capitol.\n\n-- Candy Woodall", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/10/19/house-speaker-mccarthy-ousted-voters-2024/71057500007/", "title": "'Get their act together': Voters frustrated by House without a speaker", "text": "WASHINGTON − The historic ousting of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy this month has left Americans divided over the unprecedented move − and the Republican Party may pay the price in the 2024 election.\n\nHouse Republicans have struggled to coalesce around one leader since McCarthy's historic 15 rounds of voting to become speaker in January. He made history again two weeks ago as the first speaker ousted from the House. Since then, the House Republican conference hasn't been able to unite around a single candidate and elect a new speaker, with deep divisions roiling between hard-line conservatives and centrists in the party.\n\nWith House lawmakers up for reelection in 2024, McCarthy's removal might factor into their odds of winning again, experts said.\n\n“At the basic level, either one side needs to win this in-party fighting, a compromise must be reached, or the voters will attempt to fix it next year,” Kevin Wagner, a political science professor at Florida Atlantic University, told USA TODAY.\n\nProblems in the House can influence voters at home. Several polls already show that voters are about evenly split over McCarthy's removal as speaker.\n\nA Yahoo News/YouGov poll released Monday found 31% of registered voters approve of McCarthy being ousted, while 27% disapprove of the House's decision.\n\nLikewise, a CNN/SSRS poll Oct. 4 to Oct. 9 found 50% approve the decision and 49% disapprove. Thirty-four percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say his removal was bad for the GOP, while 30% think it was good.\n\nAnd a poll released from The Associated Press-NORC on Oct. 11 found that 25% of voters strongly or somewhat approve of McCarthy's removal, while 25% strongly or somewhat disapprove.\n\nThe polls were conducted before two failed votes for a new House speaker, including a second in which Republican nominee Rep. Jim Jordan, of Ohio, earned less support than in the first election.\n\nTed Davis, 58, a retiree in Portland, Oregon, is one of the voters who disapproves of the House booting its speaker and failing to elect a replacement. He compared the situation to a “giant freaking circus.”\n\n“They can't even figure out what they want to do as near as I can tell,” said Davis, an independent. \"I'm like you're not leading, you're just running around like kids on a playground. So I've lost a lot of respect for the Republican Party these last couple of years.”\n\nRepublican presidential candidates have also spoken out against the move. In a USA TODAY town hall last week in New Hampshire, former Vice President Mike Pence said, “I have some tough words for what I call the 'chaos caucus' in my party on Capitol Hill.”\n\n“It never would have occurred to me to partner with every Democrat on Capitol Hill to oust a Republican speaker of the House,” he said, adding that if lawmakers fail to elect a speaker, voters will hold them \"accountable, individually and collectively.\"\n\nWhat happened to Kevin McCarthy?\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had a rocky start to his reign as speaker. He went through 15 rounds of voting to get elected and had to make concessions with hard-line conservatives who opposed him.\n\nBut once elected, his detractors' frustrations only grew, particularly during debt ceiling negotiations between McCarthy and President Joe Biden\n\nThe boiling point of his speakership hit late last month when McCarthy worked with Democrats to pass a stopgap measure, also known as a continuing resolution, to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who criticized McCarthy for the measure, introduced a motion to vacate and remove McCarthy as speaker.\n\nEight Republicans and 208 Democrats voted to oust him. The eight were Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, Gaetz of Florida, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Rep. Matt Rosendale of Montana.\n\n'Get their act together': Voters express frustration, anxiety over House speaker chaos\n\nAt this point, Davis said, he just wants lawmakers to elect somebody in the speaker position and get the job of representing their constituents done.\n\n“They need to get their act together. I mean, at this point, they've got the raw voting power. Why not just pick anybody at this point? They don't have to be popular. Just need to put somebody up there who can say, 'Hey, this is what we're voting on next.' And just get through it all. I don't care if they choose Jeffries from the Democrats or anybody else for that matter.”\n\nFor Kate Richards, 59, a semi-retired entrepreneur in Manchester, New Hampshire, Congress entering its third week without a speaker makes her feel angry.\n\n“It’s dangerous for the country,” said Richards, an independent. “That is a very important job. He's third in line. Nothing's getting done. And again, this is foolishness, and it's making the country at risk whether they understand that or not. It’s a very vulnerable time for us.”\n\nLeo Braham, 18, who attends Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, said it's disheartening to see the chaos unfolding in the House. He doesn’t care who the speaker is and said he just wants to see the GOP unified.\n\n“I think what we're seeing in the House is a much deeper and more worrisome reflection of the fractures in the party. And I think as a Republican voter, I want to see much less of that because I care about particular issues actually being acted upon,” he said. “I think it's a lot harder to show unity. … I think it's not positive that there's that kind of open rebellion within the caucus.”\n\nAlana Sweeny, 74, a retiree in Mahopac, New York, said she felt McCarthy’s removal was a reaction by a very small group that wanted to control the House and put a more conservative mark on House matters.\n\n“I think it's extremely unfortunate. We have a lot of important things that need to be taken care of by Congress and right now, we're paralyzed. … It makes me frustrated,” said Sweeny, a Republican. “We have people there who are to do the business of the populace. And at the moment, they're not able to do it until they get a speaker. … It's a shame that it's such a small group that's doing that and it's a shame that none of the Democrats will just vote present and get it over with.”\n\nSweeny said she liked how the former speaker was able to work on both sides, understand issues and work with a broad spectrum of people.\n\nRafael Struve, 31, a communications director for the Texas Young Republican Federation based in Houston, called the decision to remove McCarthy “premature.”\n\n“Especially as we head into the 2024 cycle − if we want to show that we're a party that is going to deliver a better or better policy platform than the Democratic Party, we need to show that we can actually get Step 1 taken care of, which is uniting behind whoever is elected ... to drive forward what we believe is the agenda that best serve the interests of our country and for us as voters,\" he said.\n\n'He did not keep his word': Other voters say lawmakers made the right move\n\nRobert Charlebois, 56, a truck driver in Danbury, New Hampshire, said McCarthy’s removal was justified.\n\n“He was given the speakership with the understanding that there were certain goals he was going to pursue, and he didn't do that, and part of the reason he was given the speakership was because he wasn't going to bend to the Democrats to achieve other goals, and yet he did. So what it boils down to the way I'm looking at it, I tried to look at it from all possible angles, is he did not keep his word,” said Charlebois, a Republican.\n\n“And so therefore, if you've got someone who promises you the moon and delivers you a marble, then are you going to keep them employed?”\n\nJared Johnson, 43, a mining industry worker and Republican voter in Tooele, Utah, also said McCarthy didn’t keep his word as speaker.\n\n“I think we've got to get more Republicans on board to … be more conservative,” he said, applauding Jordan for leading the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.\n\nKevin Fry, 63, a retired air traffic controller in Fort Wayne, Indiana, criticized McCarthy for not getting the appropriation bills finished or scheduling votes on term limits for lawmakers.\n\n“Some things are out of his (McCarthy's) control. But ... one person should not have as much power as they physically do and then not use it,\" said Fry, a Republican.\n\nHouse representatives on a tipping point with the 2024 election\n\nRepublicans already struggle to hold on to the majority after winning back control of the House from the Democrats in the 2020 midterms with a narrow margin.\n\nThe infighting between Republican lawmakers over the shutdown fight and now the speaker battle have only added pressure to the GOP. In the Yahoo News/YouGov poll, 42% of voters blame conservative and moderate Republicans for the gridlock in Congress, while 32% of voters blame progressive and moderate Democrats.\n\nMcCarthy’s removal is a reflection of the political problems the Republican Party faces as it “navigates between trying to be a center-right party who can appeal to moderate voters and a party dominated by the hard-right side of the party,” said Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThe speaker of the House can become a campaign issue, he added. For instance, former Democratic House Speaker Tip O’Neill “was a major punching bag of Republicans back in the 1980 election, for instance, and that tactic was considered successful.”\n\n“I can see Democrats having a field day going after House Republicans and perhaps a new speaker, especially if he or she is seen as being extreme,” Stewart said. “This is not good for Republicans, although they still have time to stanch the wounds.”\n\nBut Wagner said each district Republicans are competing in is different, so the speaker race might not have a huge effect.\n\n“In some districts, there will be a well-funded incumbent, others may be open, making them very different even if they are both purple,” Wagner said. “ If the GOP lags in fundraising, messaging or candidate recruitment, it could help Democratic candidates, but it really depends largely on the district.”\n\nOn a national level, Wagner said, an effective presidential campaign at the top of the ticket may well hide some of the problems among House Republicans in Congress.\n\n“However, if the perception of disarray from the House were to paint the entire party, even the presidential candidate may suffer some vote loss from voters who are frustrated with the entire party.”\n\n'Get it together': 2024 candidates discuss McCarthy's removal\n\nSome 2024 Republican candidates on the campaign trail have called out the divisions between GOP lawmakers in Congress.\n\nPence said in an interview with USA TODAY that he was concerned about how the chaos on Capitol Hill was affecting America and called on Republican leadership to elect a new speaker.\n\n“We have war now raging in Eastern Europe, war in Israel,” Pence said. “Now more than ever, we need Republicans to come together and elect leadership that can begin to not only provide our allies with the support they need, but secure our border, get our economy moving again.\"\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in an interview with USA TODAY that if lawmakers elect a speaker soon and “show unity in that selection process,” then it's a bump in the road that will not have any influence on next year's election.\n\n“If we struggle with getting the ballots to select a speaker, then it demonstrates that we're not ready to govern,” Hutchinson said. “So that would be worrisome.\"\n\nAs she filed for candidacy to participate in the New Hampshire Republican primary, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley suggested lawmakers shouldn't get paid until they elect a speaker.\n\n“What I will remind my fellow Republicans is, you don't fix Democrat chaos with Republican chaos. Get it together.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/02/house-speaker-vote-explained/10912271002/", "title": "How the House picks a speaker: What happens after McCarthy loses?", "text": "The first day of the 118th Congress ended Tuesday without a new House speaker. Voting resumed Wednesday – and still no speaker.\n\nHouse Republican leader Kevin McCarthy failed to secure enough votes to become speaker of the House on six ballotsover both days, heightening tumult around the new GOP majority. For the first time in a century, the House was unable to pick a speaker on the first vote.\n\nThe speaker is the most powerful role in Congress, in line behind the vice president to succeed the president should the commander in chief be incapacitated. But the more immediate and prominent authority the speaker wields is controlling the agenda and committee assignments that shape legislation in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nWhen Republicans took the majority in November's midterm elections, McCarthy became the top contender for the speakership after GOP lawmakers elected to keep him last month as head of the caucus. But a faction of the party balked at giving him the support he would need to secure the position.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., challenged McCarthy for the powerful leadership role and earned 10 votes on the first ballot Tuesday. By Wednesday, Biggs appeared to be out of the running for the gavel as did Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who received 20 votes on the third ballot. Florida GOP Rep. Byron Donalds became the McCarthy alternative, earning 20 votes on the fourth, fifth and sixth ballots.\n\nIn contrast, every one of the 212 elected Democrats voted for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, leader of the House Democrats, in all six rounds.\n\nMcCarthy allies — who outnumber the “never Kevin” bloc — have said they aren’t budging in supporting “only Kevin.”\n\nStay in the conversation on politics: Sign up for the OnPolitics newsletter\n\nMore:Kevin McCarthy’s race for speaker risks upending the House of Representatives\n\nThe speaker of the House is the only political position in the House elected by all its members. Here's how the election works and what could happen if McCarthy does not reach the vote threshold needed for the speakership.\n\nHow does the speaker vote process begin?\n\nPrior the start of a new Congress, both parties hold a private meeting where they elect the party leadership for the next Congress. This takes place before Jan. 3, the official start of the new term when all House members vote for the speaker.\n\nA candidate only needs a majority of votes from their respective party to win the endorsement in the private meeting for leadership.\n\nEven if a colleague votes against a candidate in the private caucus meeting, the party typically sticks together to back their nominee on the House floor in January, according to Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Government Affairs Institute.\n\nMore:A poor GOP showing in the midterms could hamper Kevin McCarthy's path to be House speaker\n\nHowever, when the whole House votes, anyone can be nominated. And just a few votes in opposition to a candidate from their own party could cost them the speakership if the majority is narrow as is the case with the Republicans: as few as five GOP House members could block the party leader from winning the gavel.\n\n\"Which creates a scenario where people could dissent, a very small faction could stop you from winning on the floor in your own party,\" Glassman said.\n\nHow is the speaker vote held?\n\nThe clerk of the House from the prior Congress gavels in the opening session and presides as speaker until one is elected.\n\nThe clerk first calls for a quorum to establish that enough members are present to conduct business and then proceeds immediately to the speaker election – before the swearing in of newly elected members.\n\nThe clerk calls lawmakers in alphabetical order by last name who then announce their choice for speaker by calling out the last name of the candidate. This differs from the usual electronic voting conducted in the House on legislation.\n\nCandidates for speaker are nominated from the floor by members of their parties. There is always one Democratic nominee and one Republican, but the speaker does not have to be a member of the majority party or even a member of Congress.\n\nHow many votes are needed to be chosen as Speaker?\n\nThe magic number is 218 – kind of.\n\nA candidate requires votes from a majority of lawmakers who are voting to be elected speaker. That means if all 435 members are present and voting, the number of votes needed is 218.\n\nBut lawmakers can decide to skip the vote, or vote \"present,\" which reduces the vote threshold needed to win the speakership. Speakers Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and John Boehner, R-Ohio, both won the speakership without reaching 218 votes.\n\nMore:Kevin McCarthy wants to block three Democrats from committees if he becomes House speaker\n\nIn the new Congress, all 434 members (one fewer than 435 because Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin recently died and a successor has yet to be chosen) can vote. If the results, for example, are: 216 votes for McCarthy, 212 for a Democratic candidate and 6 representatives vote for someone else, the 216 votes would not be the majority of 434 needed for the speakership. McCarthy would come up short.\n\nHowever, if those six representatives do not vote for someone else, they don't count toward the total votes needed. This lowers the threshold to 428, meaning a 216 vote could secure the speakership for McCarthy.\n\nGlassman said this is often used as a tactic by speaker candidates who convince their colleagues to, in essence, abstain as a compromise between voting for another candidate and supporting their candidacy.\n\n\"That's certainly a viable strategy,\" he said.\n\nWhat happens if a candidate doesn't get the majority of votes?\n\nIf the first ballot fails to provide a speaker, lawmakers will continue to vote until a candidate receives a majority. Members can vote for different candidates each ballot.\n\nIt's not common that there is more than one ballot, but it has happened.\n\nIn 1923, it took multiple ballots – nine – to elect a speaker. On three occasions prior to the Civil War, a speaker was not elected on the first ballot. In one instance, it took 133 ballots over a period of two months.\n\nAs a last resort, lawmakers can adopt a resolution that would elect a speaker by a plurality or by rank-choice voting instead of a simple majority.\n\nGlassman said McCarthy needs at least 213 votes because the 212 House Democrats are likely going to all back their party leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Of the remaining nine GOP lawmakers who have expressed reservations about supporting McCarthy, the California Republican will need some combination of votes for him, \"present\" vote or no votes.\n\n\"The important thing functionally is nothing else happens in the House until they have a speaker,\" Glassman said, adding that the House won't be able to adopt rules, assign committees or consider legislation until the speaker is chosen.\n\nHow do members typically vote?\n\nLawmakers traditionally vote for their party's nominee, but some in recent years have chosen to vote \"present\" or not vote.\n\n\"This is sort of a modern thing in the last 10 years,\" Glassman said. \"We've had members of the majority party threatening not to vote for their party's nominee on the floor.\"\n\nHe cites one reason as the current media environment where outliers realize they can gain attention from opposing a speaker nominee and separate themselves from the leadership to appeal to voters.\n\nMore:Nancy Pelosi's legacy: 'A troublemaker with a gavel' leaves her mark, from health care to impeachment\n\n\"It's a way to stand out,\" he said.\n\nThe last to vote for the opposite political party was Democratic Rep. Jim Traficant from Ohio. He voted in 2001 for the Republican speaker nominee and faced severe consequences: Democrats stripped him of his committee assignments.\n\nHow will this play out for McCarthy?\n\nA two-month speakership election is not likely.\n\nMcCarthy won the closed-door vote leadership election, and by wide margins, after facing challenger Biggs, the Republican of Arizona and a member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe votes on Tuesday and Wednesday, which included all members of the House and not just the Republican party, have yet to put McCarthy – or anyone else – over the vote threshold to win the speakership.\n\nThe speaker vote could play out in a few ways.\n\nMembers will continue to vote for days, weeks or months until a speaker candidate receives enough votes, which means no other legislative business will be conducted and members will not be officially sworn in.\n\nOne option for McCarthy is to continue to try to bargain with his colleagues to gain enough votes, though that hasn't worked so far. He could also drop out of the race for speaker, leaving an opening for another Republican to win the gavel.\n\nDespite the repeated ballots, no McCarthy challengers have come close to gaining the majority of votes for the gavel.\n\n\"If none of those things happen, then you're in for a real chaos situation because then you have to try to find candidates somewhere in the party who weren't even on the radar screen,\" Glassman said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/10/gop-fighting-speaker-mccarthy-trump-conservative-right-tea-party/10984876002/", "title": "How the GOP got here: The rise of ultra conservatives from Barry ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Republican congressional leaders have always had trouble with their most conservative members – but not like this.\n\nWhile Kevin McCarthy did finally rack up enough votes to become speaker of the House, the deals he made – and the narrow margin of the GOP majority – may wind up giving the hardcore conservative movement the most power it has ever had, a movement that has lasted for decades.\n\n\"This takes it to a whole new level,\" said Jack Pitney, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College and a former Republican who has studied conservative politics for decades.\n\nHow did the Republicans get here? Because ever-shifting groups of conservative activists have fought ever-evolving Republican establishments for more than a half-century, from Barry Goldwater to Ronald Reagan to Newt Gingrich to the Tea Party to Donald Trump to, now, the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nA sign of things to come:McCarthy House speaker drama signals more interparty fights for GOP, lawmakers say\n\nMcCarthy prevails - for now:Recap: In dramatic 15th ballot, Republican Kevin McCarthy clinches House speaker vote; members sworn in\n\nThe battle over McCarthy and the speaker's job angered many traditional Republicans who see this latest crop of ultra-conservatives as more interested in confrontation and television appearances than in governing or making policy.\n\nSome said the power grabs by anti-McCarthy conservatives will lead to more chaos, government shutdowns, a breach of the debt ceiling that will crash financial markets, and GOP campaign losses.\n\n\"For the past six years, Donald Trump has shown that you do not have to have principles to be the leader of the party,” said Republican strategist Susan Del Percio. \"These 20 are doing this because they can. They do not care about governing, just destroying.”\n\nThe insurgents say that over the years Republican leaders have bowed to the \"status quo\" and failed to follow through on promises to cut spending and downsize government. The national debt, they often point out, has ballooned over the past decades no matter which party was in charge – though they do not mention that their plans have often been foiled by Democratic senators and presidents.\n\nDuring their efforts to block McCarthy, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., said that \"for far too long, conservatives left their leverage on the table and let the establishment ignore us and sideline us.\"\n\nThere's also a more prosaic reason that archconservatives such as Boebert and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., can wield power these angry days: There are about 20 of them, and the Republican Party has only a nine-seat majority in the House – meaning as few as five Republicans can scuttle legislation by switching their votes.\n\n\"When you don't have a big margin,\" Pitney said, \"the people at the margins have a lot of leverage.\"\n\nCulture wars:House Republicans attack Defense Department for 'woke' social policies\n\n'It began with us'\n\nBack in the 1930s, humorist Will Rogers made a famous joke about a certain political party: \"I am not a member of any organized party. I'm a Democrat.\"\n\nCharlie Gerow, a Republican strategist and vice chair of the Conservative Political Action Coalition, said he thought about Rogers' joke while watching Republican infighting this week.\n\n“But I guess now you’d say, ‘I don’t belong to any political party. I’m a Republican,’” he said.\n\nThe Tea Party and Trump:A foreseeable fire: A steady diet of red meat turned the Tea Party into Trumpism\n\nThe new faction:What is the House Freedom Caucus and why is Trump attacking its members?\n\nWhen did it start to change? Different people cite different eras.\n\nFormer Illinois GOP Rep. Joe Walsh traced it to the rise of the Tea Party that fueled his election to the House in 2010, the year the Republicans won Congress by running against President Barack Obama and his health care plan. Tea Party members who took office intensified their attacks on Obama, the Democrats, and, in some cases, Republican leaders.\n\n“No doubt, it began with us,\" Walsh said. \"You can draw a direct line.\"\n\nWalsh served one term, losing in 2012 to then-Democratic candidate and current U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth. In 2020, he switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent, saying his former party “became a cult.”\n\nNever conservative enough\n\nThe Tea Party and its successor also evolved from movements that have marked Republican politics since they formed in the years before the Civil War.\n\nThey have differences among themselves, but they share a pattern: Whenever a leader ascends to the top, a new faction develops to argue that the party is drifting from the cause and placating the \"establishment.\" It seems these establishments haven't been conservative enough.\n\nIt happens in all parties, but recent Republicans have been especially noisy.\n\n\"You're always going to have some folks far out there who don't think the leadership – the establishment – is liberal or conservative enough,\" said Matthew Green, a professor of politics at Catholic University who has written about political factions.\n\nThe first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, faced the wrath of \"Radical Republicans\" over the conduct of the Civil War and the pace of slave emancipation.\n\nIn the pivotal election of 1912, former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, more progressive than party stalwarts, ran against more conservative successor William Howard Taft. Roosevelt wound up leading a third party that split the GOP vote and helped elect Democrat Woodrow Wilson (and made the GOP a more conservative institution as a result).\n\nBiggest takeaways:Kevin McCarthy elected 55th House speaker, quashes GOP rebellion with major concessions\n\nFrom Goldwater to Gingrich\n\nThe current group of hard-liners can also trace its lineage to a defeated presidential candidate from nearly 60 years ago: Barry Goldwater.\n\nIn 1964, Goldwater mounted an insurgent campaign against the \"Eastern Establishment\" and managed to capture the nomination at a fractious convention. The Arizona standard-bearer lost in a landslide to President Lyndon Johnson – a year after John F. Kennedy's assassination – but he inspired a number of conservative followers into politics.\n\nOne of them, Ronald Reagan, became governor of California and, in 1976, challenged incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford for the Republican nomination. Reagan lost, narrowly, but came back four years later to win the presidency, a milestone for the conservative movement.\n\nDuring his presidency, Reagan also took some flak from his far right – \"let Reagan be Reagan!\" went the mantra – but other conservatives during the 1980s took aim at a different target: the U.S. House, which Democrats had controlled for decades.\n\nOne of their leaders was a backbencher named Newt Gingrich, who argued – like conservatives before and since – that Republican leaders gave in too much to the Democratic majority. Launching a steady volley of verbal attacks on Democrats and some moderate Republicans, Gingrich climbed the ladder of Republican leadership.\n\nThe Georgia Republican also led the party in the historic 1994 election, when Republicans won control of both the House and the Senate. In the years that followed, they repeatedly clashed with Democratic President Bill Clinton, shutting down the government on occasion amid fights over government spending.\n\nGingrich also eventually faced a revolt from conservatives, though those disputes had more to do with power-sharing than ideology. Still, after a disappointing election in 1998 – not unlike the reversals suffered by Republicans in November – Gingrich resigned from the speakership and from Congress itself.\n\nGingrich has denounced McCarthy's critics as selfish, noting that more than 90% of the House Republican Conference voted for McCarthy in repeated ballots. \"I mean, any five people can get up and say, ‘I’m going to screw up the conference, too',\" he told Fox News.\n\nFrom the Tea Party to Freedom Caucus\n\nLittle more than a decade after Gingrich's departure came the Tea Party, named for the American colonialists who dumped British tea into Boston Harbor in 1773.\n\nAfter the Republicans claimed Congress in 2010, Tea Party members bedeviled GOP House Speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan. Both left their posts with harsh comments about the Republican right wing.\n\nWhen reached by phone, Boehner declined to comment on those tumultuous years that ultimately led to his resignation in 2015. “Sorry,” he said, \"I’ll just get myself in trouble.”\n\nIn his 2021 memoir, Boehner said liberals and conservatives have their share of \"legislative terrorists,\" but the Republican \"chaos caucus\" devolved into \"a predictable pattern.\"\n\n\"The far-right knuckleheads would refuse to back the House leadership no matter what, but because they were 'insurgents' they never had the responsibility of trying to actually fix things themselves,\" Boehner wrote.\n\nInstead, they got to \"continue to complain loudly about how Washington’s spending problem never got solved,\" he added, and \"they got another invitation to go on Fox News or talk radio, or they got another check from their friends in outside groups.\"\n\nNow these conservatives, who in 2015 formed what they called the House Freedom Caucus, are contending with McCarthy.\n\nWalsh, the former congressman, said this crop of conservatives is different because they would rather fight than govern. He said the Tea Party’s biggest gripes with Boehner involved issues, particularly federal spending.\n\nThe McCarthy rebellion “doesn’t appear at all to be about policy,” Walsh said. “They don’t seem to have an agenda. They just want to burn (stuff) down.”\n\nDonald Trump and MAGA\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus members followed the lead of Trump after he won the presidency. That included Trump's frequent criticism of the Republican establishment, particularly Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nThe results included more government shutdowns and confrontations over the debt ceiling. A Freedom Caucus chairman, Rep. Mark Meadows, wound up as Trump's White House chief of staff.\n\nUltra-conservative House Republicans vociferously defended Trump during his two impeachments, including the one that followed the insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThey continued to embrace Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" movement throughout the 2024 elections, which generally went badly for the Republicans but produced a silver political lining for its very conservative wing.\n\nThe Republicans did win the House, but by a far smaller margin than they had hoped – 222-213. That narrow margin gives the hard right more power – and McCarthy found out during the speaker election circus that may haunt his term.\n\nMcCarthy's concessions\n\nThe 20 members who consistently voted against McCarthy make up a little less than 10% of the caucus, but they picked up more power through opposing the aspiring speakers.\n\nSeeking the last several votes needed to prevail, McCarthy agreed to rule changes and committee assignments that, essentially, will make it easier for conservatives to push their agenda and thwart the establishment.\n\nRebel fundraising:These House lawmakers received campaign money from Kevin McCarthy, then voted against him\n\nConservative infighting:'High school drama'? MAGA lawmakers Greene and Boebert spar over Kevin McCarthy's speaker bid\n\nGaetz, a McCarthy enemy who at one point nominated Trump for speaker, made the attempted power grab explicit during an interview on Fox News.\n\n\"If my colleagues get what they want from McCarthy, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus will actually be more important than the speaker of the House in determining the legislation that reaches the floor, how amendments are processed and how spending occurs going forward,\" Gaetz told Fox host Laura Ingraham.\n\nIn short: The Republican battle over McCarthy's speaker position is a sign of things to come, said Green, author of \"Legislative Hardball: The House Freedom Caucus and the Power of Threat-Making in Congress.\"\n\n\"It doesn't bode well for the Republican majority,\" Green said. \"These folks aren't going away.\"\n\n‘Normal vs. crazy’\n\nBobbie Kilberg, an influential donor and former political strategist for presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, fears today's infighting between Republican leadership and its unflinching conservative flank could lead to one-party rule – and not in the favor of her GOP.\n\n“If we can’t right the ship this year, by 2024 Democrats will win up and down the ballot,” she said.\n\nThe majority of American voters are sensible and centrist, she said, and they want center-right problem-solvers who will work across the aisle, Kilberg said.\n\nA majority of Republicans and Democrats think their respective parties are too extreme, according to a USA TODAY poll in December, and some respondents called for more bipartisanship.\n\nThe several rounds of voting that failed to produce a House speaker until the 15th try probably will turn off voters, Kilberg.\n\n“We’re just giving them normal versus crazy,” she said.\n\nThe establishment may have a silver lining of its own, some Republicans said: More infighting eventually could give the party an opportunity to remake itself down the line.\n\nSaid Kilberg: \"You almost need to crash and burn and start again.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2021/12/04/nft-apple-metaverse-2022-predictions/8803081002/", "title": "From NFTs to Apple and the metaverse: What 2022 holds for the tech", "text": "Peter Csathy\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJust when we thought it was safe to get back into the real world, new COVID variants emerge to brush us back – continuing to transform all aspects of our lives. While nothing is more powerful than real physical human connection, the digital virtual tech-driven world was the big story for media and entertainment in 2021.\n\nIn particular, 2021 marked the coming out party for the blockchain – a kind of transformational decentralized Web 3.0 world. In the world of media, the headline blockchain story took its form in so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Will the blockchain’s adoption in media accelerate in 2022?\n\nMy Magic 8-Ball says “Signs point to ‘YES’.”\n\n►What's an NFT:A guide to what they are and why someone spent $69 million for one\n\nHere are 10 predictions for the coming year in which we hope that we finally get COVID under some kind of real long-term control.\n\n1. Blockchain blows up in 2022\n\nAfter early experimentation in 2021, 2022 will mark the year creators truly begin to embrace and leverage the power of the blockchain at scale. Just like iPhones ushered in a whole new mobile-first world of content 15 years ago, so-called Web 3.0 ushers in a whole new transformational world for originators of intellectual property, or IP, to directly reach and monetize their audiences. In the process, creators take back at least some of the power of mega tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Apple that built their trillion-dollar-plus valuations on their backs.\n\n2. NFTs a new venue for fans\n\nAnd 2022 will mark the year superfans will use their collective decentralized power to fuel creativity from their favorite artists via blockchain-related opportunities. Most in the entertainment world still focus on Beeple’s $69-million digital art NFT as being the blockchain’s poster child.\n\nBut instead they should be thinking of NFTs as new direct and directly monetizing channels of super-fandom – opening up membership into exclusive new clubs. If few in the world of media now know of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and DAOs in general (decentralized autonomous organizations), that changes in 2022. The blockchain, NFTs and DAOs are no momentary fads. They are long-term game-changers. Like it or not, the Los Angeles-based Staples Center’s new “Crypto.com Arena” moniker is here to stay.

Big action to come against Big Tech\n\nThe new mega-media platforms of Facebook (or Meta, actually), Google, Apple, and Amazon face a more immediate threat than the blockchain and related new decentralized social platforms in 2022, as big government finally takes big action against big tech in advance of 2022’s mid-term elections. Facebook and Zuckerberg are first to feel the pinch, as the Feds force Facebook to shed Instagram (and perhaps set some real rules to limit unbridled ad and AI-driven algorithmic devastation, both on young people and society itself). These “unlockings” of tech conglomerates will unlock more content innovation across more competing tech platforms.\n\n►The Facebook Papers:Facebook fed posts with violence and nudity to people with low digital literacy\n\n4. Apple leads the way to the metaverse\n\nFaced with these threats, Facebook tries to run and hide with its new Meta moniker (the quintessential “lipstick on a pig”), but real metaverse innovation comes from others, including Apple. Yes, Apple’s AR glasses ultimately will drive some of that innovation. But Apple already sports the ultimate wearable – AirPods (now a $20-billion business by itself). AirPods will become the first major gateway into the metaverse – outside of the games industry – much like Apple drove mass consumer adoption in the mobile world with the iPhone. Expect micro-cameras to be incorporated into higher-end, extremely expensive versions of AirPods that will enable visual experiences. I can see you lining up at your local Apple store already.\n\n►What is the metaverse anyway? Everyone wants to own the metaverse including Facebook and Microsoft\n\n5. Games + crossovers = metaverse magic\n\nSpeaking of games, that industry will continue to lead all other categories of entertainment content by an order of magnitude and increasingly show the way for artists and creators to emerge and build audiences. Before the tragedy of Astroworld, Travis Scott broke out into the metaverse in 2020 via \"Fortnite\" to the tune of 50 million viewers who drove a No. 1 hit. Ariana Grande shattered those numbers this past year, and the marriage of games and music grows stronger in 2022 as music licensing for games becomes a massive new revenue stream.\n\n►From Facebook to Fortnite:The metaverse is calling. Are we ready?\n\n6. Get paid to play\n\nMedia and tech business models will continue to fundamentally evolve, particularly in light of the havoc wreaked by ad-driven business models from the two major culprits of Facebook and Google. We’ve already seen the shift from single transactions to subscription-based recurring revenue bundles (Amazon Prime, Apple One, Disney+). That will accelerate in 2022. And move over “free to play” business models in the world of games. Now, thanks to the blockchain, welcome to an entirely new “play to earn” model that literally pays players to play (and gives them fractional ownership in the games they play). Why work when you can play? Other parts of the entertainment industry will continue to look to the world of games for inspiration and innovation, because that’s where it’s happening.\n\n7. In battle for screen dominance, Disney beats Netflix\n\nDisney+ will grow more rapidly than Netflix – and begin to close the gap in terms of global paid members – as the Mouse House begins to unlock significantly more dollars to produce originals. And don’t forget Disney’s “special sauce” that Netflix can’t touch – Disney’s priceless crown jewels of content – i.e., the Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avengers, and Disney Princess franchises. Just imagine the NFTs Disney can (and will) create with those timeless characters (which, in turn, will drive more Disney+ subscriptions/memberships). Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple will also quietly raise their own originals ante as they too accelerate their media ambitions – but for decidedly different ends. Amazon and Apple use content as marketing and to drive customer loyalty – to draw us in and create an ongoing customer relationship so we spend more time (and cash) in their walled gardens. And in the thirst for new content, expect more media production company acquisitions in 2022. The big buy in 2021 was Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine. Indie idol A24 will be the big prize for 2022.\n\n8. Musicians to harness the power of NFTs\n\nMusic will continue its double-digit growth – fueled by accelerating streaming via broader global broadband connectivity, entirely new royalty-paying platforms (Facebook, TikTok, Peloton), the growing ubiquity of smart speakers and, yes, transformational blockchain-fueled opportunities like NFTs. Perhaps most notably – and most notably absent in the minds of most executives still today – superfans will directly drive significantly more dollars into the pockets of their favorite artists. Billions have been left on the table in the past. Not any longer.\n\n►Making music and history:In her return, singer Shontelle deploys NFTs in song of empowerment\n\n9.You could help finance the next big Hollywood entertainment project\n\nExpect the retail market – that's you and me, the superfans – to directly finance and even buy fractional pieces of content from our favorite artists. In a world of content increasingly being “king,” private equity has pumped billions of dollars into the world of music acquisitions for the likes of Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan. But that kind of content ownership will not be just for the “big boys” in 2022. NFTs will help fuel the way. And superfan-fueled crowd-funding and IP ownership aren’t just for the world of music. The retail market will open up an entirely new world of financing for producers of film and television. Hey, Hollywood, check out “The Chosen.” If you don’t know about it, you should.\n\n10. Live entertainment is back, but forever changed\n\nMusic festivals and other mega-live entertainment experiences will continue to open up in 2022 due to pent up demand for real, physical interaction and lasting shared experiences in our increasingly heads-down digital, virtual world. But these large-scale live events are forever changed as a result of the twin tragedies of COVID and Astroworld. Crowd control, mitigation and broader safety and security efforts and focus will transform overall planning and execution – not to mention the overall “festival experience” for those who attend.\n\nThere you have it – 10 predictions for our increasingly tech-driven world of media and entertainment in 2022.\n\nPeter Csathy is the chairman of CREATV Media & Deep Cuts Media, a media, entertainment & tech-focused business development, M&A and advisory firm.

Crimo III, 21, is convicted, the charges could lead to a mandatory life sentence, Rinehart said. More charges are expected to come, Rinehart said, including attempted murder, aggravated discharge and aggravated battery charges.\n\n“These are just the first of many charges that will be filed against Mr. Crimo, I want to emphasize that,” Rinehart said, adding he anticipates “dozens of more charges centering around each of the victims.”\n\nCrimo has been in police custody since being apprehended Monday evening.\n\n“Tomorrow morning at the Lake County courthouse, we will ask a judge to hold Mr. Crimo without the possibility of bail,” Rinehart said.\n\nAttorney Thomas Durkin confirmed to CNN his representation of Crimo.\n\nAttorney Steve Greenberg has been retained to represent Crimo’s parents, Greenberg confirmed to CNN Tuesday evening in an email. The attorney released a statement on Twitter on behalf of the suspect’s parents.\n\n“We are all mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, and this is a terrible tragedy for many families, the victims, the paradegoers, the community, and our own. Our hearts, thoughts, and prayers go out to everybody,” the statement read.\n\nPolice earlier Tuesday identified six of the seven victims killed in the shooting.\n\nJennifer Banek, Lake County Coroner, read the list of names during the news conference. The victims are as follows:\n\n64-year-old Katherine Goldstein of Highland Park\n\n35-year-old Irina McCarthy of Highland Park\n\n37-year-old Kevin McCarthy of Highland Park\n\n63-year-old Jacquelyn Sundheim of Highland Park\n\n88-year-old Stephen Straus of Highland Park\n\n78-year-old Nicolas Toledo-Zaragoza of Morelos, Mexico\n\nA seventh victim died at a hospital outside of Lake County, Banek said.\n\nA total of 45 people died or were injured during the shooting, said Christopher Covelli, spokesperson for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force.\n\nThe focus of the investigation for the last 36 hours was on the shooter, but has now shifted to “the victims and those left behind,” Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering said during the news conference.\n\nThe release of the victims’ names comes after investigators revealed the suspected gunman may have planned the attack “for several weeks” and wore women’s clothing during the shooting to conceal his identity and his facial tattoos, and to help him leave with the crowd that was fleeing in the shooting’s wake, Covelli said.\n\nThis photo released by the Lake County Major Crime Task Force is said to be of Robert E. Crimo III dressed in women's clothing. Lake County Major Crime Task Force\n\n“He blended right in with everybody else as they were running around, almost as (if) he was an innocent spectator as well,” Covelli said late Tuesday morning at a news conference outside Highland Park police headquarters.\n\nCovelli also revealed Tuesday that Crimo had two prior incidents with law enforcement. In April 2019, an individual contacted authorities about Crimo attempting suicide. Authorities spoke with Crimo and his parents, and the matter was handled by mental health professionals, Covelli said.\n\nThen, in September 2019, a family member reported that Crimo threatened “to kill everyone” and had a collection of knives, Covelli said. Police removed 16 knives, a dagger and a sword from their residence. Highland Park police reported the incident to Illinois State Police.\n\n“At that time there was no probable cause to arrest. There were no complaints that were signed by any of the victims,” Covelli said.\n\nShortly after the September incident, Crimo legally purchased five firearms – a combination of rifles, a pistol and possibly a shotgun – between 2020 and 2021, according to Covelli. In order to buy firearms in Illinois, individuals need a Firearm Owners Identification (FOID) card. Crimo was under 21, so he was sponsored by his father, state police said in a news release. Crimo’s application was not denied because there was “insufficient basis to establish a clear and present danger” at the time.\n\nInvestigators still are trying to determine a motive for Monday’s shooting, Covelli said.\n\nCrimo, authorities believe, used a high-powered rifle “similar to an AR-15” to fire more than 70 rounds into a parade crowd from a business’s roof, which he accessed by a fire escape’s ladder, Covelli said.\n\nSounds of gunshots pierced the sunny parade just after 10 a.m. CT along the town’s Central Avenue, about 25 miles north of Chicago, sending hundreds of attendees scattering in terror – abandoning strollers, chairs and American-flag paraphernalia on the streets. Witnesses described watching in horror as injured people dropped around them.\n\nLive updates: Suspect in custody\n\nOfficers work the scene after a mass shooting at a Fourth of July parade in Highland Park, Illinois. Jim Vondruska/Getty Images\n\nThe carnage punctuates an already bloody American spring and summer – during the past 186 days, more than 300 mass shootings have happened in the US, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit tracking such incidents.\n\n“There are no words for the kind of evil that shows up at a public celebration of freedom, hides on a roof and shoots innocent people with an assault rifle,” Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Monday. “It is devastating that a celebration of America was ripped apart by our uniquely American plague.”\n\nDetails on what led investigators to believe the shooting was planned for weeks were not immediately made available.\n\nRobert E. Crimo III is arrested in this photo obtained by CNN. obtained by CNN\n\nAfter the shooting, Crimo went to his mother’s house in the area, and then took off in his mother’s car, Covelli said.\n\nAfter police determined Crimo was a person of interest in the investigation and publicized his information and the car they believed he was in, someone saw the vehicle on US 41 and called 911, Covelli said.\n\nA North Chicago police officer then saw the vehicle, waited for backup, stopped the car Monday evening near Lake Forest, Illinois, and arrested Crimo, authorities said.\n\nSuspect bought the weapons legally in the Chicagoland area, police say\n\nBesides the rifle used in the shooting, which authorities found abandoned near the shooting scene, officers also found a rifle inside the vehicle, Covelli said.\n\nCrimo, a resident of the city of Highwood, near Highland Park, had purchased both weapons legally in the Chicagoland area, Covelli said, without elaborating.\n\nOther firearms were found in Crimo’s Highwood residence, Covelli said.\n\nInvestigators have no information that the shooting was motivated by race, religion or any other protected status, Covelli said.\n\nAmong the seven people killed, five adults died at the scene and one in hospital, Lake County Coroner Jennifer Banek said. It is not yet clear how old the sixth and seventh victims were.\n\nOne of those killed was Jacki Sundheim, 63, according to a nearby synagogue where she was a congregant and a staff member. Another was Nicolas Toledo, 78, who had been visiting his family in Highland Park from Mexico, an official from the state of Morelos told CNN.\n\nThirty-nine patients relating to the shooting – including the person who died in a hospital – were treated at three NorthShore University HealthSystem hospitals, the system said Tuesday.\n\nThe injured ranged in age from 8 to 85 – four or five patients were children, Dr. Brigham Temple, the system’s medical director, said Monday.\n\nNine still were in hospitals Tuesday, ranging in age from 14 to the 70s, according to system spokesman Jim Anthony. Eight of the nine suffered gunshot wounds, Anthony said. One was in critical condition Tuesday, Anthony said.\n\n‘We’re all a little shaken’\n\nOn Tuesday morning, a Highland Park street still was littered Tuesday with revelers’ belongings that were abandoned in haste, and residents are struggling to come to terms with what happened.\n\nThree blocks of Central Avenue in downtown Highland Park remained blocked by police tape. FBI agents walked in a line to comb the street for more evidence and lifted up strewn lawn chairs, and other items left behind in the flight to safety.\n\nMembers of the FBI's evidence response team walk the scene one day after a mass shooting in downtown Highland Park, Illinois, on Tuesday. Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nA man who’d fled the carnage uninjured with his sons returned Tuesday and found the wheelchair of his elder son, who has special needs. They’d abandoned the wheelchair Monday – and the younger sibling carried his brother – after the elder fell out as they hurried away from the shooting.\n\n“We’re all a little shaken. It’s hard to believe this happened, and only (yesterday). And I think we’re all a little shaky and unsettled, (is) probably the best way to describe it,” the father, Paul Toback, told CNN’s “New Day” on Tuesday.\n\nBoth inside and outside the taped-off zone, belongings of parade visitors remained strewn on the ground. Among them: a baby carriage, a Dunkin Donuts iced coffee overrun by ants, a half-eaten cup of noodles, a toy truck, sunscreen, bottles of water, dog treats, and a stuffed Sonic the Hedgehog toy.\n\n‘Much more work to do’\n\nLast year was the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014. There were a total of 692 mass shootings in the US in 2021, the non-profit says.\n\nThe Highland Park attack comes after several recent mass shootings that shocked the nation, including an 18-year-old’s racist attack at a New York supermarket that killed 10 and another 18-year-old’s shooting at a Texas school that left 19 students and two teachers dead.\n\nHighland Park resident Murry Rosenbush is reflected in a store window Tuesday as he removes items left behind by attendees to the town's Fourth of July parade. Charles Rex Arbogast/AP\n\nIn the wake of those massacres, President Joe Biden signed into law the first major federal gun safety legislation in decades, marking a significant bipartisan breakthrough on one of the most contentious policy issues in Washington.\n\nBiden held a brief moment of silence at the White House on Monday evening during a July Fourth picnic, noting that he’d spoken to Gov. Pritzker and Highland Park’s mayor.\n\n“There is much more work to do, and I’m not going to give up fighting the epidemic of gun violence,” Biden said in a statement released Monday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris visited Highland Park Tuesday after delivering a speech at the National Education Association earlier in the day.\n\n“We’re here for you and we stand with you,” Harris said, adding that the administration would continue to offer federal assistance. “We’ve got to be smarter as a country, in terms of who has access to what, and in particular, assault weapons.”\n\nIn 2013, Highland Park had passed a local ban on semi-automatic firearms with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds of ammunition, following a series of mass shooting incidents around the country.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mayor Rotering said Monday’s shooting showed a need for strict gun laws nationally.\n\n“I think it’s important to know that our assault weapons ban … is reflective of the values of our community,” she said. “Obviously we have a problem in this country if we have weekly mass shootings involving these weapons of war, and it’s important for us to talk about how to provide that protection on a broader scale, whether it’s statewide (or) whether it’s nationally.”\n\nThe scene following a shooting in Highland Park on July 4. Network Video Productions\n\nWhat we know about the suspect\n\nFormer classmates described Crimo Tuesday as an odd, soft-spoken kid who didn’t participate in class or school activities and showed little interest in engaging with his peers.\n\nThe few friends Crimo had tended to be troublemakers who seemed to relish the notion of being outsiders, a couple of his former classmates said.\n\n“They wanted to be the ‘anti-’ group, like the rebels,” said Mackenzie, a former middle school classmate who asked to be identified only by her first name to protect her privacy. “The aura they presented was opposite, negative and harsh.”\n\nOther classmates, who wished not to be identified, described Crimo as a skater kid who made DIY skateboard videos on YouTube all the time.\n\nJust before Crimo dropped out of Highland Park High in 2017, he splattered “Awake” stickers in the school’s stairways and bathrooms, the former classmate said. Crimo made music under the name “Awake the Rapper.”\n\nOn Monday, Covelli said law enforcement officials “processed a significant amount of digital evidence,” which helped investigators identify Crimo as the suspect.\n\nCrimo posted online music videos on several major streaming outlets and on a personal website, with some featuring animated scenes of gun violence.\n\nIn one video titled “Are you Awake,” a cartoon animation of a stick-figure shooter – resembling Crimo’s appearance – is seen in tactical gear carrying out an attack with a rifle. Crimo is seen narrating, “I need to just do it. It is my destiny.”\n\nThe suspect’s uncle, Paul A. Crimo, told CNN he had spoken at length to law enforcement on Monday and described his nephew as a “lonely, quiet person.”\n\nHe said he does not know of any political views held by his nephew, though he described him as active on YouTube.\n\nHis brother, who is the suspect’s father, ran for mayor against incumbent Rotering in 2019 and lost.\n\n“I’m so heartbroken for all the families who lost their lives,” Paul Crimo said.\n\nRotering knew the suspect, having been leader of his Cub Scout pack when he was a boy. “He was a Cub Scout in my … pack. So, many years ago, he was just a … quiet little boy that I knew,” Rotering told CNN Tuesday.\n\n“I don’t know what got him to this point, but let’s ask that question of so many people,” she said.\n\nStories of terror\n\nWitnesses told stories of sheer terror following the shooting in the affluent Chicago suburb.\n\nSome bystanders initially thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks, until many fled in terror.\n\nEyewitnesses described grabbing their children and families and running for their lives, some hiding behind dumpsters or in nearby stores for safety amid the chaos. One paradegoer described seeing someone shot and killed, another saw a man shot in the ear with blood all over his face.\n\nBarbara Medina told CNN Tuesday her arm was broken during the stampede when bullets rained down on the parade. She was marching in the parade holding the banner for Community Partners for Affordable Housing (CPAH) when she heard gunshots ring out.\n\nA sea of people rushed toward her, so she dropped the banner, grabbed her 7-year-old daughter Caroline and her scooter and ran. She was separated from her 12-year-old son and her father in the chaos.\n\nMedina fled down an alley and noticed her daughter slowing down behind her. She reached back to grab her and help her along, but tripped on her scooter and fell hard on her left arm. She knew immediately it was broken.\n\n“I could see it went the wrong way, and I had to kind of maneuver it back. It was very painful,” she said.\n\nShe eventually made it to a stranger’s home, where she learned her son and his father were safe and sheltering elsewhere.\n\nMedina borrowed a sling and an ice pack and propped her arm up on some pillows to relieve the pain. Hours later, she went to a local non-trauma hospital to get her arm set and said doctors diagnosed her with a broken proximal radius just below the elbow. She now has a cast from the tips of her fingers to the top of her shoulder and expects to be in a cast for six to eight weeks.\n\nJonathan Birnberg, 41, told CNN Tuesday he attended the parade this year with his wife, 9-year-old son and 7-year-old twins.\n\n“The parade is a big tradition and didn’t happen the last two years, so everyone was really excited. There’s a carnival after and fireworks tonight, and there was excitement about bringing those traditions back,” Birnberg said.\n\nWhen the gunfire began, he said nobody moved at first, unaware of the meaning of the noise. During a second round of shots, though, he said he saw people running down the street, and so he and his family began to run in the same direction. He ducked into a coffee shop and, after regrouping with his whole family, fled to a neighbor’s house for safety along with a large group of other children and parents.\n\nMaggie Schmieder, 40, attended Monday’s parade with family and friends. She described the moments after the shooting more as “chaotic calm” than terror or panic.\n\n“People weren’t like sprinting or diving down,” she said. “It was like there was this confusion, but people automatically started going.”\n\nShe and her family fled the area and eventually made their way to their car before driving away from the scene safely.\n\nSchmieder works as a teacher and said she has prepared for a mass shooting at her school.\n\n“I always feared that this could happen at work. I naively, truly never thought that it would happen here, and certainly not at a crowded public event with a celebration,” she said.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Adrienne Broaddus Helen Regan", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Adrienne Broaddus", "Helen Regan"], "publish_date": "2022/07/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/archives/2018/02/22/finding-their-way-out-red-lion-school-shooting-still-haunts-some/363290002/", "title": "Red Lion school shooting: Some are still 'finding their way out'", "text": "Bill Landauer\n\nYork Daily Record\n\nThis story was originally published in 2012.\n\n***\n\nMindy Bennett dreams of the day.\n\nShe will pack her things.\n\nShe will pull onto Broadway and turn south on Main Street. She will reach Interstate 83 and head for Baltimore, where a new life waits.\n\nShe will leave Red Lion, the old cigar factory town in southeastern York County where she was raised. She'd been a basketball player. She'd dreamed of being a model. She'd had her first kiss there. But she also will leave behind April 24, 2003, and the moment that, for almost a decade, has made leaving impossible.\n\nA steady flow of antidepressants, psychiatrists and psychologists helped Bennett learn to talk again about that day.\n\nMaybe a firecracker had snapped, or a balloon had popped, or, perhaps, somebody pulled off a practical joke. Then she saw the blood on her principal's chest and knew.\n\nAs a 14-year-old eighth-grader at Red Lion Area Junior High School, Bennett faced a choice that would have paralyzed an adult.\n\nDo you stop to help a dying man?\n\nOr do you step over him to save your own life?\n\n* * *\n\nGrant Becker went to a party not far from his house.\n\nA couple of girls there had graduated a year ahead of Becker. Everybody got to talking about the old times, and then the conversation fell to April 24, 2003.\n\nJimmy Sheets, the girls said. What a psycho. The kid had shot up the school.\n\nBecker had been in the cafeteria that day, not them. He had heard the pistol snap, had seen the blank expression on his friend's face in the last moments before he'd taken his own life.\n\nThat wasn't Jimmy. Jimmy was a clown. A sports fan. A kid, just like Becker.\n\nBecker doesn't question Jimmy's character. He only questions why.\n\nWhat was inside Jimmy that allowed him to kill someone?\n\nBecker wonders: Is it also inside of me?\n\n* * *\n\nKim Preske toured the cafeteria with her therapist.\n\nHere, five years earlier, was where Jimmy had been standing.\n\nHe took a .44-caliber gun from his book bag here.\n\nDr. Eugene Segro, the principal, was standing here when he was shot. Jimmy placed the .44 on a chair, reached into the book bag and retrieved a .22. Pressed the barrel to his brown hair. Pulled the trigger.\n\nBut there had been something else. An errant shot had struck the floor here.\n\nAn errant shot?\n\nYes. As Jimmy lowered his arm after shooting the principal, the gun had gone off. The bullet hadn't hit anyone and had ricocheted into the ceiling.\n\nPreske believed she shouldn't have been affected. She should not have had nightmares, the play-rewind-repeat of the hundreds of children running from the building. She shouldn't have lost sleep, shouldn't have felt like she had to quit her job.\n\nShe should have been able to forget the errant shot.\n\nAfter all, Preske told herself over and over, she'd just been a sub on April 24, 2003.\n\nWhy wasn't she over it by now?\n\n* * *\n\nThe interruption\n\nBefore the sun set that day, two people had died.\n\nHundreds of children saw what happened and realized the gunman was a playmate.\n\nParents worried. And as news spread through the town, people hung banners that said \"I believe in Red Lion\" as though belief was all that kept Red Lion from dissolving.\n\nNine years later, most members of Red Lion Area School District's Class of 2007 have moved on. Others took longer to break free of the trauma. Some are still trapped.\n\nDr. Allen Miller, director of behavioral health services for WellSpan, oversaw the 50 or so mental-health and social workers who arrived to help Red Lion within two hours of the shooting. Over the past nine years, some witnesses managed to process the violence and others couldn't, he said.\n\nTheir fight-or-flight reflexes would have been working overtime that day. Intellect and reason give way to instinct during a traumatic event, and the shift can leave a residue -- for weeks afterward, trauma can plague dreams or cause uneasiness in crowds. It usually goes away in about a month.\n\nHowever, for some -- experts say as much as 8 percent of the total population -- those feelings don't fade.\n\nWhen the debilitating effects of trauma exposure linger, doctors call it post-traumatic stress disorder -- an indiscriminate illness from which mental toughness or soundness of mind offer no protection. PTSD is not cowardice. It has a definite physiology, doctors say.\n\nChildren are more at risk to different kinds of trauma -- particularly school shootings, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which is considered a pre-eminent authority on PTSD. Seventy-seven percent of children who witness a school shooting will develop PTSD, according to the VA.\n\nTo help shepherd the Class of 2007 through its recovery, Red Lion rallied. The district trucked in dozens of therapists, planted group therapy sessions all over town and identified those who seemed more likely than others to develop long-term problems.\n\nIt helped hundreds of people. Even witnesses who never sought professional help said they felt reassured by the district's response.\n\n\"It felt good just knowing that help was there if I needed it,\" said Nick Webb, who had been sitting next to Jimmy when he stood and fired his first shot. Webb said he never sought help, and any effects from the trauma he felt disappeared within weeks. Others, like Randy Boyd, say it never affected them at all.\n\nBut getting psychiatric assistance to everyone who needed it was virtually impossible, Miller said. Participation in much of what was available was voluntary. It had to be, because forcing people to talk before they're ready can make their problems worse.\n\nSome people who developed trauma-related illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder started exhibiting symptoms within months.\n\nOthers didn't. Or the symptoms were hard to identify. Some kept their nightmares and personality changes under wraps or resorted to drugs or alcohol.\n\nMany people don't discuss their struggles, publicly. That does not necessarily imply an underlying problem, said Holly Orcutt, associate professor of psychology at Northern Illinois University. Orcutt performed a study of PTSD among witnesses of a shooting at her school. She said if discussing something or seeing media coverage causes someone serious damage or harm, then a serious psychological issue might be at play.\n\nIn 2010, Denise Wagner, who'd been a teacher at the junior high school, published a children's book called \"I Went to School to Teach Today.\" Wagner's book tells the story of an unnamed act of school violence and how students and teachers reacted.\n\n\"We need to take the time to open this horrid door,\" Wagner wrote. \"We can let out the darkness and violence will be no more!\"\n\nAt first, Wagner agreed to speak about her book.\n\nLater, she called and canceled.\n\n\"I just had a chance to speak with some professional teachers that I worked with at the junior high,\" she explained in a voicemail, \"and administration has asked us not to be a part of this piece you're putting together. I'm very sorry, but, professionally, I wouldn't be able to do it.\"\n\nThe district's administration said it had informed the faculty that they were permitted to speak if they wanted to. Still, Wagner declined.\n\nThat's how it went. Of the roughly 70 former students and their families the York Daily Record/Sunday News attempted to interview, many declined to speak on the record. Several parents explained that their son or daughter -- some now parents themselves -- didn't want to relive the day.\n\nIn some cases, parents said their child had received or was still receiving therapy; talking about the day would throw them into a depression.\n\nSometimes, parents said their son or daughter was fine and would be willing to talk, and later the witness would decline. And some parents warned their child had been devastated, but, when questioned, the son or daughter claimed no damage.\n\nAmong the members of the Class of 2007 who agreed to speak, levels of cooperation waned. Men and women who started out speaking candidly later stopped returning phone calls, text messages or emails.\n\nSegro's widow, Lynne Segro, declined to comment for the story. Jimmy's stepfather and mother also declined to be interviewed.\n\nAfter the tragedy, Red Lion Area School District moved on, creating memorials, such as a display in the cafeteria of 1,000 handprints from students who had been in the junior high that day and the yearly 5K run named in honor of Segro.\n\n\"Every year there are kids who graduate from Red Lion that go to college, they get jobs, they go on with their lives,\" Miller said. \"And then there are other people . . . whose lives were affected to the degree that they weren't able to go on with their lives in what one would say was a normal trajectory that they were on the day before that incident occurred. That it was an interruption to their life.\"\n\nAnd there are those who, regardless of their best efforts and most fervent desires, remain trapped by April 24, 2003. Though they ran from the cafeteria, they have never been able to make it out the door.\n\n* * *\n\n'It stays with you'\n\nThat Thursday morning, Jimmy wore a black, imitation leather jacket over a green Jerzees T-shirt and brown, camouflage boots. He carried a backpack. On the school bus that morning, he listened to music through headphones attached to a compact disc player.\n\nEvery morning, eighth-graders gathered in the cafeteria ahead of the opening bell. Steve Bare watched Jimmy, his friend and football teammate, sit down at his usual seat. He seemed out of sorts. He usually clowned around. He was the kind of kid who would spray a buddy in the face with a water bottle for laughs. On bad days, he might sulk.\n\nApril 24, 2003, seemed to be one of those days.\n\nHis classmates streamed off buses through the glass doors and into the school. Bennett, a tall girl with long brown hair, sat with her friends in the cheerleader squad at a table next to Jimmy's and cooed over someone's baby pictures.\n\nBecker, a multisport athlete, was three tables away in freshly washed sneakers.\n\nFun Day was coming -- the day in May when carnival games on school grounds held classes at bay. Then, three months of freedom.\n\nAs the clock rounded 7:30 a.m., Jimmy held his backpack between his knees.\n\nDown the hall, Preske, a substitute with eyes toward a teaching career, readied her classroom for language arts. She had thought of going to the cafeteria, but something stopped her.\n\nIn the cafeteria, Heather Gisiner, a girl with a heart-shaped face, and Josh Campbell, a 15-year-old who had been held back a year, took their places at the wood-stained, circular tables.\n\nChad Waltemyer sat down next to Jimmy.\n\nJimmy opened his backpack. He showed Waltemyer what was inside.\n\nA pistol.\n\n* * *\n\n\"It became something real after the screaming,\" Gisiner said. \"For about 15 seconds, everybody froze, and then everyone started going in different directions.\"\n\n* * *\n\nBennett stood a few feet from a door. All around her, classmates poured through exits or became pinned against walls by fleeing forms.\n\nBetween Bennett and the door lay the body of her principal.\n\nWhat could she do? Try to stop the bleeding? Drag Segro to safety? Stay with him until paramedics arrived?\n\nThen she heard another shot.\n\n* * *\n\nBecker slid out of his chair onto the floor. Then, he stood and ran.\n\nHe arrived at the exit first.\n\nGisiner stood frozen until a friend grabbed her hand and pulled her out the door.\n\nCampbell fled through the exit doors. Waltemyer ran up a flight of stairs. Bare and a friend dashed through the kitchen.\n\nBecker hurried toward Edgar Moore Elementary School. When he got there, he realized he'd stepped out of his sneaker.\n\n* * *\n\nPreske heard three shots. A boy came tearing into her classroom. He sat at a desk and tried to catch his breath. He told her what he'd seen.\n\nAs she talked to the boy, Preske heard voices and feet and a roar. Outside her door, children flooded the hallway.\n\n\"It was a tsunami,\" she said.\n\nSix more children ducked into Preske's room. Preske shut off the lights, and she and the students huddled in a corner. They sat quietly for 15 minutes. Then, Preske heard someone knocking on a door down the hall. She opened her door a crack and peeked. A teacher told her it was over.\n\n* * *\n\nBennett climbed aboard a school bus just outside the building. Other children sat on the benches and filled the aisles. There was no room for Bennett to sit. She lay down on her classmates' legs.\n\nRumors ran wild. Dr. Segro had shot himself in the leg, one boy said.\n\nBennett knew that wasn't true. She began to cry.\n\n* * *\n\nBecker joined other students at the high school auditorium.\n\nCampbell, Bare and Waltemyer wound up there, too. For nearly four hours, police questioned Waltemyer, who had been sitting next to Jimmy and heard what might have been his last words.\n\n\"I think his exact words were, 'Should I shoot the principal?'\" Waltemyer said.\n\nGisiner and her friend had left school grounds for her friend's house. Later, Gisiner's mother drove her back to the school so she could check on a friend.\n\nAt the auditorium, everyone seemed shocked. Some children cried.\n\nBecker didn't start crying until his mother arrived to pick him up.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter parents came for her students, Preske walked back to the junior high school to get her things and head home.\n\nOn the way, she began to cry.\n\nCounselors from WellSpan had been dispatched to the school. Preske spoke with a woman who gave her a hotline number and told her to call it if she felt panicked. Preske drove home, exhausted.\n\nShe tried to go to bed, but, when she began to doze, the tsunami roared in her ears: the children running away from the cafeteria past her doorway and down the hall.\n\nWhy had she stopped at the cafeteria doors that morning? Why hadn't she gone in?\n\nShe couldn't sleep.\n\n* * *\n\nBennett sat in the auditorium and wept. Her mother arrived and took her to work. Then they went home.\n\nThe next two days \"were probably the worst,\" Bennett said.\n\nShe couldn't eat. When she tried to sleep, it played over and over again, the sound of the pistol snap and then the sickening moments where she stood waiting to be killed, the only way out blocked by her dying principal.\n\nBennett wanted to feel safe. There was only one room in the house for that -- the bathroom. It was the only room with a locking door.\n\n\"I didn't want anyone to come get me,\" she said.\n\nShe lay down on the cold floor and waited for sleep that never came.\n\n* * *\n\nThe day after the shooting, Becker went to Massachusetts for a basketball tournament. What had happened in Red Lion seemed like a bad dream.\n\nThe junior high already had held an open house for families. More than 1,000 people -- students, parents and residents -- went to the high school auditorium. They were angry, worried and fearful. Miller arranged meetings with individual students, teachers and entire families.\n\nAny one of them could have developed a long-term psychological issue, Miller said. They didn't have to be in the cafeteria when the shots were fired.\n\nThe district and other local organizations held activities for the kids, such as group meetings and art therapy. All of it was voluntary.\n\nGisiner went to a group therapy session with her friends.\n\nShe'd been having nightmares.\n\nOn Monday, April 28, mourners buried Jimmy in a plot at Susquehanna Memorial Gardens. The same day, Segro was laid to rest at an undisclosed location.\n\nWhen Becker returned from his trip, classes were in full swing.\n\n\"It was strange,\" he said. \"It was strangely normal.\"\n\nThere was a counselor in every homeroom. Becker, his friends and the counselors spoke about what happened.\n\nPreske returned to teach. Everything had changed. Colleagues who had been so friendly before, she said, now seldom spoke with one another.\n\nCounselors from WellSpan and Lincoln Intermediate Unit were on hand the first few weeks. \"I was a frequent flier,\" Preske said.\n\nShe worked at the district throughout the next year.\n\nShe gave up trying to sleep at night. The night brought the sounds of that day and the questions. Instead, after work ended in the afternoon, she would go home and catch a few hours on the couch while it was still light outside, often with her elementary-school-aged son sitting next to her.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen the junior high reopened the Tuesday after the shooting, teachers poured black paint into trays and invited the kids to walk into the cafeteria and make handprints on the wall.\n\nBennett couldn't go back in.\n\nOne time, later, she tried. She felt sick and nearly dropped her tray. She ate with the faculty in an adjoining room after that.\n\nWhen Bennett moved on to high school, counselors checked on her frequently.\n\nEventually, a high school dance was scheduled in the junior high cafeteria. Bennett didn't want to go, but her friends talked her into it.\n\nWhen she arrived, she felt nervous. They served cupcakes on a table. The table was positioned where she had seen Segro that day. Bennett had to leave.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen school began again in the fall, a basketball coach kept regular tabs on Becker.\n\nThe two spoke informally about Becker's life in general and eventually the coach asked him about how he felt in regard to the shooting.\n\nHe felt confused. He could make peace with the fact that it had happened, but Becker never understood why. Why did Jimmy do it?\n\nIn ninth grade, Bare and a group of boys he'd been sitting close to that day, or who'd been close friends with Jimmy, gathered in a classroom at the high school nearly once a week to talk. A counselor helped lead discussions about how everyone felt.\n\n\"Guilty,\" Bare said. \"We all felt like we shoulda seen it coming. We were his friends.\"\n\nOne boy in particular, the boy Bare fled with that day, seemed to Bare to be consumed with feelings of guilt. He is among the people who chose not to speak publicly, saying it was too painful to talk.\n\nFor his part, Bare said the bad feelings began to subside within that first year. \"When the media coverage started to go away, I realized I could go on with my life,\" he said.\n\nAn art class designed and installed two stained-glass windows in the junior high library as a tribute to Segro. Gisiner was one of the artists who helped with the design.\n\n\"It made me feel good about things,\" she recalled.\n\nGisiner's nightmares continued for months. She never replayed the event; instead, random dreams were interrupted by an anonymous gunman.\n\nLoud noises disturbed her. If a car backfired or a balloon popped unexpectedly, Gisiner burst into tears.\n\n* * *\n\nPreske became convinced she should have gone to the cafeteria that day. That shot had been meant for her. She should be dead.\n\nBy the time Preske taught her final class at the junior high, she had become \"a Nazi,\" she said. Once lenient and fun loving, Preske said she now sent students to the office for the smallest offenses.\n\n\"I couldn't trust my kids any more,\" she said.\n\nGone was any talk of becoming a full-time educator. She quit teaching in 2006.\n\nShe became angry. She seldom left home. She thought about suicide. She'd drive herself to the grocery store and go inside, only to emerge a moment later in tears.\n\n* * *\n\nBennett had dental surgery. The dentist prescribed Vicodin for the pain.\n\nOne day, she took an entire bottle, along with other pills.\n\nDoctors admitted her to the psychiatric ward of York Hospital. She stayed several days. Bennett remembers mingling with men and women who mumbled to themselves.\n\nBennett was suffering from depression, her doctors said. They prescribed antidepressants. The first variety made her sleepy, so they changed her dosage.\n\nA friend advised her to stop taking her pills. She stopped and suffered a relapse.\n\n* * *\n\nAs a student at Lebanon Valley College, Becker sat in a crowded arena listening to a Journey cover band. A speaker shorted out.\n\nBecker felt a sharp pain in his chest. He became aware of the people all around him. He remembers feeling trapped, as though he had to get outside into the fresh air.\n\nIt had happened before. At parties, when a balloon popped, for example.\n\nIn Red Lion, Campbell developed a cocaine problem. One night, he nearly died of an overdose. He said he has since stopped using illegal drugs.\n\nPlenty of factors led to his drug abuse, he said. But could what he saw that day be a factor? Who knows?\n\nThat day, he said, \"stays with you. It messed with my head. It's not every day you see someone murdered.\"\n\n* * *\n\nNearly six years after the shooting, Preske's son entered the eighth grade at Red Lion Area Junior High School. Preske found herself attending track and field events at the school, wearing Red Lion's colors -- yellow and black. Her son sat in the same classrooms where Jimmy had once sat.\n\nPreske didn't weep. She didn't force her son to go to another school.\n\n\"I was physically there,\" she said. \"But I felt nothing. And that was when I had had enough.\"\n\n* * *\n\n'What our voices really sounded like'\n\nOn June 8, 2007, Red Lion Area High School seniors and their families gathered on Horn Field for graduation.\n\nFour years earlier, the students' weeping, horrified faces had been national news. Now, they were heading out into the world. Gina Arakelian was about to serve her country in the military. Students such as Nick Webb, who'd been sitting next to the boy who shot his principal, were college bound.\n\nGraduating senior Libby Spangler addressed the crowd.\n\n\"People would ask, 'Where do you go to school?' and you would say, 'Red Lion,'\" she said. \"And they would stare at you.\n\n\"The nation looked at us and said, 'See what happened in little Red Lion?'\" Spangler continued. \"Some bashed us for not taking more precautions, and others praised us for how we handled the situation. . . . We wanted to share with the nation what our voices really sounded like. . . .\n\n\"Don't be afraid of what your voice has to say. Just speak up.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThe monster in the closet\n\nA barking, lunging German shepherd pushed visitors back from the front door of Bennett's yellow-sided two-story home on Broadway in Red Lion.\n\nBennett is close to 6 feet tall. Her hair, mahogany in her junior high yearbook photo, is blond.\n\nWhen she agreed to be photographed, Bennett went through her things and found two bottles of the depression medication she no longer takes.\n\nAt first, she would not bring the bottles into the room. She double checked -- nothing was to be written indicating she still was taking the pills. Once reassured, she produced the bottles.\n\nShe speaks about the day and what followed without hesitation and with a touch of gallows humor. She's been over it and over it. Talking about it feels good, she says.\n\nAfter Bennett graduated, she went to Lebanon Valley College and attempted to major in psychology. But her illness made her feel insecure, so she dropped out and moved back home with her parents.\n\nAbout two years ago, Bennett began seeing a new psychiatrist. Other therapists asked her to recount April 24, 2003.\n\nShe got sick of it. What was the point? \"Read a newspaper if you want that,\" Bennett said. Her new doctor, for the first time, asked her to delve into how she felt.\n\nThat day, her dying principal blocked her only way out of the cafeteria. Near her, Jimmy fired his gun a second time.\n\nThis was the moment within the moment -- the object of her nightmares that kept replaying over and over.\n\nDo you stop to help a dying man? Or step over him to save your own life?\n\nBennett had stepped over her principal and run out the door.\n\nFor years, she believed she should have stopped to help Segro, as if, at 14, she alone among hundreds of scattering children held sway over the man's life.\n\nBennett quit antidepressants a year and a half ago and hasn't had a relapse.\n\nShe works several double-shifts a week as a waitress at the Hawk's Gunning Club in Springettsbury Township. Recently she began applying to schools in the Baltimore area. She wants to take a job as an X-ray technician.\n\nThat would mean leaving home. Bennett feels strong enough. Now.\n\n\"I'm doing a lot better,\" she said.\n\n* * *\n\nA few years ago, a couple of Becker's co-workers were playing a prank on a girl. They were sneaking up behind her and popping balloons. The girl seemed to have an unnaturally histrionic reaction to loud noises.\n\nBecker knew why.\n\nHorrified, he told the pranksters to stop.\n\nThe girl had been his classmate. The Daily Record/Sunday News spoke with the girl's parents. They said the shooting caused her too much pain to talk.\n\nIf, like Becker, the girl struggled with finding a reason for the tragedy, there were few answers.\n\nOn the morning of April 24, 2003, Jimmy entered the cafeteria with three guns and 700 rounds of ammunition.\n\nPolice determined Jimmy was depressed, but they were never able to figure out why he shot Segro.\n\nHowever, they developed a theory -- that Jimmy had intended to wave guns to show off that morning but never meant to hurt anyone. If that theory is true, the gun went off by accident, and Jimmy, overwrought, took his own life.\n\nThe first time Becker heard the theory, he looked at the floor. He stood silently.\n\nOn the wood-paneled walls of the basement of his parents' house -- where Becker now lives -- are photos and clippings of his athletic career. Walk down a hallway from the area with the TV to the laundry room and you can watch Becker grow up in uniform.\n\nJimmy is in many of the photos.\n\nCould it all have been an accident? \"I guess I could buy that to an extent,\" he said.\n\nSeveral days later, Becker said he hadn't stopped thinking about the theory. It was the first time he heard a plausible answer about why Jimmy had killed someone.\n\n\"It just makes sense to me,\" he said.\n\nYou don't have to go far in Red Lion to hear a different theory or rumor about what happened that day. The less the town talked about what had occurred, the more opinions and stories about how the tragedy had occurred took flight.\n\nAnother of Jimmy's teammates, Bare, doesn't buy the accident theory. After he fired the shots, Jimmy's face seemed devoid of emotion. Still, Bare felt he could read something. Jimmy meant to fire the gun at Segro, Bare said. But, when it happened, \"he couldn't believe he'd chosen that road.\"\n\nToday, Bare lives with his wife and young son in a rancher in Delta. He works long hours.\n\nHis wife had been in the cafeteria that day, but they'd never discussed the shooting. Bare said he would ask her how she felt about what she had seen.\n\nLater, Bare said his wife wanted no part of this story. Then, he stopped returning phone calls.\n\nTo Becker, Jimmy is a litmus test. When he feels stressed or when things are going badly, Becker thinks about what an awful place the junior high school cafeteria must have seemed that morning to his friend. How everything must have collapsed in on him.\n\nThen Becker looks within himself. Could things ever get that bad?\n\n\"Jimmy Sheets,\" he said, \"is the epitome of a bad day.\"\n\n* * *\n\n\"You want to talk about my monster in the closet?\" Preske said recently at a diner. She laughed, grimly. She has an easy smile, a high-pitched, playful voice.\n\n\"Grief is like a Twinkie,\" she said, \"because no matter how long you have grief for it's always still fresh when you open it.\"\n\nPropped on the chair next to her were two canvas rectangles. One depicts a multicolored series of lines spiraling in on one another.\n\n\"This is what trauma looks like,\" she said.\n\nThe other is a collage of old newspaper clippings, paystubs and construction paper. One clipping is a photo of her back as she embraces a girl whose hands cover her face.\n\n\"These are all pieces of that first day,\" Preske said. She points to a headline that says \"Disbelief and Deep Anguish.\"\n\nPreske calls the big parts of life \"pieces.\" There's the substitute teacher piece, the Jimmy Sheets piece, the fear piece, the PTSD piece, the guilt and trauma piece. Preske has spent most of the last decade trying to make these pieces fit into ... something. An explanation. A life.\n\nIn 2008, Preske had had enough. At her husband's insistence, she saw a doctor. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Preske knew she had it early on but felt unworthy. She'd been a sub. She was an adult. She hadn't been in the room.\n\nThree and a half years of therapy, collages and poems later, Preske says the nightmares have subsided.\n\nAnd now, Preske is pursuing another college degree -- this time in trauma therapy. Her dream is to one day start a nonprofit to help people suffering from trauma-related illnesses.\n\nShe speaks of what happened, reverently, the way some might speak about Jesus.\n\n\"Trauma is an AMAZING organism,\" she says, smiling. The shooting \"happened to everyone. It's like an epicenter.\"\n\nBut then the town stopped talking about it, she said. Warning signs went ignored, and some people may have developed acute trauma-related illnesses that she believes could have been stemmed or lessened with treatment.\n\nTo help with her therapy, Preske sought police records and said she was denied access to files about the shooting. York Area Regional Police, which keeps the 6-inch thick file on the shooting, said they offered Preske to work with her therapist to give her access to portions of the file. Preske never returned a phone call, they said.\n\nThe town was eager to leave the shooting in the past. Most people have, Miller said. But for others, like Preske, moving on was never possible.\n\n\"I think we all talk behind our hands -- those of us that have survived,\" she says. \"... I've always wanted to sit down and say, 'Hey this isn't my story, you're not saying my story. Please stop speaking for me.'\n\n\"For eight years, everyone's been talking for me, mental-health professionals have been talking for me, my bosses, my district. I never had a voice. I just feel like my voice, as an employee, we lost our voice. I lost my voice. I lost my own opinion.\"\n\n* * *\n\nReunion\n\nOne day in February, three students returned to the junior high school for photographs.\n\nAll three said they'd put the day behind them.\n\nWaltemyer arrived first. The yellow band of the handprint display in the cafeteria glowed to his right as he walked in the door.\n\nThe last time he'd set foot in Red Lion Area Junior High School was a few weeks after the shooting. He left the district for York County School of Technology after that. Today, he works as a landscaper.\n\nHe'd been one of the lucky ones, he said. The shooting never haunted him. He'd managed to let go.\n\nNow, back at Red Lion, he glanced around corners and exhaled through his teeth.\n\n\"It's weird,\" he said. \"This is where it all went down.\"\n\nGisiner and her boyfriend arrived next. She didn't recognize Waltemyer. She hadn't been in the school since the installation of the stained glass windows in the Dr. Eugene Segro Memorial Library.\n\nCampbell arrived next. He shook hands with Gisiner and Waltemyer and reminisced about wrestling.\n\nGisiner went off to the library for photos in front of the stained glass windows she helped create. Campbell and Waltemyer walked into the cafeteria.\n\n\"It looks exactly the same!\" Campbell said.\n\nWaltemyer couldn't remember the handprints. More than 1,000 black hands smudged the walls.\n\nBoth men pointed out where they'd sat that day. Segro had fallen near a row of cash registers.\n\nAs Campbell and Waltemyer spoke, Gisiner walked down the hallway toward the exit. Something caught her eye. She stopped and stood in the cafeteria doorway.\n\nGisiner squinted. She took two steps. She raised her hand and pressed it to the wall.\n\nThe print disappeared beneath her hand.\n\nWas that hers?\n\nGisiner nodded.\n\nHow could she remember? It had been nine years.\n\n\"This is as far as I was willing to come into the room,\" she said.\n\nGisiner went no farther. She said goodbye to Waltemyer and Campbell, turned and walked out the door.\n\nPTSD symptoms\n\nSymptoms of post traumatic stress disorder usually start within three months of a traumatic event. In a small number of cases, though, PTSD symptoms may not appear until years after the event.\n\nSymptoms generally are grouped into three types, listed below, with possible symptoms for each:\n\nIntrusive memories:\n\n-- Flashbacks, or reliving the traumatic event for minutes or even days at a time;\n\n-- Upsetting dreams about the event.\n\nAvoidance and emotional numbing:\n\n-- Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event;\n\n-- Feeling emotionally numb;\n\n-- Avoiding activities you once enjoyed;\n\n-- Hopelessness about the future;\n\n-- Memory problems;\n\n-- Trouble concentrating;\n\n-- Difficulty maintaining close relationships.\n\nAnxiety and increased emotional arousal (hyperarousal):\n\n-- Irritability or anger;\n\n-- Overwhelming guilt or shame;\n\n-- Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much;\n\n-- Trouble sleeping;\n\n-- Being easily startled or frightened;\n\n-- Hearing or seeing things that aren't there.\n\nSymptoms can come and go. You might have more symptoms when things are stressful, in general, or when you run into reminders of what you went through. You might hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences, for instance. Or you might see a report on the news about a rape and feel overcome by memories of your own assault.\n\nSource: Mayoclinic.com\n\nHow to get help\n\nIf you feel as though you can't get past a traumatic event, talk to your primary care physician about it, advised Dr. Allen Miller, director of behavioral health at WellSpan.\n\nShort of that, he recommended talking it over with someone you trust, if you feel ready.\n\nIf you feel you have nowhere to turn, a number of websites are available to help you gauge whether you should seek professional help.\n\nAbout this story\n\nIn 2011, two people who had experienced the Red Lion school shooting eight years earlier independently approached the York Daily Record/Sunday News and said they wanted to talk about what happened, how they had coped and the effect they believed the shooting had on the Red Lion community.\n\nThey said others would want to help tell the story of the shooting's aftermath.\n\nThat's where this story began. Reporter Bill Landauer created a list of members from the Class of 2007 and started calling and visiting them. Visual journalist Jason Plotkin joined him. Instead of focusing on the events of that day, Landauer and Plotkin wanted to talk to people about their lives since then. Those stories could show others who were struggling that they are not alone.\n\nRed Lion Area School Supt. Scott Deisley told school staff they could talk to us, if they wished, and he allowed us to photograph students at the school. Some people we talked to said they understood and even supported the idea of the newspaper doing this story, but they didn't want to participate. Others questioned what good a newspaper story would do and declined to talk. Some objected to the paper writing about the shooting again.\n\nOthers, including Jimmy Sheets' parents and Eugene Segro's widow, Lynne, said they didn't want to talk. We respected their wishes.\n\nSeveral people decided to tell their stories in depth.\n\nIn all, Landauer and Plotkin spoke with dozens of former students, as well as members of the Red Lion Area Junior High School staff, trauma experts and police.\n\nThis story is written from those interviews, information from York Daily Record/Sunday News archives, public records and online resources.\n\nMore about the shooting: What happened\n\nFor about two months after the shooting, Walt Hughes, former chief of the now-disbanded Red Lion Police Department, attempted to cobble a profile of 14-year-old Jimmy Sheets. Hughes didn't find a sadist like Eric Harris or Dylan Klebold, the two boys responsible for the massacre at Columbine.\n\nRather, Jimmy had been depressed. \"He felt as though he'd let everybody down,\" Hughes said.\n\nLittle is known about Jimmy Sheets' biological father. In his summary of the shooting, Hughes said, \"The father is Arthur Baker, stepfather, married to his mother. The father of James Sheets has not participated in his life, as I was informed, since his birth.\"\n\nDuring the autopsy, investigators found \"I Luv Lil Betsey\" written in blue ink on his stomach. Jimmy's sister is Elizabeth Baker.\n\nJimmy's mother, Angelia Baker, and stepfather declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\nJimmy was seeing a school counselor, and there was a visit to his home from York County Children and Youth Services, according to the York Daily Record/Sunday News archives. Neither Hughes nor Tom Gross, chief of the York Area Regional Police Department, would discuss the specifics of the visit, but both downplayed its importance. The call came not from the school or from Jimmy, but from one of Jimmy's friends, Hughes said.\n\n\"There was nothing that prompted a referral,\" Gross said.\n\nStill, after that event, plus a breakup with a girlfriend earlier in April 2003, \"he fell into a depression,\" Hughes said.\n\nIf there were warning signs of what Sheets would later do, \"you'd need an advanced degree in counseling\" to divine them, Hughes said.\n\nHughes theorizes that the shooting wasn't on purpose. Jimmy might have been thinking about suicide, but Hughes believes he hadn't intended to kill Eugene Segro or anyone else. Rather, Hughes believes Jimmy had gone to school heavily armed to show off. He'd pointed the gun at his principal in a display of bravado. The gun went off.\n\nCertainly the evidence, or lack thereof, supports Hughes' theory, Gross said. \"I see nothing at all,\" Gross said. \"Nothing at all to show that he targeted Dr. Segro.\"\n\nHowever, Jimmy had stuffed his backpack with 700 rounds of ammunition. And, if he didn't mean to shoot anyone, \"It was a fatal shot,\" Gross said.\n\nHughes and Red Lion Police Department did most of the investigation work that followed, which consisted mostly of looking for a possible motive. They compiled a file folder about six inches thick with eyewitness accounts, diagrams and profile information.\n\nYork Area Regional Police Department inherited the file when it absorbed the Red Lion department. Gross wouldn't release its contents. According to state law, that's his prerogative. He won't, he said, because it contains personal information he doesn't want to redact, and it includes pages and pages of unsubstantiated rumor.\n\n\"These aren't sworn statements,\" he said.\n\nIn answering questions about the case, Gross would read from the file, and he released 1 1/4 pages of Hughes' initial report.\n\nHughes determined the following:\n\nAt about 7:34 a.m., Jimmy shot his principal and then himself with weapons he had pilfered from his stepfather's gun safe. He acted alone. He wasn't under the influence of drugs or alcohol. He wasn't a member of a gang. He'd gotten into some minor trouble at school but was not a bad kid.\n\nThere was no prior planning. He hadn't boasted or threatened. Jimmy was clearly troubled, but there were few if any red flags that said he was capable of violence. Police could find no motive.\n\nBut Jimmy had committed his crime in front of hundreds of witnesses.\n\nMost were children, like him.\n\nWho was Jimmy Sheets?\n\nThose who knew Jimmy Sheets now speak about him mostly in platitudes. He was quiet. He was nice. He was funny, once you got to know him. Others remember him as brusque, quiet or moody.\n\nHe listened to music on a pair of headphones a lot. Country, usually, classmate Josh Campbell said.\n\nEverybody has a different memory.\n\nHe was a very funny guy, and everybody liked him, Steve Bare recalled.\n\nHe was crass, he told gross jokes about girls, and nobody liked him, Mindy Bennett remembers.\n\nHe was quiet around people who didn't know him, but once you got to be friends with him, he talked a lot, Grant Becker recalls.\n\nHe talked about guns, Campbell recalled. Nothing odd about that. Many young hunters live in Red Lion and York County.\n\nAaron Criswell remembered seeing him the day before the shooting. He'd been working on a hand puppet for a home economics class. The two had joked about it.\n\n\"Jimmy was about the last person I would have expected to do something like that,\" he said.\n\nChad Waltemyer remembers visiting Jimmy, his mother, his stepfather and his little sister at the family's split-level on Freysville Road.\n\n\"He had a really good life,\" Waltemyer said. \"They seemed happy. They weren't poor.\"\n\nHeather Gisiner didn't know him that well. In the months leading to the shooting, she heard that Jimmy had broken up with his girlfriend. Jimmy was visibly upset.\n\n\"He was banging stuff around, you know, throwing books into his locker,\" she said. \"That kind of thing.\"\n\nIn the aftermath, rumors about Jimmy began to fly. Many members of the Class of 2007 hate the rumors. Becker, for one, blanches when he hears Jimmy relegated to the realm of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold — the two boys responsible for the Columbine High School massacre. That was not Jimmy Sheets.\n\nSome of his friends still have problems reconciling the Jimmy they knew with the person who shot and killed a man and then took his own life.\n\n\"The thing that always bothered me,\" Criswell said, \"was they had memorials for Dr. Segro. That's good. They should. Where's Jimmy's memorial?\"\n\nThe 'jinx' class?\n\nIn July 2007, one of Jimmy Sheets' classmates, Aaron Criswell, and a friend broke into Pleasant Grove United Methodist Church in Windsor Township and Guinston Presbyterian Church in Chanceford Township.\n\nAccording to court documents, Criswell, then 18, spray-painted graffiti that included obscenities, gang signs and a swastika.\n\nCriswell was sentenced to six to 23 months in York County prison, plus probation. Today, Criswell, a slender man with long, bleached-blond hair and a pierced lower lip, lives with his parents in Felton. He works at temp jobs. Obtaining permanent work is a struggle, he said, given his criminal record.\n\nCriswell blames himself for the vandalism. Before his trial, he went to the church and apologized to the congregation.\n\nCriswell had been a friend of Jimmy Sheets and had narrowly missed witnessing his final moments. He'd been standing at the doors to the cafeteria when the shots were fired. And Criswell had been a student at North Hopewell-Winterstown Elementary on Feb. 2, 2001, when William Michael Stankewicz entered and injured 14 people, mostly children and three adults, with a machete.\n\nDuring the machete attack, Criswell remembers being locked in a room and seeing a panic-stricken substitute teacher burst into tears. He remembers being led from the building and seeing blood on the floor.\n\nAfter both events, Criswell said, he felt \"jumpy.\" Eventually that faded.\n\nThe events no longer haunt him. Criswell said he has had other issues in his life that probably have more to do with his troubles. However, he does acknowledge that the two incidents might have affected him in some way.\n\n\"If I sat down with a psychologist, who knows what they'd say?\" he said.\n\nIn many ways, the Class of 2007 was no different from any other to graduate from the district. The success stories outweigh the tragedies.\n\nTom Gross, chief of the York Area Regional Police Department, said there is no reason to believe members of the Class of 2007 are any more or less apt to commit crimes than members of any other class in all of York County.\n\nStill, several members of the class say they've developed a reputation over the years.\n\n\"We were known as the jinx class,\" said Heather Gisiner.\n\nOther relatively high-profile crimes involved members of the Class of 2007:\n\n• In February 2005, John Meisky, a 16-year-old sophomore at Red Lion Area Senior High School, attacked his classmate, Kris March, with a seven-inch hunting knife in a classroom.\n\nMarch suffered a minor cut on his neck. Meisky fled and was later caught by police.\n\nDavid Meisky, John's father, said his son was taking two different antidepressants to help him deal with a traumatic incident that occurred about six years earlier when he was 10 years old. The boy also was dealing with having witnessed the shooting of Dr. Eugene Segro, David Meisky said at the time of the 2005 stabbing.\n\nMarch declined to comment about the stabbing.\n\nJohn Meisky couldn't be reached. Meisky graduated from Central York High School in 2007 and joined the U.S. Marine Corps, according to the York Daily Record/Sunday News archives.\n\n• In 2011, Alexander Robb and Michael Allen Nalls set fire to several cars throughout southern York County and northern Maryland. Playing cards and notes were found at the scene of some of the incidents, and before Nalls and Robb were arrested they were known in some circles as \"the carsonists.\"\n\nBoth are serving short prison sentences.\n\nRobb and Nalls were classmates of Sheets. Nalls' father said his son had been in the room when Sheets shot Segro.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/12/weeding-robots-goat-lottery-liquor-shortage-news-around-states/117484386/", "title": "Weeding robots, goat lottery: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A state agency said Friday that it will work with private organizations to encourage more elderly and disabled people to get vaccines for COVID-19, which is on the rise as the state’s inoculation rate trails the nation. With Alabama ahead of only Mississippi in vaccinations and just 30% of the state’s population fully inoculated against the illness caused by the coronavirus, the Alabama Department of Senior Services said a new marketing campaign was aimed at overcoming vaccine hesitancy. The agency will work with local agencies for the aging and disability organizations to encourage more people to get shots. A telephone hotline will allow people to reach local services and make vaccination appointments, which has been difficult for some disabled people. Vaccination rates have dropped statewide to the lowest point since early this year, when doses were scarce, and only certain people were eligible to receive shots. While less than a third of the state’s population is fully vaccinated, precautions like face masks and social distancing are increasingly rare in the state. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are rising in a trend that is troubling to health experts. State statistics showed 252 people were being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals Thursday compared to a low of 166 late last month.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state court judge is scheduled to hear arguments Monday in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a voter-approved initiative that would end party primaries in Alaska and institute ranked-choice voting in general elections. Scott Kohlhaas, who unsuccessfully ran for a state House seat last year as a Libertarian; Bob Bird, chairman of the Alaskan Independence Party; Bird’s party; and Anchorage attorney Kenneth P. Jacobus sued in December, shortly after the initiative was approved. In court documents, they say people “exercise their right of free political association by forming political parties for the purpose of electing candidates” and advancing issues and principles. They call the new voter-approved system a “political experiment” and say it was designed in a way to harm political parties. They cite concerns that candidates for minor parties, like the Alaskan Independence Party, could get “lost in the shuffle” in a primary where all candidates are listed on one ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election. Attorneys for the state Department of Law in court documents say the plaintiffs’ opposition includes a mix of policy arguments and speculation. They say the claims raised by the plaintiffs “rest on a misunderstanding” of what the initiative does, according to court filings.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Friday signed legislation banning state or local governments from requiring training in “critical race theory” and a bill creating a new small-business income tax category that will allow small-business owners to avoid paying any of the 3.5% income tax surcharge voters approved in November. The new small-business tax is expected to cut $292 million from the original $836 million schools would have received under Proposition 208, according to the Legislature’s budget analysts. Backers of the initiative have vowed to block the new law by referring it to the ballot. Ducey also signed a measure that tightens the state’s sex education law and requires parents to give permission for instruction that includes sexual issues in non-sex ed classes. The broad requirement would block discussions of historic events that have a sexual component, like the 1969 Stonewall riots in New York, considered the genesis of the modern gay rights movement, or even the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage, without parental preapproval. “Parents should have the right to know what their children are learning in school,” Ducey said in a statement. “This is a no-brainer piece of legislation that protects our children from learning materials that aren’t suited for them.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Arkansas State Police on Friday handed over to prosecutors the results of the agency’s investigation into a deputy’s fatal shooting of a white teenager that has drawn the attention of civil rights activists nationwide. Lonoke County Prosecutor Chuck Graham said his office received the case file on the shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain by Lonoke County sheriff’s deputy Sgt. Michael Davis during a June 23 traffic stop. Graham said the file has been taken to the state prosecutor coordinator since he’s requested a special prosecutor to handle the case. Authorities have released few details about the shooting, and State Police earlier Friday referred questions about the case file to Graham’s office. Brittain’s family has said the teenager was unarmed and holding a jug of antifreeze at the time of the shooting. Prosecutor Coordinator Bob McMahan said a special prosecutor should be named early this week. Davis was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley last week for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred. Staley said there’s no footage from the shooting, only the aftermath. The Rev. Al Sharpton and two attorneys who represented George Floyd said the teen’s death highlighted the need for interracial support for efforts to reform police practices.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBurbank: Batman’s secret cave, Harry Potter’s cupboard under the stairs and the apartment from “Friends” are major centerpieces to the huge Warner Bros. studio lot expansion. Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood recently reopened more than a year after doors were shuttered because of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, attendees will have a chance to explore the studio’s nearly 100 years of television and filmmaking history, highlighting the DC Universe and “Harry Potter.” A firsthand look took place a couple of days before the tour opened in late June at the Southern California studio, which now welcomes families with children ages 5 and older. Warner Bros. officials said the expansion – which includes a new building – took five years to develop in Burbank. Officials say the studio tour will follow all city, state and federal COVID-19 safety protocols. “One of the most incredible things about Warner Brothers is the incredible history of epic films that are legendary,” said “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, who helped reopen the tour.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: A 10-year-old died of plague in La Plata County, San Juan Basin Public Health said Friday. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and health officials said they are investigating the case and will provide more information as it becomes available, 9News reports. No other information on the child was immediately released. “We are so sad for the loss of this young Coloradan, and our deepest condolences go to the family,” said Dr. Jennifer House of the health department. “Public Health is doing an epidemiological investigation and wants Coloradans to know that while this disease is very rare, it does occur sometimes and to seek medical care if you have symptoms.” Officials say plague is caused by bacteria that can be transmitted to humans by the bites of infected fleas or by direct contact with infected animals. The risk of contracting certain animal-borne diseases, while present year-round, increases during the summer when humans and animals are frequently in close contact. Most human plague cases are acquired directly from fleas. Officials say it’s important to wear repellent when outdoors and keep up to date on pet vaccinations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says symptoms of the plague include fever, headache, chills, weakness, and one or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State employee union leaders are suing to stop Gov. Ned Lamont’s order to have workers return to the office now that much of the state has emerged from the pandemic, accusing him of violating prior telework agreements reached with the unions and ignoring the benefits of having people work from home. The State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, which filed the request for an injunction in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday, said in a statement that state workers proved throughout the COVID-19 crisis that a flexible teleworking agreement could be beneficial to the state of Connecticut. “From increased productivity and quality performance to the positive environmental impacts like reduced emissions, improved air quality and public health, the benefits of telework are clear and something that the Administration should be taking a proud step in leading,” SEBAC said in a statement posted on its website. In May, Lamont sent an email to state employees announcing that they would be returning to their offices as of July 1 and that any telework would be limited to no more than 50% of their time, with manager approval.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: More than 111 years after it sank off the Delmarva coast and 43 years after divers found and looted it, researchers can finally – and officially – say where the USS Nina is located and why the U.S. Navy steamer built in the 1860s likely sank. The University of Delaware is a big reason why. A two-day mission out of Lewes led by UD oceanographer Dr. Arthur Trembanis in mid-June used the school’s new autonomous underwater vehicle to help identify the sunken ship. The university has been partnering with the Navy for nearly a decade, and Trembanis’ group has been mapping the seafloor for years. The drone used during the mission has a shape similar to a small torpedo. Trembanis needed to test the new equipment and said the “stars aligned” nicely for this mission since Dr. Jim Delgado, senior vice president of SEARCH Inc., a cultural resource management firm, had been talking about a mission to officially identify the Nina. Using UD’s technology, the mission did in hours what divers and researchers may have needed days or weeks to do. “We’re really privileged at UD to have one of the most largest and advanced fleets of autonomous systems in the country,” Trembanis said. A violent February storm appears the likely culprit for the ship’s loss.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With more homicides so far in 2021 than by this same time in 2020 and carjacking incidents skyrocketing, the police department is trying to get a handle on the crimes by getting back to the basics of community policing. D.C. police officers in the 4th District have been hitting the streets, knocking on doors and starting conversations with people in the community, WUSA-TV reports. “This is an opportunity for folks to really give us some feedback – let us know what we’re doing right, what we’re doing wrong,” Inspector James Madison Boteler said. The work officers are doing is part of an initiative called “100 blocks in 100 days.” “It’s really just a get-back-to-the-basics kind of police work,” he said. Boteler, who is in a newly appointed position with the 4th Police District, is teaming up with officers covering parts of Northwest and Northeast to build better relationships with neighbors. “The amount of folks that live in the city versus the amount of crime that we respond to on a daily basis is ever-increasing,” Boteler said. To help fight that crime and the growing number of homicides year after year in the district, Chief Robert Contee selected a handful of inspectors to serve as second-in-command for larger police districts.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Red tide could cause people along certain parts of the Gulf Coast to experience respiratory irritation, health officials said. The Florida Department of Health in Pinellas County on Sunday recommended that anyone with chronic respiratory problems consider staying away from areas experiencing red tide, the Tampa Bay Times reports. Officials also advised people not to swim around dead fish and to keep pets away from water, sea foam and dead marine life. The National Weather Service in Tampa issued a beach hazards statement Saturday evening cautioning that red tide can cause coughing, sneezing and tears in the eyes and that symptoms can be worse for people with asthma, emphysema or other chronic lung diseases. Red tide is an algae bloom producing toxins that kill fish. The toxins may also make the surrounding air difficult to breathe and often turn the water red. Those with allergies also can be affected, National Weather Service meteorologist Paul Close told the newspaper. “And just the smell, dead fish smell,” he said. St. Petersburg crews cleaned up 9 tons of dead fish in 24 hours last week, the paper reports. During a news conference Friday, St. Petersburg Emergency Manager Amber Boulding said red tide blooms killed the fish, and Tropical Storm Elsa pushed them ashore.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Biden administration’s decision to reevaluate Georgia’s plan to overhaul how residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act came as a “surprise” and suggests it wants to revisit the plan’s approval, which is not allowed, Gov. Brian Kemp’s office said. The “Georgia Access” plan would improve the experience of shopping for insurance and encourage the private sector to enroll uninsured residents, the director of Kemp’s Office of Health Strategy and Coordination said in a letter to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. “Despite unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, Georgia Access will put more affordable, quality insurance coverage within reach of consumers in our state than a one-size-fits-all federal solution,” said the letter by Grant Thomas. Under the Republican governor’s plan, residents would bypass healthcare.gov and shop for federally subsidized health insurance through private agents. Critics worry the move will make it harder to shop for insurance and drive healthy people to cheaper plans that provide limited coverage, increasing premiums for older and sicker people who need the comprehensive benefits required by the ACA because the move to private websites would make it easier for consumers to simultaneously see plans that don’t provide all the benefits required by the federal health care law.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: To protect historic lands from invasive goats, officials will distribute the live animals to the public via a lottery. Hawaii officials will hold the lottery as a way to remove at least 700 goats from Puuhonua o Honaunau National Historic Park, which is an important cultural and historical site on the west side of the Big Island, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Those interested in the goats may apply for permits, which will be issued through a random lottery July 28. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources will distribute 20 to 50 goats per permit. Applicants must indicate how many goats they want and can’t choose individual animals. Lottery winners must have a 16-foot enclosed horse trailer or equivalent to pick up the goats so that they don’t escape. A permit can be refused if a trailer isn’t secured.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little on Friday mobilized the Idaho National Guard to help fight wildfires amid an ongoing drought and extreme heat. The Republican governor issued an emergency declaration allowing soldiers to help fight fires on the 9,700 square miles in mostly northern Idaho where the state provides fire protection. “Wildfire is presenting an imminent threat to life, property, and the environment, and we need all hands on deck,” Little said in a statement. “I appreciate our firefighters and fire managers for working so hard under such challenging conditions, and I am grateful that our guardsmen are able to step in once again to support Idaho communities.” It’s the first time the Idaho Department of Lands has requested the governor issue such an emergency declaration. The agency said the soldiers will help with fire suppression and logistics support. State officials didn’t say how many soldiers might be deployed to help with wildfires. Officials also said National Guard Blackhawk helicopters could be used to drop water or other suppressants on fires as well as transport firefighters and supplies. Besides tapping the National Guard, the Lands Department has also requested workers in the agency with fire line qualifications to make themselves available for fire assignments.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Visitors to this year’s Illinois State Fair will be able to visit one of the nation’s more historic highways with the creation of the Route 66 Experience. The multiyear project will turn the Springfield fairgrounds’ Gate 2 into a year-round destination for visiting a microform of the Mother Road in Illinois, from Chicago to the Chain of Rocks Bridge over the Mississippi River in Madison. It will highlight communities and attractions along the way. The project sponsor, the Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway, will have the first phase completed by the state fair’s opening Aug. 12, executive director Casey Wichmann said. “Being able to provide visitors a central location to experience what our historic road has to offer is an amazing opportunity prior to the 100th anniversary of Route 66,” Wichmann said. The 2,448-mile highway, one of the nation’s first interstate “hard roads,” was begun 95 years ago. Dubbed the “Mother Road” by John Steinbeck in his novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” it runs from Chicago’s Loop business district to Santa Monica, California. Its path through Illinois is similar to that of current-day Interstate 55. Once running, the exhibit will feature Quick Response codes and story boards detailing historic attractions and businesses. Those communities lining Route 66 will be invited to participate.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: Six inmates are alleging in lawsuits that they were kept in near-total darkness for weeks at a time and suffered electric shocks from exposed wires at a state prison. The lawsuits filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana claim the conditions at the maximum-security Miami Correctional Facility near Peru amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. The lawsuits claim that the six men were held in isolation cells that had no lights and that some of them suffered cuts from broken window glass and were shocked by dangling wires from a broken light fixture while trying to make their way around in the dark. ACLU of Indiana attorney Ken Falk called the prison’s action “torture.” Inmate Jeremy Blanchard’s lawsuit filed in March said he was kept in nearly total darkness for about a month last year, and the conditions led to hallucinations and severe anxiety. Attorneys for the state have denied the allegations and asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit. The other five lawsuits were filed this month. A Department of Correction spokeswoman declined to comment on those cases.\n\nIowa\n\nVentura: The road running between a marsh wildlife area and Clear Lake in this small northern Iowa city is dangerous for turtles, even with a turtle crossing sign. So five boys have spent some time this summer helping the turtles cross it. On one recent summer day, they spent several hours assisting turtles, saving 20 to 30 from being flattened by motorists, and they reckon they’ve saved close to 200 overall, the Mason City Globe Gazette reports. “One time, I saw a pile of flattened turtles and two baby turtles – their parents must’ve died – so that motivated me to save other turtles,” said 10-year-old Zacaious Moe. Four friends have joined Zacaious in the turtle rescuing: Keygan Hoover, 9; Blake Meyer, 8; Cole Meyer, 10; and Casen Wenzel, 8. “That’s such a neat thing for them to spend their day doing that,” said Ventura City Administrator Else Taylor. Taylor said the turtle crossing sign and a geese crossing sign have been up for several years. “We have had issues with geese and turtles getting run over in large amounts,” she said. “I walk my dog by some of these places, and there are turtle pancakes.”\n\nKansas\n\nCheney: A central Kansas farmer has invented robots that can whack weeds and reduce the use of pesticides on crops. For years, Clint Brauer has struggled with keeping weeds out of his row crops. Along with keeping living roots in the ground, organic practices and no-till methods, he tried crimping, but the pigweeds just grew taller. Three years ago, Brauer, an ex-California-based executive who farms in Haven and Cheney, decided to implement a wild plan, using robots to behead weeds. “I realized there was no great way to get the weeds out at scale without chemicals,” Brauer said. “I needed to invent one.” So he started Greenfield Robotics. Before chemicals replaced them, workers pulled weeds from the farm. Greenfield Robotics puts the “workers” back in the field with a new kind of worker – a mechanized one. “We want to control weeds with labor and make it robot labor,” Brauer said. “Robotics is our way of putting (mechanized) labor back into the farm.” The challenge was that he felt regenerative farming did not work for large fields without the heavy use of agrichemicals. “I came up with the idea for it and tested it manually,” he said. “No one knew if it would work. It has to fit between rows.” Brauer uses the weeding bots on other farmers’ soybean crops in the area and hopes to work with sorghum, cotton and possibly canola farmers.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Capitol is open again for visitors, but some fresh security regulations are in place. The new rules include measures detailing the types of masks allowed in the Capitol and prohibiting visitors from congregating in office entrances but still allow people to carry any gun of their choosing, with certain restrictions on ammunition and how they are secured. Gov. Andy Beshear said the emergency Capitol security measures were needed following the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, where supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the building and forced the evacuation of members from both chambers. He also cited “a rise in domestic terror around the country.” Armed protesters have been a common sight outside the Capitol since the onset of the pandemic and even after the Jan. 6 insurrection, with the president of the Kentucky Three Percenters notably hanging the governor in effigy at one protest. About a dozen masked men wearing camouflage and carrying rifles posed for photos in the Capitol Rotunda in early 2020 – the same day as a large protest against a proposed “red flag” gun law – near the governor’s office, while the House and Senate were in session. Visitors won’t be allowed to wear their own face mask in the Capitol but will be given one by security as they enter.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: The state’s newest food trail has the quirky name No Man’s Land: Gas Station Eats. No Man’s Land was one of the names for a buffer zone between U.S. and Spanish territories for about 13 years after the Louisiana Purchase. The Gas Station Eats food trail is starting with three stops in each of seven southwest Louisiana parishes, The American Press reports. The 450-mile route runs through Calcasieu, Allen, Beauregard, Sabine, Natchitoches, Vernon and DeSoto parishes. Stops range from the South Beau Dairy Barn in the Beauregard Parish community of Longville to French Market Express, which offers meat pies, plate lunches, yam cakes, cookies and pies in Natchitoches. There’s also an Exxon station in Natchitoches, Big Thicket BBQ in DeRidder, a Shop-A-Lott in Mansfield and another in Many, Anacoco Mercantile, and a Grab N Geaux in Lake Charles. Several stops offer fried boudin balls and whole sausages such as boudin and andouille. Others have fried fish, burgers, sandwiches – and, in Zwolle, tamales. All are in the seven-parish area known as No Man’s Land and the Neutral Strip from about 1806 until a treaty in 1819 established the Sabine River as the boundary between the United States and what later became the state of Texas.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: The state is nearly tripling the number of acoustic shark detectors in coastal waters a year after its first fatal shark attack. The Maine Department of Marine Resources deployed eight acoustic receivers in coastal waters a year ago between Wells and Popham Beach, raising the number of sensors to 11. This summer, the state has deployed 32 acoustic receivers between York and Boothbay Harbor, said agency spokesperson Jeff Nichols. The sensors don’t provide real-time data. They must be brought to shore for the data to be downloaded to determine if they detected sharks that were previously tagged with transmitters by researchers, the Bangor Daily News reports. The extra sensors come a year a fatal attack in Harpswell. Julie Dimperio Holowach, 63, of New York City, was killed by a great white shark while swimming. It was Maine’s first fatal shark attack and the third fatal shark attack in New England. An increasing presence of large sharks in New England waters is tied to a growing number of seals.\n\nMaryland\n\nTowson: Mobile crisis teams in Baltimore County respond to fewer than half of calls to help people having mental health crises. But The Baltimore Sun reports that a pilot program funded by a $1.6 million federal grant aims to add more behavioral health professionals and set up a system to redirect some 911 calls from police to behavioral health resources. Of 4,319 calls for service since September, crisis teams have responded to 1,844, according to police data. When teams aren’t available – about 57% of the time – requests for aid are rerouted to officers, according to Police Chief Melissa Hyatt. “We have a significant capacity limitation,” Hyatt told lawmakers during a state Commission to Study Mental and Behavioral Health briefing earlier this year. There are 20 part-time and full-time clinicians and 12 officers with 40 hours of crisis intervention training in the county of nearly 830,000 residents. Next month, officials begin planning the program’s rollout, police spokeswoman Joy Stewart said. The program was announced just weeks before a May rampage in which a man set his Woodlawn home on fire and killed three neighbors before police killed him. Police said crisis teams had previous interactions with him but didn’t disclose more details.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: Archaeologists combing a hill near Plymouth Rock where a park will be built in tribute to the Pilgrims and their Native American predecessors have made a poignant discovery: It’s not the first time the site has been used as a memorial. David Landon of the University of Massachusetts-Boston’s Fiske Center for Archaeological Research said his team unearthed a cache of personal items he thinks were buried there in the late 1800s, most likely by a brokenhearted settler who had outlived all three of her children. Landon said the objects – eyeglasses, clothing, sewing implements, a pocket watch and a book – gave him chills because they turned up during final excavations of Cole’s Hill, a National Historic Landmark site in Plymouth where Remembrance Park is set to be constructed. “Someone clearly used that space in that fashion in the past to memorialize members of their family,” said Landon, whose team spent the past month scouring the waterfront site where the Pilgrims are said to have come ashore in 1620. Remembrance Park originally was conceived to mark 2020’s 400th anniversary of the Pilgrim’s 1620 arrival, the founding of Plymouth Colony and the settlers’ historic interactions with the indigenous Wampanoag people. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit, idling events as well as construction.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Massive amounts of green are being spent to find green ways to prevent basements, yards, streets and freeways in the city from flooding during heavy storms like one last month. Of $100 million pumped each year into infrastructure upgrades for the city’s aging water and sewer systems, $10 million goes toward installing detention ponds, bioswales, rain gardens and permeable pavement. Called green stormwater infrastructure, the features hold and slowly release rainfall into sewers, lessening flooding that has plagued Detroit and other older cities for decades. “It’s not the end-all-be-all, but it is a type of intervention that reduces wet weather flows into the system or delays them,” said Palencia Mobley, deputy director and chief engineer for Detroit’s Water and Sewerage Department. City officials say 6 inches of rain that poured down in the area June 25-26 was the most at one time in 80 years. As with a funnel beneath a swiftly flowing faucet, the volume of water moved faster than it could be pumped out or pushed through sewers to water treatment plants. Water pooled in streets and yards as debris clogged sewer grates. Untreated water pushed up through basement drains. Motorists were stranded on freeways. New vehicles in one auto plant lot were nearly submerged.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state is planning to close all but one of its COVID-19 mass vaccination sites by Aug. 7. A statement from Gov. Tim Walz late Friday said the state will focus on the several hundred smaller vaccination sites around the state, at pharmacies and health care providers. Minnesota Public Radio reports the state’s COVID-19 vaccination rate has been stagnant in recent weeks, at about two-thirds of residents 16 and older with at least one vaccine dose. Health officials have been turning to small-scale, targeted efforts to get the shots to more people. As of Friday the state reported administering more than 618,000 vaccine doses at the mass vaccination sites since January. The Mall of America location will be the only state-run mass vaccination site to stay open past the first week of August. As of Sunday, the state-run sites in St. Paul, Oakdale, Lino Lakes, Duluth, Rochester, Mankato and St. Cloud are only offering second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in their final weeks of operation. The state-run site at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport will offer the one-dose Johnson and Johnson vaccine until it closes in early August.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: The Justice Department is continuing its investigation into the killing of Emmett Till, the Black teenager whose slaying 65 years ago in the Mississippi Delta community of Money sparked outrage and illustrated the brutality of racism in the segregated South. The department’s latest report on civil rights cold cases, released late last month, lists three investigations dating back decades that were closed because witnesses or suspects have died, leads went nowhere, or cases were too old to prosecute, but the Till case wasn’t among them. Relatives of Till said they didn’t know of anyone in the family who’d received official notification that the review had ended, a key step in the department’s process. “That’s all we know, that it’s still open,” family member Marvel Parker said Friday. Her husband, Wheeler Parker, was with Till the night he was taken from a family home at gunpoint. The youth’s brutalized body was later pulled from a river, where it had been weighted down with a cotton gin fan. Some news outlets reported last year that the investigation had ended. Initially closed in 2007, the case was reopened after a 2017 book quoted a key figure in the case, Carolyn Bryant Donham, as saying she lied when she claimed that the 14-year-old Till grabbed her, whistled and made sexual advances.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Three of the state’s top health officials said Friday that trusted local leaders and community representatives must be the primary influencers in the state’s efforts to reduce a surge in COVID-19 cases. During a virtual news conference, Robert Knodell, acting director of the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, said the state continues to have a strong relationship with federal health experts, but they all believe local health department workers and community representatives are the best avenue for persuading residents to be vaccinated. Knodell said federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials agree that people from out of state cannot “parachute” into Missouri to persuade residents to get vaccinated. “We’re on the same page as it relates to that,” Knodell said. The comments came after Republican Gov. Mike Parson said last week that he does not support a suggestion from President Joe Biden’s administration that government employees go door-to-door to urge people to get vaccinated. Jeffrey Zeints, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, responded that the program would rely on local doctors, faith leaders and others, and suggesting otherwise was “misinformation.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has discontinued Montana’s membership in a coalition of two dozen states dedicated to fighting climate change. The U.S. Climate Alliance is a nonpartisan group committed to achieving the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement and avoiding the worst impacts of climate change. Democratic former Gov. Steve Bullock joined the alliance in 2019. The alliance is made up of nearby Western states, including Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Evan Westrup, of the U.S. Climate Alliance, said Gianforte did not respond to the organization’s invitation to continue the state’s membership, Montana Public Radio reports. Gianforte spokesperson Brooke Stroyke said in a statement that the governor believes the solution to climate change is unleashing American innovation, not overbearing government mandates. She said the Paris Agreement punishes the U.S., while letting countries like China off the hook. Stroyke didn’t respond to requests to clarify Gianforte’s climate goals, or what sort of innovation is necessary in Montana. Amy Cilimburg, executive director of Climate Smart Missoula, said the state needs more than innovation. “The U.S. Climate Alliance was not some kind of a radical group; it was governors realizing that we’re stronger together,” Cilimburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Roughly 200 people were possibly exposed to a rabid bat while staying overnight at Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, the zoo said. The zoo and Nebraska health officials recommended that roughly 186 campers who stayed overnight at the aquarium in recent weeks, as well as some staffers, get rabies shots. A camper on July 4 woke up to a wild bat flying around her head. A zoo emergency medical technician didn’t find any bites or scratches on her. The zoo found seven wild bats in the aquarium and euthanized them. One tested positive for rabies. The zoo in a news release Friday said it has recommended that people exposed to wild bats while they were sleeping get rabies shots. The zoo gave campers refunds and is paying for their shots. Animal Health Director Dr. Sarah Woodhouse said in a statement that guests who visited the aquarium during the day shouldn’t be concerned because bats only come out at night. “The bats we identified were little brown bats, a common bat species in Nebraska that anyone could find in their backyard or attic,” Woodhouse said. “It is not unusual for a wild bat to be infected with rabies, which is why you should never directly touch a wild bat.” Zoo staff didn’t find any signs of long-term bat roosting at the aquarium.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The U.S. Department of Energy has agreed to pay the state $65,000 after the government mislabeled and mischaracterized low-level radioactive waste that was shipped to a disposal site north of Las Vegas for more than five years. The settlement agreement announced Thursday certifies that multiple changes have been made to prevent unapproved waste from being shipped and disposed of at the Nevada National Security Site in the future, state and federal officials said. It also establishes an additional groundwater monitoring well at the site. The Energy Department has said none of the materials shipped to Nevada posed any health or safety threats to workers or the public. They were mischaracterized as the wrong category of low-level waste and should have been classified as low-level mixed waste, the state’s review determined. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry notified Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak in July 2019 that 33 packages of unapproved waste were sent in 10 shipments between 2013 and 2018 to the site from the Energy Department’s Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A council tasked with addressing broad issues around housing affordability and stability in the state seeks to increase housing availability by 13,500 units by 2024, according to its plan released Friday. The plan includes a three-year framework to specifically address homelessness across the state, with emphasis on the need for an increase in inventory of affordable housing. Recommendations include promoting new housing development, reducing barriers to affordable housing, and using a data-driven approach to understand regional needs. “The plan serves as a blueprint for our collective efforts – statewide, regionally, and locally – with a focus on alignment, coordination, innovation, and accountability,” Gov. Chris Sununu, who created the council last year, said in a statement. Sununu created the Council on Housing Stability after state police cleared a homeless encampment outside a courthouse in Manchester. It represents a revamping of the existing Interagency Council on Homelessness.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSeaside Heights: Gov. Phil Murphy signed a package of bills Friday aimed at moving the state closer to its goal of generating 100% of its power from clean sources by 2050. The measures make it easier to develop some solar energy projects and to locate and build electric vehicle charging stations. But still waiting for action by the Democratic governor is another bill that would remove most local control from where and how offshore wind energy projects come ashore. Murphy did not mention that bill at a signing ceremony in Seaside Heights in a municipal parking lot across the street from a popular water park. “From wind turbine component manufacturing to solar to electric vehicles, we are well on our way to putting New Jersey back to its rightful place as a national leader” in clean energy, Murphy said. One measure makes it easier to locate electric vehicle charging stations throughout the state, eliminating the need to go before planning or zoning boards to get them approved. A similar bill signed by the governor encourages development of zero-emission vehicle fueling and charging infrastructure in redevelopment projects. Murphy also signed two measures dealing with solar power projects. One allows so-called dual use solar projects located on unpreserved farm land that is still also used for agricultural purposes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Republican lawmakers are asking the state attorney general to weigh in on a spending dispute over $1.75 billion in federal pandemic relief aid. GOP leadership in a letter sent Thursday asked New Mexico Attorney General Hector Balderas, a Democrat, to issue a legal opinion declaring the funds must be allocated by the Legislature to protect the body’s fiscal authority. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham has said her administration must distribute the money because of the way Congress passed the pandemic relief bill. The Legislature allocated money earlier this year, but Lujan Grisham used her veto power to effectively bring the money under discretionary control by her office. Republican lawmakers took issue. They, along with one vocal Democratic senator, signed a petition that called for an extraordinary legislative session to be convened to override the governor’s veto and bring the funds back under the Legislature’s control. Democratic majorities in the House and Senate did not sign on. “Standing on principle isn’t always popular,” Sen. Jacob Candelaria, D-Albuquerque, said on Twitter in response to a news article. “Was easy for my Dem colleagues to challenge (the) power of (former Republican Gov. Susana) Martinez. Such a fair weather commitment to the law.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is seeing an uptick in COVID-19 cases as vaccination rates slowly rise, according to data released Saturday. About 525 people each day tested positive for the coronavirus in New York for the seven days through Friday. That’s up from 369 people – a 42% increase – for the prior week. It’s unclear why more people in New York are testing positive, at a time when fewer people are getting tested. The state Department of Health said a higher percentage of cases are linked to more contagious variants and urged more people to get vaccinated. New York City is driving much of the increase in positives, though cases are also rising on parts of Long Island. Meanwhile, hospitalizations are flattening: Hospitals reported 342 COVID-19 patients as of Friday, similar to 340 patients from last Friday. About 55% of 20 million New Yorkers are fully vaccinated. That’s up from nearly 48% as of June 6. Vaccination rates are lowest in parts of western and central New York; about one-third of residents in Allegany County are fully vaccinated. Rates are also lower in parts of New York City: 43% of Bronx residents and 45.5% of Brooklyn residents are fully inoculated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: Fayetteville State University has used pandemic relief funds to clear $1.6 million in tuition debt for nearly 1,500 students. The Fayetteville Observer reports the historically Black school utilized money from the federal legislation that’s known as the American Rescue Plan. Signed into law in March, it provided nearly $40 billion to higher education institutions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. FSU cleared tuition that was not covered by federal student grants or loans. The school also plans to use $4.7 million in federal funds to provide free summer classes to 1,400 undergraduates through the summer of 2023. “The university is focused on students’ success by clearing past due balances and erasing debt,” FSU spokeswoman Joy Cook said. “When the burden of financial stress is taken away, student success increases.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A Midwestern network and technology services provider says it plans to invest $200 million to upgrade and expand its fiber network in North Dakota. Midco said it’s part of a larger $500 million investment to its network in the upper Midwest that will benefit telehealth, education, government operations and remote working. Upgrading to 10-gigabit speed by 2030 is a goal toward which the cable provider has been working for the past couple years. “Now we think we can do it sooner,” said Midco President and CEO Pat McAdaragh. The phased upgrade begins in earnest in 2022, doubling Midco’s fiber network to 22,000 miles, McAdaragh said. Work in North Dakota will begin with a $100 million first phase in Bismarck, Dickinson and Fargo, lasting about three years. “Then immediately we’ll begin spending the other $100 million and getting to areas we haven’t gotten to done yet, so we’re looking at more of a six-year process than 10,” McAdaragh said. More than 25 communities, many of them rural, stand to benefit from the upgrade in North Dakota, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Midco expects remote work to continue to be an employment trend, sparked by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOhio\n\nRootstown: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver after a man allegedly attempted to swallow a bag of cannabis when he was pulled over for speeding. Ohio State Police Sgt. Ray Santiago said the traffic stop occurred July 3 in Portage County. Trooper Charles Hoskin stopped a vehicle that was allegedly traveling at 94 mph in a 70 mph zone, WEWS-TV reports. Dash camera video posted to the Ohio State Police Twitter account shows Hoskin asking if the driver could breathe before helping him out of the car and performing the Heimlich. The man expelled a bag of marijuana and apologized to the officer. After the man recovered, Hoskins asked: “Do you want to die over a minor misdemeanor?” The man received citations for speeding and failing to wear a seat belt, according to Santiago. The man also received a summons for marijuana and was released at the scene.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials on Friday urged more residents to get vaccinated amid an alarming spike in new cases and hospitalizations for COVID-19, particularly in the northeastern part of the state. Oklahoma is seeing an uptick in cases with the emergence of the new delta variant of the coronavirus, particularly in rural areas where there are lower rates of vaccinations, said Oklahoma Health Commissioner Dr. Lance Frye. He said those numbers will likely continue to increase following the Fourth of July holiday. “Vaccination numbers for 12 to 34 years old are particularly low, meaning this demographic is especially at risk,” Frye said. “We want people to get out and enjoy their lives and their freedoms. Vaccination is the way to get there.” Oklahoma has the 11th lowest percentage of its population fully inoculated at 38.9%, compared to a national average of 47.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma has risen over the past two weeks from 190.29 new cases per day June 23 to 278.71 new cases per day Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Meanwhile, the CDC on Friday said it identified 47 cases, all with the delta variant, in April and May associated with a central Oklahoma gymnastics facility.\n\nOregon\n\nPendleton: Dozens of baby hawks, desperate to escape a blast of early summer heat in recent weeks, bailed from their nests and plummeted to the ground. Calls poured into Blue Mountain Wildlife day after day as temperatures pushed beyond 110 degrees across Eastern Oregon. Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian that she hadn’t seen anything like it in her 30 years as director of the wildlife rehabilitation center outside Pendleton. “They had no choice,” said Tompkins, 68. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.” In all, the center took in nearly 50 nestling Swainson’s and Cooper’s hawks after they leaped from their nests in the extreme heat wave that baked the Pacific Northwest. Thirteen of the raptors suffered injuries severe enough that they had to be euthanized. “We knew the temperature was going to spike beforehand, and we assumed we might get a few more calls,” said Trisha Marquez, a volunteer who fielded the calls and who is Tompkins’ niece. “But we did not expect this at all.” The influx was more than the small staff could handle. They hardly had the space to put them all and, eventually, asked people to turn on their sprinklers and hoses and set out pans of water for less-injured birds to cool themselves down.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A museum has returned to public view a 19th-century diorama that shows lions attacking a camel and its human rider, about a year after covering it up in response to complaints about how the courier was depicted. The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reports a curtain around “Lion Attacking a Dromedary” at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was removed a week ago, and information was posted to address the controversy. X-rays have confirmed that the figure contains a human skull and jaw, presenting an ethical problem for the museum, which does not know where those remains originated. The courier’s costume has been determined to be derived from at least five separate North African cultures. A new sign tells museum patrons that the exhibit, which vividly depicts two lions attacking a camel and its knife-wielding rider, is popular but reinforces stereotypes. “For the present, the museum is keeping the diorama on display,” the sign says. “We want to engage with visitors, staff, and community members to listen and learn from you as we consider the future of this diorama.” Museum director Gretchen Baker told the paper the curtains “were more harmful than not having them up at all,” and in hindsight covering the exhibit may not have been the right approach. The French-built diorama has been at the Carnegie since 1899.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee has vetoed legislation that would make property owners register with the state before listing short-term rentals through online lodging websites, to the chagrin of some concerned about the unregulated nature of the industry. “I cannot support this bill because it will create additional burden for property owners,” the Democratic governor wrote Thursday in a veto message. “Short-term rental concerns, like other property/land use and small business matters, are most effectively addressed at the municipal level.” Some municipal leaders and residents are worried about properties rented on vacation rental websites like Airbnb and VRBO becoming de facto hotels. Calls for a registry increased in the spring after a 22-year-old University of Rhode Island student was fatally stabbed during a party at a rental property in Newport. The proposal was overwhelmingly approved by the heavily Democratic Legislature, which can override McKee’s veto. Senate President Dominick Ruggerio and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement that they were “disappointed” by the veto.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservationists have pulled a historic canoe from a river and plan to put it on display. Volunteers with the Chattooga Conservancy hauled the weathered wooden canoe out of the South Carolina side of the Chattooga River on Tuesday after a group of canoeists headed downstream discovered the craft last fall, The State newspaper reports. Archaeologists at the University of South Carolina say the boat could be 200 to 250 years old, a discovery that could shed light on life in the late 1700s. Canoes of that age are rarely found along the Chattooga, a free-flowing mountain river that runs along the Georgia-South Carolina border. Most of South Carolina’s historic canoes have been found in the state’s Lowcountry region, said underwater archaeologist James Spirek. “Up in the mountains on the rivers, they’re a little rare,” Spirek told the newspaper. “It’s interesting to find people were using canoes on some of these wild rivers.” The experts said the canoe was hollowed out using an iron hatchet or ax, suggesting it was made after Europeans settled in the Southeast. A nail was also found at one end of the canoe. Volunteers are expected this week to pull the boat up a mountain slope and down a bank to then float it down a calmer river stretch to move it out of the river corridor for storage or display.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Two Native Americans announced Thursday that they were joining a lawsuit against South Dakota alleging that state agencies failed to offer voter registration services. The two tribal members, along with the Lakota People’s Law Project, said they were asking a federal district judge to allow them to join a lawsuit that alleges state agencies are breaking federal law by not providing ample opportunities to register to vote or update voter registration information at places like motor vehicle and public assistance offices near Native American reservations. Federal law requires the agencies to help people register to vote at those kinds of offices, including ones that provide public assistance or serve people with disabilities. The Oglala Sioux Tribe and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe initiated the legal challenge last year. The state has denied those allegations in court documents and asked that the lawsuit be dismissed. The tribes have argued that state practices already make it difficult for Native American people to register to vote. They alleged that they have documented instances in which people tried to register their votes at state agency offices but were turned away.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A federal judge on Friday halted enforcement of a new state law requiring businesses to post special signs if they allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice. The first-of-its-kind law went into effect July 1 and would require such businesses to post signs on multiperson bathrooms that say: “This facility maintains a policy of allowing the use of restrooms by either biological sex, regardless of the designation on the restroom.” Businesses in Nashville and Chattanooga sued over the law, claiming that being forced to post those signs would violate their First Amendment rights by compelling them to communicate language they find offensive. The state of Tennessee argued in court that the signs are merely factual. In her Friday decision, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger handed a victory to the businesses that sued, granting a preliminary injunction that effectively prevents the state from enforcing the law while the case works through the courts. She noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has found that compelling individuals to “mouth support for views they find objectionable” violates a cardinal constitutional command unless justified by “the strongest of rationales.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Houston man who received widespread attention after standing six hours in line to cast a ballot in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary was in jail Friday on charges that it was illegal for him to vote at all because he was on parole. Hervis Rogers became an overnight face of Texas’ battle over voting access when he emerged from a polling center at a historically Black college around 1:30 a.m. He was among Houston voters on Super Tuesday who waited more than an hour – some for several hours – in mostly minority, Democratic neighborhoods. Lines in mostly white, Republican neighborhoods were shorter. “The way it was set up, it was like it was set up for me to walk away,” Rogers told reporters. He was arrested this week on two counts of illegal voting, a second-degree felony that carries a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. His bail was set at $100,000. Rogers, 62, voted last March while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Andre Segura, an attorney for the ACLU of Texas who is representing Rogers, said his client did not know he was ineligible to vote. “We shouldn’t be prosecuting people for innocent mistakes,” Segura said. The rare arrest on illegal voting allegations comes as Texas Republicans begin a second attempt at passing many of the same restrictive voting measures blocked by Democrats during a dramatic late-night walkout in May.\n\nUtah\n\nMilford: Just outside this town of about 1,400 people in southwest Utah, researchers behind a major energy project are hoping to tap into a limitless supply of clean, reliable power. The energy exists thousands of feet below the surface, where the natural heat from the Earth’s core can be used to create electricity. Researchers at the Utah-based FORGE lab are working on technology to create geothermal reservoirs almost anywhere in the world, KUER reports. Geothermal power already exists but currently makes up just 0.4% of energy production in the U.S. So far it’s largely been limited to select areas around naturally occurring hot springs, such as the Roosevelt Hot Springs in Beaver County. FORGE lab researchers have recently completed one of two major wells they’ll use to develop the tools to build “enhanced geothermal systems” – human-made versions of natural geothermal reservoirs that pump water through cracks underground, heat it, and use the steam to power turbines or to heat buildings. If successful, the project and others like it could lead to “a 40-fold increase over present geothermal power generating capacity,” according to the U.S. Department of Energy. “The world is looking at Milford,” said Joseph Moore, a geologist and lead researcher at FORGE.\n\nVermont\n\nWinooski: The state is undergoing a pandemic-related liquor shortage, regulators say, leading to empty shelves in some stores and warehouses, WCAX-TV reports. “It is a global issue. A lot of it has been exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s not going to be a quick fix,” said Wendy Knight, deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Liquor and Lottery. It’s a global supply chain issue “from production gearing back up from the pandemic, worker shortages, shipping issues, and a glass shortage. That comes on top of demand from restaurants and bars reopening,” she said. The Burlington bar The Archives planned to open a second location in Winooski last year, but the pandemic kept it closed until Thursday. Now the arcade bar is facing another obstacle. “The liquor shortage has been a challenge,” the bar’s co-owner Matthew Walters said. Bars and restaurants are not the only ones feeling the tight supply. “There’s enough to at least have your second choice, if not your first,” George Bergin of the Beverage Warehouse in Winooski told the news station. “With all the bars and restaurants opening up everywhere, everyone is trying to restock their shelves, and it’s just taking a little bit of time to get caught up with the sudden demand.” Vermont saw a 13% increase in liquor sales amid the pandemic, Knight said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: Cheers erupted Saturday as a Confederate statue that towered for nearly a century over downtown was carted away by truck from the city where it had become a flashpoint for racist protests and deadly violence. It was a day of palpable joy and immense relief for scores of residents and visitors who lined neighboring streets to watch the larger-than-life figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee as it was hoisted from its pedestal and taken – at least for now – to storage. The statue’s removal came more than five years after racial justice activists had renewed a push to take down the monument, an initiative that drew the attention of white supremacists and other racist groups, culminating in the violent “Unite the Right” rally in 2017. “I’m ecstatic that we’re here now. It’s sad that it’s taken so much to get us to this point. But this is an incredible day,” said Don Gathers, a local Black activist who long advocated for the statue’s removal. Work to remove Lee’s statue, as well as one of Confederate Gen. Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson shortly after, proceeded peacefully and without interruption. Also removed Saturday was a statue depicting Sacagawea and explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark that has been criticized for a depiction of the Native American guide and interpreter that some view as subservient and weak.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A federal jury has convicted a timber thief who authorities said started a large forest fire in a case that prosecutors said marked the first time tree DNA had been introduced in a federal trial. The jury deliberated for about seven hours before convicting Justin Andrew Wilke, 39, on Thursday of conspiracy, theft of public property, depredation of public property, and trafficking and attempted trafficking in unlawfully harvested timber, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Western Washington said in a news release. The wood he sold to a mill in the city of Tumwater had been harvested from private property with a valid permit, Wilke said. But a research geneticist for the U.S. Forest Service, Richard Cronn, testified that the wood he sold genetically matched the remains of three poached trees. Wilke used gasoline to destroy a wasp’s nest in the base of a maple tree he was stealing, prosecutors said, though jurors did not convict him of charges related to the fire. Some witnesses testified that, although Wilke was standing next to the nest when the fire began, they did not actually see his actions in the dark. Wilke and others conducted an illegal logging operation in the Elk Lake area of the Olympic National Forest, near Hood Canal, between April and August 2018, according to records filed in the case.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice called on Saturday for the resignation of a state lawmaker who posted a sexually explicit TikTok video to his public account. State Del. Joe Jeffries was stripped of a committee assignment Friday after word spread of the social media posting, according to a statement from House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, who called his fellow Republican an “embarrassment.” On Saturday, the GOP governor issued a statement calling Jeffries’ behavior “sad” and “childish.” “Not only did he yell graphic comments about me to a group of senators during the recent Legislative Session, but now we find that his not-so-secret TikTok is full of disgustingly vulgar videos, which are especially insulting to women,” Justice’s statement said. “This is the behavior of an immature child, not a 39-year-old father and elected official.” The governor said he had expected to hear an apology from Jeffries by Saturday morning, “but all he has done is hide from the media and the criticism.” Jeffries, whose district includes a group of counties near Charleston, posted the video Thursday. His account was set to private Friday. Belinda Biafore, chair of the West Virginia Democratic Party, said Jeffries “has a slew of inappropriate and vulgar videos with his own sexually explicit commentary on a social media app aimed at youth.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A bishop has taken the unusual step of removing a priest from the ministry after he made a series of divisive remarks about politics and the pandemic. The Diocese of La Crosse said in a statement Friday that Bishop William Patrick Callahan has issued a decree immediately removing the Rev. James Altman as pastor of St. James the Less, a parish in the city of La Crosse. The decree will remain in effect for an undetermined length of time, the statement said. “(The bishop) and his diocesan representatives have spent over a year, prayerfully and fraternally, working toward a resolution related to ongoing public and ecclesial concerns of the ministry of Fr. James Altman,” the statement said. “The obligation of a Bishop is to ensure that all who serve the faithful are able to do so while unifying and building the Body of Christ.” Diocese officials didn’t release the decree and didn’t immediately respond to a request for a copy. Altman told conservative news outlet LifeSiteNews.com that he’s not surprised the Catholic hierarchy is trying to silence him. “Unfortunately for the corrupt hierarchy, I will not be silenced by any arbitrary Decree, nor will I be cowed by any action against my priestly faculties,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A rancher who was pinned by an all-terrain vehicle survived on beer and bottled water for two days. Frank Reynolds, 53, was trying to round up a cow and calf on a neighbor’s pasture outside Gillette when the vehicle tipped over on him July 4, Reynolds told the Gillette News Record. “It was scary as hell is what it was,” Reynolds said Wednesday from a hospital room. Family thought Reynolds had gone camping or was with friends, said Quentin Reynolds, the Campbell County undersheriff and Frank’s brother. Later Monday, they began to worry. Eventually, they learned Frank Reynolds had planned to do some work on the property, where he was laying with a dislocated shoulder and broken ribs. A search began. Reynolds, meanwhile, honked the ATV’s horn so much he wore down the battery – to no avail. He was able to ration a couple of bottles of water and Keystone Light beers from a cooler, Sheriff Scott Matheny said. Searching on horseback, neighbor Don Hamm found Reynolds about 8 a.m. Tuesday. By that point, Reynolds recalled he was “pretty much out of it.” “Everything on the left side pretty much hurt, from the top of my head to my toes,” he said. He was expected to remain in the hospital a few more days and eventually recover.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2014/07/10/immigrant-children-border-kids-pipeline/12410517/", "title": "Pipeline of children: A border crisis", "text": "Daniel Gonzalez and Bob Ortega\n\nThe Republic | azcentral.com\n\nThe pipeline bringing a flood of Central American migrants to the United States, including thousands of unaccompanied children, begins in villages like Quebrada Maria, near the Caribbean coast of Honduras.\n\nThat's where dimple-faced, 14-year-old Brayan Duban Soler Redondo lived in daily fear of being beaten up or killed by members of gangs like Mara Salvatrucha, also called MS-13, and Calle 18.\n\nGangs such as these terrorize neighborhoods throughout Central America. Over three days in May, gang members in another Honduran city, San Pedro Sula, murdered five children ages 5 to 13.\n\n\"They cut their bodies into quarters as a warning to others because the children didn't want to distribute drugs in their neighborhood,\" said Father German Calix, director of Caritas Honduras, a Catholic relief agency.\n\nSlayings like these were why Brayan was desperate to leave. He imagines himself working in an office in the United States someday, \"wearing fancy clothes\" and sending money back to his family.\n\nBut his charming smile offered little protection in his village, where gangs kill over the smallest of things, he said, even for trying to go to school or wearing the wrong clothes.\n\nHe had no idea how he would escape that world until, the week before Easter, he heard news he thought could save his life.\n\nTwo brothers from the same village had set off a month earlier for the United States. Their mother had received a call. The boys, teenagers like Brayan, had made it. Word spread through the village fast. The boys told their mother that, after turning themselves in to \"la migra,\" the Border Patrol, they had been detained briefly and then released to relatives in the United States.\n\nBrayan saw a way out.\n\nThere was one big problem. Migrants often pay smugglers thousands of dollars to guide them to the United States. Brayan didn't have any money. He is the youngest of eight children. His parents are coffee pickers. And, unlike many migrants, he didn't know any relatives working in the U.S. to send him money for the trip.\n\nBut that didn't deter him. After hearing the story about the two boys, Brayan decided to leave his family behind and strike out the very next day on a 1,400-mile journey to the U.S. To earn money, he killed a rabbit and sold it for the equivalent of $9.50, which he carried in his pocket the day he left.\n\nSo in mid-April, Brayan entered the pipeline, which has grown increasingly crowded with children looking for an escape route out of their violent homelands. Kids such as Brayan and 16-year-old Levi Manases Miranda Peña from El Salvador and 16-year-old Jairo Garniga from Guatemala.\n\nThe pipeline carrying migrant kids and families to the United States ends at the Rio Grande, where the surge of thousands of women and children from Central America has overwhelmed the Border Patrol in southern Texas.\n\nIn the past eight months, about 57,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended in the U.S., already 18,000 more than fiscal 2013. With four months still remaining, experts predict the number could soar to 90,000 this year.\n\nMore than 70 percent are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, three Central American countries plagued by poverty and crime. All three rank among the top five countries with the highest murder rates in the world.\n\nThousands more from these countries have fled to neighboring countries, including Mexico, Costa Rica and Nicaragua.\n\nThe escalation of fleeing migrants has created a humanitarian crisis that has rippled across the U.S. Thousands of migrant children caught crossing the border end up crowded into detention centers and military bases in Arizona, Oklahoma and California until they can be moved to shelters, reunited with relatives in the U.S. or flown back to their home countries.\n\nA 2008 law requires the United States to provide full immigration hearings to any unaccompanied children who reach the U.S. from countries other than Mexico and Canada.\n\nThe same law requires unaccompanied migrant children to be placed in \"the least restricted setting possible\" as they await the outcome of their hearings.\n\nAs a result, many are released to relatives instead of being held in shelters until their immigration hearings.\n\nThe surge of migrants began sometime in 2011 but was barely noticed outside southern Texas until it became a gusher in recent months. It overwhelmed the Border Patrol system in southern Texas, which was set up to care for only about 5,000 unaccompanied minors per year, nothing like the numbers that are crossing the border now.\n\nMany young people, like Brayan, said they heard stories of others who made the arduous trip to the U.S. and were reunited with mothers and fathers, brothers, sisters or cousins, aunts and uncles.\n\nOthers who made the trip told The Arizona Republic they had heard or read reports in the Central American media or on the Internet that they could get \"permisos\" to live in the U.S. if they made it to the border. But when The Republic was in Central America, news media discouraged going to the United States.\n\nSmugglers also market their services, telling parents that children are their ticket to stay in the U.S.\n\nPoverty prompts some, like 16-year-old Juan David Chavez, to make the journey.\n\nJuan was among 114 Salvadorans — 72 of them minors — who arrived back in San Salvador one day in mid-June on three buses of deportees after being caught in Mexico.\n\n\"I left for economic reasons,\" Juan said. Jobs are hard to come by, he said, and pay far too little. \"I'm the oldest son, and I wanted to help my family,\" he said.\n\nJuan said he will try again to reach the U.S.\n\nBut the chance to reunite with relatives in the U.S. and the fear of gangs and violence appear to be by far the major factors motivating so many young people to take the risks involved to reach the U.S. Such risks include being robbed, beaten, held for ransom or killed while traveling through Central America and the length of Mexico.\n\nThe gangs reach into almost every corner of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\n\nOne day in May, seven gang members boarded a public bus in San Salvador, El Salvador's capital. They were looking for two members of a rival gang. But they fired indiscriminately at passengers, killing six people and wounding a score of others, including a 2-year-old. On that day alone, 31 people were murdered in San Salvador. The city averaged more than 12 murders a day in June, according to federal police.\n\n\"The gangs are in schools, neighborhoods. They're everywhere,\" said Alison Ramirez, who works on a U.S.-funded, violence-prevention project in El Salvador and frequently visits Honduras and Guatemala. \"Even if the kids don't want to be a part of it, they get caught up in the crossfire, extorted, threatened.\"\n\nThe pipeline begins in the neighborhoods of major cities, like the leafy-green and crumbling Zacamil section of San Salvador. The rival gangs MS-13 and Calle 18 lay claim here.\n\nMembers spray-paint the letters and numbers of their gangs on telephone poles, apartment buildings and the walls of concrete-block homes abandoned by families who have fled.\n\nOn street corners, young men and boys watch who comes and goes. One shouts curses and flings rocks at a passing car when he spots a photographer's lens peeking out a window.\n\nIn contrast, vivid, cheerful murals of women and children cover the outside walls of the community center known as Fe y Alegria — Faith and Joy.\n\nBehind the walls topped with razor wire, children play in a concrete courtyard. A grassy football field awaits just past a padlocked iron fence. But the children don't play there anymore. Last year, a gang member climbed over a wall and shot to death a student and wounded a teacher during a soccer game.\n\nIn early June, gang members fired four shots at an older student on the street just outside the front gates, she said. The boy scrambled to safety. He has not been back since, Mena added.\n\n\"It's changed a lot in the last four years,\" said Federico Pliotez, who teaches woodworking. \"Many families have no source of income, no work. They eat one meal a day.\"\n\nThe gangs prey on vulnerable families, recruiting children as young as 10 to deliver drugs and to be their eyes and ears on the street. \"You can be killed for going to school if they tell you not to,\" Pliotez said.\n\nThe San Ramon neighborhood, at the foot of the San Salvador volcano, is another area infested by the MS-13 and Calle 18 gangs.\n\n\"They're a plague,\" said Kevin Briseño, 18, who agreed to meet reporters at a Catholic-run children's center.\n\n\"I was four months from graduating from high school, and I had to leave the school because they threatened me,\" he said. \"I couldn't go out of the house, I couldn't meet with friends. It was too dangerous.\"\n\nIt took more than a year before Briseño felt safe enough to go out into the community again.\n\nHe lives in a single, ill-lit room with his father, off a narrow courtyard they share with three other families, along with a common bathroom and large sink. Anyone arriving or leaving carefully locks the outer door, made of thick iron bars.\n\nBriseño and his friend, Omar Barrera, 19, both spoke matter-of-factly about why it may be a death sentence for those who try to leave but are caught and sent back.\n\nOne friend fled a year and a half ago after he was threatened and gang members murdered his father, a policeman. Their friend was trying to reach his mother in Maryland, but he was stopped in Mexico and returned to San Salvador.\n\n\"He was murdered the week after he got back,\" Barrera said, shaking his head.\n\nOne mother tried desperately to help her three daughters escape the gangs in San Salvador, taking them on the journey herself.\n\n\"I don't want to go to the United States,\" she said. \"I don't speak English. I don't think we'll be welcome there.\" But she said she saw no alternative but to flee north.\n\nThe woman huddled with her daughters, 10, 16 and 19, on plastic seats at the Salvadoran government's crowded processing center for returned deportees in San Salvador. They had been caught in Mexico and sent back.\n\nTwice a week, the buses bring children there. Some are accompanied by their mothers; others, mostly teens, travel alone. No unaccompanied children younger than 12 are sent by bus, said Ana Solorzano, chief of the department of migrant needs at the center.\n\nThe mother begged that none of her family be named or photographed. As she explained why, she gripped her hands so fiercely her knuckles turned white.\n\nA few months ago, some members of the Calle 18 gang went to their house in San Salvador's Soyapango neighborhood looking for the girls. They ordered the mother to turn over the two oldest daughters to be the \"girlfriends\" of gang members.\n\nThat night, the mother fled with her daughters to another part of the city. The gang soon found them. They ran again, to a countryside village. But, like its main rival, MS-13, the Calle 18 gang has tentacles throughout the region. Again, the gang caught up with them.\n\n\"The authorities here did nothing to protect us,\" the mother said. \"Nothing.\"\n\nSo, they fled north into the pipeline to the United States.\n\n\"We had to go; I want to save my daughters' lives,\" the mother said.\n\nBut near Villahermosa, in southern Mexico, police stopped the bus they were on to check for documents. They were deported to El Salvador.\n\nWith almost no money left, the mother said, \"I don't know what we'll do. I don't know where we'll go. I have to save my daughters, but I don't know what to do.\"\n\nAll children who arrive in the United States illegally without a guardian are categorized as unaccompanied minors by Customs and Border Protection. But most children don't enter the pipeline alone, especially the younger ones.\n\nThere has been a steady stream of mothers and their children making the trip, like the ones caught in Texas and then dropped off by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at bus stations in Arizona because of a lack of detention space. Other children are accompanied at least part of the way by an older family member.\n\nBrayan, the 14-year-old from Honduras, traveled for a while with his 25-year-old brother, Grebil.\n\nSome families with at least modest means entrust their children to total strangers — the human smugglers called coyotes or polleros.\n\nLevi Manases Miranda Peña is a 16-year-old who left El Salvador on June 5. His friends call him Guero because of his fair skin and light-brown hair. He is from Tonacatepeque, a small city about 12 miles northeast of San Salvador.\n\nHis mother owns a small restaurant and store that sells clothing and stuffed tortillas called pupusas. She contracted with a smuggler to guide him all the way to Omaha, Neb., where his 17-year-old sister, Linda, lives. Once in Omaha, Levi hoped to continue school, something he couldn't do in El Salvador because of threats from gangs.\n\nHe said he didn't know how much his mother paid the smuggler. His sister confirmed that her mother borrowed $7,000 to pay a smuggler for her trip to the United States.\n\nLevi (pronounced LEH-vee) said his grandmother accompanied him on a 70-mile bus ride from Tonacatepeque to Ahuachapan, a city near the border of Guatemala. In his backpack, Levi carried two pairs of pants, three shirts, three pairs of socks. In his pocket, he carried $150, about what many factory workers in El Salvador earn in a month.\n\nFor good luck, he wore bracelets on both wrists given to him by his friends before he left El Salvador. One said \"Peace\" in English.\n\nHis mother arranged for Levi to meet the smuggler at the bus terminal in Ahuachapan. Levi had never met this person. His mother instructed him to look for a short man about 35 years old with straight black hair wearing a red shirt, gray pants and black shoes.\n\nLevi said he was scared, but in El Salvador, \"my life was already in danger.\"\n\n\"It's very dangerous in my country,\" he added. \"You can't even go to the store without being afraid of being robbed or killed.\"\n\nLevi rode in a bus with the smuggler to Guatemala City, where they were joined by five more teenagers from El Salvador heading to the United States. Along the route, the smugglers changed guides often, handing off the group of boys from one smuggler to the next in different cities.\n\nBrayan and his brother traveled by bus, too, out of Honduras, then through Guatemala, where the pipeline funneled them to the same place it carries many of the migrants from Central America headed for the United States — to the Suchiate River in Tecun Uman, Guatemala, on the border with Mexico.\n\nOne night in June, 16-year-old Jairo Garniga and six other boys — three from Honduras, and Jairo and three others from a coastal town in southern Guatemala — arrived in Tecun Uman long after dark. The doors of the migrants' shelter had shut for the night.\n\nThey lacked money for even the seediest of hotels in the crime-ridden border town. So instead, they stretched out for the night with several other migrants in front of the doorway of the Catholic church.\n\n\"It seemed safer than just sleeping in the street,\" Jairo said. They had risen just after dawn and waited beneath a towering lapacho tree until the Casa de Migrantes shelter opened. After a breakfast of rice, beans and bananas, Jairo and several other boys chatted while looking at a map posted on one wall, showing the dangers— river currents, deserts, bandits, kidnappers, towns hostile to migrants — along various routes north.\n\nThey couldn't afford to travel by bus, said Jose Hernandez, a 28-year-old neighbor guiding Jairo and another boy. So, they would hop a freight train known as \"La Bestia\" (the Beast) and take it up the Gulf coast and north to Texas' Rio Grande Valley. Riders sit atop freight cars, clinging for their lives to the metal roofs.\n\n\"The train is riskier, but you don't have to have so much money. So, we'll go by train,\" Hernandez said. \"They told us about the dangers. ... We'll go slowly.\"\n\nThey know — having met a man at this shelter who lost one foot this way — that gangs extort money from riders and throw those who don't pay off the moving train. The migrants hope to find work and earn money along the journey, which can take days or even months — if they stop and work along the way.\n\nJairo listened and grinned. His mother told him she was worried about the risks.\n\n\"My mother wouldn't have let me go alone. And I didn't want to,\" he said.\n\nThin and small for his age, Jairo didn't seem fazed by the two days he'd spent roughing it since leaving home. Like several other youths at the shelter, he was traveling with next to no money and only the clothes on his back. Unlike most, he had no family waiting for him in the United States.\n\n\"I'm not sure where I'm going in the U.S., or how we'll get there,\" he said. \"I hope God will help me along the way. I'll do whatever work there is. I just want to work.\"\n\nThe Casa de Migrantes is one of a string of shelters along the routes north through Guatemala and Mexico run by the Roman Catholic Scalabrini order.\n\nFather Ademar Barilli, who founded the shelter 19 years ago, has spoken with many of the 135,000 migrants who have passed through its doors over that time. He said he has seen a jump in minors staying at the shelter: up to 123 in May and June from 47 for those two months a year earlier.\n\nBarilli said the closing of many parts of the U.S. border and tougher enforcement have pushed migrants into the arms of the Mexican drug cartels.\n\nFour or five years ago, he said, many coyotes were respected figures in their own communities. They would accompany migrants all the way from Central America to the United States. But those coyotes have been pushed out of business, he said, as new border fences have forced migrants onto cartel smuggling routes.\n\n\"The drug traffickers saw another source of income,\" Barilli said. \"They organized themselves. And now, the coyotes have to have ties to the cartels, and these organized groups see the migrants as a milk cow.\"\n\nAfter a night in the shelter, Jairo, several other teens, and Jose Hernandez left the next morning to cross the Suchiate River.\n\nThe southern bank of the river, wider and faster than the Rio Grande, lies less than 100 yards from the shelter. Sturdy men on homemade rafts, crafted of wooden planks lashed to massive inner tubes taken from tractor-sized tires, called out for passengers.\n\nNot all the crossers are undocumented. Many townspeople cross into Mexico to shop, and rafts ferry black-market goods south. Passage costs the equivalent of just over a dollar. A wide bridge, the legal crossing point, can be seen less than half a mile downstream.\n\nAt small stands, vendors sell iced drinks, corn and snacks. Coyotes wait by the main road. A pedicab pulled up, and a mother and three children, all in neat, clean clothes, with large handbags, were met by a coyote.\n\nHe walked them to the river and settled them on a raft, then called on his cellphone to a counterpart on the other side. His associate waved in acknowledgment, and the raftsman started to pole upstream, to the point from which he would let the current carry them across.\n\nMeanwhile, Jairo and the others boarded another raft.\n\nJose Hernandez, the neighbor, asked the raftsman whether they needed to watch for Mexican authorities on the other side.\n\n\"No,\" the man said, \"not this early.\" It's about 7 a.m.\n\nWithin minutes, they were in Mexico, with the most treacherous section of the pipeline still ahead. Jairo waved at the reporters and turned north with his companions, hiking out of sight, the last contact The Republic had with him.\n\nBrayan, the 14-year-old from Honduras, and his brother decided not to pay the fee to cross the Suchiate. They swam to the other side at midnight.\n\nBut after a dispute over money, the two separated on the Mexican side of the river in Hidalgo, Chiapas state.\n\nSo, Brayan set out alone.\n\nHe begged for money and food. He asked people which buses to take. He slept on the street.\n\n\"Do you have a job for me? Because I need something to eat. I am from Honduras,\" he would say.\n\nOn the way to hop the freight train in Arriaga, a city in Chiapas state just north of the Guatemalan border, Brayan said he fell asleep near a railroad terminal in the city of Tonalá.\n\nA hard slap on the back startled him awake. Men in Mexican immigration uniforms asked him where he was from. After telling them he was from Honduras, Brayan said the men threatened to send him back to Honduras unless he paid them money. Brayan handed over all he had: 200 pesos and 70 lempira, or about $18.\n\nLevi said he and the other migrants from El Salvador had a similar experience with Mexican authorities after crossing the border from Guatemala by bus.\n\nIn Mexico, he said, men in federal police uniforms stopped their bus. The men climbed aboard and asked each passenger where he or she was from. Passengers from other countries were allowed to continue only if they handed over 400 pesos, about $30.\n\n\"If you don't give them the money, they don't let you go,\" Levi said.\n\nLevi and the other minors from El Salvador arrived in Reynosa before dawn on June 12. The city of 600,000 in Mexico is located on the border with Texas. For Levi and many other Central American migrants, Reynosa is the last stop on the pipeline before trying to cross the Rio Grande into the United States. A smuggler was waiting for them at the bus terminal in a minivan to drive the group to the Rio Grande so they could cross while it was still dark.\n\nBut they never made it. On the way to the river, Mexican federal police intercepted the van and arrested the coyote.\n\nLevi remembers looking out the window of the smuggler's van and seeing a \"mysterious\" white pickup race up. He saw the windows roll down and pistols pop out. The men in the pickup, apparently part of the smuggling organization, \"started firing bullets everywhere,\" he said.\n\nLevi and the other migrants threw themselves on the floor of the van until the shooting stopped. The federal police didn't fire back, he said. In the end, no one was hit.\n\n\"I felt an incredible fear, a terrible fear,\" Levi said.\n\nThe federal police turned Levi and the other boys over to Mexican immigration authorities. After they were processed, the boys were taken to Centro de Atencion a Menores Fronterizos, a government holding shelter in Reynosa for undocumented minors caught near the border.\n\nBrayan also ended up in a shelter near Reynosa.\n\nBrayan's luck seemed to change after the men who identified themselves as immigration officials took his money. He met a truck driver and his wife who were hauling mangoes, pineapples and other fruit from southern Mexico to the north. He called them Don Macario and Doña Maria.\n\nThe couple offered to give Brayan a lift in their tractor-trailer rig 1,000 miles from Tonalá, Chiapas, all the way to Reynosa. Along the way, they passed through several immigration checkpoints. Each time, the truck driver told the immigration officials that Brayan was their son. The couple let Brayan stay at their house in Reynosa for a month.\n\nBrayan had no money to pay smugglers to take him across the river, so the truck driver took Brayan to the Senda de Vida (Path of Life), a migrant shelter run by a Christian pastor in Reynosa. The shelter has three dormitories, one for women with children, one for men, and one for elderly men and people with disabilities. Brayan slept in the one for the elderly.\n\nFor Levi and Brayan, the end of the pipeline was now a mere 100 yards away, across the Rio Grande into the United States, where they had planned to turn themselves in to la migra.\n\nBut it might as well still have been 1,000 miles away.\n\nReynosa is one of the most dangerous cities in Mexico.\n\nFor more than four years, two rival drug-trafficking organizations, the Gulf cartel and their former enforcers, the Zetas, have waged pitched gunbattles in the streets with each other and with Mexican law-enforcement authorities.\n\nHundreds of people have been killed, and thousands have fled the city.\n\nGunbattles still happen regularly, though not as frequently as the past. Federal police patrol the streets in pickups mounted with machine guns.\n\nOn June 19, at Centro de Atencion a Menores Fronterizos, the government shelter in Reynosa, eight teenage boys sat cross-legged in the shade of a peach tree.\n\nAll were from either Honduras or El Salvador. One by one, they named cities and states in the United States. The names mean nothing to them. They have never been to the United States. They know nothing about these places. They are just the names of places given to them by relatives they were trying to reach in the U.S. before they were caught.\n\nOne has a mother in Virginia.\n\nAnother a brother in Miami.\n\nAnother a mother in Boston.\n\nAnother a brother in Atlanta.\n\nBut before they could cross the border, they were intercepted by immigration authorities, not in the U.S. but in Mexico.\n\nFor now, their journey through the pipeline to reach their U.S. destinations has been halted.\n\nThe teens spend their days waiting to be deported to their countries of origin. On this particular day, there were 15 minors from Central America being held at the shelter: 12 teenage boys and three teenage girls.\n\nThe boys are kept segregated from the girls. They are allowed to sit outside in the shelter's courtyard for an hour or two each day. The rest of the time they are locked up in cell-like dormitories with bars on the doors. They sleep on dirty mattresses thrown on the floor, with nothing to do except watch a small TV sitting on top of a dresser.\n\nAfter traveling more than 1,400 miles for days and sometimes weeks, they give the same answer about what they will do when they are sent back: Turn around and try again.\n\nAll except one.\n\nAt first, Levi thought he would try to come back to the U.S. once deported back to El Salvador. But after spending several days at the shelter, he wasn't so sure. Despite the dangers in his home country, he said, he wouldn't want to leave his mother alone again. And he wouldn't want to repeat the ordeal of being smuggled.\n\n\"I have been thinking a lot all these days that I have been here at the shelter,\" he said. \"I don't want to have to suffer through everything I have already suffered. I don't want to go through everything I have already gone through and what I am still going through.\"\n\nOn June 26, Levi was sent back to El Salvador. His sister, Linda in Omaha, said he is back home living with their mother. But he is afraid to go outside for fear he could be attacked by the gangs, she said.\n\nOver at the Senda de Vida shelter, Brayan remained in limbo as of July 11. The shelter sits on land on the edge of Reynosa overlooking the greenish waters of the Rio Grande. By climbing up a small hill in the back, Brayan can see the United States on the other side.\n\nSmugglers want 1,000 pesos, about $76, to ferry him across the river in a raft. But he was out of money, and he had no idea how he would come up with the smuggling fee.\n\nTrying to cross the cartel-controlled waters alone is too risky.\n\nSo, he waited, hoping that his pipeline dream hasn't ended.\n\nAt the end of the pipeline, on a Saturday in June in southern Texas, two young boys walked up a gravel road from the Rio Grande a mile to the south.They were among the hundreds of migrants from Central America streaming across the Rio Grande daily.\n\nOne boy appeared to be about 9 or 10, the other 12 or 13. The younger one carried a jacket thrown over his right shoulder. There were no adults in sight. Just two boys walking up a road by themselves in the middle of a vast wildlife refuge on the U.S.-Mexican border.\n\nThis is an area where armor-plated gunboats operated by the Texas Highway Patrol cruise up and down the Rio Grande, keeping a lookout for drug traffickers and human smugglers.\n\nSmuggling trails snake down the banks on the Mexican side and come up on the Texas side of the river. Hiding in the brush or high up in houses on stilts, los mañosos — thugs — working for the criminal organizations that control these waters on the Mexican side keep watch for the Border Patrol.\n\nBut at this time of the morning, the wildlife refuge was quiet except for birds chirping and the wind rushing through the thick brush. Up above to the east, there was hardly any traffic on the Anzalduas International Bridge connecting McAllen, Texas, and Reynosa, Mexico.\n\nThe boys looked down at the ground as they trekked up the road, glancing up occasionally to scan the horizon. When they reached the top of a levee where two gravel roads meet, they stopped and crouched on their haunches. They reached the spot where they had been told to wait.\n\nSoon, they saw a Border Patrol van in the distance racing toward them on top of one of the levees. An agent climbed out of the van and walked up to the boys, a radio clipped to his belt. Only the older boy stood up.\n\n\"Where are you from?\" the Border Patrol agent asked.\n\n\"Honduras,\" the older boy replied.\n\nThe agent opened one of the van's side doors, and the two boys climbed inside. They had made it to the United States and turned themselves in to the Border Patrol, the same way thousands of migrants from Central America have.\n\nThe pipeline worked for them.\n\nBut many questions remain.\n\nWhat will happen to the boys?\n\nWill they be reunited with their families in the U.S.?\n\nWill they be allowed to stay?\n\nWill they be sent home?\n\nAnd how many more are coming?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/07/10"}]}

He went to add that Murdaugh was not covered in blood or biological material, no murder weapons were found, and there was no proof that he disposed of the weapons.\n\nHe added that the \"mere presence\" at a crime scene was not enough to assume guilt by the standards of law.\n\n\"The State has proven at most that he (Alex Murdaugh) was at the kennels at 8:44 p.m.,\" said Griffin, \"And he either misstated the time or lied.\" He added that that State had \"contrived\" a cell phone timeline that offers no real evidence of guilt.\n\nBut Judge Clifton Newman disagreed, saying that the court and S.C. law makes no distinction between direct evidence and circumstantial evidence, and cases can be proven by both.\n\n\"Their is evidence to derive at a guilty verdict, if the jury agrees,\" added Newman.\n\nPossible new drug abuse motive, circumstances revealed\n\nNew evidence was introduced Friday that brings a possible new motive, or at least contributing circumstances, to the State's case for murder against Murdaugh.\n\nThe State entered into evidence a copy of a May 6, 2021, text message from Paul to Alex Murdaugh stating that \"We have to talk... Mom found several bags of pills in your computer bag.\"\n\nProsecutors also entered into evidence computer spreadsheets that reveal that, on the same day, Maggie had been using Safari to search online to identify those pills.\n\nDuring previous testimony, Maggie's sister, Marion Proctor, testified that Maggie often referred to Paul as her \"Little Detective\" because, if Murdaugh had illegal pills around the house, the son would find them.\n\nDuring a taped conversation with SLED, which was entered into evidence on Thursday, Murdaugh said that when he was going through drug withdrawals he would do just about anything to get drugs.\n\nProsecutors tighten grip on Murdaugh's inconsistencies with cell phone timeline\n\nAfter introducing vehicle GPS data, the State introduced a comprehensive timeline of data from the night of the killings taken from several cell phones, vehicle data from General Motors and OnStar, and other sources which reinforces previous claims that Murdaugh lied to authorities and points out new inconsistencies in his statements to 911 and police.\n\nThe data primarily reveals that Murdaugh's phone showed no activity for most of the evening of the killings (indicating it may have been turned off), several entries from his call log had been deleted from his phone but showed up on other phones, and suggested that he called 911 so quickly after finding the bodies that he would not have had time to check the victims for a pulse, as he told 911.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\nMurdaugh's phone showed no activity between 6:52 p.m. and 9:04 p.m. on June 7, 2021.\n\nSeveral entries in Murdaugh's call logs showed up on Paul and Maggie's phones, but not on Alex's phone data.\n\nPaul's Snapchat video showing Murdaugh wearing different clothes that what police saw was taken at 7:39 p.m. and uploaded at 7:56 p.m.\n\nA video was taken at 8:44:55 on Paul's cell phone with three voices in the background; multiple witnesses have identified Murdaugh's voice as one of them. Murdaugh, on multiple occasions, told authorities that he did not go to the kennels after dinner, but the video places him there. \"The defendant repeatedly denied that he was ever at the kennels before their phones go silent forever?\" asked lead prosecutor Creighton Waters.\n\nThe last time Paul, a frequent cell phone user, ever unlocked his phone was between 8:48:58 p.m. and 8:49:01 p.m.; Maggie's phone was locked \"forever\" at 8:49:28 p.m. Police think they were killed between 8:50 p.m. and 9:06 p.m., when Murdaugh's vehicle was cranked.\n\nBetween 9:02 and 9:06 p.m., Murdaugh's phone data indicates that he took 283 \"steps,\", or roughly 70.75 steps per minutes. It was the highest rate and number of steps he had taken all afternoon. \"He was a busy guy right there, wasn't he?\" Waters asked Special Agent Rudofski.\n\nMurdaugh's vehicle cranks at 9:06 p.m. and begins leaving at 9:07 p.m., returning straight to the residence at roughly 10 p.m. He arrives at the crime scene, the kennels, at 10:05:07, then calls 911 at 10:06:14 p.m. This is less than 20 seconds later, which calls into question his claim to 911 and police that he attempted to turn over and check both bodies for a pulse. He also had no blood on his hands when found, previous testimony noted.\n\nWhen that 20-second inconsistency was discussed in court, Murdaugh appeared to sneer at the SLED agent, then looked away and then down while sitting at the defendant's table.\n\nTimeline reveals Murdaugh's high-speed drive on the night of murders\n\nA SLED condensed timeline just entered into evidence revealing where Murdaugh drove on the night of the murders, at what time, and at what speed.\n\nSLED forensics agent Peter Rudofski took the stand Friday morning and presented a timeline and GPS maps taken from the recently acquired General Motors data from Murdaugh's 2021 Chevy Suburban, which he drove on the night of the murders. Here are the highlights of that June 7, 2021, timeline:\n\nMurdaugh had previously told police he had rode around the property with Paul for two hours before dinner, but the timeline shows he didn't leave work until 6:24 p.m.\n\nMurdaugh left Moselle at 9:07:36 p.m. to drive to Almeda, reportedly to visit his ailing mother, according to his court-filed alibi. Police believe that Paul and Maggie were gunned down sometime between 8:50 p.m. and 9:06 p.m,, which is when Murdaugh's vehicle was cranked, according to previous evidence.\n\nMurdaugh is driving roughly 42 miles per hour at the location where Maggie's phone was found by police, then quickly accelerates after that point.\n\nMurdaugh's vehicle arrives at Almeda at 9:22:06 p.m.\n\nMurdaugh's maximum speed during that portion of the drive was 74.4 mph, and his average speed was 51.94 mph - much higher than his averages speeds for all other trips that day.\n\nMurdaugh's first stop once arriving at Almeda was at the rear of the property, behind his parents' home, near the wood line and some outbuildings. Investigators now apparently believe that he could have disposed of murder weapons and evidence there.\n\nThe Suburban leaves Almeda at roughly 9:43, which means Murdaugh was there roughly 20 minutes. He had previously told SLED investigators that he was there \"45 minutes to an hour\" and, according to previous testimony, even appeared to ask a witness to tell police the same answer if questioned.\n\nMurdaugh arrived back at Moselle at 10 p.m. His maximum speed on the return route was 80.16 mph and his average speed was 46.52, which included a one-minute pause in the driveway at Almeda.\n\nMurdaugh went to the residence first, then left for the kennels at 10:05:06.\n\nHe arrived at the kennels at 10:05:57, then called 911 at 10:06:11.\n\nAt 10:11:54, Murdaugh heads back to the house to get a shotgun for \"protection,\" he tells 911. He returns to the kennels at 10:14 p.m.\n\nMurdaugh attorney Dick Harpootlian badgers witness, SLED agent Ryan Kelly\n\nDay 20 began with cross examination of SLED Senior Special Agent Ryan Kelly by Murdaugh attorney Richard Harpootlian. Kelly testified Thursday afternoon about the Sept. 4, 2021, roadside suicide plot involving Murdaugh.\n\nUpon cross examination, Harpootlian focused much of his early questioning on Murdaugh's head injury received during the shooting, and the notion that Murdaugh had \"cooperated\" with SLED investigators, then appeared to badger the witness. At one point, he told Kelly, \"we are having a hard time communicating.\" Later, he asked, \"Are you telling me SLED can't locate a phone?\"\n\nAt one point, Judge Clifton Newman interrupted, scolding Harpootlian for not giving the witness time to answer the questions.\n\nHarpootlian also suggested that, when Murdaugh gave SLED agent Kelly a recorded conversation that included several confessions, that he might not have been of sound mind and competent. This was in spite of the fact that Murdaugh was in the presence of two of his attorneys, and when asked if he was of \"sound mind\" and competent, said yes.\n\nTuesday brings emotional testimony from Maggie Murdaugh's family\n\nOn Tuesday, family members of slain mother Maggie Murdaugh gave emotional and revealing testimony in the Richard “Alex” Murdaugh double murder trial.\n\nThis is a continuation from the start of week four of the double murder trial, when the state started Monday morning session off with scientific DNA testimony, followed by graphic and chilling testimony from the forensic pathologist who autopsied the bodies of Maggie and Paul Murduagh.\n\nGreenville News and USA Today are streaming live from inside the Colleton County Courthouse. Coverage since day one of the Murdaugh saga can be found here.\n\nWhat is Alex Murdaugh accused of?\n\nBesides facing murder charges in the deaths of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh, the former attorney faces more than 100 other criminal charges ranging from murder to tax evasion.

His work has earned indictments on more than 100 suspects following investigations into drug operations in the state prison system.\n\nHe also worked with other prosecutors on major white-collar cases that ranged from the misconduct allegations against former S.C. Speaker of the House Bobby Harrell of Charleston to the $9 billion V.C. Summer nuclear project criminal conspiracy.\n\nBut since 2019, Waters’ primary focus has been on unraveling Murdaugh’s alleged web of financial and drug-related crimes, and leveling indictment after indictment against the disbarred attorney and several of his alleged accomplices, including former Hampton banker Russell Laffitte.\n\nIn December 2022, the AG's Office announced that it would be seeking life without parole if Murdaugh is convicted.\n\nWaters and his prosecutorial team will be facing an equally talented and experienced criminal defense team led by Columbia attorneys Richard Harpootlian and Jim Griffin.\n\nMore revealed:New documents reveal more about the Alex Murdaugh murder and Russell Laffitte fraud cases\n\nNot seeking the death penalty:Alex Murdaugh murder trial: SC AG Wilson seeks life without parole, not death penalty\n\nRichard Harpootlian: A celebrity attorney with dual experience\n\nRichard “Dick” Harpootlian has more than 30 years of trial experience on both sides of the courtroom - as a prosecutor, defense attorney, and civil litigator, states his bio at Harpootlian Law.\n\nHarpootlian began his career as a prosecutor, deputy solicitor, and solicitor in the Fifth Circuit Solicitor’s Office. As the Fifth Circuit’s chief homicide prosecutor, he prosecuted hundreds of murder cases, including 12 death penalty cases, and defended one of those convictions on appeal before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1983, Harpootlian earned a death-row conviction in the prosecution of Donald “Pee Wee” Gaskins — South Carolina’s most notorious serial killer.\n\nIn 1990, Harpootlian was elected as Fifth Circuit Solicitor, where he personally prosecuted and obtained convictions in a number of high-profile murder, drug and public corruption cases. In 1991, he prosecuted and convicted ex-University of South Carolina President Jim Holderman on public corruption charges.\n\nOn the civil side of the law, Harpootlian’s private practice has earned him state and national recognition for his efforts on behalf of civil litigants and criminal defendants, including a number of multimillion-dollar verdicts and settlements.\n\nHarpootlian earned celebrity status as an attorney long before the Murdaugh case. He has appeared on 60 Minutes, Good Morning America, ABC Nightly News, NBC Nightly News, Dateline NBC, and various CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, and Fox News broadcasts. He is also frequently quoted in local, state, and national publications, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, the Los Angeles Times, and TIME Magazine.\n\nHarpootlian has also been active in South Carolina politics, serving on the Richland County Council, as Chairman of the S.C. Democratic Party, and most recently as state senator.\n\nHarpootlian is a former chair of the Criminal Law Section of the South Carolina Bar Association and a past member of the S.C. Bar Board of Grievance and Discipline, and is an adjunct professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law.\n\nJim Griffin has experience defending fraud, corruption cases\n\nAccording to the Griffin Davis Law website, Jim Griffin is an accomplished trial lawyer and healthcare attorney with more than 30 years of experience representing clients in civil and criminal courts at both the federal and state level.\n\nIn his criminal practice, Griffin has been the lead trial counsel in a number of cases featured in national and state news publications, magazines and television programs — including one major, televised acquittal — and he has also obtained multi-million-dollar verdicts and settlements for clients in several civil cases.\n\nHe has extensive experience representing clients charged with federal crimes, such as mail and wire fraud, healthcare fraud, mortgage and securities fraud, public corruption, government contractor and procurement fraud, and criminal tax charges.\n\nIn his healthcare practice, Griffin has been at the “forefront of legal challenges facing healthcare providers,” stated his firm’s website. He has also represented physicians and other healthcare professionals who are under investigation by federal and state authorities.\n\nIn 2018, Griffin was honored by the S.C. Chapter of the American Board of Trial Advocates as the “Trial Lawyer of the Year.” He is currently listed as a Premier Healthcare Attorney and “South Carolina Super Lawyers” has recognized him for five straight years for his work in the area of civil defense.\n\nDig deeper:Convicted Hampton banker, alleged Murdaugh accomplice requests new trial after jury controversy\n\nAdditional indictments:Alex Murdaugh indicted on SC tax evasion charges, now has more than 100 criminal charges\n\nWho will decide justice in the Murdaugh murder case?\n\nThis all-star legal lineup is sure to present compelling arguments and evidence on both sides of the courtroom, but, before the trial begins, and after closing arguments, it will be up to the judge and jury to make some important decisions.\n\nS.C. Circuit Court Judge Clifton Newman (Kingstree) is presiding over the case and will have some crucial pretrial motions to consider. Among the most important decisions he will make will concern whether or not state prosecutors can use evidence of Murdaugh's many alleged financial crimes as evidence of motive in the murder case.\n\nUltimately, the final verdict will be in the hands of 12 Colleton County residents. Colleton County Clerk of Court Rebecca Hill said that her office mailed out 900 jury summons notices just before the Christmas holiday, and jury questionnaires have been prepared to help begin the selection process.\n\nJury selection is expected to begin at the Colleton County Courthouse on Jan. 23 and last roughly two days, and the trial is scheduled to last until roughly Feb. 10. Trial dates have not been scheduled for Murdaugh's other alleged crimes.\n\nMeanwhile, Murdaugh remains jailed in the Alvin S.

Murdaugh has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAfter the shootings in June 2021, police launched investigations into two other deaths connected to Murdaugh and alleged criminal acts dating back more than a decade.\n\nHere are the details of the case:\n\nAlex Murdaugh trial:Catch up on everything from the beginning.\n\nMurdaugh takes the stand:Former South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh testifies in own defense in murder trial\n\nAlex Murdaugh sentenced to life in prison, autopsy photos leaked from courtroom\n\nIn a dramatic end to one of the nation's most sensational true crime cases, disgraced attorney Richard “Alex” Murdaugh was sentenced to life in prison Friday for the murder of his wife and son.\n\nAfter a six week trial and just three hours of deliberation, jurors found Murdaugh guilty of the gruesome killings, marking the end of a powerful South Carolina family legal dynasty.\n\nMurdaugh continued to proclaim his innocence before Judge Clifton Newman issued his sentence, an assertion the judge told him was simply not believable. “It might not have been you,\" Newman said, \"it might have been the monster you've become.\"\n\nAfter the sentencing, the judged said a complaint had been made about autopsy photos from the case being leaked. It appeared, he said, that the photos were taken in the courtroom well where staff, lawyers and the jury work, not from the audience. He invited law enforcement to investigate the matter.\n\nJury receives instruction from the judge, moves to deliberate on verdict\n\n“You have heard the testimony, received the evidence and heard the argument of the state and the defendant,” Judge Clifton Newman told the jury Thursday afternoon before sending the jury out to deliberate. Newman told the jurors they were “finders of the facts,” and reminded them that the defendant is to be given the benefit of any reasonable doubt.\n\nThe judge also told jurors evidence of other crimes committed by Murdaugh may be considered only in relation to the motive for the crime and not as the basis of a moral judgement.\n\nEach of the four indictments — two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime — will require its own verdict from the jury. Newman reminded the jury it should limit outside influence and only consider evidence and testimony presented at trial.\n\nJohn Meadors wraps up the trial with a dramatic rebuttal for the prosecution\n\nIn prosecutors' final address to the jury, John Meadors said, “This is a commonsense case,” and told them they'd been preparing to make this ruling their whole lives.\n\nDuring his emotional rebuttal the defense's closing argument, Meadors told a story about the children’s book ‘The Velveteen Rabbit.’ His mother gifted him a copy with the inscription, \"always be real,\" a theme of the book.\n\nThroughout his rebuttal Meadors returned to that metaphor, saying the prosecution presented real, hard facts. Murdaugh was never real, Meadors said, he was a habitual liar.\n\nMeadors described the case as being as clear cut as an episode of Columbo, though admitted that the jury was probably too young to understand the reference.\n\nMurdaugh might have loved Paul and Maggie, Meadors conceded, but he loved himself more than anything, and that drove him to do the unspeakable.\n\nJim Griffin paints prosecution’s theory on motive as divorced from reality, not matching defendant’s character\n\n“Totally illogical, irrational, and insane” are the words Griffin used to describe the prosecution’s assertion that Murdaugh killed his loved ones to escape his own criminal misconduct.\n\nThat’s just not what people do, Griffin said. He pointed instead to Murdaugh’s failed suicide plot as a more likely reaction of a person who was running out of options.\n\nThe prosecution, Griffin said, wanted to win at all costs, and had been caught up in media attention to the case they developed a shoddy motive.\n\nGriffin argued that the prosecution's evidence was merely circumstantial and does no conclusively prove Murdaugh’s guilt. There is no reason he would have committed this crime, no answer to the ‘Why?’ he said.\n\n“There are two words that justice demands in this case, and those words are not guilty,” Griffin said near tears, asking the jury not to compound the tragedy the Murdaugh family has endured\n\nJim Griffin begins closing arguments for defense, juror ousted for discussing the case\n\nJust before attorney Jim Griffin began his closing arguments for the defense Thursday morning Judge Clifton Newman announced one of the 12 jurors was removed for discussing the case with at least three other people, which is strictly prohibited.\n\nThe juror was replaced with an alternates “in order to preserve the integrity of the process,” Newman said. Lead prosecutor Creighton Waters did not object to the move but described the process as “muddled” — drawing attention to the fact that the interviews conducted to determine the whether the juror had violated court rules were carried out by SLED agents, an agency, he asserted, had already had their credibility questioned throughout the trial.\n\nState concludes closings, frames Murdaugh as man with no way out\n\nIn his sweeping closing argument, Waters said Murdaugh was a man who relied on his family name to bring him immunity and privilege. As his father Randolph was dying, with his son was facing criminal charges for the boat case, Murdaugh was facing civil charges that would unravel his financial crimes and became desperate.\n\n“He’s the kind of person for which shame is an extraordinary provocation,” Waters said, and when his ego couldn’t stand it anymore he became a “family annihilator.”\n\nDozens of witnesses took the stand over the past few weeks Waters noted, but two were notably absent: common sense and human nature. Waters insisted that while the two concepts can't take the stand they should speak on behalf of Maggie and Paul.\n\nHe lied to everyone close to him, and he’s good at it Waters cautioned the jury. He fooled everyone who thought they were close to him, including Maggie and Paul, and they paid for it with their lives. Don’t let him fool you too, Waters wrapped up, asking the jury to return a guilty verdict.\n\nState focuses on Murdaugh's lies\n\nClosing arguments for the state resumed after lunch with attorney Creighton Waters taking the jury through a detailed timeline of the night of the murders.\n\nUsing cell phone data, Waters placed Murdaugh at the scene of the crime “just minutes before” the murders occurred. Why, Waters asked, would he lie about his whereabouts and the last time he saw his wife and son so quickly after their death?\n\n“It doesn’t make sense ladies and gentleman,” Waters said. Murdaugh, he alleged, merely fabricated a new story to match the facts of the case once they were presented in court.\n\nAt one point Waters walked to a courtroom door and reenacted the shooting, describing what Maggie must have felt \"running to her baby\" never imagining it was her husband who pulled the trigger.\n\n‘We know how powerful opiates can be’ State casts doubt on Murdaugh’s drug use\n\nAfter a detailed review of the ‘hamster wheel’ of Alex Murdaugh’s cycle of spending and stealing, Waters moved to his drug use.\n\nWhile testifying on his own behalf, Murdaugh claimed he was taking 1000 milligrams of opioid painkillers a day. Waters cast doubt on that assertion, arguing Murdaugh could never have kept up his lifestyle \"if he was taking that much dope.\"\n\nMurdaugh said he lied to law enforcement officers the night of the murder because of drug-induced paranoia. But Waters downplayed the severity of the drug problem, noting that the cover-up he pulled off after the murders could not have been orchestrated by someone in such a drug-induced state.\n\nCreighton Waters begins closing arguments for the state\n\nAfter the jury’s trip to the crime scene Wednesday morning, closing statements began in the trial of Alex Murdaugh on charges he murdered his wife and son.\n\nThe state began, with lead prosecutor Creighton Waters arguing there was only one person with the motive, opportunity and means to commit the crime - and that person was Alex Murdaugh.\n\nWaters painted Murdaugh as a man of great privilege who became so dependent his high-dollar lifestyle began to steal by “talking fast” to family members and legal clients.\n\nWaters described missing legal fees, a 2019 boat crash which killed Mallory Beach, and a wrongful death settlement for former his former housekeeper closing in on Murdaugh.\n\nWith his finances falling apart, Murdaugh was without options, Waters said, and he did what he's always done when accountability comes knocking - he made himself a victim.\n\nWaters seemed intent on separating Murdaugh from everyday people, highlighting his wealth and prominence in the community and characterizing his crimes as a story never before seen.\n\n“The pressures on this man were unbearable and they were all reaching a crescendo the day his wife and son were murdered by him” Waters argued.\n\nState rests after rebuttal, jury adjourns\n\nAfter exhaustive testimony from forensics expert Dr. Kenneth Kinsey, the state rested its rebuttal.\n\nWith no more witnesses to call, both sides will make their closing arguments after an expected visit to the crime scene by the jury. Deliberations may begin by the week's end.\n\nMark Ball, Alex Murdaugh’s former law partner, takes the stand again\n\nMark Ball, one of Murdaugh’s former law partners, took the stand early Tuesday afternoon to go over previous testimony he shared as a witness for the prosecution.\n\nBall characterized Murdaugh’s relationships with law enforcement as healthy, casting doubt on previous claims by the defendant that he had a deep distrust of SLED and that was why he lied in an interview conducted the night of the murders.\n\nDuring cross-examination, defense team lawyer Jim Griffin pinpointed a number of events which would have prompted a distrust of SLED — a criminal prosecution of Murdaugh’s close friend Greg Alexander, and a case involving Paul Murdaugh’s 2019 boat crash, both of which involved SLED.\n\nDuring cross examination, Ball was also asked about Murdaugh’s disposition; he has been emotional on the witness stand. Ball confirmed Murdaugh was a generally emotional person, agreeing with Griffine that there had been other occasions when the defendant had become emotional.\n\nMurdaugh’s defense team rests, prosecution to call only 5 rebuttal witnesses\n\nMurdaugh’s defense team rested Monday afternoon, following two days of blockbuster testimony from the defendant himself – Alex Murdaugh.\n\nThe prosecution on Tuesday called rebuttal witnesses. The state plans to call five witnesses, including Colleton County Coroner Richard Harvey and Murdaugh’s former law partners Ronnie Crosby and Mark Ball.\n\nCreighton Waters, the lead prosecutor on the case indicated the rebuttal will be done by Tuesday afternoon. After that the jury is expected to visit the crime scene at Moselle – the Murdaugh property where Paul and Maggie were shot. Closing arguments could begin as early as Thursday and are expected to take a full day before the case goes to the jury for deliberation.\n\nProsecutor paints Murdaugh as a self-made martyr, moves the trial to a character debate\n\nProsecutor Creighton Waters widened the scope of cross-examination late Friday afternoon, moving to broader questions about Murdaugh's character.\n\nWaters has made sweeping statements about Murdaugh’s character, evidently aiming to poke holes in Murdaugh’s projected image of a grief-stricken defendant. Throughout his time on the stand Murdaugh has remained fairly even-headed, obfuscating direct attacks on his character and expressing remorse over previous crimes.\n\nWaters has been dogged in his attempts to puncture that image and to convince the jury that the defendant’s attitude is an act — that he is a man of great privilege and wealth who is once again trying to skirt accountability.\n\nMurdaugh gave an unequivocal denial when Waters prompted, “Mr. Murdaugh are you a family annihilator?”\n\nProsecutor tries to poke holes in Murdaugh’s new story, needles about lying to SLED\n\nIn an exhaustive review of the events leading up to the murders of Paul and Maggie Murdaugh, Waters focused on revealing inconsistencies in the defendant’s story.\n\nWaters focused on details including phone calls Murdaugh made before the killings and conversations he had with his wife in an apparent effort to poke holes in a new narrative of events Murdaugh recounted for the first time on the witness stand.\n\nDuring yesterday’s testimony, Murdaugh admitted to lying to SLED officials the evening of the murder. Murdaugh blamed his lying on drug-induced paranoia. During extensive questioning, Water pressed Murdaugh on exactly when he decided to lie to SLED detective David Owens about seeing Maggie and Paul that night, playing clips from the interview and pausing at certain points to ask if he'd started lying yet.\n\nDay 2 of Alex Murdaugh’s cross-examination begins with detailing of oxycodone addiction\n\nThe cross examination of accused murderer Alex Murdaugh continued for a second day Friday, as lead prosecutor Creighton Waters pressed the defendant on his drug dependency.\n\nMurdaugh painted himself as a man at the mercy of his opioid addiction, attempting at kick the habit hundreds of times. He described the pain it inflicted on his family and the paranoia it elicited.\n\nBefore rehab, Murdaugh said he always kept the pills on him, afraid someone might discover them. He said he had a pocket full of pills when he was interviewed by law enforcement the day after the murders.\n\nMurdaugh said the prosecution failed to respond to multiple requests from his lawyers talk about his other wrong-doings. He would have been willing to share about his drug addiction and financial crimes and how they related to the evidence, he said, but lawyers for the state did not respond to his attorney. The first contact with prosecu Murdaugh said he received was when he was charged with murder.\n\nWaters balked at that assertion, noting that Murdaugh had never, before taking the stand Thursday, told prosecutors he had lied about being at the dog kennels the night of the murder. Waters said Murdaugh was simply coming up with a brand new story to match the facts of the case.\n\nTensions rose between Waters and Murdaugh over financial crimes\n\nTempers flared during the cross examination between the defendant and lawyer Creighton Waters on Murdaugh's financial crimes. Waters described how Murdaugh sat across from one client, looking her in the eye and \"talking fast\" – a folksy way of saying lying.\n\nMurdaugh equivocated on the eye contact, and said the details of his fraud was hazy.\n\nThe questioning appeared aimed at portraying Murdaugh as a man who lied easily, and had become quite good at it.\n\nMurdaugh, expressed exasperation, telling Waters he had been forced to sit through weeks of testimony about financial crimes he has admitted to and is embarrassed about, bit is on trial for the murder of his wife and son.\n\n“I stole money that was not my money, I misled people I shouldn’t have misled and I did wrong I can tell you that,” Murdaugh conceded.\n\nCross examination begins, Creighton Waters draws on Murdaugh family legacy\n\nCreighton Waters began an aggressive cross-examination of Murdaugh, taking a combative tone with the defendant.\n\nDelving into the history of the Murdaugh legal dynasty, Waters peppered him with questions about his family tree and his own success as a lawyer.\n\nWaters and Murdaugh sparred over the definition of success, with Waters pointing out the cases Murdaugh won and the millions of dollars in legal fees he collected. Murdaugh, however, seemed hesitant to paint himself in too favorable a light. “Do I feel like I was successful? No sir not sitting here today I don’t,” Murdaugh said.\n\nWaters line of questioning sought to portray a cozy relationship Murdaugh had with law enforcement based on family connections.\n\nMurdaugh confesses to orchestrating assisted suicide plot, gushes about wife Maggie and son Paul\n\nMurdaugh told jurors about an assisted suicide plot he hatched, paying Curtis Edward Smith to shoot him to escape his addiction.\n\n“At the time in the bad place that I was, it seemed like the better thing to do,” he said, saying that now he is grateful to have survived.\n\nWhen asked about his wife, Murdaugh lovingly described her as a wonderful woman whose laugh would light up a room. Very feminine, she did her best as the mother of two sons, he said, taking to their interests. She could hob-nob with the affluent at the governor’s mansion and then take a shift at a soup kitchen.\n\n“I would never hurt Maggie – ever,” Murdaugh insisted.\n\nMurdaugh described his son Paul as a good man, who had been misrepresented in the media. He challenged everyone in the courtroom, and anyone listening – nodding to the trial’s wide digital audience – to find anyone who knew Paul “without an ulterior motive” who had something negative to say about him.\n\n“He was a man’s man,” Murdaugh said, a true country boy with a soft and sweet side, often checking in on his grandparents.\n\n“Did I love him?” Murdaugh said, choking back tears “Like no other.”\n\nMurdaugh admits to stealing client funds, talks about his opioid addiction\n\nAlex Murdaugh returned to the witness stand Thursday afternoon after a lunch break to answer question about his alleged financial crimes. He downplayed his feelings about a confrontation by his former law firm CFO about his stealing that occurred the day of the murders\n\n“It wasn’t anything that was a big deal,” Murdaugh said, noting he was not worried at the time about anyone looking into the missing legal fee which prompted the conversation.\n\nMurdaugh later admitted to stealing legal fees from the family law firm. Asked by lawyers how he got himself into such a predicament he said, “I’m not quite sure how I let myself get where I got.”\n\nMurdaugh said he was addicted to opioids, in particular oxycodone, after knee surgery for a college football injury sustained during his time at University of South Carolina. The addiction was expensive he said. After various detox attempts and a trip to rehab, Murdaugh shared he has been sober for 353 days and is “very proud of that.”\n\nMurdaugh details threats against his son Paul after boat accident, walks lawyers through moments after murders\n\nAt one point in his 911 call, Murdaugh can be heard saying, “I should have known.” He explained he was referring to “the most vile threats” that had been levied against his son Paul after he was implicated in a 2019 boat crash. Murdaugh said the threats were so extreme that a counselor at Paul’s college had reached out to him.\n\nHis lawyers also asked Murdaugh why he traveled back to his home to get a firearm after discovering his wife and son. Murdaugh, appearing slightly flustered repeated “I don’t know” a number of times on the stand before indicating he thought the killer might be at large.\n\nMurdaugh also offered an explanation for suspicious phone activity presented by the prosecution that showed he made google searches for a restaurant and called a wedding photographer in the moments after the murder. In the rush to call family members, Murdaugh said the search must have happened by accident.\n\nAlex Murdaugh breaks down on the stand describing crime scene\n\nFollowing a detailed play-by-play of his day leading up to the murders, Murdaugh became emotional on the stand, breaking down in tears and asking for water, before describing the moment he discovered the bodies of his wife and son.\n\nThrough tears, Murdaugh recalled his shock and desperation at the scene, saying he touched both bodies to check for signs of life and to return his son Paul’s phone to his pocket after it had fallen out.\n\nDefense attorneys played back the 911 call from the evening of the murders as Murdaugh listened in to his own voice, often looking downward and shaking.\n\nAlex Murdaugh admits to lying to SLED the night of the murders, blames addiction\n\nSpeaking to crowded courtroom pews, Murdaugh admitted to lying to South Carolina Law Enforcement agents, but vehemently denied ever shooting his wife Maggie or son Paul, who he referred to by nicknames ‘Mags’ and “Pau-Pau’ on the stand.\n\nMurdaugh, appearing at times emotional and at a loss for words, told defense attorney Jim Griffin that he had lied to SLED agents about the last time he had seen his wife and son the night of the murders, blaming it partially on his distrust for the agency, and on a paranoia induced by drug addiction. Mr. Murdaugh entered rehab previously for oxycodone dependence.\n\nAsked why he continued to lie to law enforcement after the murders, Murdaugh lamented: “What a tangled web we weave.”\n\nWhat is SLED?\n\nSLED stands for South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, the state agency which has run point on the investigation into the killing of Paul and Maggie Murdaugh.\n\nSLED agents arrived on scene after the killings, and conducted interviews with father and husband, Alex Murdaugh, who was charged with their murders.\n\nOn Thursday, Murdaugh took the stand and admitted lying to SLED agents in the aftermath of the crime, attributing his dishonesty to a general distrust in the agency and the advice of former law partners not to speak to agents without an attorney present.\n\nAlex Murdaugh takes the stand for highly anticipated testimony\n\nAfter some back and forth, defendant Alex Murdaugh confirmed Thursday he will take the stand in his own murder trial, opening himself up to questioning from his lawyers, and a potentially brutal cross-examination.\n\nMurdaugh, a former attorney, will provide testimony aimed at rebutting claims by the state that he murdered his wife and son to distract from his financial crimes.\n\nDefense attorney Jim Griffin asked Judge Clifton Newman Wednesday if Murdaugh could use his Fifth Amendment rights against incriminating himself in the nearly 100 other allegations he faces including stealing from clients, money laundering, tax evasion and insurance fraud. Newman said prosecutors generally get wide latitude in cross examination.\n\nAlex Murdaugh's lawyers present a defense, Buster Murdaugh testifies\n\nWeek five of the Murdaugh trial kicked off Tuesday with the defense team at the helm. Lawyers for Alex Murdaugh began making their case Friday afternoon, calling two officials whose testimony they view as crucial to poking holes in the state's presented evidence: Colleton County Coroner Richard Harvey, and Sheriff’s Office Public Information Officer Shalane Tindal.\n\nTuesday morning Buster Murdaugh, Alex Murdaugh's surviving son, took the stand detailing how guns were stored at the family property 'Moselle.'\n\nMurdaugh's high profile defense team will need to provide the jury reasonable doubt that their client committed the murders and paint the evidence presented by the prosecution as circumstantial and too week to bring such a serious charge.\n\nState rests, but Murdaugh defense team asks for case to be tossed\n\nOver the course of the past month, lawyers for the State of South Carolina have called over 50 witnesses, presenting a case against disgraced lawyer Richard \"Alex\" Murdaugh. On Friday, they rested their case. Shortly after, Jim Griffin, one of Murdaugh's attorneys, requested a \"directed verdict,\" alleging the prosecution had failed to provide sufficient evidence for the jury to deliver a guilty verdict.\n\nIn a hearing without the jury present Griffin claimed the evidence was \"exclusively circumstantial\" and \"merely suspicious.\" Judge Clifton Newman shot down these assertions, saying the court and S.C. law makes no distinction between direct evidence and circumstantial evidence.\n\n\"Their is evidence to derive at a guilty verdict, if the jury agrees,\" Newman commented.\n\nRead a full recap of Day 20's trial proceedings.\n\nWhen was Alex Murdaugh's roadside shooting?\n\nThe murders of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh are not the only shootings related to this case. In September 2021, Alex Murdaugh himself was hit in the head by a bullet during a drive-by shooting.\n\nState police confirmed that the shooting was orchestrated by Murdaugh himself as an \"assisted suicide\" plot. He was charged in connection with the failed suicide-for-hire attempt from which he had hoped to secure a $10 million life insurance payout for his son.\n\nCurtis Edward Smith, the shooter, was a former client of Murdaugh, and also faces a number of charges including insurance fraud, conspiracy, assisted suicide, aggravated assault and battery.\n\nMurdaugh gave Smith the gun to kill him, police said. Smith then followed Murdaugh to Old Salkehatchie Road in Hampton County and fired the shot. It only grazed Murdaugh though, who was then able to call 911.\n\nFollowing the incident, state agents confirmed both men confessed. Murdaugh's lawyer later asserted his client had come up with the plan for a would-be-assassination amid a battle with oxycodone addiction and a depressive episode. He entered rehab shortly after and resigned from the family law firm following allegations he had misappropriated funds.\n\nMurdaugh jurors test positive for COVID\n\nTwo of the jurors in the double-homicide trial tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of Monday's court proceedings. The clerk of court also tested positive.\n\nAfter the remaining 10 jurors and five alternates tested negative, Judge Clifton Newman decided to continue the trial despite requests from both the prosecution and defense for a delay. Another round of tests will be administered Wednesday.\n\nThe remaining jurors will wear masks, as will testifying witnesses and questioning attorneys. The courtroom will remain as packed as before, with 200-plus onlookers, who will not be required to don masks.\n\nNewman, however, recommend safety measures. “At the moment, we are going to encourage everyone here to mask up for your own protection as well as the protection of these proceedings and each other,” he said.\n\nWho is Claude 'C.B. Rowe?\n\nClaude “C.B.” Rowe is a former Murdaugh employee.\n\nColleton County Sheriff’s Office detective Laura Rutland, who served as a liaison to SLED for the investigation, testified earlier that Murdaugh offered up Rowe’s name as a possible suspect in the murders during an interview the night of the killings.\n\nCell phone records presented in court indicate Rowe’s phone was was not in the vicinity of the Murdaugh estate at the time of the murders.\n\nRowe, a groundskeeper for the Murdaugh estate, also is part of the defendant’s alibi. In court filings, Murdaugh says the night of the murders he drove to his mother's house in nearby Vanville and called a number of people on the way, including C.B. Rowe.\n\nDuring Monday's court proceedings, SLED Forensic DNA analyst Sarah Zapata testified in tedious and inconclusive detail about DNA samples, including those found beneath Maggie Murdaugh's fingernails. Rowe's DNA couldn't be ruled out but Zapata said it was only a \"moderate likelihood\" the mixture was his and Maggie's.\n\nThe foreign DNA from a male found under Maggie's nails was not her husband or son Paul.\n\nGloria Satterfield's son testifies\n\nTony Satterfield, the son of Gloria Satterfield, a former housekeeper for the Murdaughs, who died as a result of a fall at the family property, took the stand Thursday.\n\nSatterfield testified that after his mother died in 2018, Murdaugh approached him and his brother and promised to take care of them, telling them he would allow a friendly claim against his homeowner's insurance.\n\nMurdaugh promised to secure $100,000 for each of the grieving sons, Satterfield testified. However, according to indictments and civil lawsuits, Murdaugh, along with fellow attorney Cory Fleming carried out a scheme to coerce his insurance companies into paying roughly $4.3 million — all of which Murdaugh kept.\n\n\"Did he ever pay you one dime?\" Creighton Waters, lead prosecutor Creighton Waters asked Satterfield. \"No,\" he responded.\n\nWho is Chris Wilson? Alex Murdaugh's friend takes the stand\n\nChris Wilson, a former close friend of Alex Murdaugh, took the stand midday Thursday. Wilson, a Bamberg lawyer, who has known Murdaugh since high school, appeared as a witness for the prosecution.\n\nWilson testified to his family's shock and grief at the death of both Maggie and Paul, and described traveling to Moselle, the family property, to comfort Murdaugh the night of the murders.\n\nIn his testimony Wilson suggested that both he and other lawyer friends of Murdaugh did not want him speaking to South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) officers alone because he was so distraught. \"We felt that Alex wasn't in a position that he needed to, or was even able to, talk to SLED without someone being with him,\" Wilson said.\n\nIn a previous in-camera testimony, without the jury present, Wilson described how close he and his family were to the Murdaughs, and how he felt truly betrayed by Murdaugh's financial crimes.\n\n\"He was one of my best friends, and I thought that he felt that way about me,\" Wilson said, his voice thick with emotion on Thursday.\n\nAs questions continued, Murdaugh hung his head and wiped away tears.\n\nColleton County Courthouse evacuated due to bomb threat\n\nOn Wednesday, a Colleton County Sheriff's Office deputy was reported to be sprinting across the grounds of the Courthouse, yelling in a panic for people to clear the area.\n\nAt 12:27 p.m., Judge Clifton Newman ordered the courtroom to be evacuated until as late as 2:30 p.m. Newman did not cite a specific reason for the evacuation, but the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division confirmed that a bomb threat was reported.\n\nSeveral student groups were in attendance today at the trial today as well as Murdaugh family members.\n\nJason Ryan on the ground at the courthouse on behalf of the The Hampton County Guardian described significant police presence at the scene, reporting that law enforcement had formed a perimeter around the courthouse square and cleared the block.\n\nShortly after 3 p.m. the court reconvened and proceedings resumed.\n\nJeanne Seckinger testifies to Alex Murdaugh's alleged stealing\n\nJeanne Seckinger, CFO of the Murdaugh family law firm PMPED (now Parker Law Group) took the stand Tuesday, painting Alex Murdaugh as a thief and manipulator.\n\nSeckinger alleged Murdaugh used his prominent name and the chummy culture of the law firm to pull off a years-long con, stealing millions from clients, partners and other close associates.\n\nSeckinger characterized Murdaugh as a sloppy thief, stealing the same funds twice and leaving incriminating checks and bank statements on his desk at the office.\n\nHis success as a lawyer, she alleged, was not the result of skill but manipulation. \"Alex was successful, not because of his work ethic, because of his ability to manipulate people into a settlement,\" Seckinger told the courtroom, \"He did it through the art of (expletive) , basically.\"\n\nAn important ruling from Judge Newman\n\nJudge Clifton Newman ruled on Monday that evidence pertaining to Alex Murdaugh's other alleged crimes would be permitted in the trial. The ruling is a big win for the prosecution, which filed documents indicating lawyers plan to paint Murdaugh as a man out of options, desperate to distract from his financial crimes.\n\n\"I find that the jury is entitled to consider the apparent desperation of Mr. Murdaugh because of his dire financial situation and the treat of being exposed. ... possibly resulting in the commission of the alleged crimes,\" Newman said.\n\nMurdaugh is the subject of a number of state investigations and has been indicted on nearly 100 different charges including fraud and drug trafficking. The admission of evidence related to these alleged crimes is expected to prolong what was already anticipated to be a three-week trial.\n\nAlex Murdaugh murder trial updates:Judge rules financial crimes admissible; caregiver testifies\n\nCaretaker for Libby Murdaugh, Alex Mudaugh's mother testifies\n\nThe prosecution called Mushelle \"Shelley\" Smith to the stand as Monday. Smith is the caretaker for Alex Murdaugh's elderly mother, Libby Murdaugh.\n\nSmith testified that Murdaugh came to visit his mother the night of the murders at about 9 or 9:30 p.m. and stayed 15 to 20 minutes. Smith testified that days later, at the funeral of his father, Randolph Murdaugh III Alex made a point of telling her he was at the house that night for longer — 30 to 40 minutes.\n\nShe also testified that Murdaugh offered financial support for her upcoming wedding and to use his connections to help with her second job at the local school district .\n\nSmith also said a week after the murders she saw Murdaugh at his mother's home carrying what looked to be a blue tarp.\n\nIn his cross-examination, defense team lawyer Jim Griffin sought to undermine Smith's account by pointing to a conflicting report she gave police about whether Murdaugh had a tarp or a raincoat.\n\nWhen were the Murdaugh murders?\n\nMaggie and Paul Murdaugh were shot and killed the evening of June 7, 2021, on the family's property in Islandton, South Carolina.\n\nIt wasn't until July 14, 2022, more than a year later, that authorities pointed to Alex Murdaugh as the killer, indicting him on two counts of murder.\n\nWhere is the Murdaugh trial being held?\n\nThe trial is taking place in Walterboro, South Carolina at the Colleton Country Courthouse.\n\nJudge Clifton Newman is presiding.\n\nWhere did the Murdaugh murders happen?\n\nBoth Maggie and Paul were killed at the Murdaugh estate, called 'Moselle' in Islandton, South Carolina.\n\nThis is also the home where Gloria Ann Satterfield, long-time housekeeper for the Murdaugh family, died following a fall down the stairs.\n\nAlex Murdaugh was later investigated by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) in connection with Satterfield's death over allegations he stole insurance settlement funds from her heirs. Murdaugh also faced a civil suit from Satterfield's sons in connection with those allegations.\n\nWho is Rogan Gibson?\n\nRogan Gibson, a friend of Paul Murdaugh's, was named a number of times in day six of the trial.\n\nGibson's communications via text and call with Paul were presented as evidence to help establish a timeline of the murders.\n\nSLED Senior Special Agent Jeff Croft shared cell phone snapshots of text exchanges between Gibson and both victims, as well as a call log showing Gibson attempted to call Paul numerous times without answer.\n\nLogs also showed that Gibson missed a number of calls from the defendant Alex Murdaugh.\n\nWhat is the significance of the 300 Blackout rifle?\n\nDuring week one of the trial, prosecutors said markings, model and brand information for the 300 Blackout rifle cartridges found at the crime scene matched other ammunition found throughout the Murdaugh estate.\n\nThe defendant Alex Murdaugh purchased a 300 Blackout style rifle for his son Paul in 2017, which could not be found. Murdaugh's attorney Richard Harpootlian maintains it was stolen.\n\nWhat are the charges against Alex Murdaugh charged?\n\nMurdaugh is facing double-homicide charges, accused of killing his son Paul, 22, and wife Maggie, 52.\n\nMurdaugh also is the subject of other state investigations and has been indicted on roughly 100 additional charges. Those charges include tax evasion, drug trafficking and fraud.\n\nHis cases have thrust the small town of Walterboro and Colleton County, South Carolina, into the national spotlight.\n\nThe criminal saga of Alex Murdaugh, whose family had control over a local prosecutor's office in Hampton County for over 80 years, stretches back nearly a decade. Following the June 2021 shootings, law enforcement began to investigate two other deaths in connection with Murdaugh. He himself survived a gunshot during a drive-by shooting prosecutors allege was part of a failed insurance fraud scheme.\n\nTake an in-depth look at the timeline: What we know about Alex Murdaugh's crime saga.\n\nWho is Alex Murdaugh?:Behind the man who wrecked a South Carolina legal dynasty\n\nHow is the PMPED law firm/Parker Law Group related?\n\nPMPED (now called Parker Law group) is the family law firm where Alex Murdaugh was formerly employed. The name stands for the initials of Peters, Murdaugh, Parker Eltzroth and Detrick.\n\nMurdaugh resigned from the firm after being accused of stealing funds. Judge Newman ruled on Monday that evidence of Murdaugh's alleged financial crimes will be admissible in the case. On Thursday Jeannie Seckinger, the CFO of Parker Law Group, testified she had confronted Murdaugh about missing legal fees the day of the murder. The jury was not present for this testimony.\n\nFilings from the prosecution indicate they allege Murdaugh carried out the murders to distract PMPED from his financial crimes. The state also plans to call Annette Griswald, Murdaugh's former paralegal who first sounded the alarm bell on the alleged finacial crimes .\n\nMurdaugh trial witness list\n\nMore than 250 people are on the potential witness list for the defense and prosecution.\n\nThe list includes agents from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), forensic experts, Murdaugh family members and medical professionals. Murdaugh himself eventually took the stand as well, proving perhaps to be the defense's most key witness.\n\nAlex Murdaugh murder trial:First officers on scene of murders offer revealing testimony.\n\nWho are Alex Murdaugh's attorneys? Richard \"Dick\" Harpootlian leads defense team\n\nJudge Clifton Newman is presiding over the trial and Murdaugh's defense team is headed by attorneys Richard Harpootlian and Jim Griffin.\n\nHarpootlian is a trial lawyer with decades of experience, having worked as a prosecutor, defense attorney and civil litigator. He is no stranger to high-profile cases. Notably, in 1983, Harpootlian sealed a death-row conviction for the prosecution of Donald “Pee Wee” Gaskins — a notorious serial killer.\n\nGriffin is both a trial lawyer and health care attorney and has extensive experience in representing clients charged with federal crimes, including various classifications of fraud, public corruption, and criminal tax charges.\n\nDig deeper:Learn more about Alex Murdaugh's media-savvy defense team\n\nWho is the prosecutor in the Murdaugh trial? Creighton Waters leads the team\n\nCreighton Waters is the chief attorney for the State Grand Jury division of the South Carolina Attorney General’s Office and is the lead prosecutor in all of the criminal cases involving Murdaugh.\n\nWaters, 52, has worked for the Attorney General’s Office for more than 24 years. He has won State Grand Jury indictments on corrupt law enforcement officers, as well as school district and county officials. His work has earned indictments on more than 100 suspects following investigations into drug operations in the state prison system.\n\nSince 2019, Waters’ primary focus has been on unraveling Murdaugh’s alleged web of financial and drug-related crimes, and leveling indictment after indictment against the disbarred attorney and several of his alleged accomplices.\n\nWelcome to Walterboro, South Carolina:Food trucks serve influx of visitors amid Murdaugh murders trial\n\nPaul Murdaugh boat crash\n\nIn July 2021 court documents were filed alleging a civil conspiracy that would have connected law enforcement with members of the Murdaugh family after a 2019 Beaufort County boat crash killed Mallory Beach, 19.\n\nPaul Murdaugh, Alex Murdaugh's late son, was allegedly driving the boat when he crashed into a bridge, resulting in Beach's death and injuries to the two other passengers on board. He was awaiting trial after pleading not guilty to three felony counts of boating under the influence. The boat was owned by Alex Murdaugh.\n\nIn court proceedings Sgt. Daniel Greene of the Colleton County Sheriff's Office testified that Murdaugh, moments after officers arrived on the scene the night of Maggie and Paul's death, told them that the shootings were likely related to the 2019 boat crash and threats his son had been receiving.\n\nWho is Buster Murdaugh?\n\nAlex and Maggie Murdaugh had two children: Paul, who is the subject of the murder trial and one other surviving son Richard \"Buster\" Murdaugh.\n\nBuster is on the witness list for the trial. He attended law school at University of South Carolina before being kicked out over accusations of plagiarism, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBuster and Maggie Murdaugh were both named in the wrongful death lawsuit brought by Mallory Beach's family following the 2019 boat crash, but their names were eventually dropped in the settlement. Buster was charged originally because his ID was used by younger brother Paul to buy the alcohol in his system at the time of the crash.\n\nAlex Murdaugh trial jury selection\n\nJury selection began Monday, Jan. 23 in a Walterboro, South Carolina, courtroom for the highly anticipated trial.\n\nAttorneys narrowed down a list of 900 residents to a potential jury pool of roughly 150 in open court and made further cuts in judge's chambers. On Wednesday, Jan. 25, they settled on a final jury of four white men, six white women and two Black women. The alternates include two white men, one white woman, one Black man and two Black women.\n\nThe South Carolina Attorney General's Office is seeking life in prison for Murdaugh if he is convicted.\n\nA deep dive:Learn more about jury selection in the Alex Murdaugh trial.\n\nAlex Murdaugh murder trial begins:What could happen in this historic case?\n\nAlex Murdaugh trial opening statements\n\nOpening statements were given by state prosecutors and defense attorneys on Wednesday, Jan. 25.\n\nLead prosecutor Creighton Waters asserted evidence would show a \"perfect storm\" was brewing that led Murdaugh, 54, to kill his wife and son in June 2021. Dick Harpootlian, Murdaugh's defense attorney, reminded the jury his client is innocent until proven guilty and dismissed the state's evidence and mere \"theories.\"\n\nWaters detailed a precise timeline of the crime in his opening statement, drawing on ballistic and forensic evidence, cell phone data and video footage of the crime scene. He alleged Murdaugh used a family gun, which is now missing, to commit the murders, then drove to his mother's house before returning home later and phoning 911.\n\n\"You are going to see what he did to Maggie and Paul, and it is going to be gruesome,\" Waters said.\n\nMurdaugh trial kicks off:Opening statements given in former attorney Alex Murdaugh's double murder trial\n\nContributing: Michael M.

The same day, his family members and one of his attorneys said that SLED agents met with them \"as a courtesy\" to inform them that they intended to charge Alex Murdaugh in connection with the double homicide.\n\nHere is what we know and don't know about the Alex Murdaugh case.\n\nPrevious reporting:Here's a timeline of the Murdaugh family killings\n\nPending charges:Murder charges pending for Alex Murdaugh. 'We want the truth,' family says\n\nWhere will the murder trial be held?\n\nThat double murder trial, set to begin Jan. 23 at the Colleton County Courthouse in Walterboro, will be the biggest televised public attraction in that county since the motion pictures Radio and Forest Gump were filmed there decades ago, and public officials are bracing to get prepared for the anticipated crowds of journalists, legal personnel, and curious spectators.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the S.C. Attorney General's Office, murder trials are generally held in the county where the crime happened unless a judge grants a change of venue. Colleton is one of five counties in the 14th Circuit where Murdaugh's family were chief prosecutors for more than 85 years. In other high-profile cases, jury pools have been selected from outside of the jurisdiction.\n\nNo.\n\nS.C. Attorney General Alan Wilson, whose office is prosecuting all of the Murdaugh cases, announced on Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2022, that state prosecutors would not be seeking the death penalty for Murdaugh, if convicted, but would seek life in prison without parole.\n\nWho are the Murdaughs?\n\nFor over a century, the Murdaugh name was synonymous with civil law and criminal justice in and around Hampton County. Alex's great-grandfather, Randolph Murdaugh Sr., founded a personal injury firm that grew into a Lowcountry legal giant, and Alex's father was the third Randolph Murdaugh to hold the office of 14th Circuit Solicitor in a family tenure that spanned more than 85 years.\n\nLike the generations before him, Alex Murdaugh attended the University of South Carolina law school, played Gamecock football while enjoying hunting, fishing and boating in the scenic Lowcountry, practiced civil law at the family firm, and even worked as a volunteer assistant solicitor under his father. Murdaugh lived a seemingly perfect life of wealth and luxury, dividing his time between the family's primary estate and its Edisto beach house.\n\nDespite their power, wealth and connections, the Murdaughs were largely unknown outside the realm of their five-county circuit — until Alex's son, Paul, allegedly crashed his father's boat in Beaufort County, leaving Mallory Beach, 19, of Hampton dead.\n\nThen, as Paul Murdaugh awaited trial on felony boating under the influence charges, the family was propelled into the national spotlight on the night of June 7, 2021, when Alex Murdaugh called 911 to report that Paul and his mother had been shot and killed.\n\nA mother and son of a prominent family lay dead, and for more than a year, no arrests or suspects were officially announced.\n\nDispatches From Hampton County:Remembering victims, lives lost in the Murdaugh crime saga\n\nPower, prestige and privilege:Inside the rise and fall of the Murdaugh dynasty in South Carolina\n\nWhat we know about the double homicide of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh\n\nMaggie, 52, at the time, and Paul, 22, were shot and killed outside their Colleton County estate, commonly called \"Moselle\" by the family, near Islandton.\n\nAlex Murdaugh called 911 at 10:07 p.m. and told operators that he wasn't home at the time of the killings and came home to find both victims unresponsive and that nothing else looked out of place.\n\nThe Colleton County Sheriff's Office responded to the scene and immediately notified the State Law Enforcement Division, which took the lead in the investigation.\n\nColleton County Coroner Richard Harvey reported that the victims were found on the ground near the family dog kennels, and both died of multiple gunshot wounds. Harvey placed the time of death between 9 and 9:30 p.m. Soon after the killings, SLED issues a statement saying that there is no danger to the public.\n\nOn June 16, eyewitnesses reported to The Hampton County Guardian that SLED agents with SCUBA diving gear were searching the Salkehatchie River roughly two miles from the crime scene. SLED would not confirm if this was related to the homicides.\n\nOn June 10, a day before the Murdaugh family was set to hold funerals for Paul and Maggie, Randolph III, 81, died of apparent natural causes at his home in Hampton County. In less than a week, the Murdaughs held funerals for three of their own.\n\nMembers of the Murdaugh family, vilified by some in the public following Beach’s death, appeared on Good Morning America on June 17 pleading for help, stating that Paul had received death threats. “The person who did this is out there,” said Randolph “Randy” Murdaugh IV. “We need help finding who did this… We’re just regular people, and we are hurting just like they would be hurting if it had happened to them.”\n\nThe killings prompted international media coverage and a true crime, social media following — as well as numerous rumors and conspiracy theories.\n\nOnline following of Murdaugh saga:South Carolina murder saga attracts cult-like online following\n\nOn June 25, Alex and his surviving son, \"Buster,\" offered a $100,000 reward for the killer or killers.\n\nOn June 23, SLED spokesperson Tommy Crosby released the following statement: \"SLED has opened an investigation into the death of Stephen Smith based upon information gathered during the course of the double murder investigation of Paul and Maggie Murdaugh.\" Smith's death had controversially been ruled a hit and run in 2015.\n\nFor more than a year, SLED remained tight-lipped about the case and released little information, which was heavily redacted, as public speculation and interest grew.\n\nOn July 12, 2022, Alex's brother, John Marvin Murdaugh, told The Guardian that SLED met with family members that morning as a \"courtesy\" to announce pending homicide-related charges against Alex, but did not discuss details.\n\nOn July 14, 2022, the Colleton County Grand Jury charged Alex Murdaugh with two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime in the deaths of his wife and son. The indictments state that Paul was killed with a shotgun and Maggie with a rifle.\n\nWhat we don't know\n\nHave murder weapons been recovered? Officials have not released that information. But state police have been spotted on more than one occasion searching area rivers with metal detectors and dive teams.\n\nDNA and possible, alleged blood spatter evidence was found on Murdaugh's clothes, but it is unclear if this evidence will be admissible. Murdaugh's attorneys have filed pretrial motions seeking to have this material excluded, claiming that it isn't scientifically accurate, or that Murdaugh could have gotten blood or DNA on his clothes while checking for a pulse.\n\nSLED investigators have released little information and few public records in this high-profile homicide case, so there is much that the public doesn't know. The USA TODAY Network will continue digging deeper and share more official information as it becomes available.\n\nDid Murdaugh have an accomplice?\n\nWhile multiple S.C. media outlets have reported two weapons were used in the killings, state police did not discuss additional suspects with the Murdaugh family members or Maggie's family, the Branstetters. A spokesperson for the S.C. Attorney General's Office told The Hampton County Guardian after Murdaugh's indictment that they did not anticipate charging any further suspects.\n\nHowever, in a pretrial motion, Murdaugh's attorneys alleged that Curtis Edward Smith, who has been indicted on charges related to Murdaugh's alleged financial and drug crimes \"failed\" a SLED polygraph test when asked if he was at the scene on the night of the murders.\n\nHowever, the state has filed a pretrial motion seeking to exclude any mention of polygraph tests during the trial, citing that polygraph data is not admissible in court.\n\nWhat is the motive in these killings?\n\nWhile theories abound on social media, the SC Attorney General's Office filed a Dec. 8, 2022, motion to admit evidence of motive, claiming that Murdaugh killed his family in order to distract and gain sympathy with suspicious members of his law firm, in order to delay questions and buy time to cover up his many alleged financial crimes.\n\nWill Murdaugh's alleged financial crimes be used as evidence of murder?\n\nOn Dec. 19, 2022, Murdaugh's attorneys filed a motion seeking to exclude any evidence related to financial crimes or other \"bad acts,\" claiming they are not admissible in murder trials, citing examples of state law. The state has filed a response in opposition, also citing precedents of law.\n\nJudge Clifton Newman is expected to rule on all of the pretrial motions right after jury selection next week.\n\nDoes Murdaugh have an alibi for the night of the killings?\n\nOn Nov. 17, 2022, Murdaugh's attorneys filed a motion of alibi defense, claiming that their client was visiting his ailing mother in Almeda, outside Varnville, at the time that the Colleton County Coroner's Office says they were likely killed.\n\nHow serious are Murdaugh's other charges?\n\nMurdaugh is currently facing more than 100 criminal charges, as well as 11 lawsuits in state court and one in federal court. At last tally by the S.C. Attorney General's Office, if convicted on all charges and sentenced consecutively, those charges add up, in theory, to more than 800 years of prison time. It is unclear, however, what Murdaugh's actual punishment will be if convicted or if additional charges are to be added.\n\nWill others be charged in connection to Murdaugh's financial and narcotics cases?\n\nCurrently charged along with Murdaugh for financial crimes are suspended attorney Cory Fleming, former banker Russell Laffitte, and a Colleton County man, Curtis Edward Smith. Laffitte, who is facing state and federal charges related to his role in the alleged bank fraud involving Murdaugh, has already been convicted in federal court but is appealing.\n\nSmith, along with two other men, is also charged with Murdaugh in connection with narcotics charges. It is possible that other attorneys and bankers may be charged, and it is even more likely that other drug offenders will be indicted, considering the fact that Murdaugh and Smith are charged with distributing Oxycodone in a \"multi-county area.\"\n\nWhat took SLED so long to file murder charges?\n\nThis isn't just an isolated criminal case. In addition to the many financial allegations, Murdaugh is connected in some way to two other ongoing homicide investigations by SLED - the 2015 death of Stephen Smith and the 2018 death of Gloria Satterfield - as well as an alleged financial crime spree spanning multiple victims in several counties for more than a decade. SLED is also tasked with investigating serious crimes all around the state, which compounds matters.\n\nI have more questions about Alex Murdaugh\n\nIf you have additional questions that our journalists can help answer, please share them with us using the form below.

There've been in federal conspiracy cases and numerous criminal cases involving unscrupulous bankers in the compelling but controversial legal dynasty that serves as a powerful backstory for current events.\n\nMurdaugh, the disgraced attorney, is also accused of murdering his wife and son in a case that has made international headlines and primetime true-crime documentaries.\n\nRandolph Murdaugh Sr. took on corrupt bankers during Great Depression\n\nLaffitte is accused of using his status and access as CEO of Palmetto State Bank to conspire with Murdaugh and take advantage of his legal clients.\n\nThese current allegations might have been looked upon with great displeasure by Murdaugh's great-grandfather, Randolph Murdaugh Sr., a former 14th Judicial Circuit prosecutor who spent much of his career prosecuting unscrupulous bankers during the bank collapses of the Great Depression.\n\nThe Laffitte family traces the origins of Palmetto State Bank back to the Loan and Exchange Bank of Hampton, which was established on Lee Avenue in Hampton in 1907 but later purchased by the Laffittes in 1955.\n\nAccording to interviews conducted by the author for the University of South Carolina – Salkehatchie's \"Salkehatchie Stew\" history project, that bank's founder and president, R.O. Bowden, was well known for making unusual loans, which sometimes included loans for moonshining equipment, and for hiding money from federal regulators by burying it in the stables of his livestock business, the Horses and Asses Farm.\n\nHis was one of the few banks in Hampton County to survive the Great Depression.\n\nAs banker Bowden made a reputation for himself during that era, his contemporary, Randolph Sr., Alex Murdaugh's great-grandfather, made a name for himself in taking on bankers and banks.\n\nRandolph Murdaugh Sr. took on cases involving officers of three of the largest banking institutions of that era in his hometown Hampton County — banks that he, his family and his associates likely did business with.\n\nOn Sept. 21, 1926, the Hampton County Grand Jury asked the solicitor to hand down indictments on officers of the Merchants and Planters Bank of Varnville, the Merchants and Planters Bank of Brunson, and the Bank of Hampton for violations of the state’s banking laws.\n\nIn February of 1928, Randolph Sr., working along with Hampton attorney George Warren, later a state senator, earned convictions on two Beaufort County bankers for making false statements in a conspiracy scandal involving the former Beaufort Bank. The convictions were appealed to the state Supreme Court but were upheld.\n\nTaking on bad bankers would even pull the Hampton attorney out of his power zone in the 14th Circuit. In July of 1930, Randolph was appointed by state Attorney General John M. Daniel to represent South Carolina’s interests during a special term of court in Lancaster, 149 miles away. He prosecuted the case against two officers the First National Bank and Trust, a defunct organization at that time that had also been accused of violating state banking laws.\n\nPower, prestige and privilege:Power, prestige and privilege: Inside the rise and fall of the Murdaugh dynasty in South Carolina\n\nMurders, mystery, money:Murders, mystery, money: Here's a timeline of the Murdaugh family killings\n\nMurdaugh was also involved in two major cases with state-level implications — one in defense of a South Carolina governor and one in prosecution of a former governor.\n\nDuring Allendale County General Sessions Court the week of July 11, 1924, he prosecuted a major case against former Gov. Wilson G. Harvey, also the former president of the Enterprise Bank of Charleston, who was charged with violating state banking laws by accepting deposits even though he knew the failing bank was insolvent. The case pitted Murdaugh against another South Carolina legal legend, Edgar A. Brown, of Barnwell, who would later become a state senator and part of a powerful group of politicians known as “The Barnwell Ring.”\n\nDuring the trial, Solicitor Murdaugh called five key witnesses and produced numerous banking documents. Over the strong objections of the defense, Murdaugh placed the former governor in the prisoner’s dock while the indictment was being read, a subtle move that changed how he was viewed, literally, and could've added insult to indictment. It was also an early example of the type of colorful, and often controversial, courtroom antics that his son and grandson would later become well known for, and often sanctioned for by the South Carolina Supreme Court.\n\nSet in Allendale, just 30 minutes away from both Murdaugh’s stronghold of Hampton and Brown’s powerbase in Barnwell, the well-publicized trial resulted in an acquittal of Harvey. The defense called no witnesses and made a closing argument that the prosecution had failed to produce enough evidence to convict its client.\n\nDuring a later trial in Allendale, in April of 1925, Murdaugh was able to earn a guilty plea from Harvey on charges of lending money to a corporation in which he had interests more than the amount allowed by law. The former governor pleaded guilty to lending excessive amounts of the Enterprise bank’s money to the Consolidated Truck and Auto Company of Charleston. In accepting Harvey’s guilty plea, Solicitor Murdaugh agreed to drop two other charges that included Harvey allegedly giving excessive loans to himself, and to his brother-in-law.\n\nHBO Max, CNN specials:CNN and HBO Max to air TV specials exploring Murdaugh murders and alleged crimes\n\nNot a \"special defendant\": SC says Alex Murdaugh should not be a 'special defendant'\n\nBanker's trial has strong similarity to federal moonshine conspiracy case\n\nLaffitte's federal trial has some interesting parallels with a federal case that happened decades ago and also involved members of the Murdaugh family, including Alex Murdaugh's grandfather, Randolph \"Buster\" Murdaugh Jr. Both conspiracy cases are set in federal courthouses in Charleston, an hour and a half away from the rural, small town of Hampton where the Laffittes and the Murdaughs are among the most prominent and wealthy families around.\n\nKnown as “The Great Colleton County Whiskey Conspiracy,” Buster's affair was a federal case “born in violence on a cold November morning,” The State newspaper wrote in 1951. That’s when federal agent Henderson Clary shot a bootlegger named Doc Freeman and feds later learned of allegations that the wounded moonshiner was “in cahoots” with local legal officials — and he didn’t take too kindly to being shot.\n\nOn June 5, 1956, after a five-year investigation, Murdaugh was among 30 defendants who were originally indicted by the federal government for conspiracy to violate the Internal Revenue laws relating to liquor.\n\nAlso indicted was Colleton County Sheriff G. Haskell Thompson, who pleaded not guilty and refused to turn in his badge.\n\nJust like Laffitte’s attorneys filed pretrial motions seeking to have the charges dismissed, which were denied, in August of 1956, Murdaugh’s defense attorneys, Henry H. Edens and Henry Hammer, filed several motions seeking to have the charges dismissed on grounds of alleged improper grand jury evidence, and alleging that prosecutors were promising “light sentences” to the other defendants to encourage testimony against Murdaugh.\n\nThe motions also requested that Murdaugh be tried separately from the other defendants, claiming that in a joint trial the solicitor could be found guilty “by transference” rather than by evidence. In the motions, Murdaugh’s defense team added that, as solicitor, Murdaugh had prosecuted many of the coconspirators and, if tried along with them, his “substantial rights to a fair trial will be prejudiced.”\n\nOn Aug. 20, following a pre-trial conference, federal Judge Walter E. Hoffman denied Murdaugh’s motions, and the trial was scheduled for Sept. 17 in federal district court in Charleston.\n\n.Just as Laffitte asserted his innocence during a pretrial interview that was released on YouTube the week before his trial, Murdaugh also pleaded his case in advance of the legal proceedings of his era.\n\n“The security, honor and happiness of my wife and children face destruction, my personal integrity and liberty are at stake,” Murdaugh wrote in a letter to state officials. “With the help of Almighty God the falsity of the charges will be bared and I will return to the office of Solicitor.”\n\n\"Level playing field\":Murdaugh team seeks ‘level playing field’ as Russell Laffitte is struck with new charges\n\nWhat we know and don't:What we know, and don't know, about the Alex Murdaugh crime saga\n\nJudges ask jurors to avoid exposure to media\n\nJust as Laffitte’s attorneys plan to use audio recordings of bank board meetings in their defense, according to federal court documents, Buster Murdaugh’s prosecutors introduced a tape recording as evidence that was purported to be a conversation between Oscar Phillips, a local bootlegger, and Sheriff Thompson that was made Sept. 22, 1955, in the trunk of a car in which the men were sitting.\n\nAfter the defense complained about newspaper coverage of the moonshine conspiracy trail, Judge Hoffman urged the jurors to avoid reading any news reports over the weekend.\n\nThe Laffitte trial, too, has became a high-profile case with a lot of media attention, causing the judge to order jurors to avoid media exposure.\n\nJust as Laffitte’s legal team, Bart Daniel and Matt Austin, are currently battling it out with federal prosecutor Emily Limehouse, the 1956 case was equally heated as the two sides sparred.\n\nMurdaugh took the stand and his questioning was described by the press as “a battle of wits and tempers” between the accused solicitor and Irvine Belser Jr., assistant U.S. attorney, a “parry and thrust” game which became heated at times. At one point, the judge warned both of them and threatened Belser with contempt of court if the questioning again moved out of the agreed-upon “bounds.”\n\nDuring the final arguments of the 1956 trial, the assistant district attorney described the indicted former public officials, including Murdaugh, as “a bunch of buzzards and vultures.”\n\nMurdaugh defense attorney Claud N. Sapp then called the government’s witnesses “a bunch of perjurers, thieves and convicts.”\n\nThe jury’s verdict came on Oct. 1. Murdaugh, along with two other defendants, was acquitted of all charges, though other public officials were convicted.\n\nSheriff Thompson earned the heaviest sentence: seven years in prison and a $3,000 fine. The deputies and magistrate received three years each, and the remaining defendants got two years or less.\n\nIn the final day of the session, as he was hearing pleas for leniency for the convicted, Judge Hoffman had a few strong words for the acquitted, including Murdaugh. He described Murdaugh’s conduct as “grossly unethical,” including the fact that he represented accused bootleggers in other federal proceedings.\n\n“I can’t get involved in Colleton County politics, but I notice by the newspapers that Mr. Murdaugh plans to go back into office as solicitor,” Judge Hoffman said in court. “He is an acquitted man, and that is his prerogative. However, his unethical conduct — so grossly unethical by his own admission — was such that I couldn’t go back and face my people if I were he. But that’s his business and the business of the people there.”\n\nA November 1956 U.S. Department of Justice memo added further condemnation for Murdaugh:\n\n“The defense resorted to some highly questionable tactics, all apparently designed to bring about an acquittal or mistrial as to Solicitor Murdaugh even at the risk of sacrificing the remaining defendants….”\n\nWhat will be the outcome of Laffitte's federal trial? That remains to be seen, but the case is expected to conclude by Nov. 18, setting the stage for the courtroom battles of Alex Murdaugh, which are expected to kick off in January 2023.\n\nMichael DeWitt Jr. is the author of the upcoming \"Fall of the House of Murdaugh: The Rise and Fall of a South Carolina Legal Dynasty;\" and \"Wicked Hampton County\", scheduled for publication in the spring/summer of 2023.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/south-carolina/2022/10/17/murdaugh-murders-new-earlier-trial-date-set-for-alex-murdaugh/69568594007/", "title": "Murdaugh murders: New, earlier trial date set for Alex Murdaugh", "text": "After setting an initial trial date for Richard \"Alex\" Murdaugh, the South Carolina Courts Administration has now set a new date for the disbarred and disgraced South Carolina attorney to stand trial on charges that he murdered his wife and son — Jan. 23.\n\nAfter a string of other indictments, Murdaugh was charged on July 14 with two counts of murder and double weapons charges on allegations that he killed his wife, Maggie, with a rifle and his son Paul with a shotgun at their vast Colleton County estate, Moselle, on the night of June 7, 2021.\n\nJudge Bentley D.

The Manning office soon relocated to Kingstree, where the practice flourished. While continuing in private practice, he was appointed assistant solicitor for Williamsburg County in 1983. In 1994, he formed and served as managing partner of Newman & Sabb, P.A., with offices in Columbia, Kingstree and Lake City.\n\nAfter 24 years as a practicing attorney and 17 years as assistant solicitor, he was elected circuit court judge by the South Carolina General Assembly on May 24, 2000.\n\nMurdaugh island for sale:Private island owned by Alex Murdaugh and suspected drug smuggler for sale in SC\n\nArt imitating life?:Murdaugh similarities threaten Murder Mystery Ball as Hampton council opposes show\n\nNewman received historical preservation awards for his work in restoring historic buildings in Kingstree and Columbia.

Alex Murdaugh placed the 911 call reporting the shooting, saying he had just returned home and discovered their bodies.\n\nMurdaugh, a pillar of the South Carolina legal community, has denied involvement in the deaths, saying he had been visiting his mother at the time.\n\n“Alex wants his family, friends and everyone to know that he did not have anything to do with the murders of Maggie and Paul. He loved them more than anything in the world,” Murdaugh’s attorneys, Dick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, said in a statement Thursday.\n\nThe attorneys blasted the latest development in the case.\n\n“It was very clear from day one that law enforcement and the Attorney General prematurely concluded that Alex was responsible for the murder of his wife and son,” the statement said.\n\nMurdaugh faces charges tied to financial crimes\n\nHarpootlian and Griffin said they will file a motion for a speedy trial “requesting that the Attorney General turn over all evidence within 30 days as required by law and (demanding) … a trial within 60 days of receiving that evidence.”\n\nKeel called the indictment “one more step in a long process for justice for Maggie and Paul.”\n\n“Over the last 13 months, SLED agents and our partners have worked day in and day out to build a case against the person responsible for the murders of Maggie and Paul and to exclude those who were not,” Keel said in a statement. “At no point did agents lose focus on this investigation. From the beginning I have been clear, the priority was to ensure justice was served.”\n\nMurdaugh is being held behind bars in Columbia, South Carolina, on a $7 million bond, facing a slew of charges for alleged financial crimes.\n\nA bond hearing on the most recent charges will be held Wednesday morning at the Colleton County Courthouse before Judge Clifton Newman, according to South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson’s Office.\n\nThe alleged financial crimes are tied, in part, to allegations that Murdaugh stole millions in death settlement funds from the family of his late housekeeper Gloria Satterfield.\n\nSouth Carolina authorities opened an investigation into Satterfield’s death last year. She died at the Murdaughs’ home in 2018, after what Murdaugh described as a “trip and fall” accident. Questions about her death and how it was handled emerged last year.\n\n“Expected but still shocked,” Eric Bland and Ronnie Richt, attorneys for Satterfield’s family, said in a statement, referring to the new indictment. “Just another shameful chapter in the downfall of an evil man devoid of morality. What is sad is the amount of victims that are in his wake. Clients, family members, law partners, colleagues and friends. Alex was an equal opportunity victimizer.”\n\nAccording to SLED, Murdaugh coordinated with her family to sue himself and reach an insurance settlement, saying he would give the family the proceeds. However, he secretly deposited about $3 million of that money into an account he owned, according to affidavits released by SLED.\n\nSource cites blood spatter as potential evidence\n\nA source with knowledge of the investigation into the death of his wife and son told CNN that blood spatter found on Murdaugh’s clothing could place him at the scene of the killings of his wife and son.\n\nThe blood spatter could place Murdaugh in close contact with at least one of the victims when they were killed, the source said. High velocity spatter is associated with the use of a particular weapon, such as a rifle, and it creates a specific blood pattern, especially when used at close range.\n\nIn addition, a phone belonging to Paul Murdaugh was recovered on his body containing video and audio of Alex Murdaugh talking with his wife close to the time she and Paul were killed, the source said.\n\nAlex Murdaugh and his family. Provided to CNN\n\nAlex Murdaugh is not seen on the video but is heard speaking with her, and that recording has a time stamp, the source said, which may prove key to the investigation.\n\nThe details were first reported by FITSNews.\n\nMurdaugh, scion of a powerful political family in South Carolina’s Lowcountry, last June called 911 to report that his wife and son had been shot dead outside of their home, according to SLED.\n\nThe investigation into those deaths has led to unexpected twists: the reopening of an investigation into a 19-year-old’s unsolved 2015 death; Murdaugh’s resignation as an attorney for a prominent legal group; an admission that he struggled with opioid abuse; and dozens of charges accusing him of stealing money from clients.\n\nIn one bizarre incident, Murdaugh in September called police to report he had been wounded by a gunshot to the head. He soon admitted that he had conspired with another man to fatally shoot him so that his surviving son would collect a $10 million life insurance payout, according to authorities.\n\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court issued an order Tuesday disbarring Murdaugh, having suspended his license to practice law in the state in 2021.", "authors": ["Randi Kaye Dianne Gallagher Ray Sanchez", "Randi Kaye", "Dianne Gallagher", "Ray Sanchez"], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/south-carolina/2022/02/16/train-crash-lawsuit-helped-launch-murdaugh-family-dynasty-south-carolina/6719697001/", "title": "Murdaugh history: Train crash, lawsuit helped launch SC family ...", "text": "Midnight trains and tragic accidents are recurring themes that steam through the timeline of the Murdaugh family dynasty, leaving behind tragedy and fortune.\n\nIn the life of Randolph Murdaugh Sr., trains would bring him both.\n\nThe Murdaughs had wealth long before they were lawyers. Randolph’s father, Josiah Putnam Murdaugh II, made his first fortune in phosphate mining and the commercial fertilizer industry in Charleston County, before getting into real estate development in Beaufort and Hampton counties.\n\nE.R. Ginn Jr., known as Little Ed, had a family farm at Almeda and was a neighbor of the Murdaughs prior to and during the Great Depression. The Ginns and the Murdaughs had a couple of things in common: They were more fortunate than their neighbors, but had to live with the fact that the railroad cut through their lives and their front yards.\n\nAccording to an early Varnville history book, \"Railroads and Sawmills,\" Ginn would ride the rail cars up and down, from Varnville to Frog Hollow and on to Almeda, sharing cornmeal, cane syrup and stove wood with less fortunate families along the way. He would later take his sons on these good Samaritan missions.\n\nWhen he was 18, Ginn had been riding between railroad cars as they were being shifted out of the spur to the Ginn Mill, and he didn’t realize the shifting had been completed. Before he knew it, the train got up steam and headed toward Augusta, Georgia. Varnville historians wrote that Ginn attempted to jump off the train in front of the Murdaugh house but got caught between the cars.\n\nRandolph Murdaugh Sr. was the first person to get to Ginn, states the local history, pulling him to safety and carrying his mangled body home to his horrified family.\n\nGinn had to wait until the next day when his father, a state senator, got home from Columbia, to travel for proper medical treatment. That day, he lost a leg to a surgeon’s saw on a bloody Charleston hospital table.\n\nA dynasty is born\n\nJust after the turn of the century, Murdaugh was well on his way to creating a Southern legal dynasty. Fresh out of the University of South Carolina School of Law, Murdaugh founded his own law firm, at first a one-man practice, in 1910. Local lore and family legend contend that he never put a shingle with his name outside the Hampton law office because everyone in town knew where the Murdaugh law firm was located.\n\nIf everyone in the small county of Hampton seemed to know the attorney – Murdaugh even served as the Town of Varnville’s official town attorney for a fee of $25 per year – none at the time could likely have foreseen the legal giant the Murdaugh law firm would evolve into in that part of the state.\n\nNor could they have known this firm would become the background setting of an alleged multimillion-dollar, decade-long crime spree, as one of Murdaugh’s descendants would be accused of taking advantage of the name and clientele that took a hundred years to build.\n\nPower, prestige and privilege:Inside the rise and fall of the Murdaugh dynasty in South Carolina\n\nHis great-grandson, Richard Alexander Murdaugh, formerly a partner at the ancestral firm, now sits on the other side of the table of justice, facing 74 criminal charges for allegedly stealing more than $8 million from legal clients, partners and other people who trusted him.\n\nIn 1920, the elder Murdaugh became the solicitor for the 14th Judicial Circuit, a five-county swath of South Carolina's Lowcountry that ranges from the rural swamps of Colleton County to the resort beaches of Hilton Head Island. It was a position that would stay in his family’s control for almost 86 years, with few opposing them in district elections. His son, Randolph Jr., and his grandson, Randolph III, would continue to hold that office – and prosecutorial power over the territory – for three generations in all.\n\nDuring that rapid rise to success, wealth, and legal power, Murdaugh, like the generations that would bear his name after him, became a prominent and popular man in his hometown and district – at least among those he deemed on the right side of the law.\n\nHis name peppered the society pages: his comings and goings, appearances at garden parties, family trips – even his wife’s bridge party and flower judging made the papers. Murdaugh was involved in all matters of local and state affairs. He was credited with helping to pay for the clay to build a road from Hampton to nearby Fairfax, and he even briefly published his own newspaper.\n\nThe making of the fearless, talented Murdaugh legal legend began in the courtrooms of that era. Solicitor Murdaugh was not afraid of high-profile cases that reached beyond the bounds of humble Hampton County, a county of roughly only 25,000 people at the time. He once represented one state governor and later prosecuted another. During that trial he made the governor stand in the prisoner’s block while the indictment was read, an early example of the colorful courtroom theatrics his family successors would employ. In other cases, he indicted bankers, convicted corrupt preachers and packed courtrooms during murder trials.\n\nAll the stars seemed to align for the rising Southern lawyer.\n\n“Grand Jury lauds Murdaugh,” a Feb. 28, 1940, headline in The Hampton County Guardian read. “Endorsed for re-election.”\n\nBut tragedy was bearing down at high speed on Murdaugh and his family.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that Murdaugh was leaving a late-night poker game around 1 a.m. on a Friday and his car stalled on the tracks. The Hampton County Guardian, his hometown paper, stated simply that he was returning from a late visit with “friends in Yemassee,” and there was no court session that day.\n\nBoth outlets reported that on July 19, 1940, Murdaugh’s car was crossing a railway about four miles east of Varnville when the car mysteriously stopped in the middle of the crossing.\n\nA westbound C & W.C. freight train plunged ahead in the dark, steamy night.\n\nMurdaugh lifted his hand and waved at the oncoming locomotive, the driver later reported during an investigation.\n\nThe train wreck that started it all\n\nThe headlight beams drew closer, brighter, followed by the sound, the steam, the shaking rumble. Then the light and sound and speed overtook Randolph Murdaugh Sr.\n\nEngineer W.W. Bartlett testified that he did not see the car near the tracks until about 40 yards away, and that Murdaugh had his hand raised as though waving at the train crew. But when the train drew closer, the car started up and stopped directly on the tracks.\n\nOn July 24, 1940, The Hampton County Guardian reported that “the impact hurled the automobile approximately 900 feet up the track, totally wrecking it,” and “Murdaugh’s body was found beside the track approximately 150 feet from the crossing.”\n\nMurdaugh had been suffering from health problems since 1939, The Guardian reported on several occasions, and had just been released from the hospital in April. Local historians have wondered if his health was a factor in this accident.\n\nLocals and historians have also wondered and speculated, without direct evidence, if alcohol was involved in this crash. Historical records and newspaper accounts give us no firm clue if that was the case. Others hint at suicide, again without probable cause.\n\nWas the accident caused by railroad crossing conditions? Or were vehicle malfunction problems to blame?\n\nThe Hampton County Coroner’s jury simply ruled the death an accident. The public would likely never know the exact contributing cause of this collision, but the Murdaugh family had a suspicion, one that they would later take to court.\n\nIt would not be the only strange death or tragic accident to surround the Murdaugh family. As Alex Murdaugh sits in jail in the state capital, four death investigations now orbit the modern Murdaugh family, including the shooting deaths of Paul and Maggie Murdaugh in June of 2021, currently unsolved; the 2015 death of Stephen Smith, originally attributed to a hit-and-run accident; and the 2018 death of Gloria Satterfield, originally ruled '\"natural\" despite being attributed to a trip-and-fall accident. The State Law Enforcement Division is investigating each of these death cases based on connections to the Murdaugh family, the state agency has said.\n\nIn 2019, Paul Murdaugh was charged with three felony counts of boating under the influence after an alcohol-fueled, early morning boating trip left Hampton County teen Mallory Beach dead and several others injured.\n\nWithin a week of the fatal 1940 train crash, the 14th Circuit had a new Solicitor, Randolph “Buster” Murdaugh Jr., who would continue to grow the Murdaugh family legacy and fortune. He would start by taking legal revenge of sorts for his father's death.\n\nThe 'wrongful death of said Randolph Murdaugh Sr.'\n\nThe historic Charleston & Western Carolina freight line is an ancestor of modern-day CSX Transportation.\n\nPrior to his death, Randolph Sr. had taken on the rail company a time or two, records tell us, but history does not suggest that was a major focus of his practice. But that changed for the Murdaugh family and its law firm in the decades after his untimely death.\n\nAccording to Hampton County Court of Common Pleas records, on Oct. 1, 1940, Randolph Jr., as executor of his father’s will and estate, filed a summons and complaint against the Charleston and Western Carolina Railway Co. The lawsuit brought action on behalf of Randolph’s widow, Mary Murdaugh, and her children for the “wrongful death of said Randolph Murdaugh Sr.”\n\nThe suit alleged that the train was traveling from Yemassee to Varnville “at a high rate of speed” and failed to blow a whistle or ring a bell at the Camp Branch crossing. The suit also alleged that the crossing and its approach “was in a rough, washed out and dangerous condition” and Murdaugh’s view was obscured by trees and tall underbrush on that foggy night, placing him in “sudden and imminent peril.”\n\nBuster Murdaugh demanded a judgement of $100,000 for the death of his father. Court records filed on Sept. 22, 1941, state the case was settled. The amount was not disclosed.\n\n‘Trains have been killing our people ever since’\n\nDuring the early 1900s, Randolph Sr. was in the right place and time to come to the aid of Little Ed Ginn after the tragic train accident. Because of his injury, Ginn missed his chance to serve in World War I, something he regretted for the rest of his life, and spent his remaining days hobbling with a cork leg.\n\nIn later years, other injured people would come to rely on Murdaugh and his law partners for legal help, and help they did, while amassing fortunes in the process over the century to come.\n\nFor more than a hundred years, the Murdaughs ran their private law practice and the 14th Circuit, mixing civil law with criminal law, which was not uncommon at the time.\n\nAs Randolph Murdaugh Sr.’s successors continued in his footsteps, the Murdaugh private law firm acquired more legal partners and legal prowess along the way, which both contributed to the Murdaugh family’s wealth, prominence and connection while also allowing them to focus much of their time on prosecuting criminal cases.\n\nBy the time that Randolph Murdaugh III entered office in 1986, state ethics laws did not allow solicitors to prosecute criminal cases and handle personal injury cases, but by then, the Murdaugh law firm had all the legal might it needed. The one-man practice founded in 1910 had become Peters Murdaugh Parker Eltzroth and Detrick, PA, a South Carolina powerhouse with offices in multiple counties, more than a dozen attorneys and more than 50 local employees. Randolph III would return to the family practice only after he retired from public service in early 2006.\n\nPMPED made a name for itself in defending “the little guy” against the corporate giants, and throughout its history only represented one major corporate client, Palmetto Electric Cooperative, according to its website.\n\nIn the decades that followed the elder Murdaugh’s death, PMPED would defend scores of clients and take on many corporate adversaries, but few targets seemed as favored as the rail companies, including CSX Transportation. The PMPED website, before it was taken down in 2022, listed scores of success stories with multi-million dollar judgements or settlements, with many of those against CSX.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2002, PMPED filed four dozen personal injury cases against CSX, and from 1995 to 2002, CSX paid $18.8 million in verdicts and settlements, stated a 2002 Forbes magazine article, “Home Court Advantage.” The majority of those cases involved railroad accidents that took place outside of the county but were filed in Hampton County Court of Common Pleas due to the state venue laws of the day, which allowed for more “venue shopping.\"\n\nUnder the laws of that time, if a company such as CSX owned property or did business in Hampton County, a lawsuit against that company could be brought to Hampton, even if the train crash and the people involved lived in another S.C. county.\n\nFrom the PMPED point of view, these cases brought in much-needed money and relief for medical or end-of-life expenses for injured motorists or rail workers and their families, stated the firm’s website. The cases PMPED took on and won also brought about major improvements and reforms to railway and transportation safety laws and practices, saving countless lives, they contend.\n\nWith tongue-in-cheek sarcasm, locals in Hampton County dubbed the PMPED law office, one of the grandest buildings in Hampton, “CSX Towers” and “The House That CSX Built.”\n\nTaking on the railroads became such an integral part of the family law firm’s dynasty that the Murdaughs freely and publicly joked about it.\n\n“A train killed my grandfather in 1940, and they have been killing our people ever since,” Randolph Murdaugh III once joked during a speech at a public event in Hampton County in 2018.\n\nLegal reformists began to take a hard look at South Carolina’s tort and venue laws in the late 1990s. In 2004, the American Tort Reform Foundation listed Hampton County as the third-worst “Judicial Hellhole” in the country, based on the number of out-of-county cases handled there, and the above-average amounts of judgements and settlements awarded.\n\nState and local economic development officials began to question if the tort and venue laws of the day, and PMPED's success in using them to their legal advantage, was having a negative impact on the attraction of new industries and companies to that area.\n\nForbes reported that, in 2000, the legal environment in Hampton County, one of the poorest of South Carolina's 46 counties, was directly responsible for at least one big box retailer, WalMart, making a decision not to locate in that county.\n\nAt the time, PMPED partner John E. Parker disputed that notion as \"a propaganda tool\" and claiming that \"if anyone can find such a company, he will promise not to sue it if it moves to Hampton – and represent the company free of charge,\" reported Forbes.\n\nBy February 2005, the Supreme Court of South Carolina issued a decision that changed the state’s venue laws and reduced the level of forum shopping, which began to limit the number of out-of-town cases that could be brought back to Hampton.\n\nIn late 2021, following the ongoing, high-profile criminal cases involving Randolph Sr.’s great-grandson, Alex, who now stands accused of stealing millions from PMPED and its clients, the law firm founded by a Murdaugh, and once dominated by the Murdaugh name, changed its name to Parker Law Group, in honor of John E. Parker's service to the firm.\n\nPMPED is no more, the name \"Murdaugh\" stripped away.\n\nToday, only one member of Randolph Sr.’s lineage, Randolph IV, practices law at this newly organized firm. No member of the Murdaugh family is currently affiliated with the 14th Circuit Solicitor's Office.\n\nAfter the first round of criminal charges was filed against Alex Murdaugh, the 14th Circuit, his former law firm, and even one of his brothers, all issued statements cutting legal ties with him. An order of the South Carolina Supreme Court has suspended his license to practice law in the state.\n\nFor more than a century, the Murdaugh name was synonymous with law, order, and power. Today, if a judge or jury convicted and sentenced Alex Murdaugh consecutively for every crime he is currently charged with, that punishment would theoretically equal the next seven centuries in a South Carolina prison.\n\nAs the Murdaugh dynasty now comes to terms with its own tragedy, the trains roll on through Hampton County.\n\nSources for the historical information in this narrative come from:\n\n- The Hampton County Guardian archives\n\n- Hampton County Court of Common Pleas public records\n\n- Railroads and Sawmills, Varnville, S.C. 1872-1997, 1998, Varnville Community Council\n\n- From the Salkehatchie to the Savannah: A Visual Journey Through Hampton County, 2006, Hampton County Historical Society\n\n- Images of America – Hampton County, 2015, Arcadia Publishing", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/2023/02/13/alex-murdaugh-trial-live-updates-whats-happening-week-4/69898022007/", "title": "Alex Murdaugh trial live, updates: What's happening at start of week 4", "text": "Dr. Ellen Riemer, a forensic pathologist, described the injuries of both Maggie and Paul Murdaugh as severe, catastrophic, and \"immediately fatal.\"\n\nDuring this gruesome, morbid testimony, which included autopsy photos sealed by the court from the public, one female juror clutched her mouth and appeared shaken.\n\nMurdaugh did not look at the pathologist during her entire testimony, instead facing straight ahead and rocking slightly.\n\nMurdaugh attorney Richard Harpootlian is expected to begin what he called an \"extensive\" cross examination at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning.\n\nThe video at the top of the story will play a live video feed of the Monday, Feb. 13 proceedings in the Alex Murdaugh double murder trial or a replay upon completion.\n\nDay 16 of the Alex Murdaugh double murder trial started off with tedious morning filled with scientific DNA testimony, following by graphic and chilling testimony from the forensic pathologist who autopsied the bodies of Maggie and Paul Murduagh.\n\nDr. Ellen Riemer, a forensic pathologist with the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, autopsied both victims on June 10, 2021, three days after they were shot and killed at their family home in Colleton County, Moselle.\n\nRiemer described the injuries of both victims as severe, catastrophic, and \"immediately fatal.\" Some of the evidence she presented brought no surprises - Paul was shot twice with a shotgun, and Maggie multiple times with a rifle. But the full extent of their injuries was not fully known until now.\n\nPaul and Maggie Murdaugh autopsy testimony\n\nPaul was shot at less than three feet away - so close that the plastic shotgun wad became embedded under his skin - as the first shot sent pellets into the left side of his chest and through his left arm. The wound would not have been fatal, said Riemer, and abrasions and exit wounds of the pellets indicated his arms were down and not in a \"defensive\" position or a position of surrender.\n\nThe second shotgun blast - the coup de grace - skipped over the top of his left shoulder into his neck, through the base of his skull and brain stem, before blasting a large exit wound in the right side of his head. His brain was \"ejected\" from the right side of his head, said Riemer, with only a small portion left attached to his brain stem. His brain arrived for autopsy in a separate container, she added.\n\nPaul was facing his shooter when the shots were fired.\n\nDuring this gruesome, morbid testimony, which included autopsy photos sealed by the court from the public, one female juror clutched her mouth and appeared shaken.\n\nMurdaugh did not look at the pathologist during her entire testimony, instead facing straight ahead and rocking slightly. The Murdaugh family members present could not see the exhibits, but appeared shaken.\n\nThe forensic expert then testified that Maggie was shot five times, but added that two of the wounds could have been from the same projectile.\n\nThe 52-year-old mother was shot first in the abdomen and thigh from the front at a close range of roughly three feet, based on the gunshot \"stippling\" burn marks. One of those shots entered her abdomen, pancreas and left kidney before exiting her back, but would not necessarily have been fatal, said Riemer.\n\nThose opening rounds would have made Maggie bend over or fall to her hands and knees, based on the evidence, and the shooter then fired a round that entered and exited her left breast, then entered the left side of her face into the brain before exiting her skull. This wound in itself would have been fatal, she said.\n\nA final wound included an entrance wound to the back of the head near the base of the skull, traveled through her brain stem and cerebellum, before fragmenting and leaving multiple exit wounds along her back. This wound alone would have also been fatal.\n\nA fifth wound to her wrist may have been in conjunction with one of those fatal wounds.\n\nBased on the angles and trajectory of the bullet wounds, Riemer believed that the shooter was \"circling the victim\" as he fired a 300 Blackout caliber rifle.\n\nNeither of the victims had drugs or alcohol in their system, and their stomach contents matched, which collaborates with previous evidence and testimony that Murdaugh asked both of them to come to the Moselle home and have supper.\n\nMurdaugh attorney Richard Harpootlian is expected to begin what he called an \"extensive\" cross examination at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday morning.\n\nMurdaugh defense goes on offensive, attacking DNA, blood evidence\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, Murdaugh attorney Phil Barber conducted a strenuous and arguably effective cross examination of SLED forensic scientist and DNA analyst Sara Zapata. Zapata had testified that DNA samples collected from the white T-shirt that Murdaugh was wearing when police arrived contained DNA that was most likely a mixture of his, Maggie's and Paul's.\n\nIn questioning, Barber pointed out that there was possible DNA under Maggie's fingernails from a different male source, despite the fact that she had been to a nail salon earlier that day.\n\nZapata also testified that there were 74 cuttings made for DNA samples, but after an initial test was \"prospective positive\" for blood, confirmatory \"HemaTrace\" tests were all negative for human blood.\n\n\"So, zero for 74 in detecting blood?\" asked a pressing Barber, before referencing leaked media reports from 2022 that blood spatter evidence had been found by SLED. \"Why was it sent for blood spatter analysis if there was no blood? \"Do you think you can have blood spatter without blood?\"\n\nBarber also showed the court a closeup photo of the T-shirt, which had a logo that appeared to read \"Black Sheep, Hampton, S.C.,\" and described it as a \"fishing shirt.\" Black Sheep is reportedly the name of a boat owned by someone in the Murdaugh family, according to sources.\n\nThrough further questioning, Barber pointed out that the HemaTrace test only tests positive for human blood, as well as higher primates and ferrets, adding that since this was a \"fishing shirt\" and no visible blood was reported, it was possible those stains could have been fish blood. \"Is it fair to say there is no human blood on this shirt?\"\n\nBarber also grilled Zapata on the DNA results of the shirt. \"Would it be uncommon to find a wife's DNA on a husband's shirt?\" he asked, to which the witness replied it would not be unlikely.\n\nThe S.C. Attorney General's Office has now called 40 witnesses, and upon closing the Monday session prosecutor Creighton Waters indicated the State is still on track to rest its case by Wednesday, assuming there are no more surprise witnesses or COVID complications in the jury.\n\nMonday a.m. updates in the Alex Murdaugh murder trial\n\nWeek 4 of the Alex Murdaugh double murder trial opened Monday morning after last week's wild ride that included a bomb threat, a motion for a mistrial and even a GoFundMe controversy involving two of the South Carolina’s key witnesses.\n\nAfter the announcement that two jurors in the double murder trial of disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh have COVID, the State had a major announcement of its own. Almost two years after the double homicides, new evidence is now available.\n\nGeneral Motors initially told state prosecutors that no GPS location data was available for the Chevrolet Suburban that Murdaugh was driving on the night of the killings. But lead prosecutor Creighton Waters informed the court that GM officials contacted him late Friday to inform him that, after further review in this highly publicized and televised case, they somehow found \"a massive amount of data.\"\n\nThe data was shared with the defense, but both parties seemed to agree that the State will give the defense time to review it and seek its own expert reviewers before presenting the evidence and the testimony of any GM officials.\n\nThe evidence and testimony will likely tell the jury a great deal about Murdaugh's movements and activities on the night of the killings.\n\nSLED forensic scientists offer DNA evidence in Murdaugh trial, but where is it leading?\n\nSLED forensic experts offered a lot of often tedious and scientific testimony Monday morning, but at this point it is unclear what impact this confusing data will have on the jury and the trial - or who it helps.\n\nA \"reddish stain\" on the shotgun Murdaugh had in his possession tested \"presumptive positive\" for blood, but the defense is likely to argue that other factors, including rust and bacteria, could trigger a false positive.\n\nZapata testified that DNA swabs taken from the shotgun, Murdaugh's shirt and shorts from the crime scene, tested \"likely\" for having a mixture of DNA from Murdaugh, Paul, and Maggie. However, additional \"confirmatory\" blood testing on Murdaugh's shirt identified that these DNA spots were not identified as human blood. There was not DNA profile obtained from a blue raincoat found at Murdaugh's mother's house after the killings.\n\nCOVID isn't the only threat bearing down on the jury - after today's tedious, scientific testimony, boredom appears to have set in. Several jurors have appeared to be \"checked out\" - they are clock watching, and in some cases nodding off.\n\nMurdaugh trial continues even after jurors test positive for COVID-19\n\nTwo jurors in the double murder trial of disgraced South Carolina attorney Alex Murdaugh have COVID, leaving the future of the proceedings in some doubt as they enter their 16th day.\n\nJudge Clifton Newman decided to keep the trial going in the packed Colleton County courtroom after the remaining 10 jurors and five alternates tested negative. They will be tested again on Wednesday. The clerk of court also tested positive for the virus.\n\nNewman said jurors agreed to wear masks. Masks were provided to the jurors after the COVID announcement was made Monday morning, as well as to members of the media and the public, but four jurors - all white men - declined to wear them.\n\nNewman rejected suggestions from both the defense and prosecutors to delay the trial until that second round of tests Wednesday, reduce the over 200 people allowed to attend the trial each day or order everyone in the courtroom to wear masks other than testifying witnesses and questioning attorneys.\n\n“At the moment, we are going to encourage everyone here to mask up for your own protection as well as the protection of these proceedings and each other,” Newman said.\n\nMurdaugh, 54, faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted of murdering his wife and son near dog kennels at the family’s Colleton County home on June 7, 2021.\n\nMonday marked the fourth week of the trial and the 13th day of testimony with prosecutors still presenting their case. They called state agents who tested evidence for DNA.\n\nThe trial started with six alternate jurors, but is now down to three.\n\n“My only concern is we don’t create train wreck with this jury,” said defense attorney Dick Harpootlian, who immediately began wearing a mask.\n\nProsecutor Creighton Waters said he agreed with the defense that delaying the trial for a few days to make sure COVID-19 isn’t spreading is much better than losing so many jurors there has to be a mistrial and three weeks of work is gone. He also suggested limiting the number of people inside the large, century-old courtroom. The trial is being live streamed and shown on television.\n\n“A little less numbers might be warranted. None of us want to limit anything, but we’re in different paradigm. Both of us have a concern about getting this thing to the end without COVID causing it to fall apart,” Waters said.\n\nThe judge said he would keep all options in mind, but for now the trial will continue without any changes.\n\n“We just have to take precautions as we all do as we navigate through life during this period of time,” Newman said.\n\n- Jeffrey Collins, Associated Press.\n\nLooking back at Week 3 in the Murdaugh murder trial\n\nThe third week of the Murdaugh trial saw the state continue to build its house of circumstantial evidence with gunshot residue as the cement holding together round after round of testimony. On Feb. 8, testimony from the long list of potential witnesses in this trial that is under the national microscope came to a standstill when a bomb threat was called into Colleton County Courthouse.\n\nFollow Michael DeWitt's coverage of the Murdaugh trial on Twitter\n\nCheck back for updates throughout the day.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/south-carolina/2023/01/09/walterboro-colleton-race-for-unprecedented-alex-murdaugh-murder-trial-sc-lowcountry-hampton/69782728007/", "title": "Walterboro, Colleton race for 'unprecedented' Murdaugh murder trial", "text": "Just over 30 miles of South Carolina Highway 63 and the two Salkehatchie Rivers separate Hampton and Colleton counties, but a major criminal trial is about to take place that will link these two rural Lowcountry areas forever in SC history.\n\nOn the night of June 7, 2021, Margaret \"Maggie\" Murdaugh and her younger son Paul died by rifle and shotgun blasts, shot to death at their family estate, Moselle, a sprawl of 1,700 acres that straddles Hampton and Colleton jurisdictions.\n\nNow-disbarred attorney Richard \"Alex\" Murdaugh - a 52-year-old heir to the locally famed family of Hampton attorneys that dominated the 14th Judicial Circuit as three generations of solicitors and through a century old, personal injury powerhouse firm - was charged with the murders along with a slew of financial and drug crimes.\n\nThat double murder trial, set to begin Jan. 23 at the Colleton County Courthouse in Walterboro, will be the biggest televised public attraction in that county since the motion pictures Radio and Forest Gump were filmed there decades ago, and public officials are bracing to get prepared for the anticipated crowds of journalists, legal personnel, and curious spectators.\n\nPower, prestige and privilegePower, prestige and privilege: Inside the rise and fall of the Murdaugh dynasty in South Carolina\n\n'A horrible tragedy' on 'the front porch of the Lowcountry'\n\nWalterboro hails itself as \"The Front Porch of the Lowcountry,\" and this high-profile, double murder trial is expected to draw huge crowds and just may be the biggest thing that Colleton County has ever seen, said CC Clerk of Court Rebecca H.

No one here has any experience with this, but we want to be prepared for any contingencies.\"\n\nDuring the trial, which is scheduled to be held Jan. 23 - Feb. 10, the City of Walterboro's 30 sworn officers and Colleton County's 68-strong Sheriff's Office will be out in force, patrolling streets, directing traffic, designating parking areas, and providing security.\n\nMeanwhile, rumors circulate on social media that throngs of obsessed true-crime fans and cult-like online sleuths will be camping out near the courthouse in hopes of attending the trial, getting a glimpse of Murdaugh, or at the very least visiting the area to see what some are calling a \"media circus.\"\n\n\"We are anticipating a large number of people and we are trying to work out the logistics of parking and navigating an influx into our downtown area for quite possibly an extended period of time,\" said Molinari.\n\nThe Colleton County Courthouse can only legally hold 234 occupants, according to a notice posted inside by the county fire marshals, so the city will use the nearby Walterboro Wildlife Center as a \"media overflow room,\" and Court TV is expected to provide a live feed for all news agencies and its viewers.\n\nThe city has even solicited local entrepreneurs to sign up and park their food trucks outside the Wildlife Center to feed the throngs of journalists, spectators and court personnel.\n\nOfficials are also preparing to make any adjustments needed once the trial begins, then get on with normal life in Colleton County once it's over.\n\n\"We are going to learn a lot after the first week, and we will adjust as necessary moving forward,\" added Molinari. \"Then after the trial is over, it will be back to business as usual. We have a lot of positive things going on in Colleton County, and the city has a lot of exciting projects.\"\n\n\"But this is certainly something that one one here will ever forget, and it will leave a lasting mark on our community.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/09"}]}

Four already have been freed. The Israeli military rescued another earlier this week.\n\nQatari mediators also helped broker a deal that has allowed for limited evacuations of foreign passport holders and some critically injured people from the Gaza Strip, which Israel has been pummeling with air strikes since the Hamas attack last month.\n\nMore than 1,000 people, including more than 100 Americans, already have left the embattled area through the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza as a result of the agreement. Other departures are expected.\n\nHow did Qatar, a wealthy Arab state that’s just a speck on maps of the Middle East, find itself thrust in the middle of international diplomacy?\n\n“Qatar is the only government that has sufficient capability and is looked upon favorably enough by both Hamas and Israel to be willing to engage with them on things like humanitarian issues,” said Jonathan Panikoff, an expert on Middle Eastern affairs with the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan think tank based on Washington.\n\n'They're missing! They're missing!':Inside an American family's frantic fight to free their loved ones held hostage by Hamas\n\n'An essential party' to hostage talks\n\nQatari officials have been holding talks with Hamas, Israeli and U.S. officials about the fate of the hostages. David Barnea, who heads Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad, has reportedly been in Qatar as part of the discussions. Mediators for Qatar have been shuttling between Mossad's Barnea and Hamas leaders to try to secure the hostages’ release.\n\n“Qatar has lines of communication with Hamas that almost nobody else has,” said John Kirby, the White House’s spokesman for national security issues.\n\nIsrael has no formal diplomatic relations with Qatar but has acknowledged its role in the hostage negotiations.\n\n“Qatar is becoming an essential party and stakeholder in the facilitation of humanitarian solutions,” Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel’s national security chief, wrote on Oct. 25 on X, formerly Twitter. “Qatar’s diplomatic efforts are crucial at this time,” he said.\n\nIt’s not the first time Qatar has played the role of international mediator.\n\nQatar helped negotiate the release earlier this year of four Ukrainian children held by Russia, which allowed them to return to their families. A close ally of the U.S., Qatar helped secure the release in 2014 of an American journalist, Peter Theo Curt, who had been held in Syria for two years.\n\nQatar also was instrumental in evacuating refugees from Afghanistan two years ago, when the U.S. withdrew its military forces from the country after the Taliban returned to power following a two-decadelong war. Qatar hosted peace talks between Afghan government negotiators and Taliban representatives. The Taliban still has an office in Qatar.\n\nMore recently, Qatar played a key role in an agreement between the U.S. and Iran that led to the release in September of five Americans imprisoned in Iran. Iran had accused the Americans of being spies or working on behalf of the U.S. government.\n\nTo facilitate the exchange, Qatar agreed to allow $6 billion in Iranian assets frozen in South Korea to be transferred to Doha and for Iran to request access to them for the purchase of humanitarian goods. After the Hamas attack, however, Qatar and the U.S. decided that Iran would not be allowed to access the funds for now.\n\nHurling insults, Molotov cocktails:Jews live in fear as antisemitism rages\n\nQatar's ties to Hamas questioned\n\nQatar’s role in the Gaza hostage discussions has raised some questions because of its ties to Hamas, which the U.S. considers a terrorist organization.\n\nHamas has maintained a political office in Doha, Qatar’s capital, for more than a decade. Qatar also serves as the home of Hamas’ senior leaders in exile, including Khalid Mashaal and Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nThe U.S. sanctioned Mashaal in 2003 for being responsible “supervising assassination operations, bombings and the killing of Israeli settlers.” Washington sanctioned Haniyeh in 2018, saying he had “close links with Hamas’ military wing and has been a proponent of armed struggle, including against civilians.”\n\nFor years, Qatar also has subsidized the salaries of public employees, including teachers and doctors, in Gaza as part of an informal cease-fire brokered by Egypt. Gaza has been under a blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007. Some estimates put those transfers from Qatar to Hamas at $1.5 billion over the past decade.\n\n“The significant majority, potentially the vast majority, of those funds ended up in the bank accounts of Hamas, its employees, or its operatives,” said Asher Fredman, director for Israel at the Abraham Accords Peace Institute.\n\nThe objective of the funds transfers was to provide “just enough money that tensions in Gaza would simmer below the surface but not boil over,” Panikoff said. “They thought it was working.”\n\nThe events of Oct. 7 showed it wasn’t, he said.\n\nOn that day, Hamas militants staged their surprise attack on Israel, killing more than 1,400 people, kidnapping more than 200 hostages and touching off a war that the Hamas-run health ministry says has killed more than 9,000 Palestinians.\n\nIsrael-Hamas war:US spy planes search for hostages in Gaza as Pentagon builds forces in Middle East\n\nA quest for prestige on the world stage\n\nWith its role in the hostage talks, Qatar is seeking to boost its image on the world stage, said Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution’s Center for Middle East Policy.\n\n“Qatar wants to be a player at the same height as the Saudis or Egypt,” Riedel said. “Of course, it never will because it’s a tiny little country with very few citizens.”\n\nQatar, which sits on a peninsula that juts out into the Persian Gulf, has a population of just 2.7 million, but most of its residents are expatriates. Just 300,000 are Qatari citizens.\n\nOne of the world’s richest nations, Qatar’s gas reserves are the third largest in the world after Russia and Iran. It’s also home to Al Jazeera, a state-owned satellite television network with a global audience in more than 150 countries.\n\nQatar’s ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who is just 43, is eager to be seen as a world leader along the ranks of King Abdullah II of Jordan, Riedel said.\n\nFor him and the Qatari officials involved in the hostage talks, “the prestige is about the only thing they are looking for,” Riedel said. “They’ve already got more money than anybody could ever spend. So what else are they looking for in life?”\n\nMichael Collis covers the White House.

Israel's response “may force everyone to take action,” Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said.\n\nThe Houthi militia in Yemen said it fired a “large batch” of missiles and drones in three attacks against Israel on Tuesday. In response, Israeli forces sent missile boats to the Red Sea on Wednesday.\n\nWestern nations, including the U.S., have strongly condemned last month's surprise raid by Hamas against civilian targets inside Israel. Hundreds were killed and thousands injured, and scores more were taken hostage.\n\nThe Israeli military said it has surrounded Gaza City, heightening concerns about civilian casualties at a time when Israel faces increasing pressure to agree to a humanitarian halt in the war, USA TODAY reported Thursday. President Joe Biden has endorsed a humanitarian \"pause.''\n\nIn the Middle East, some nations support Hamas, including Iran, Turkey and Qatar. Iran, which is suspected of helping Hamas plan and execute the attack, has denied involvement. No evidence has been found to substantiate the claim, the White House has said. Iranian officials, however, said the attack was justified as Palestinian self-defense.\n\nThe U.S. has sent 14 Navy ships to the region as a show of force and to discourage Iran and others from attacking Israel. Here some of the major supporters of Israel and Hamas.\n\nWho are the allies of Israel and Hamas?\n\nThough many Western countries side with Israel, not all European Union members completely agree. Spain and Ireland, for example, sympathize with the Palestinians, the BBC reports.\n\nIt’s important to note that support for Hamas is complicated and varied in the region.\n\nGaza Strip\n\nHamas has controlled Gaza since 2007, but not all the people who live there agree with Hamas. Foreign Affairs, a U.S. foreign policy magazine published by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations, reports 67% of 399 Gaza residents said they had either “no trust” or “not a lot of trust\" in Hamas authorities in an Arab Barometer poll taken Sept. 28-Oct. 6. As the war continues, those numbers could change.\n\nIran\n\nIran supports Hamas. Though the two have not always agreed, Iran gives the militant organization about $100 million a year, according to Israel.\n\nIran says it doesn't want the war to spread, but it supports a network of proxy forces, or militant groups with no official connection to the government. They include Hezbollah in Lebanon and other groups in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. Over the years, these groups, sometimes known as the \"axis of resistance,\" have launched limited strikes against Israel and U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria, the Guardian reports.\n\nLebanon\n\nThe nation is a base for Hezbollah, and other Palestinian groups in Lebanon have claimed responsibility for past attacks on Israel. About 80% of 400 people surveyed in Lebanon support the Hamas attacks, according to a poll by the newspaper Al-Akhbar.\n\nBut “all of Lebanon, including Hezbollah − we don’t want a war,” said Lebanon’s foreign minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, according to The New York Times.\n\nTurkey\n\nTurkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the EU, supports Hamas. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said Hamas is a liberation group, not a terrorist organization.\n\nQatar\n\nOfficially, Qatar supports Hamas and hosts senior leaders of Hamas. But it also has developed a security partnership with the U.S. The Al Udeid Air Force Base in Doha is headquarters of the U.S. Central Command and the U.S. Air Force Central Command.\n\nQatar has become a mediator in negotiations over hostages held by Hamas.\n\nSyria\n\nSyria supports Hamas, the Jewish Policy Center says. Its president, Bashar al-Assad, has weaponized Islamic extremism against Israel and the U.S.\n\nWhat is the 'axis of resistance'?\n\nAside from nations, an Iranian-backed network of militant groups known as the axis of resistance has been operating against Israel, sometimes on behalf of Iran. Now axis members are threatening to join the Israel-Hamas conflict. The groups include:\n\nHamas and Palestinian Jihad in Gaza\n\nand in Gaza Hezbollah in Lebanon\n\nin Lebanon Houthis in Yemen\n\nin Yemen Shia militias in Syria\n\nin Syria Popular Mobilization Force in Iraq\n\nThe war surrounding Israel: Where countries, leaders and militant groups in the region stand\n\nWhat nations say they are neutral?\n\nJordan\n\nJordan, a U.S. ally, is officially neutral on the conflict. It signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1994. But now Jordan fears it will be drawn into the fighting if Iran enters the war. It has asked the U.S. for Patriot air defense missile systems to protect itself.\n\nEgypt\n\nEgypt has been a mediator between Israel and Hamas, including negotiating cease-fires. Though Egypt has blocked its border with Gaza, it has asked Israel to limit its airstrikes and advised Hamas to treat its hostages well to prevent escalation of the war, Reuters reports.\n\nChina\n\nChina said it is not taking a side in the war, Time magazine reports. After the Hamas incursion, however, China said it opposed acts that harm civilians but did not condemn Hamas for the attack. It later denounced Israel's retaliation against Hamas in Gaza. China has offered to mediate a resolution between Israel and Hamas.\n\nRussia\n\nLike China, Russia isn't officially taking a side in the war. Moscow has criticized Israel and Hamas. But Russia expects the war to draw world attention away from its war in Ukraine. Members of Hamas met with Russian officials in Moscow on Oct. 26.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSaudi Arabia and Israel were working toward establishing formal diplomatic relations when Hamas launched its attack. The Saudis paused the effort after Israel's retaliation in Gaza.\n\nSaudi Arabia has recently eased its policy of prosecuting Hamas members as part of a terrorist organization, Politico reports, in hope of reducing criticism of the diplomatic effort. The Oct. 7 attack has put future efforts in doubt.\n\n_________\n\nSOURCE USA TODAY Network reporting and research; Associated Press; Council on Foreign Relations; eeas.europa.eu; U.S. Naval Institute; Foreign Policy Research Institute", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/11/24/cease-fire-hostages-israel-hamas-war-live-updates/71686579007/", "title": "Israel-Hamas temporary truce day 1 recap: More hostages to be freed", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest news on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here.\n\nHamas was preparing to release 14 Israeli hostages Saturday for 42 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, according to Egyptian officials, in an exchange that comes on the second day of a cease-fire that has allowed critical humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and given civilians their first respite after seven weeks of war.\n\nOn the first day of the four-day cease-fire, Hamas released 24 of the about 240 hostages taken during its Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war. The exchange also resulted in the release of 39 Palestinian women and children who were held in Israeli jails.\n\n\"It’s only a start,\" Biden said in an address from Nantucket on Friday afternoon. \"But so far it’s gone well.\"\n\nHe said the agreement was the result of \"a lot of hard work,\" including diplomatic efforts by the United States, Qatar and Egypt. The four-day pause in fighting started at 7 a.m. local time, midnight EST. The deal calls for the release of a total of 50 hostages taken by Hamas and 150 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.\n\nBoth sides agreed to release women and children. Israel also agreed to extend the pause in fighting by one day for every 10 additional hostages Hamas releases.\n\n\"We expect more hostages to be released tomorrow\" and the days following, Biden said. He said it wasn't clear when some of the Americans still in Hamas captivity would be released, but he expects it to happen.\n\nThe hostages released Friday included some 13 Israelis, 10 Thai nationals and one Filipino citizen, according to Majed al-Ansari, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of Qatar, one of the countries that served as a mediator in the agreement. The Israelis included children and women, including several elderly women. They underwent an initial medical assessment in Israeli territory and will be transported to Israeli hospitals, according to Israel's military.\n\nThe Schneider Children’s Medical Center said it was treating eight Israelis — four children and four women — and all appeared to be in good physical condition. The center said they were also receiving psychological treatment, adding that “these are sensitive moments” for the families.\n\nThe Palestinian prisoners released were 24 women, including some convicted of attempted murder for attacks on Israeli forces, and 15 teenagers jailed for offenses like throwing stones.\n\nThe cease-fire comes more than six weeks after an estimated 240 people were captured and held hostage by Hamas after its deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The temporary pause in fighting had been scheduled to begin Thursday but was delayed by what al-Ansari said were logistical issues, including verification of the hostage release list exchanged by Israel and Hamas officials.\n\nOn the first day of the truce, over 200 trucks of desperately needed supplies, including fuel, were delivered to Gaza. A respite from weeks of attacks was felt in the territory, and rocket fire from Hamas into Israel went silent as well.\n\nLatest developments:\n\n◾ Two Palestinians were killed Friday and 11 others were wounded as Israeli forces fired at people attempting to return to northern Gaza near a main combat zone despite Israel's warnings to stay put, the Associated Press reported.\n\n◾ No U.S. citizens were in the first group of hostages released by Hamas on Friday, and Biden said he is not sure when they will, but remains hopeful Americans will be among the first 50 hostages released over four days. \"We don’t know when that will occur, but expect it to occur,\" Biden said.\n\n◾ Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it has received a new list of hostages to be released by Hamas on Saturday. After Israel approves the names, a list of Palestinians in prison expected for release Saturday will be sent to Hamas, Haaretz reported.\n\nHostages to be freed:Inside the 'excruciating' work of a secret US cell that secured the release of 50 hostages\n\nDon't return to north Gaza, Israel warns amid halt in fighting\n\nIsrael's military warned people not to return to their homes in the northern parts of Gaza as the temporary cease-fire got underway Friday.\n\n\"The war is not over yet. The humanitarian pause is temporary. The northern Gaza Strip is a dangerous war zone and it is forbidden to move north,\" said Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee, an Arabic language spokesman for Israel's Defense Forces.\n\nIn the days leading up to the pause, Israel's government has repeatedly said it sees the halt in fighting as a limited measure only to allow for the freeing of hostages. It has rejected calls for a comprehensive cease-fire.\n\nAbout 1.7 million people, three-quarters of Gaza's population, have been displaced since Oct. 7.\n\nFather of American hostage does not expect son to be released\n\nAs dozens of families await word on whether their loved ones will be released in the hostage and prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas, American Jonathan Dekel-Chen, 60, is keeping his expectations low.\n\n\"It will not involve my son. I am as certain of that as one can be,\" he said in a brief phone interview.\n\nDekel-Chen's son, Sagui, 35, hasn't been heard from since Hamas invaded his home on Nir Oz kibbutz, in southern Israel, on Oct. 7. He lived there with his two daughters, ages 2 and 6, and his pregnant wife. They escaped.\n\nOf the 50 hostages due to be released over four days beginning Friday, most if not all are expected to be women and children, according to Israel and Qatari officials.\n\n\"I will be overjoyed for those families who can be reunited with their loved ones,\" Dekel-Chen said.\n\nHe described his son, an entrepreneur whose \"moonlighting gig is repurposing old buses for new uses,\" as \"the son anyone would love to have. You can't meet him and not smile. He's endlessly positive. He's a builder. He's a creator. He's been that his entire life.\"\n\nPalestinians waiting to hear news about their children\n\nPalestinian teenager Samed Khaled Abu Khalaf, 17, could be one of several dozen Palestinians, mostly women and children, who could be released from an Israeli prison today, according to his family.\n\nHis father, Khaled, 51, said in a brief WhatsApp message Friday that his son was detained by Israel seven months ago. He said he doesn't know why his son was imprisoned.\n\n\"Today, God willing,\" he said.\n\nThe teenager's name appears on a list, reviewed by USA TODAY, of 300 Palestinians that Israel's justice ministry said are eligible to form part of a hostage and prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas. Information under his name says he was arrested in April for \"damage to the security of the area.\"\n\nThe family lives in a village in the eastern part of the West Bank.\n\nPalestinian prisoners’ rights group Addameer says that Israel has about 200 boys, most of them teenagers, in detention, as well as several teenage girls. International and Palestinian human rights organizations have long alleged that Israel mistreats its child detainees, whom it prosecutes in military courts and holds for indefinite periods of time. Israel says they are detained for suspected terror-related offenses.\n\nKhaled Mahmoud Abu Khalaf says he is waiting to get a call from the International Committee of the Red Cross to hear whether his son will be freed. The group is helping to facilitate releases on both sides.\n\nUnited Nations chief describes worsening conditions in Gaza\n\nA United Nations agency head described deteriorating conditions in Gaza on Friday following his second visit to the strip since the war began.\n\n“People are going to sleep holding their children tight while not knowing if they will wake up alive the following morning,” said Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner-general of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA.\n\nPeople were struggling to have one meal a day and many have not changed their clothes for more than a month, Lazzarini said. Skin diseases and diarrhea have increased exponentially, a consequence of unsanitary conditions worsened by rain. Most of the shops and pharmacies were closed, and some of the streets were eerily empty. Lazzarini said the strikes were constant, and at some points, whole buildings shook.\n\nA vocational training center, once the organization’s “pride and joy,” now resembled an overcrowded prison as 35,000 people took shelter, Lazzarini said. He noted 69 UNRWA shelters have been hit since the war began, some more than once and some directly. Half of them were not in the north.\n\nLazzarini called for a longstanding humanitarian cease-fire, reopening of commercial supply lines to revive the private sector and replenish empty markets, and expansion of humanitarian aid. He also warned against deepening polarizations the longer the war continued, and slimmer chances of a “political solution.”\n\nHow tiny Qatar became a big player in the hostage release\n\nQatar, a tiny Persian Gulf nation with an abundance of natural gas reserves and a desire for prestige on the world stage, has become a pivotal player in the fate of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nQatar has taken on the role of intermediary in negotiations aiming to secure the release of more than 200 hostages captured by Hamas in its attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nQatari mediators also helped broker a deal that has allowed for limited evacuations of foreign passport holders and some critically injured people from the Gaza Strip, which Israel has been pummeling with air strikes since the Hamas attack.\n\nIt’s not the first time Qatar has played the role of international mediator.\n\nQatar helped negotiate the release earlier this year of four Ukrainian children held by Russia, which allowed them to return to their families. A close ally of the U.S., Qatar helped secure the release in 2014 of an American journalist, Peter Theo Curt, who had been held in Syria for two years.\n\nMore recently, Qatar played a key role in an agreement between the U.S. and Iran that led to the release in September of five Americans imprisoned in Iran. Iran had accused the Americans of being spies or working on behalf of the U.S. government.\n\nWho are the Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners awaiting release?\n\nThree Americans were among the hostages set for release including 3-year-old Avigail Edan, whose parents were killed during the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, as well as two women, according to a senior Biden administration official.\n\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal also included a provision for the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit the hostages in captivity.\n\nIsrael’s Justice Ministry published a list of 300 Palestinians eligible for release from prison, mainly teenagers arrested over the past year for relatively minor offenses such as throwing rocks. The youngest detainee on the list is 14. The list also includes about 40 women. The detainees are to be released to their homes in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza.\n\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/usanow/2014/07/14/israel-gaza-palestinian-conflict/12616193/", "title": "Egypt proposes cease-fire for Israel, Hamas", "text": "Mariam Hamed\n\nSpecial for USA TODAY\n\nGAZA CITY — A cease-fire plan proposed by Egypt is the most serious attempt yet by international mediators to end bloody fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHamas' top leader in Gaza confirmed Monday there was \"diplomatic movement,\" while Israel's policy-making Security Cabinet was set to discuss the proposal early Tuesday.\n\nIn Washington, President Obama welcomed the proposal to stop the bloodshed.\n\n\"We're going to continue to do everything we can to facilitate a return to the 2012 cease-fire,\" Obama said at a White House dinner celebrating the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. \"We are encouraged that Egypt has made a proposal to accomplish that goal.\"\n\nArab foreign ministers discussed the plan Monday night at an emergency meeting in Cairo.\n\nAlthough U.S. officials had said Secretary of State John Kerry was considering a trip to the region to push diplomatic efforts there, Kerry has decided to end his nine-day trip and return to the U.S., according to the Associated Press. He had been in Vienna for talks aimed at halting Iran's nuclear program.\n\nWith at least 185 people dead in a week of heavy fighting, both sides have come under increasing international pressure to halt the fighting.\n\nIn Washington, White House spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said the U.S. hopes the plan will lead to calm being restored as soon as possible.\n\nIsrael is demanding guarantees of an extended period of quiet, while Hamas seeks an easing of an Israeli-Egyptian blockade on Hamas-ruled Gaza. Israel launched the offensive last week, saying it was a response to weeks of heavy rocket fire out of Gaza.\n\nEgypt's Foreign Ministry announced the three-step plan starting with a temporary cease-fire to go into effect within 12 hours of \"unconditional acceptance\" by the two sides. That would be followed by the opening of Gaza's border crossings and talks in Cairo between the sides within two days, according to the statement.\n\nIn a speech broadcast on Al-Jazeera, Ismail Haniyeh, a Hamas leader in Gaza, confirmed that there was \"diplomatic movement.\"\n\nBut on CNN, Hamas spokesman Osama Hamdan called the cease-fire proposal a publicity stunt and \"joke.'' However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said he is hopeful that \"we may see some real, real serious signs of a possible cease-fire in the next 12-24 hours.\"\n\nEgypt, the first Arab state to reach peace with Israel, often serves as a mediator between Israel and Hamas.\n\nThe Israeli military said three rockets were fired at the southern city of Eilat early Tuesday morning, lightly injuring two people and sparking a fire. The military said it did not immediately know who was behind the rocket fire. Previous rocket attacks on Eilat were from radical Islamic militants in the neighboring Sinai Peninsula.\n\nIsrael's military said that it shot down an unmanned drone along its southern coastline, the first time it has encountered such a weapon since its struggle with Gaza Strip militants began last week.\n\nThe military said the drone came from Gaza and was downed by a Patriot missile near the southern city of Ashdod.\n\nThe development comes as thousands of residents are fleeing northern Gaza at the urging of the Israeli military and as Israel's ground troops briefly crossed the border Sunday on a mission to destroy a launching site used by militants.\n\n\"We (left) after Israel threatened to bomb our house,\" said Samar Elewa, 19, of Bet Lahiya, in northern Gaza Strip. \"We did not know where to go. We found other families walking on the street, and we decided to go to the UNRWA (the United Nation's refugee agency) school.\"\n\n\"In the school, we can't sleep — I feel like we are refugees in our own country,\" said Elewa.\n\nSince the conflict began, militants have fired nearly 1,000 rockets at Israel, causing some injuries and damage to property, but no fatalities among Israelis. By contrast, 175 Palestinians have died as a result of Israel's air attacks. More than 1,200 have been injured, Gaza's health ministry said.\n\nThe use of drones with an offensive capacity could inflict significant casualties — something the rockets from Gaza have failed to do, largely because of the success of the Israeli military's \"Iron Dome\" air-defense system in shooting them down.\n\n\n\n\"Hamas is trying everything it can to produce some kind of achievement, and it is crucial that we maintain our high state of readiness,\" Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said. \"The shooting down of a drone this morning by our air-defense system is an example of their efforts to strike at us in any way possible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday night, the military wing of Hamas briefly hacked news coverage on Channel 10, one of Israel's two commercial broadcasters. Government websites also reportedly were hacked.\n\nHamas inserted images of wounded Gazans into the Channel 10 broadcast and the message: \"Your government chose the time to launch this campaign. Your government will not agree to our terms, so prepare yourselves for an extended stay in the bomb shelters.\"\n\nIt was not the first time during the latest conflict that the Palestinian group has hacked an Israeli broadcaster, but it was the first time viewers had complained, the Jerusalem Post reported. Channel 10 is carried by U.S. cable companies.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Syrian Electronic Army hacking group posted bogus tweets on the Israeli Army's Twitter account. One claimed the Dimona nuclear facility was leaking.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that the current Israeli operation could last for \"a long time\" and that the military was prepared \"for all possibilities.\"\n\nCalls for a cease-fire are growing internationally as casualties mount. Protests have flared in Paris and elsewhere against the Israeli operation, which aims to prevent Hamas and affiliated groups from targeting Israeli territory with rockets.\n\nContributing: Michele Chabin in Jerusalem; William M.

In a week of airstrikes and rocket attacks, at least 212 Palestinians and 10 Israelis have been killed.\n\nBut while the United States has significant leverage in the region and has long sought to broker a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians, the White House is not the most important player right now.\n\nHere's a look at the roles and motivations of those engaged in the military confrontation – and those trying to end it.\n\nHamas\n\nHamas is a militant Islamic group that does not recognize Israel's right to exist. It was started in 1987 by a Palestinian cleric, and since 2007, Hamas has controlled Gaza, a small patch of land bordering the Mediterranean Sea and home to about 2 million Palestinians.\n\nThe United States and the European Union consider Hamas a terrorist organization. Hamas' military tactics against Israel have shifted over the years from plotting suicide bombings to amassing an arsenal of rockets of varying accuracy.\n\nThe group has long been opposed to peace talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, the umbrella political organization that runs the West Bank with the Fatah Movement. Hamas condemned the 1993 Oslo Accords, under which the Palestinians gained a measure of governing authority over parts of the West Bank and Gaza, while the PLO formally recognized Israel.\n\nIn the current conflict, Israel’s military says Hamas has fired more than 3,000 rockets at civilian targets in Israel. The Israel Defense Forces say they have intercepted about 90% of those with Israel's sophisticated Iron Dome missile defense system.\n\nHamas, which has a political wing as well as a military one, is trying to capitalize on the disarray in Palestinian politics and to \"get a leg up on Fatah,\" Michael Koplow of the Israel Policy Forum, wrote in an analysis. Fatah is a rival Palestinian political party operating in the West Bank and led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a hard-line leader who has aggressively promoted Jewish settlements in the West Bank and other Palestinian enclaves.\n\nCritics say his policies helped set the stage for the current conflict by creating a sense of hopelessness among Palestinians who want their own independent state. One spark for the confrontation was an effort by Jewish settlers to evict Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem.\n\nNetanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, has been unable to assemble a governing coalition after four successive elections in which the Israeli electorate declined to give his right-wing Likud party a clear majority. The Israeli leader has been scrambling to stay in power in part because he faces a corruption trial and has been seeking immunity from Israel's parliament.\n\nJon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while “everything (Netanyahu) does is politically calculated,” he does not believe the Israeli leader is using the conflict to distract from his own political problems.\n\nBut it is having that effect nonetheless: A bid from rival factions to assemble a governing majority collapsed when the violence erupted. At least one of the rival factions had planned to enter into a coalition that included, for the first time in Israel's history, an Arab Israeli political party.\n\nBiden and the US\n\nThe U.S. considers Israel its most important ally in the Middle East, and it sends more than $3 billion a year in security assistance to Israel.\n\nCritics have pounded Biden for his handling of the conflict, with many saying his administration has not prioritized Israeli-Palestinian issues and missed several opportunities to intervene before it became a military confrontation.\n\nPrevious presidents, from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama, have appointed high-profile envoys to try to broker a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians. Former President Donald Trump tasked his son-in-law and top adviser Jared Kushner to develop what they hoped would be a breakthrough peace proposal.\n\nBut those efforts have all failed, and some believe Biden did not want to devote precious foreign policy capital on a conflict that has frustrated even the most seasoned diplomats.\n\n\"What he wants to avoid, above all, is a fight with Israel that could prove politically costly at home,\" Peter Beinart, editor at large of left-leaning magazine Jewish Currents, wrote in an essay last week. Beinart noted that when the conflict erupted, the administration sent a midlevel envoy to the region to help mediate.\n\nBiden’s national security advisers say he has been deeply engaged. On Monday, Biden expressed support for a cease-fire in a call with Netanyahu, according to a White House readout. Biden has spoken with Netanyahu several times since the violence erupted, and he spoke with Abbas over the weekend. The U.S. does not have any lines of communications with Hamas because of its status as a designated terrorist group.\n\nMartin Indyk, a former U.S. special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, says Biden can't solve the crisis, in part because both Hamas and Israel want to preserve the status quo.\n\n\"Both sides’ objectives in this round are strictly limited,\" Indyk wrote in a Foreign Affairs op-ed May 14. \"Hamas hopes to enhance its standing among Palestinians; Israel hopes to reestablish its deterrence against Hamas’s attacks on its citizens. Neither side is interested in having the United States broker a two-state solution.\"\n\nBut he said Biden cannot ignore the conflict.\n\n\"The Biden administration will need to manage the conflict in a way that helps create a political horizon for the Palestinians,\" he said, which means pushing Israel to freeze Israeli settlements and pressure Abbas to reschedule planned elections.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United Nations\n\nSoon after the fighting began, the Egyptian government sent mediators to try to broker a cease-fire, and many see Cairo's role as pivotal.\n\n\"The only ones who have real leverage on Hamas right now are the Egyptians,\" Dennis Ross, a former U.S. diplomat who worked for years on the Middle East peace process, told CNN last week.\n\nHe noted that Egypt, which shares a border with Gaza, has helped broker the past four cease-fires in the region, including in 2014.\n\n\"They're in a position where they go to Hamas and they can say, 'We can use our influence with the Israelis as well, but if you're not responsive to us, don't expect us to save you from the Israelis and don't expect us to open the border,'\" Ross said.\n\nQatar and United Nations officials also are trying to broker a truce. But the talks have faltered.\n\nHamas’ top leader,Ismail Haniyeh, told The Associated Press that the group has been contacted by the United Nations, Russia, Egypt and Qatar but “will not accept a solution that is not up to the sacrifices of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nNetanyahu has not shown interest in a cease-fire, saying Israel hasn't yet achieved its military objectives.\n\n\"We're trying to degrade Hamas's terrorist abilities and to degrade their will to do this again,\" he said in an interview on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nIndyk said the Egyptians and other players eventually will bring about a truce, but he offered a grim view of what would follow.\n\n\"Both sides bury their dead, clear the rubble, and go back to business as usual\" while the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas prepare for the next round, he wrote. \"The Biden administration’s approach so far suggests that Washington will be comfortable accepting this unhappy ending.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/11/21/israel-palestinians-gaza-conflict/1718591/", "title": "Cease-fire between Israel and Hamas has shaky start", "text": "Michele Chabin, Special for USA TODAY\n\nDiplomats pressed for cease-fire from Israel and Hamas as fighting continued\n\nReports of attacks despite commencement of cease-fire\n\nPresident Obama called to congratulate Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nJERUSALEM — A cease-fire between Israel and Hamas was announced Wednesday after days of bloody fighting and deaths on both sides.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Amr announced the cease-fire, which took effect at 2 p.m. ET.\n\nHowever, it appeared that the cease-fire got off to a shaky start. Five minutes after it took effect, four Grad rockets were fired at the southern city of Beersheva. Within minutes, rockets were also fired at other southern towns and cities.\n\nHaaretz reported that the Israel Defense Forces struck a home in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis belonging to a leader of the Islamic Jihad movement. Hamas said the attack took place after the cease fire began. Israel denied this.\n\n\"We're just hoping the cease fire will take hold,\" said Moshe Sherf, a resident of the coastal city of Ashkelon.\n\nThe cease-fire announcement came after furious negotiations between diplomats, including Clinton who has been in Cairo for talks with Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, who has acted as a mediator between the two groups.\n\n\"The people of this region deserve the chance to live in peace,\" Clinton said at a news conference with Amr to announce the cease-fire.\n\nShe called it a \"critical moment\" for the region.\n\n\"Egypt's new government is assuming responsibility and leadership that has long made it a cornerstone of regional stability and peace,\" Clinton said.\n\nClinton said that for the cease-fire to hold, \"the rocket attacks must end and a broader calm must return.\"\n\n\"There is no substitute for a just and lasting peace,\" Clinton said. \"Now that there is a cease-fire, I am looking forward to working with the foreign minister and others to move this process.\"\n\nPresident Obama spoke by phone Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, thanking him for agreeing to the cease-fire and reaffirming the U.S. commitment to Israel's security.\n\n\"The president made clear that no country can be expected to tolerate rocket attacks against civilians,\" the White House said. \"The president expressed his appreciation for the prime minister's efforts to work with the new Egyptian government to achieve a sustainable cease-fire and a more durable solution to this problem.\"\n\nThe announcement came on a day when a bomb ripped through an Israeli bus near the nation's military headquarters in Tel Aviv, wounding at least 27 people.\n\nFor a cease-fire to hold, Hamas must enforce it on all factions in Gaza, said retired Israeli brigadier general Mike Herzog, an analyst at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.\n\nHamas \"seems to be reluctant to force it on others, but they'll have to make a choice,\" he said.\n\nThough it is clear that Israel \"seriously degraded\" Hamas' capabilities, the Palestinian faction — designated a terrorist organization by the State Department — is still a threat, Herzog says.\n\nIsraeli jets and drones have succeeded in destroying weapons caches, smuggling tunnels, weapons manufacturing plants and command and control structures, Herzog said. Hamas still has \"a sizable arsenal and still can continue to function,\" he said.\n\n\"To really root them out, Israel would have to go into Gaza\" with ground troops, he said.\n\nA lot of Hamas' infrastructure and rocket launchers are inside civilian areas, which poses a challenge to Israel in minimizing Palestinian civilian casualties, he said.\n\nThough the details of the cease-fire are unclear, a Hamas leader says cease-fire deal includes opening of all Gaza crossings, including with Egypt. Opening up the border with Egypt, would make Hamas \"literally the new king of Gaza,\" said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. adviser on Arab-Israeli negotiations to Republican and Democratic secretaries of State and now vice president of the Woodrow Wilson Center, a Washington think-tank.\n\nIf the opening is meaningful, Hamas \"will have significant leverage\" over smaller rival militant groups that are likely to attempt to spoil the deal with further attacks on Israel, Miller said.\n\nOn the streets of Jerusalem, reaction to the cease-fire was mixed.\n\n\"The Israeli government looks weak in the eyes of the world, in the eyes of the Arab street and worst of all in the eyes of their own citizens who have been facing missile attacks day in and day out since Israel pulled out of Gaza,\" said Joshua Halickman of Jerusalem.\n\nFern Reiss, an American living in Jerusalem, said, \"As we go into Thanksgiving, with millions of Israelis in the south still eating dinner in their bomb shelter — but with the promise of a cease-fire on the horizon — I am truly thankful for everything we have.\"\n\nYael Talker, a resident from Kibbutz Reim near the Gaza border who spoke by phone from Ra'anana, where she has taken refuge from the rockets since last Friday, said that before she will return home with her two children, \"I'll have to see whether the cease-fire is real. I'll take it day by day. We have no personal bomb shelters and had to sleep in the (reinforced) kindergarten.\"\n\n\"If the cease-fire holds for just a while, it's not enough,\" Talker said.\n\nFighting between Israel and Hamas has raged on both sides of the border even as negotiations continued.\n\nClinton released a statement when she arrived in Cairo saying, \"I am closely monitoring reports from Tel Aviv, and we will stay in close contact with Prime Minister Netanyahu's team. The United States stands ready to provide any assistance that Israel requires.\"\n\nClinton met with Netanyahu Tuesday night.\n\nThe bus exploded around noon on one of the coastal city's busiest arteries, near the Tel Aviv museum and across from an entrance to the Kirya, Israel's national defense headquarters.\n\nThe bus was charred and blackened, its side windows blown out and its glass scattered on the asphalt.\n\nPolice spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said authorities were investigating whether the bomb had been planted and left on the bus or whether it was the work of a suicide bomber.\n\nIsraeli aircraft pounded Gaza with at least 30 strikes overnight, hitting government ministries, smuggling tunnels, a banker's empty villa and a Hamas-linked media office two floors above the office of the French news agency Agence France-Presse.\n\nFULL COVERAGE:Latest developments on Israel-Gaza conflict\n\nA Haaretz-Dialogue poll found that 84% of Jewish and Arab Israelis expressed support for the latest bombing operation, called Operation Pillar of Defense. Only 30% said they would support an all-out ground operation into Gaza.\n\nHagit Ofran, spokesperson for Peace Now, a group promoting territorial compromise, called Wednesday's bus bombing \"a brutal attack that horrifies every Israeli.\" She said Israel's precarious security situation \"reinforces the urgent need for an agreement\" resulting in \"a two-state solution.\"\n\nContributing: Vanessa O'Brien, Naser Najjar and Oren Dorell; Associated Press.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/11/09/israel-hamas-war-gaza-live-updates/71514275007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war live updates: Daily four-hour pauses in Gaza ...", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest news on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here.\n\nIn a crucial breakthrough for the global effort to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza, Israel has agreed to daily four-hour pauses in fighting across northern Gaza, the White House said Thursday.\n\nU.S. National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said the Israelis had committed to announcing each four-hour window at least three hours in advance starting Thursday. Israel also was opening a second corridor for civilians to flee the areas being pounded by Israel's military campaign aimed at wiping out Hamas after the brutal Oct. 7 attack on border communities, with a coastal road joining the territory’s main north-south highway, he said.\n\nBy Thursday night, though, there was still no sign the fighting had stopped or confirmation of such plans from Israel, Reuters reported.\n\n\"The fighting continues against the Hamas enemy, the Hamas terrorists,'' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a Fox News interview that aired Thursday. \"But in specific locations, for a given period of a few hours here, a few hours there, we want to facilitate a safe passage of civilians away from the zone of fighting. And we're doing that.''\n\nPauses in the fighting have been taking place intermittently for days while tens of thousands of civilians flee northern Gaza for the south. The U.S. and several other nations have been urging Israel to provide more time for safe passage and for the safe flow of humanitarian aid into war-battered Gaza.\n\nKirby also said the pauses could help the effort to win freedom for at least some of the approximately 240 hostages, including several Americans, held by Hamas and other militants since the war began. President Joe Biden told reporters he asked the Israelis for a “pause longer than three days” in talks about freeing the hostages.\n\nUS fighter jets strike Syria:Hit militia's facility in response to attacks\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Palestinian Islamic Jihad released a video of two hostages Thursday − a 77-year-old woman and a 13-year-old boy − and said it would be willing to free them if its conditions are met. The militant group, which has said it's holding at least 30 hostages, did not specify the conditions.\n\n∎ An Israeli fighter jet killed Ibrahim Abu-Maghsib, head of Hamas’ Anti-Tank Missile Unit, the Israeli military said. Maghsib directed and carried out numerous anti-tank missile launches directed at Israeli civilians and soldiers, the military said.\n\n∎ Assistant Secretary of State Barbara Leaf told a House panel the number of Palestinian deaths in Gaza, which its Health Ministry said Thursday has surpassed 10,800, could be even higher. It's “very possible,” she said.\n\n∎ At least 45% of the housing in Gaza has been damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombardment, according to the U.N., which said the territory's gross domestic product shrank by 4% in the first month of the war and would decline by 8.4% − the equivalent of $1.7 billion − if the conflict extends through a second month.\n\n∎ Western and Arab officials gathered in Paris on Thursday to discuss ways of providing more aid to civilians in Gaza. The talks come one day after the Group of Seven democracies called for the unimpeded delivery of food, water, medicine and fuel, as well as humanitarian pauses in fighting.\n\nConditions improving in Gaza's south but not in north\n\nIsraeli officials said last week they had split the Gaza Strip in half, and the stark reality of what that means is becoming increasingly clear for Palestinians still in the north.\n\nDavid Satterfield, the United States humanitarian envoy, said conditions in south and central Gaza have improved as the influx of aid trucks has increased lately to an average of about 100 a day. But there's no indication the aid is reaching the north, where much of the Israeli bombardment is focused. Israel has urged Palestinians to move to safe zones in the south, and tens of thousands are now doing so daily.\n\nSatterfield also said Thursday the international community has provided fuel to turn back on water desalination plants in the south, and that two pipelines supplying clean drinking water to the south from Israel are operating again.\n\n“We do see the ability in the coming days we hope to meet the minimum requirements of the population in the south,” he said.\n\nThe north, where hundreds of thousands still remain, is not getting those benefits, though Satterfield said arrangements are being made to move wounded people south.\n\nIsraeli raid in West Bank kills 13, including militants\n\nAt least 13 people were killed Thursday in an Israeli raid into the West Bank’s Jenin refugee camp, Palestinian health officials said, raising to more than 170 the number of Palestinians who have died in the enclave during clashes with Israeli forces or settlers since the war started.\n\nThe attack, which included the use of a drone strike, killed at least 10 militants, according to the Israeli military, which also reported arresting more than 20 Palestinians. Hamas said nine of its fighters had died.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said one of its paramedics was wounded when Israeli forces targeting an ambulance shot him in the back.\n\nMilitant attacks on U.S., coalition forces persist in Middle East\n\nU.S. defense officials reported Thursday three minor injuries to American and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria after repeated aggression in the last 24 hours by Iranian-backed militant groups.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pentagon said it struck a weapons warehouse used by militants in Syria in response to the persistent hostilities, which have included rocket and drone attacks.\n\nDeputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said U.S. and coalition forces have been attacked 46 times since Oct. 17, injuring 56 personnel. All of them returned to duty.\n\nProtesters stage sit-in at New York Times headquarters\n\nPro-Palestinian demonstrators on Thursday occupied The New York Times lobby, demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and accusing the media of bias in its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war, the Associated Press reported.\n\nLed by a group of media workers calling themselves “Writers Bloc,” hundreds of protestors gathered outside the media company’s Manhattan headquarters. Some entered the building for a sit-in vigil that lasted more than an hour, the AP said.\n\nProtestors read the names of thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza, starting with the youngest and including at least 36 journalists who have been confirmed dead in the war, the news outlet said.\n\nDemonstrators scattered editions of a self-produced mock newspaper, “The New York War Crimes,” calling on the Times’ editorial board to publicly back a ceasefire.\n\nThe sit-in followed a series of actions at high-profile locations in New York intended to bring attention to the growing death toll in Gaza.\n\nPalestinian Authority willing to help rule postwar Gaza\n\nThe Palestinian Authority is willing to rule the Gaza Strip after the war if the United States commits to a two-state solution to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a top official of the Palestine Liberation Organization told the New York Times. Hussein al-Sheikh, the PLO’s secretary general, said he told Secretary of State Antony Blinken last week that the Palestinian Authority sought a comprehensive political agreement that would include the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Al-Sheikh said Palestinian leaders believe the Biden administration is capable of forcing Israel to go along.\n\nU.S. officials say the Palestinian Authority, which rules the West Bank, must play a central role in Gaza after Hamas is destroyed. Hamas has ruled Gaza since 2007.\n\nAl-Sheikh warned that without a comprehensive initiative from the U.S. postwar, Gaza would be “a fertile soil for radicalism.”\n\nDeal for release of some hostages could be near\n\nMediators were closing in on a possible deal for a three-day cease-fire in exchange for the release of about a dozen hostages held by Hamas, two Egyptian officials, a U.N. official and a Western diplomat told the Associated Press. The deal would also allow fuel to enter Gaza for the first time since the war began.\n\nMilitants are believed to be holding about 240 hostages, most of them Israelis. They were seized Oct. 7 when militants crashed across the border from Gaza and rampaged through Israeli communities, killing 1,400 and wounding thousands more. That fueled an Israeli push to crush Hamas, with the resulting attacks blamed for more than 10,800 Palestinian deaths, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nIsrael closes in on hospital where it says Hamas leaders are hiding\n\nIsraeli strikes pounded Gaza City on Thursday while ground forces clashed with Hamas militants near a hospital where the Israelis say Palestinian civilians are being used as ''human shields.\" The Israeli military, facing global backlash for its unrelenting destruction of Gaza, accused Hamas of exploiting hospitals, ambulances, clinics, mosques and schools to stash militants and weapons. Israeli forces were closing in on Gaza’s largest hospital, al-Shifa, where tens of thousands of Palestinian civilians reportedly are sheltering alongside patients.\n\nOne militant captured by Israel reportedly said ambulances were used to transport “important people” such as Hamas commanders because “the Jews don’t attack ambulances,\" according to a translation by the Times of Israel.\n\n\"Most senior Hamas political and military officials are hiding in the hospitals, especially the Shifa Hospital,\" the Israeli military said in a statement. \"This is another example of how the Hamas terrorist organization exploits civilian infrastructure and uses civilians as human shields.\"\n\nHospitals in Gaza struggle to treat, shelter refugees\n\nHospitals across Gaza have been grappling with low fuel and supplies as disease and the death toll rise amid the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe An Naser Children’s Hospital in Gaza City was hit during an airstrike on Thursday at about 5 a.m., killing three people and injuring dozens of others, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\nOfficials said Al Shifa Hospital nearby was also near a reported bombardment. Patients who have undergone surgical procedures there are at high risk of infection, the UN said in its report, with some people’s wounds reportedly covered in white flies and larva.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials at Al Quds Hospital in Gaza City announced that its main generator shut down, and they were using a smaller one to reduce fuel consumption. The hospital was forced to close its surgical ward, oxygen generation plant, and MRI ward.\n\nThe facility said it could provide two hours of electricity each day for people sheltering there. According to the UN, the hospital has become isolated from other areas and is facing severe shortages of food, baby formula, and medicine.\n\nAccording to the UN’s Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, nine out of its 22 health centers are still operating in the southern region of Gaza. Officials recorded 6,530 patient visits on Wednesday.\n\nGaza’s only psychiatric hospital stopped operating after it was damaged in an attack on Nov. 5, the UN said in its report.\n\nProminent Palestinians arrested in Israel on way to protest\n\nThe arrest of six prominent Palestinian leaders on their way to an antiwar protest in Israel has prompted accusations the Israeli government is trying to quash dissent.\n\nAmong those detained were three former lawmakers: Mohammed Barakeh, Hanin Zoabi and Sami Abou Shahadeh.\n\nThe Adalah organization, which advocates for the rights of Palestinians in Israel, said Barakeh was arrested illegally after being followed by police. Barakeh explained the group he leads planned a protest with less than 50 participants and did not require a permit.\n\nHis detainment, Adalah said, exemplifies a policy “designed to muzzle any dissent and to suppress the freedom to protest of Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel.”\n\nWith about 20% of Israel's population of 9.7 million, Arabs represent the country's largest minority.\n\nPolice said in a statement the protest in the northern city of Nazareth was “liable to incite and harm the public’s welfare.” Police recently banned antiwar protests.\n\nGerman leader vows to combat 'shameful' surge in violent antisemitism\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz marked the 85th anniversary of Nazi-fueled Kristallnacht riots that left more than 100 Jews dead by vowing Thursday to protect German Jews from a \"shameful\" surge in antisemitism. Scores of synagogues were burned, hundreds of Jewish businesses were destroyed and homes were ransacked on \"Crystal Night,\" which later became known as the \"Night of Broken Glass.\"\n\nGermany, like many other countries, has seen an uptick in antisemitism violence since the Israel-Hamas war broke out. Scholz attended a memorial event in Berlin's Beth Zion Synagogue, attacked last month in a failed arson attempt. Germany's \"never again\" promise made after World War II means the country must protect Jewish institutions and communities, he said.\n\n\"The Hitler Putsch (coup) began in Munich 100 years ago this evening,\" Scholz wrote on social media. \"Our lesson: We must protect and defend our democracy against anyone who wants to undermine it. This applies to each and every one of us and especially these days.\"\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2023/11/29/israel-hamas-war-gaza-live-updates/71738452007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war updates: Temporary truce extended", "text": "Editor's Note: For the latest on the Israel-Hamas conflict, please see our live updates file here\n\nA temporary truce between Israel and Hamas has been extended another day, Israel's military announced, making it the second extension of the four-day agreement that was set to expire Thursday.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said Thursday that the temporary truce with Hamas will be extended for a seventh day “in light of the mediators’ efforts to continue the process of releasing hostages, and subject to the terms of the agreement.\" Hamas and Qatar, which have been mediating between the two sides, confirmed the extension.\n\nThe Qatari Foreign Ministry said the agreement is under the same terms as in the past, under which Hamas has released 10 Israeli hostages per day in exchange for 30 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nNegotiators had been feverishly working to continue the halt in fighting. Last-minute disagreements earlier Thursday included Hamas saying Israel had rejected a proposed list that included seven living captives and the remains of three who the group said were killed in previous Israeli airstrikes.\n\nIsrael later said Hamas submitted an improved list, which led to the extension just minutes before it was set to expire.\n\nOfficials in Qatar, Egypt and the U.S. have been working with Hamas and Israeli leaders on a temporary extension with an eye toward ending the war. Netanyahu, however, has said fighting will ultimately continue until Hamas has been crushed.\n\nWednesday's hostage release was initially said to involve 10 Israeli citizens and two Russians − dual nationals who are mother and daughter, according to the Times of Israel − but the Israeli military later said it also included four Thai citizens. Among those released is a dual Israeli-American citizen: Liat Beinin Atzili, a 49-year-old teacher and mother of three.\n\nMartin Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, wrote on X that the \"time is ripe\" for a larger swap.\n\n\"Netanyahu can see that Hamas prefers not to return to war but the public insistence on prioritizing return of hostages ties his hands,\" Indyk wrote. \"And pressure from (President Joe) Biden to extend the pause makes it doubly difficult for him to resume the battle.\"\n\nBut a senior Israeli official who spoke to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity said that, despite reports to the contrary, he was \"not aware of any possibility\" to turn the pause into a longer-term cease-fire involving all the remaining hostages, including men and soldiers, being released in exchange for all Palestinians in Israeli jails.\n\n\"We are doubtful there is such an offer,\" the official said.\n\nThe truce began Friday and initially was to last four days, but talks led to a two-day extension through Wednesday that allowed for more releases. The cease-fire has resulted in 96 hostages getting freed, including 72 Israelis, as well as 180 Palestinians, not including those expected to be let go early Thursday. Four hostages were previously released and another one was rescued by Israeli forces.\n\n12 more hostages freed:More Israeli captives released in Gaza\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Israeli troops killed two Palestinian boys – ages 8 and 15 – during a raid in the West Bank city of Jenin, Palestinian health officials said. That increases to 234 the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli forces or settlers in the West Bank since the war began, including 63 children, the U.N. said.\n\n∎ Northern Gaza, which hardly benefited from the influx of humanitarian aid trucks into the strip as it was battered by the Israeli air and ground campaign before the truce, received 21 such trucks Wednesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent said.\n\n∎ Advocacy groups including Amnesty International USA delivered nearly 1 million signatures to the White House calling on Biden to use his influence to bring about a sustained cease-fire.\n\n∎ Pope Francis, during his weekly public audience at the Vatican on Wednesday, expressed support for the temporary truce, the release of hostages and the delivery of aid to Gaza.\n\n∎ Hamas said the release of two Russian hostages came at the behest of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nHusband of freed US hostage still in captivity\n\nLiat Beinin Atzili, who teaches high school and serves as a youth guide at the Holocaust Museum Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, became only the second American hostage to be released during the truce. She and her husband, Aviv Atzili, were kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Oz in the Hamas rampage.\n\nU.S. authorities believe seven or eight Americans remain captive in Gaza.\n\n\"We remain determined to secure the release of every person taken hostage by Hamas during its brutal terrorist assault on Israel on October 7, including Liat’s husband Aviv,'' Biden said in a statement.\n\nBeinin Atzili was born in Israel and \"likes to travel to wild places with her family, and experience the nature and the wildlife,'' according the to the BringThemHomeNow family group.\n\nAt a stop in Pueblo, Colorado, Biden said he spoke with her parents. “They’re very appreciative and things are moving well,” he said. “She’ll soon be home with her three children.”\n\nAnother American hostage is free. But families of US hostages in Gaza want more to come home\n\nHamas says three hostages have died\n\nThe Israeli military said it was investigating the veracity of a Hamas announcement Wednesday that three Israeli hostages have died \"as a result of a former Zionist bombing on the Gaza Strip,\" apparently prior to the start of the cease-fire. Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, said in the Telegram post that Shiri Silverman Bibas, 32, her 4-year-old son Ariel and her 10-month-old son Kfir had died.\n\n“The Hamas terror organization continues to act in a cruel and inhumane manner,” the Israeli military said in a statement. \"The responsibility for the safety of all the abductees in the Gaza Strip lies fully with the terrorist organization Hamas.\"\n\nThe Bibas family released a statement to Israel's i24 news saying it was awaiting the report \"to be confirmed or hopefully refuted soon by military officials.\" The statement also thanked the people of Israel for the \"warm embrace\" the family has received.\n\nNetanyahu: Israel will go back to 'fighting until the end'\n\nAmid the hopes for a longer-lasting peace raised by the current truce and exchange of hostages for prisoners, Israel's Netanyahu has steadfastly maintained the war will resume when the cease-fire ends.\n\nHe reiterated that stance Wednesday in a tweet.\n\n“In the last few days I hear a question – will Israel return to fighting after this phase of returning our abductees is exhausted?’’ Netanyahu said, according to the Google translation from the Hebrew. “So my answer is unequivocal – yes. There is no way we are not going back to fighting until the end.’’\n\nNetanyahu repeated his three goals for the war: The release of all hostages, the elimination of Hamas and making sure Gaza never threatens Israel again.\n\n“These three goals remain the same,’’ he said.\n\nHowever, Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Netanyahu, told CNN that about 25 Israeli women and children are still under captivity, so Israel is willing to make good on its offer to extend the truce by a day for every 10 hostages who get released. “The ball is in Hamas’ court,’’ he said.\n\nIsrael has been pounding Gaza since militants slipped across the border into Israel on Oct. 7 on a mission of destruction, killing 1,200 people before racing back into Gaza with an estimated 240 hostages. Israel's response has been to level swaths of Gaza in a military campaign that Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 13,000 people.\n\nFormer hostage Abigail Edan, 4, discharged from hospital\n\nAbigail Edan, the 4-year-old Israeli American whose parents were killed in the Oct. 7 rampage by Palestinian militants, was discharged from a hospital in Israel late Tuesday night, Schneider Children’s Medical Center in Petah Tikvah said. She had been admitted for evaluation after spending seven weeks in captivity.\n\nAbigail, a dual citizen, was the first American released under the terms of the current truce as she made it out of Gaza on Sunday along with 16 other hostages held by Hamas. She turned 4 under captivity Friday and her release became a focal point of the Biden administration.\n\nDuring the attack, Abigail ran to a neighbor’s home for shelter and was taken in by the Brodutch family before militants abducted the family into Gaza. Hagar Brodutch and her three children were also released Sunday.\n\nUniversity presidents to testify on antisemitism on campuses\n\nRepublican lawmakers asked three college presidents to testify at a congressional hearing next week about how they've handled a rise in antisemitic incidents on their campuses since the Israel-Hamas war began Oct. 7. The presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology agreed to testify Dec. 5 before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, the committee said. The universities have faced public backlash, student demonstrations and alumni revolts since the war began.\n\n“Over the past several weeks, we’ve seen countless examples of antisemitic demonstrations on college campuses,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-North Carolina, who chairs the committee. “Meanwhile, college administrators have largely stood by, allowing horrific rhetoric to fester and grow.” Read more here.\n\n− Zachary Schermele\n\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard and Jeanine Santucci, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2023/10/13/israel-hamas-war-explained-maps-graphics/71158132007/", "title": "Israel-Hamas war in maps, and visual explainers: Understand the ...", "text": "The death toll continues to rise in Gaza with more destruction from Israeli airstrikes as Israel Defense Forces prepare to launch a ground invasion in response to the brutal attack by Hamas on Oct. 7.\n\nPreparations continue despite international pleas for a humanitarian pause in the conflict. Israel said Thursday it had sent tanks into Gaza to prepare the area for future combat.\n\nUSA TODAY is tracking developments in Gaza and the surrounding area. Here are the latest:\n\nNov. 12: Gaza's largest hospital no longer functioning\n\nAs Israeli airstrikes and ground forces advance toward Gaza's largest hospital, thousands of civilians seeking shelter and receiving treatment remain trapped inside the facility that officials say has run out of fuel and water.\n\nWord Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Al Shifa Hospital – a stated target of the Israeli military, which says the facility is the location of a significant Hamas command post – \"is not functioning as a hospital anymore.\"\n\nOct. 31: Israeli forces press further into Gaza\n\nIsraeli soldiers are pouring into Gaza as the ground invasion drives more Palestinians from their homes. Israeli forces have moved further into Beit Hanoun in the northeastern Gaza Strip and have expanded their positions in the northwest of the Gaza Strip along the coast.\n\nA flurry of Israeli airstrikes on the largest refugee camp in Gaza caused dozens of casualties Tuesday, flattened apartment buildings and killed what the Israeli military said were numerous Hamas militants.\n\nCiting officials from Indonesian Hospital on the outskirts of Gaza City, Reuters reported more than 50 people were killed and 150 wounded in the attack on the densely populated Jabaliya refugee camp, which left craters were residential structures had been standing. Al Jazeera TV video showed dozens of people digging through rubble trying to find survivors.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said it struck a \"terrorist stronghold'' and killed Ibrahim Biari, a Hamas commander it said was among the leaders of the Oct. 7 rampage. The IDF also said Hamas \"had taken over civilian buildings” and that tunnels under them collapsed.\n\n\"The stronghold was used for training and execution of terrorism activities,'' the IDF said in a tweet with a photo showing its targets. \"During the ground activity, the troops eliminated approx. 50 terrorists, as well as destroyed entrances to terrorist tunnels and weapons.''\n\nReuters reported a long line of bodies covered in white cloth laid outside Indonesian Hospital in the nearby town of Beit Lahiya, and a procession of injured people of different ages getting rushed into the facility amid screams and chaos.\n\nOct. 30: Israeli forces push invasion into northern Gaza\n\nIsrael appeared to begin blocking exit routes from northern Gaza on Sunday as its ground invasion of the occupied enclave intensified amid pockets of resistance from Palestinians who refused repeated Israeli orders to evacuate.\n\nFierce clashes took place as Israeli forces penetrated deep into northern Gaza near Beit Lahia, a city of 90,000, the Palestinian media outlet Al-Ayyam reported. The Israeli military said its forces were pushing into the territory, encountering militants attempting to launch anti-tank missiles and mortar shells. Dozens of the militants were killed, the Israelis said.\n\nOct. 26: Destruction in Beit Hanoun, Al Karameh in North Gaza\n\nCities in Gaza have been heavily damaged by heavy Israeli airstrikes over the past three weeks, new satellite images from Maxar Technologies show.\n\nIn the north, Beit Hanoun has significant damage, with four- and five-story buildings collapsing, reported the Guardian. The city is close to the area where Hamas militants crossed the border and attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nIn Al Karameh, aerial views show blankets of gray ash marking areas of destruction.\n\nOct. 23: Aid trucks are entering Gaza from Egypt at Rafah border crossing\n\nA third small aid convoy has entered Gaza from Egypt, according to The Associated Press. Satellite images collected Saturday by Maxar Technologies showed trucks on both sides of the border.\n\nMany on the Gaza side appeared to be empty, perhaps ready to be loaded with goods from the trucks crossing from Egypt. Others are seen driving out of Gaza, presumably empty, back to Egypt. Previous images showed up to 90 trucks waiting to cross.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry described the latest convoy as consisting of 20 trucks, with 34 trucks crossing over the weekend.\n\nOct. 20: Satellite imagery shows trucks reportedly carrying humanitarian supplies lined up at Gaza's Rafah border crossing\n\nMaxar Technologies captured new imagery today showing trucks lined up at the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt.\n\nAt the Egyptian border, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters that “restrictions” are preventing humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, which has been cut off by Israel from food, water, fuel and electricity since Hamas’ Oct. 7 surprise attack.\n\n“We are actively engaging with all the parties in order to clarify these restrictions so we can have these trucks moving towards where they’re needed. We need these trucks moving as soon as possible,” said Guterres, adding: “We have two million people here who are suffering tremendously.”\n\nOct. 20: Israeli military forces pound Gaza with heavy airstrikes, hit a Greek Orthodox church building in Gaza City\n\nIsraeli military forces on Friday continued pounding the Gaza Strip with heavy airstrikes, slamming areas in the south where Palestinians had been told to seek safety, prompting many to return north as hundreds of trucks packed with humanitarian aid stayed piled up at the Egypt-Gaza border.\n\nAn untold number of Palestinians were allegedly killed and wounded in an explosion at a Greek Orthodox Saint Porphyrius Church, the oldest church still in use in Gaza City late Thursday. The precise death toll has not yet been determined as bodies were still under rubble. The church is located a few blocks from the at al-Ahli Hospital that was struck on Tuesday.\n\nThe New York Times posted a statement from the Israeli military, which said that the church was not the intended target. The IDF said the fighter jets that carried out the attack were trying to destroy a Hamas command center near the church.\n\nGaza's health ministry (controlled by Hamas) said at least 16 people were killed and with many still buried under rubble. The death toll has not be independently confirmed.\n\nJustin Amash a former member of the U.S. House, representing Michigan's 3rd Congressional District, stated that some of his family members were killed at the church in a post to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Friday.\n\nOct. 19: Red Cross says Gaza's dwindling water, electricity supply could turn hospitals into 'morgues'\n\nVehicles carrying relief supplies stood motionless at Egypt's border with the Gaza Strip this week while locals and aid organizations begged for food, water and fuel for generators. They said the tiny territory sealed off by Israel after last week’s rampage by Hamas was near total collapse.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinians who had been forced from their homes were searching for bread. Hospitals in Gaza were on the brink of power outages, endangering the lives of thousands of patients. As an Israeli ground invasion seemed a certainty, Hamas militants continued their relentless rocket fire, and tensions grew along the Israel-Lebanon border to the north.\n\nThe Gaza power plant and power cables from Israel, which were Gaza's two primary suppliers of electricity, are no longer operational. At the beginning of the siege, Israel cut off its supply of electricity to the city, and the power plant ceased operations almost a week ago because of a shortage of fuel.\n\nLearn more with this visual story: Gaza's dwindling water, electricity supply could turn hospitals into 'morgues'\n\nOct. 18: U.S. backs Israeli denial of involvement in Gaza hospital complex explosion\n\nPresident Joe Biden backed up Israel’s statements on Wednesday, as he visited Tel Aviv. Biden said he was “outraged and saddened” by the loss of life in Gaza City. But he said that U.S. intelligence indicated that Israel was not behind the explosion.\n\nMohammed Abu Selmia − the general director of Shifa Hospital where all the wounded and dead were transferred following the explosion − said early Wednesday he believed the death toll was close to 250, with hundreds more wounded, The Associated Press reported.\n\nOct. 17: Hamas-run Health Ministry says hundreds killed in hospital strike\n\nIsraelis and Palestinians blamed each other Tuesday for an explosion that killed hundreds at a Gaza City hospital packed with wounded people and others seeking shelter from relentless bombing.\n\nThe Gaza Health Ministry, which is run by Hamas, said an Israeli airstrike tore through Al Ahli Arab Hospital and estimated the number of fatalities at a minimum of 500. The Israel Defense Forces said it would investigate, then issued a statement disavowing involvement.\n\n\"An analysis of IDF operational systems indicates that a barrage of rockets was fired by terrorists in Gaza, passing in close proximity to the Al Ahli hospital in Gaza at the time it was hit,'' the statement said. \"Intelligence from multiple sources we have in our hands indicates that Islamic Jihad is responsible for the failed rocket launch which hit the hospital in Gaza.\"\n\nThe U.S. considers Islamic Jihad, the second-largest militant group in Gaza and the West Bank, a terrorist organization. It occasionally cooperates with Hamas.\n\nOct. 17: Israeli bombings kill dozens in Gaza region seeking to flee\n\nIsrael bombed areas of southern Gaza where it had told Palestinians to flee to ahead of an expected ground invasion, killing dozens of people on Tuesday in retaliatory attacks it says are targeted at Hamas militants that rule the besieged territory, according to the Associated Press.\n\nWith no water, fuel or food being delivered to Gaza since Hamas’ brutal attack on Israel last week, mediators struggled to break a deadlock over delivering supplies to increasingly desperate civilians, aid groups and hospitals.\n\nIn Gaza, dozens of injured were rushed to hospitals after heavy attacks outside the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis, residents reported. Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official and former health minister, reported 27 people were killed in Rafah and 30 in Khan Younis.\n\nOct. 16: Gaza-Egypt border strained as many Palestinians try to flee fighting\n\nThere have been conflicting reports regarding the state of affairs at Rafah. Who can pass through is controlled by Hamas and Egypt, however since Israel started attacking Gaza with airstrikes in response to Hamas's attack, operations have been hampered.\n\nReports that the crossing might be temporarily reopened during a brief lull on Monday, masses gathered at Rafah; however, both Israel and Hamas promptly refuted this.\n\nMore than 1 million Gazans had evacuated their homes. Last week Israel ordered an evacuation of northern Gaza, an edict that fueled chaos across the Israeli-occupied territory of about 2.3 million Palestinians.\n\nOct. 13: Israeli military calls for evacuation of civilians in northern Gaza\n\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\n\nIsrael’s military told some 1 million Palestinians on Friday to evacuate northern Gaza and head to the southern part of the besieged territory, an unprecedented order applying to almost half the population ahead of an expected ground invasion against the ruling Hamas militant group.\n\nThe evacuation order, which includes Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, sparked widespread panic among civilians and aid workers already running from Israeli airstrikes and contending with a total siege and a territorywide blackout.\n\nA closed military zone has been created by the Israel Defense Forces surrounding the Gaza Strip. Hamas continues to try to infiltrate the area, though in smaller forces. The border breaches from the initial attack are being rebuilt. There are around 300,000 Israeli soldiers are gathering near the Gaza Strip.\n\nOct. 10: Destruction of residential buildings evident in Gaza City, US carrier group heads to Middle East\n\nResidential neighborhoods in Gaza City sustained significant damage, as seen in recent satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies.\n\nThe Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group, a force of six warships headed by the U.S. Navy’s largest and most advanced nuclear aircraft carrier, arrived in the eastern Mediterranean Sea on Tuesday as part of the U.S. response to the attack by Hamas on Israel.\n\nSee more with this visual story: How U.S. Navy ships in the Mediterranean are positioned to support Israel\n\nOct. 9: Israel announces \"complete siege\" of Gaza\n\nIsrael’s defense minister says electricity, food, water and fuel to Gaza will be halted as part of a “complete siege” of the nation.\n\nIsrael launched strikes inside Gaza on Monday morning. Several mosques and a marketplace are hit and an unknown number of people are injured. The Yassin Mosque near the Shati refugee camp in Gaza City is among those destroyed.\n\nThe Israeli military says it's conducting one of the largest airstrikes ever against Hamas in Gaza and says more than 1,200 targets were hit.\n\nA Hamas spokesperson said Monday the group will kill one civilian hostage each time Israel targets civilians in Gaza without warning.\n\nOct. 8: Israel strikes Gaza\n\n2:19 a.m. On social media site X, formerly Twitter, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel has destroyed the sites used to launch the rocket attacks.\n\nSee more with this visual story: Gaza, the 140-square-mile strip at the core of the conflict\n\nIsrael's Defense Ministry said mortars fired from Gaza hit the Erez border crossing into Israel, used by thousands of Gazans daily. The mortars damaged the roof and shrapnel hit the hall's entrance, the ministry said. The crossing has been closed amid the fighting.\n\nA Hamas official said Saturday that the hostages could be freed in exchange for Palestinian terrorists serving prison sentences in Israel.\n\nOct. 7: Hamas attacks Israel\n\nMore than 1,900 people have died, including at least 14 Americans, and fighting continues after the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad launched thousands of rockets from Gaza against Israeli cities and sent an estimated 1,000 gunmen across Israel's border to attack and kidnap civilians on Oct. 7.\n\nSee more with this visual story: Maps and graphics show how Hamas militants' deadly raid unfolded\n\nThe coordinated assault, the deadliest attack on Israel in decades, caught the nation and the world by surprise.

Through Sunday, the world reported 83.62 million cases this year, up from 83.56 million cases last year. The early months of 2020 reflect the gradual rise and spread of the virus around the world. But since the fall of 2020, the global pace of infections hasn't abated. Confirmed coronavirus cases in India, the United States and Brazil have outpaced the rest of the world in 2020 and 2021, but the U.S, with half of the population at least partially vaccinated, is the only country where the number of cases have fallen this year.\n\nPrefer to listen?

Egypt succeeded in brokering the Gaza truce after the Biden administration pressed Israel to wind down its offensive. While in Israel on Tuesday, Blinken said the Biden administration would reopen its consulate in Jerusalem, which had served as a de facto embassy for Palestinians until former President Donald Trump shuttered it in 2019. Biden dispatched Blinken to the Middle East to help ensure the cease-fire sticks and to reassure both Israelis and Palestinians that the U.S. would remain engaged in the region. Biden has vowed to help with a massive recovery effort in Gaza, which bore the brunt of the destruction after being pounded by Israeli missiles for 11 days.\n\nAdam Toledo's family creates sanctuary for at-risk youth in honor of 14th birthday\n\nAdam Toledo would have celebrated his 14th birthday on Wednesday. Toledo's family announced the creation of Adam's Place, a rural sanctuary for at-risk youth in honor of Adam, who was fatally shot by a white Chicago police offer on March 29. \"This year, as they struggle with their grief, Adam's parents and siblings are dedicating themselves to helping other families prevent the excruciating sorrow that comes from the loss of a child,\" Adeena Weiss Ortiz and Joel Hirschhorn, lawyers for the Toledo family, said in a statement. Adam's Place will provide a \"safe and nurturing haven\" in a rural setting where at-risk youth ages 10 to 14 from Chicago and other Midwestern cities can \"develop skills, values, and self-worth by learning to care for the natural world, others, and themselves, away from the dangers of urban streets,\" the lawyers said.\n\nRecord temps possible as heat wave scorches Southeast\n\nFor much of the South, midsummer-like heat will peak Wednesday, bringing the greatest chance to break daily record highs. More than 70 daily heat records may be broken as a high pressure system dominates the eastern half of the country. \"The heat will challenge daily record highs for several days in a row in cities such as Charlotte and Raleigh with afternoon highs around or even slightly above what they normally peak at in July or August,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Dan Pydynowski said. Parts of the Southeast could stay hot right through the end of the work week, according to Weather.com.\n\nA super blood moon and total lunar eclipse may come to skies near you\n\nIt's the sky spectacle of the year. Early Wednesday, a full \"supermoon\" will brighten the night sky over the U.S., and a total lunar eclipse will be visible across the West during predawn hours. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth is between the full moon and the sun. The Earth's shadow covers the moon, which often has a red color, hence the \"blood\" moon nickname. You don't need special glasses or gizmos to view it, unlike a solar eclipse, so feel free to stare directly at the moon. Binoculars or a telescope improve the view. What does a supermoon mean? It just means the moon looks a bit bigger than usual since it's closer to the Earth. This will be the second and last supermoon of 2021.

Actors will start appearing on picket lines Friday morning.\n\nAt a news conference Thursday afternoon, Screen Actors Guild president Fran Drescher explained that a strike was the inevitable result of actors feeling \"disrespected\" by studios.\n\n\"At some point, you have to say, no, we’re not going to take this any more,\" she said. \"There was nothing there, it was insulting.\"\n\nSo what does that mean for your favorite films, TV series, awards shows and any other events that involve actors? Get ready to tee up your favorite reruns for the coming days, weeks and possibly months as all parties seek a resolution.\n\nHere's what we know so far:\n\nActors strike live updates:SAG-AFTRA will picket, prompting historic Hollywood shutdown\n\nAre writers still on strike in Hollywood?\n\nActors have agreed to strike about 10 weeks after members of the Writers Guild of America walked out in an effort to secure higher wages and specific terms related to AI-powered writing tools such as ChatGPT. Their fear is such technology could be called in to supplement or substitute for human writers.\n\nHollywood actors who are members of the Screen Actors Guild have gone on strike seeking better compensation at a time when incomes are threatened by everything from streaming service deals to nascent artificial intelligence.\n\nHow will the Screen Actors Guild strike affect my favorite shows and movies?\n\nThe ongoing Writers Guild strike has meant that many TV shows and movies have had to cancel production, although some production continued without writers on set. But an actors' strike means very little can continue. Animation (minus voice actors), reality TV and some projects shooting outside the U.S. with actors who aren't in SAG will be able to carry on.\n\nTV series will be forced into an indefinite hiatus, and movies will immediately go dark.\n\nPlan on seeing a lot of reruns on TV. But movie theaters, already facing an uphill climb after the combination of a pandemic and a shift to at-home viewing, are looking at another big financial challenge come this holiday season when already-shot movies have already come out.\n\nA movie fan's guide to the strike:Wait, will 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' come out?\n\nWhat else will be shut down by the actors' strike?\n\nLove your red carpet awards shows with all that celebrity glitz and glamour? Kiss that goodbye.\n\nStrike rules forbid actors from promoting their projects, a constraint writers have faced since May. That means no premieres, no talk show appearances and no glossy magazine cover stories that aren't already banked. (USA TODAY's interviews with actors for upcoming movies such as \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were conducted before the strike began.)\n\nThe strike will also depress the fun at fan favorite events such as San Diego Comic-Con, usually chock-full of popular actors, writers and directors pitching their movies and TV shows to thousands of coplaying admirers.\n\nThe Emmy Awards, planned for Sept. 18 on Fox, would likely be delayed until both strikes are resolved. If the strikes drag on into 2024 (unlikely but possible), other major awards shows like the Oscars would be put on hold.\n\nWhat do actors want?\n\nWhile we're all familiar with the mega-millions pay days for A-list stars such as Tom Cruise, most actors do not make that kind of money. SAG members say they are striking for an increased base compensation, regulated use of artificial intelligence, better benefit plans and money for self-taped auditions – the cost of which used to be the responsibility of casting and production.\n\nActors also want to be compensated for streaming TV shows and movies based on the performance of those titles. The problem there is that streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Max do not share metrics with the public, or even the creators of their films and TV shows. SAG is pushing for analytics from a third party to help determine payment.\n\nWhat do studios want?\n\nStudio executives maintain that spending on new content to meet consumer demand has hurt profits and resulted in losses that have required the layoffs of thousands of employees.\n\nA recent Deadline report cites unnamed sources who say the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers are in no rush to negotiate with writers and are hoping a prolonged paycheck drought will eventually bring them back to the bargaining table.\n\nAMPTP denied the notion of a so-called \"October surprise,\" a reference to producers being willing to wait until Halloween before negotiating with strikers. “These anonymous people are not speaking on behalf of the AMPTP or member companies, who are committed to reaching a deal and getting our industry back to work,” a spokesperson for the organization said.\n\nHow long will the Hollywood strike last?\n\nThat always is an unknown. There have been strikes throughout Hollywood's century-long history. The most recent was the writer's strike of 2007, which lasted 14 weeks. In 1988, the WGA struck for 22 weeks, the longest action in its history.\n\nPast actors' guild strikes included a six-week walkout in 1960, which was led by its then-president, and future U.S. president, Ronald Reagan. A 1980 strike lasted three months, while a 1986 strike, the most recent until now, lasted 14 hours.\n\nThere was one directors' guild strike in 1987, and it lasted just three hours. In early June, the Directors Guild of America reached an agreement with studios for new film and TV contracts, avoiding the prospect of an unprecedented three-guild strike.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/06/30/sag-strike-2023-hollywood-actors-extend-contract/70373804007/", "title": "SAG strike 2023: Hollywood actors postpone strike as talks continue", "text": "Hollywood actors will stay on the job ― for now.\n\nAfter a month of tense negotiations between Hollywood actors' union and the major studios, the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) will continue talking , the guild announcedlate Friday, averting a strike, at least for 12 more days.\n\nThe contract, which was set to expire at 11:59 p.m. PDT Friday, will now expire on July 12 at the same time, the actors union and the studios and networks group said in a joint statement. \"The parties will continue to negotiate under a mutually agreed upon media blackout.\" The new deadline falls just hours after TV's Emmy Awards announce nominations for this year's ceremony.\n\nThere is a lot at stake in the \"seminal\" negotiations, so-called by SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher. The rise of streaming services, the advent of artificial intelligence technology and the greater economic headwinds have changed how actors are paid. Actors want increased base compensation, which they say has been undercut by inflation and the streaming ecosystem, regulated use of artificial intelligence, better benefit plans and money for \"self-taped auditions\" – the cost of which used to be the responsibility of casting and production.\n\nDrescher and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland sent a hopeful message to the membership over the weekend about the talks. It was quickly followed Wednesday by an open letter from over 1000 SAG members to the leadership. The letter, signed by names as big as Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence, expressed the membership's sincere willingness to strike if they were not able to achieve all their demands in a new contract.\n\nThe entertainment industry is already mostly shut down after the Writers Guild of America went on strike May 2. Actors shared many of the same concerns and demands as the writers, including regulating AI and establishing an updated pay scale for work on streaming content. It is possible deal with SAG could move the needle in negotiations between the AMPTP and the WGA. The AMPTP also reached a deal with the Directors Guild of America that was ratified by its membership June 24.\n\nMembers of the WGA and SAG-AFTRA were last on strike at the same time in 1988, when commercial actors and writers were both on the picket line. Hollywood actors and writers were also both on strike in 1960. Although many Hollywood film and TV sets are already shut down without writers, losing actors will bring worldwide production to a standstill, delaying series including HBO's \"House of the Dragon\" and films such as \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.\" A strike could also delay or cancel the Emmy Awards, currently scheduled for September, and depress the lineup at San Diego Comic-Con in July, usually an event full of A-list Hollywood actors, writers and directors.\n\nMore on the SAG strikeHere's why Hollywood actors are walking off set", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2023/07/13/sag-aftra-actors-strike-2023-live-updates/70410271007/", "title": "SAG-AFTRA strike: Hollywood actors hit picket lines in labor dispute", "text": "Hollywood actors are about to be off the job and on the picket line.\n\nThe Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA), the union that represents American film and TV actors, announced plans for a strike beginning at midnight PDT Thursday, a work stoppage that will essentially bring most movie and TV production worldwide to a halt.\n\nThe announcement comes 12 hours after the contract between the union and the major studios expired without a new deal. Much of Hollywood has already shut down because of an ongoing writers strike that began May 2, but more productions would pause in an actors strike, from highly anticipated sequel films (“Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning - Part 2”) to new TV seasons (Netflix's \"Stranger Things\").\n\n\"We are the victims here. We are being victimized by a very greedy entity,\" SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said, announcing strike plans. \"You are systematically trying to figure out ways to carve us out of what is due us. Shame on you!\"\n\nHere are the latest updates from SAG, the studios and major celebrities as the labor battle goes on.\n\nWho will feel the impact of an actors' strike?\n\n\"I think it's gonna impact everybody,\" said Natalia Castellanos (\"Bosch\"), an actor and member of the union's negotiating committee, outside a press conference called to announce the strike. \"Me personally, I won't have any work, so no income coming in, and that's scary.\" – Charlie Trepany\n\nStrike causes a wave of San Diego Comic-Con cancellations\n\nSan Diego Comic-Con, a late July fan event that's usually chock full of A-list actors, directors and writers hawking their upcoming films and shows to costume-clad fans, will be a muted affair this year. Planned panels were already cut back by the writers strike in May, and on Thursday the Comic-Con website kept a running list of panels and events canceled after the SAG news. Among them were a \"Good Omens\" autograph signing and a \"That '70s Show\" 25th anniversary panel.\n\nMatt Damon says middle-class actors are hardest hit\n\nMatt Damon, a star of the upcoming film \"Oppenheimer,\" was among the last to appear on a red carpet, hours before the strike was called. He defended fellow actors in an interview with the Associated Press, and said fair royalty payments are a lifeline for average working actors.\n\n\"We got to protect the people who are kind of on the margins. 26,000 bucks a year is what you have to make to get your health insurance. And there are a lot of people (for) who residual payments carry them across that threshold. If those residual payments dry up, so does their healthcare, and that's absolutely unacceptable.\" – Erin Jensen\n\nWhat happens now that a strike has been called?\n\nExpect to see some of your favorite actors marching with picket signs, rather than promoting their movies and TV shows, especially in Los Angeles and New York, starting Friday. Since much of the entertainment business was already crippled by the writers' strike, the movie pipeline will eventually dry up – though fans won't notice until at least 2024 ‒ and TV has already turned to a heavier diet of reality shows to fill the void. Streaming services operate with longer lead times than traditional TV networks, so they will have a steadier supply of new series, for now. But some may stockpile shows and spread them over a longer period to fill expected gaps. – Gary Levin\n\nHere’s what actors can't do while on strike\n\nActors cannot do any work while on strike, which means no filming on new movies and TV shows. But it goes beyond that: They can’t audition for future projects or promote others that were already completed under the expired contract, at conventions, premieres or on social media. That means Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are off the press trail for “Barbie,” and the cast of “Succession” won’t be campaigning for Emmy Awards. Actors won’t be giving new glossy magazine cover interviews or go on ABC's “Good Morning America” and “The View” to talk about new movies. And the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards, for which nominations were announced Wednesday, will likely be postponed from a planned Sept. 18 airdate to as late as January, joining a crowded field in awards season.\n\nAMPTP responds to SAG strike\n\n\"AMPTP member companies entered the negotiations with SAG-AFTRA with the goal of forging a new, mutually beneficial contract,\" the organization said in a press release sent at the start of SAG-AFTRA's press conference. \"The AMPTP presented a deal that offered historic pay and residual increases, substantially higher caps on pension and health contributions, audition protections, shortened series option periods, and a groundbreaking AI proposal. A strike is certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life.\"\n\nEmotional SAG chief Fran Drescher officially calls a strike: 'This is a moment of history'\n\nAt a press conference Thursday, Drescher and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland announced that the organization’s board had unanimously voted for the television and theatrical division of the union to strike, and for members to \"withhold their labor\" until a fair contract can be achieved. The strike will begin at midnight tonight, and picket lines will be set up Friday morning.\n\n\"The eyes of the world and particularly the eyes of labor are upon us. What happens here is important because what is happening to us is happening across all fields of labor,\" Drescher said. \"Because at some point the jig is up. You cannot keep being dwindled and marginalized and disrespected and dishonored. The entire business model has been changed by streaming, digital, AI. This is a moment of history. This is a moment of truth. If we don’t stand tall right now we are all going to be in trouble, we are all going to be in danger of being replaced by machines.\"\n\nThe announcement comes 12 hours after SAG-AFTRA’s contract expired with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major Hollywood studios. This means actors in the union will not be able to film TV shows and movies, audition for new projects or promote their finished work.\n\nWhat is the AMPTP?\n\nThe Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers is an organization that represents the major Hollywood studios and streamers including Warner Bros., Paramount, Netflix, Disney and others. The AMPTP bargains on behalf of those studios with the major entertainment guilds including SAG-AFTRA, the WGA and the Directors Guild of America (DGA). When Drescher and Crabtree negotiate on behalf of SAG, they are meeting with members of the AMPTP on the other side of the table.\n\n‘Oppenhemier’ and ‘Barbie’ stars walk red carpet just before strike is called, Nolan says actors are ‘writing picket signs’\n\nThe strike means that actors have to stop all of their work, including promoting their upcoming films and movies. But the stars of highly anticipated movies \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer,\" both due in theaters July 21, were able to squeeze in a premiere before the strike was formally called. \"Barbie\" stars Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling walked the pink carpet in Los Angeles last weekend. And just hours before SAG announced the strike, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Cillian Murphy and Florence Pugh promoted \"Oppenheimer\" at a premiere in London.\n\nThe \"Oppenheimer\" actors were asked by reporters about the impending strike. \"Nobody wants a work stoppage,\" Damon told Deadline, \"but if our leadership is saying that the deal isn't fair, then we gotta hold strong till we get a deal that's fair for working actors. It's the difference between having healthcare and not for a lot of actors, and we've gotta do what's right by them.\"\n\nBlunt said the cast would leave the premiere together if a strike was called. \"We’re going to have to,\" she told Deadline. \"Oppenheimer\" director Christopher Nolan introduced the screening of his film by saying the cast had indeed left the premiere to go \"write their picket signs\" and join the fight with the guilds.\n\nDisney CEO says guilds are 'disruptive' and 'dangerous'\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger didn’t mince words when appearing on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Thursday morning, saying writers’ and actors’ demands were unrealistic.\n\n\"It's very disturbing to me,\" he told host David Faber when asked about the WGA strike and impending SAG strike. \"This is the worst time in the world to add to that disruption. I understand any labor organizations’ desire to work on the behalf of its members to get, you know, the most compensation and to be compensated fairly based on the value that they deliver. ... There's a level of expectation that they have that is just not realistic. And they are adding to a set of challenges that this business is already facing that is quite frankly very disruptive and dangerous.\"\n\nThe skinny:What the Hollywood actors' strike means for anyone who loves movies and TV shows\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThe expected strike comes in the middle of a long WGA strike and after a month of contentious talks between SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP, and a 12-day extension of the existing contract. But the conversation around the negotiations became increasingly acrimonious during the 12-day extension. When a contract was not reached by midnight on Wednesday, and the negotiating committee recommended the board call for a strike, it became a foregone conclusion that actors would take a major labor action.\n\nDuring the press conference Drescher said that during the 12-day extension, the AMPTP remained \"behind closed doors\" and intractable on points of negotiations, and that SAG felt \"disrespected.\" She used the word \"disgusting\" more than once to describe the offer from the AMPTP.\n\nWhy are actors striking?\n\nAt stake for the actors are how much they get paid in a streaming-service-dominated industry and how artificial intelligence will be used in Hollywood as this technology radically changes our world. They want more money, regulated use of AI, and for their compensation to be based on how well their shows and movies perform on streaming services.\n\nReaction:Matt Damon, Jamie Lee Curtis, more stars share their thoughts on the actors strike\n\nHas SAG ever gone on strike?\n\nYes, but not for some time. The last time any actors went on strike was in 2000, when commercial actors walked out for six months. Theatrical and TV actors were last on strike for just 14 hours in 1986, and they also went on strike for three months in 1980.\n\nThe last time actors and writers were on strike at the same time was in 1960, when Ronald Reagan was the president of SAG and Dwight Eisenhower was president of the United States.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/06/27/sag-strike-explained-will-actors-walk-off-set/70350283007/", "title": "SAG strike 2023 explained: Will actors strike affect my movies and TV?", "text": "Hollywood actors will soon replace red carpets with picket lines.\n\nAfter a month of tense negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA), the union representing the majority of actors in film and television, and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents the major Hollywood studios, the parties have not reached a deal for a new contract for Hollywood actors. After talks ended Wednesday night the SAG-AFTRA negotiating committee unanimously recommended a vote by its national board to call a strike. The vote will be held Thursday morning, and a formal announcement by the actors union is expected at noon PDT. The soon-to-be-striking actors will join movie and TV writers, who walked out May 2 after their negotiations with the AMPTP also collapsed.\n\nHow will the double strike, which hasn't happened since 1960, affect your favorite TV shows and movies? Will A-list actors walk the picket line? And will the SAG strike change anything for the Writers Guild of America strike? We answer all your questions about the expected SAG-AFTRA strike and everything that could happen next.\n\nHow will the SAG strike affect my favorite TV shows and movies?\n\nMuch of American TV and film production has already shut down because of the WGA strike, but some production has continued without any writers on set. However, without actors, Hollywood will be a ghost town.\n\nSome production that doesn't need SAG or WGA members will continue: reality TV, animation (minus voice actors), some foreign productions and some talk shows. But while it was possible (but difficult) for filming to continue without writers, the loss of SAG-affiliated actors will bring virtually all production to a standstill. When it comes to most scripted content, almost anything that isn’t already filmed would be affected, including TV shows set to return later this year and next year, and films scheduled for the next few years. Major sets expected to shut down include HBO's \"House of the Dragon\" Season 2 and films such as \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two.\"\n\nThe fall broadcast TV schedule, already full of reality TV, reruns and international shows, would be stuck that way even longer. Streaming services will soon (as soon as October or November) run out of new scripted series to premiere. Movies would be reshuffled on the release calendar or canceled outright. If the WGA goes back to work before the actors, some TV series could return, like late-night talk shows.\n\nWhat else will the SAG strike affect?\n\nSay goodbye to swanky movie premieres, like the recent pink carpet for the \"Barbie\" movie. Strike rules forbid actors from promoting their projects (writers have been in the same boat since May). That means no premieres, no talk show appearances (on whatever talk shows still were filming without writers) and no glossy magazine cover stories that aren't already banked. The strike will also depress the lineup at San Diego Comic-Con, usually full of A-list actors, writers and directors pitching their movies and TV shows to thousands of costume-clad fans.\n\nThe Emmy Awards, currently set for September 18 on Fox, would likely be delayed until both strikes are resolved. If the strikes drag on into 2024 (unlikely but possible), they will also delay other major awards shows like the Oscars.\n\nWhat do the actors want?\n\nThe rise of streaming services, the advent of artificial intelligence technology and the greater economic headwinds have changed how Hollywood works and how actors are paid. They want increased base compensation, which they say has been undercut by inflation and the streaming ecosystem, regulated use of artificial intelligence, better benefit plans and money for \"self-taped auditions\" – the cost of which used to be the responsibility of casting and production.\n\nActors also want to be compensated for streaming TV shows and movies based on the performance of those titles. The problem there is that streamers like Netflix, Hulu and Max do not share metrics with the public, or even the creators of their films and TV shows. SAG is pushing for analytics from a third party to help determine payment.\n\n\"SAG-AFTRA negotiated in good faith and was eager to reach a deal that sufficiently addressed performer needs, but the AMPTP's responses to the union's most important proposals have been insulting and disrespectful of our massive contributions to this industry,\" SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher (best known for her work in \"The Nanny\") said in a statement. \"The companies have refused to meaningfully engage on some topics and on others completely stonewalled us. Until they do negotiate in good faith, we cannot begin to reach a deal.\"\n\nWhat do the studios want?\n\nEntertainment conglomerates and streaming services are looking to bolster their bottom lines, ratcheting back a spending spree on new content that has hurt profits (although most are still profitable enterprises). Many have reported losses from streaming to Wall Street in recent months and made plans to lay off thousands of employees.\n\n\"We are deeply disappointed that SAG-AFTRA has decided to walk away from negotiations,\" the AMPTP said in a statement after the deadline passed. \"In doing so, it has dismissed our offer of historic pay and residual increases, substantially higher caps on pension and health contributions, audition protections, shortened series option periods, a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors’ digital likenesses, and more.\"\n\nThe AMPTP reached a deal with the Directors Guild of America that was ratified by its membership June 24, but the directors had very different concerns in their contract than the writers and actors do.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThere are two likely possibilities to end the strike, and they depend on the reaction of the studios.\n\nThe first possibility is a double strike pushes the studios to cave on the sticking points in the contracts for both the writers and actors. This would be the outcome that would resolve the strikes the fastest.\n\nThe second potential outcome is that the AMPTP digs in further, hoping the prolonged strike hurts the guild members more than the studios, and that pressure from outside groups forces the actors and writers to give up their major demands. If that happens the strike will end by attrition after a very long haul.\n\nThe AMPTP has not returned to the negotiating table with the writers since their talks concluded without a deal May 1.\n\nWGA strike latestWhy the writers walked out, what it means for TV and film", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/11/08/sag-aftra-strike-ends-with-tentative-deal-studios/71050537007/", "title": "Actors strike ends: SAG-AFTRA reaches tentative deal with studios", "text": "Hollywood actors will return to work on TV and movies: The actors' union's negotiating team on Wednesday reached a tentative agreement with the group representing studios and streamers, ending a historic 118-day strike that began July 14.\n\nThe 160,000-member Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) agreed to a new three-year contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) representing eight major studios and streamers including Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros. Discovery and Amazon.\n\n\"We are thrilled and proud to tell you that today your TV/Theatrical Negotiating Committee voted unanimously to approve a tentative agreement with the AMPTP,\" SAG-AFTRA announced late Wednesday. \"As of 12:01 a.m. (PST) on November 9, our strike is officially over and all picket locations are suspended.\"\n\nThe deal will allow studios to resume production of TV shows and movies that has been largely shuttered for the past six months, ever since the Writers Guild of America began its own walkout on May 2.\n\nAbout 60,000 members of the union were affected by the strike. The union membership will schedule a vote in the coming days to formally authorize the deal, putting actors one step closer to stepping in front of the cameras again. It's likely that broadcast networks can salvage part of the 2023-24 TV season by airing some new episodes of scripted series as early as February, while movies can restart production to fill a depleted pipeline.\n\nAfter two and a half months of striking without negotiations, SAG-AFTRA and the AMPTP first met on Oct. 2, but talks fell through when the AMPTP walked away on Oct. 11. Studio representatives said that \"conversations (were) no longer moving us in a productive direction.\"\n\nBargaining resumed on Oct. 24 and included major executives from four Hollywood studios as the two sides tried to hammer out a deal.\n\nThe upshot:Actors strike ends, but what's next? Here's when you can expect your shows and movies back\n\nSAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher was ready for a 'long-haul' strike\n\nSAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher, star of the hit '90s sitcom \"The Nanny,\" said in July that the union was ready for a \"long haul\" strike to achieve demands that included increased actors' salaries and basing actors' compensation on the success of their shows and movies on streaming services. Protections against the studios' use of Artificial Intelligence and digital replicas of actors were also among the union's priorities, but the studios initially bristled at many of the union's asks before reaching a compromise.\n\nThe SAG-AFTRA statement said the contract, valued at over $1 billion, achieved pay raises, unprecedented provisions to protect members from the threat of AI, and a new \"streaming participation bonus,\" among other benefits. \"We have arrived at a contract that will enable SAG-AFTRA members from every category to build sustainable careers,\" the union's statement said. Many thousands of performers now and into the future will benefit from this work.\"\n\nThe studio group called the agreement \"a new paradigm\" and said the AMPTP \"is pleased to have reached a tentative agreement and looks forward to the industry resuming the work of telling great stories.\"\n\nFor much of the summer, actors shared the picket line with WGA members, who were on strike for 148 days. The dual actors' and writers' strikes brought Hollywood movie and TV production to a standstill throughout the summer and fall.\n\nThe WGA leadership voted Sept. 27 to affirm a deal with the AMPTP, bringing some TV shows back on air, including \"Saturday Night Live,\" daytime and late-night talk shows such as \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" and \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\"\n\nThe WGA congratulated SAG-AFTRA on the deal on the union's official X account, formerly Twitter.\n\n\"We are thrilled to see SAG-AFTRA members win a contract that creates new protections for performers and gives them a greater share of the immense value they create,\" the statement said.\n\nWriters strike officially endsHollywood writers ratify new contract with studios", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2023/07/13/sag-strike-2023-why-hollywood-actors-walked-out/70403209007/", "title": "SAG strike 2023: Hollywood actors walk, halting movie, TV production", "text": "Hollywood actors have voted to strike, joining already-striking writers in a move that shuts down the production of countless movies and TV shows.\n\n\"I went in in earnest, thinking we could avert the strike, so the gravity of this move is not lost on me,\" Screen Actors Guild president Fran Drescher said Thursday at a news conference in Los Angeles announcing the strike, which officially begins at midnight local time Thursday and will find actors on the picket lines Friday morning.\n\n\"We had no choice. We are the victims here, being victimized by a very greedy entity,\" she said. \"They stand on the wrong side of history. We stand in unprecedented unity. At some point the jig is up, you can’t keep being marginalized and disrespected. The business model has been changed by streaming and AI. If we don’t stand tall right now, we’ll all be in jeopardy. At some point you have to say, no, we’re not going to take this anymore.\"\n\nActors strike live updates:'Shame on you!' says emotional SAG chief Fran Drescher\n\nHollywood writers have been on strike since May 2, holding out for improved payment contracts at a time when less-than-lucrative streaming deals are bumping up against the looming threat of artificial intelligence taking writers' jobs. Actors are also looking for better pay deals, especially from streaming services such as Netflix.\n\nThe strike caps a month of tense negotiations between SAG-AFTRA and the major studios. On June 28, an open letter from more than 1,000 SAG members was sent to the union's leadership. The letter, signed by Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lawrence and other big stars, expressed the membership's sincere willingness to strike if they were not able to achieve all demands in a new contract.\n\nBoth sides had already extended talks by 12 days after their initial contract expired June 30.\n\nThe combined SAG and Writers Guild of America strikes mean the immediate shutdown of any TV show or movie currently in production, and includes promotional appearances ranging from red carpet walks to media junkets. While the duration of the strike is an unknown, some reports suggest studios are willing to hold out into the fall to win concessions.\n\n\"The studios are consolidating in a bid to compete with Netflix, the only one who seems ready for Hollywood's fully digital era,\" says Aymar Jean Christian, associate professor of communication studies and director of the Media and Data Equity Lab at Northwestern University.\n\n\"The streaming model is making the studios both more powerful and cost-conscious,\" he says. \"This will be a grind. Unless the AMPTP (Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers) gives in quickly, which seems unlikely, this could be the longest production slowdown in history.”\n\nFor their part, studios shifted blame for the strike to actors for walking away from talks and said \"historic\" pay increases and other benefits had been offered. In a statement, the AMPTP said, \"This is the Union’s choice, not ours. ... Rather than continuing to negotiate, SAG-AFTRA has put us on a course that will deepen the financial hardship for thousands who depend on the industry for their livelihoods.\"\n\nExplainer:What the Hollywood actors' strike means for anyone who loves movies and TV shows\n\nThis marks the first time in 63 years that both Hollywood actors and writers have been on strike simultaneously. Commercial actors last walked off the job for six months in 2000, while the last strike by film and theatrical actor members of SAG lasted 14 hours, back in 1986. The writers staged a 100-day walkout in 2007 and 2008.\n\nThe ongoing Writers Guild strike has meant that many TV shows and movies have had to cancel production, although animation (minus voice actors), reality TV and some projects shooting outside the U.S. with actors who aren't in SAG have been able to carry on. But with an actors' strike, very little can continue.\n\nFor movie theaters, already facing an uphill climb after the pandemic and a shift to at-home viewing, it means another big financial challenge after they're run through their supply of already-shot movies.\n\nStrike rules forbid actors from promoting their projects, a constraint writers have faced since May. That means no premieres, no talk show appearances and no glossy magazine cover stories that aren't already banked. (USA TODAY's interviews with actors for upcoming movies such as \"Barbie\" and \"Oppenheimer\" were conducted before the strike began.)\n\nThe strike will also depress the fun at fan favorite events such as San Diego Comic-Con, usually chock-full of popular actors, writers and directors pitching their movies and TV shows to thousands of cosplaying admirers.\n\nThe Emmy Awards, planned for Sept. 18 on Fox, would likely be delayed until both strikes are resolved. If the strikes drag on into 2024 (unlikely but possible), other major awards shows like the Oscars would be put on hold.\n\nThe actors will join the writers on picket lines at a transformational moment in the entertainment industry. The WGA is asking for a guaranteed minimum number of writing staffers, increased royalties for streaming TV shows and movies, and the regulated use of AI. Actors share many of the same concerns and demands.\n\nThe studios reached a deal with a third major Hollywood union, the Directors Guild of America, that was ratified by its membership on June 24. But that settlement did not move the writers or actors toward an agreement with the studios.\n\nContributing: Brian Truitt, USA TODAY\n\nA movie fan's guide to the strike:Wait, will 'Barbie' and 'Oppenheimer' come out?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2023/04/13/writers-strike-hollywood-2023-wga-contract-explained/11634717002/", "title": "Writers strike 2023 explained: Why and what it means for TV, film", "text": "Hollywood writers have left their keyboards behind.\n\nAt 12:01am Tuesday, the Writers Guild of America, the union representing most of Hollywood's scribes behind your favorite TV shows and films, went on strike. The board of directors for the WGA, which includes both a West and an East branch, voted unanimously to strike after talks between the guild and Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the nine largest studios, failed to reach a contract. Writers, they said, are facing an \"existential crisis.\"\n\nIf it feels like a TV repeat, that's because it's all happened before. For 100 days in 2007 and 2008, writers went on strike, bringing the entertainment industry to a halt. Now those behind everything from network series like CBS' \"NCIS\" to Marvel movies to streaming series including Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" will hit the picket lines for the first time in 15 years.\n\nLatest strike updates:Hollywood writers, slamming 'gig economy,' go on strike\n\nHollywood haschanged significantly since 2008, led by the rise of streaming services. This has upended the traditional pay structure in the industry and, as the WGA argues, has led more writers longer for less pay (streaming series often have longer production schedules but fewer episodes per season, which is how their pay is calculated). At the same time, entertainment conglomerates are seeing financial losses, cutting jobs and have been shelving TV shows and movies.\n\nWe answer every question about the strike.\n\nWhy did the WGA go on strike?\n\nWriters are primarily looking for more compensation, with many pointing to the rise of streaming as having a negative effect on their earnings. In TV, writers are often paid per episode, and where a broadcast series once produced 22 or more installments each season, streaming series are more typically eight to 13 episodes.\n\nResiduals or royalties, which earn writers, actors and producers (among others) money after a TV show's debut when it airs or streams elsewhere, are lower for streaming shows than for broadcast shows that air reruns on cable or syndication.These lower minimums were established when streaming was in its infancy, and because streamers often insist on exclusivity, limiting the distribution of their shows elsewhere. In their pattern of demands, the guild also asked studios to standardize compensation forscreenwriting – regardless of whether a film is released theatrically or on streaming – and increase studio contributions to the pension plan and health fund.\n\nWhat about my favorite TV shows?How the writers strike will shut down some TV, but not all\n\nIn a statement announcing the strike, the WGA said, \"The companies' behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing ... They have closed the door on their labor force and opened the door to writing as an entirely freelance profession. No such deal could ever be contemplated by this membership.\"\n\nMembers of the guild tweeted details of the negotiations, including the AMPTP's counteroffers and outright rejections of many proposals, including setting a minimum number of writers to staff a show.\n\nWhy did the studios reject WGA proposals?\n\nThe studios approached the negotiations with \"the long-term health and stability of the industry as our priority,\" AMPTP said in a statement shortly before the talks began, and it has been a shaky time in the industry. Entertainment conglomerates and streaming services are looking to bolstertheir bottom lines, ratcheting back a spending spree on new content that has hurt profits. Many have reported losses from streaming to Wall Street in recent months and made plans to lay off thousands of employees.\n\nThe AMPTP said it presented \"a comprehensive package proposal to the Guild (April 30) which included generous increases in compensation for writers as well as improvements in streaming residuals. The AMPTP also indicated to the WGA that it is prepared to improve that offer, but was unwilling to do so because of the magnitude of other proposals still on the table that the Guild continues to insist upon.\"\n\nWhat TV shows and movies will be affected by a writers strike?\n\nViewers will first notice the effects on daytime and late-night talk shows, from \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and \"The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon.\" Topical talk shows depend on writers and tape shows the day they air. So a strike immediately forces a shutdown.NBC's \"Saturday Night Live\" is also done for the remainder of the season, as three May episodes will be canceled. (The May 6 show was already being written for host Pete Davidson).Daytime soap operas also will run out of new episodes within a few weeks.\n\nMore:Is your favorite network TV show renewed, canceled or ‘on the bubble’? Our 2023 status report\n\nMost broadcast shows, such as NBC's \"Law & Order\" and ABC's \"Abbott Elementary,\" will finish their seasons; their finale episodes have already been written and filmed. But a prolonged strike could affect how soon they return in the fall. (A handful, including NBC's \"Quantum Leap,\" already produced episodes for next season in preparation for a strike.) Streaming shows operate with far longer lead times, meaning the delays caused by any work stoppage won't be felt for months. But it's uncertain whether actors (also unionized in the Screen Actors Guild) would agree to film projects from already completed scripts during a strike.\n\nMovies have an even longer lag time, so titles set to release in 2024 and 2025 are most likely to be affected by a strike, forcing delays.\n\nThe longer thestrike goes on, the more studios, streamers and networks will draw programming from non-WGA sources: Reality shows and foreign TV.

The Screen Actors Guild (SAG-AFTRA), the union that represents American film and TV actors, announced Thursday its members would go on strike after failing to reach a contract agreement with major studios. Much of Hollywood has already shut down because of the ongoing writers strike that began May 2, and the actors' work stoppage will essentially bring most movie and TV production worldwide to a halt. Key issues for the actors are how they get paid in an industry now dominated by streaming services, and how artificial intelligence will be used in Hollywood. The latest updates on the labor battle.\n\nOTC birth control gets FDA approval\n\nIt's official: The first over-the-counter birth control pill could hit store shelves early next year. The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday signed off on Opill (norgestrel), a once-a-day tablet that will soon be readily available to consumers online and at drug stores, grocery stores and convenience stores. Opill has been available by prescription since 1973, but its over-the-counter status could go a long way toward removing barriers to access since people will be able to get an oral contraceptive without the need to first see a healthcare provider.

Congressman receives ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Embattled Rep. George Santos was expelled from Congress Friday after a scathing House Ethics Committee report found substantial evidence Santos misused campaign funds for his own personal benefit and committed federal crimes.\n\nThe House voted to boot Santos, R-N.Y., from the lower chamber by a bipartisan vote of 311-114. An expulsion vote requires a two-thirds vote to pass − a heavy lift in the divided House.\n\nDespite the early momentum for his expulsion, Santos' removal was still in question the morning of the vote as lawmakers demurred over whether they were certain they had the votes to oust him. All of the top House GOP leadership, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced they would vote against his expulsion.\n\nSpeaking outside the Capitol steps, members of New York's GOP delegation, who spearheaded the efforts to expel Santos, took a victory lap but lamented that Santos hadn't stepped down in the first place.\n\n\"It's a sad day,\" Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., said. \"We hear about Santos every single day. You go to the barber shop, you go to church, you go to the post office, you go get a slice of good New York pizza and people want to talk about George Santos.\"\n\n\"Santos should have held himself accountable and he should have resigned when he had the chance,\" he added.\n\nLawmakers who voted against Santos' expulsion sought not to defend the first-term lawmaker's alleged misconduct but expressed concerns over setting new precedent in Congress. Only two House members have been expelled in modern times and both were convicted of crimes before their expulsion.\n\nTrouble from before Day One\n\nThe New York native has been mired in controversy since before he entered Congress, when it was reported Santos had baldly embellished and fabricated parts of his resume and background, including claims that he'd worked at the Goldman Sachs investment bank and that his grandmother was a victim of the Holocaust.\n\n\"I've been a terrible liar,\" he said during a TV interview last February.\n\nDuring his brief tenure in Congress, the Long Island Republican was slapped with a multitude of federal charges, including money laundering, wire fraud, identity theft, credit card fraud and lying to Congress.\n\nSantos faced calls to resign from both sides of the aisle in the face of those controversies, but he remained defiant up until his expulsion. While he has admitted to lying about his background, he has denied all wrongdoing and has pleaded not guilty to the federal charges.\n\nHis opponents have pushed to remove him from Congress twice already, but those efforts ultimately failed while lawmakers awaited the House Ethics Committee to release its report.\n\n\"I've been very clear. He's unfit to serve and I've been clear from the start that he needed to go,\" Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said Friday. \"You cannot allow a sociopath to serve in public office when you know full well that he defrauded voters and donors and the evidence was overwhelming.\"\n\nHouse report: Santos 'cannot be trusted'\n\nAfter the damning report was made public last month, momentum to expel Santos once and for all swiftly gained traction, leading to Friday's vote on an expulsion resolution introduced by Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., chairman of the Ethics Committee.\n\nThe 56-page ethics report found evidence Santos sought to “exploit” his House campaign for his financial benefit including “blatantly” stealing from his own campaign and deceiving campaign donors.\n\n“Representative George Santos cannot be trusted. At nearly every opportunity, he placed his desire for private gain above his duty to uphold the Constitution, federal law, and ethical principles,” the Ethics Committee report read.\n\nDisgrace, or a 'badge of honor'?\n\nIn one instance, Santos allegedly used $50,000 in campaign funds to pay off his own personal debt; make a purchase at Hermes, a luxury apparel store; make smaller purchases on OnlyFans, a subscription service for explicit content; at the personal care retailer Sephora; and for meals and parking.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Santos’ lies were so extravagant, his own campaign staff called him a “fabulist” and encouraged him to “seek treatment,” according to the report.\n\nDespite the clear resounding support among both Democrats and Republicans to expel him in advance of the House’s vote, Santos refused to resign and accepted his fate, saying in a three-hour conversation on X spaces, formerly Twitter spaces, that he would take his removal in stride and “wear it like a badge of honor.”\n\nTrouble for the GOP\n\nSantos has also derided the ethics report as an attempt to “smear me” and “force me out of my seat,” saying it “wasn’t a finding of facts.”\n\nSantos’ expulsion is a rare sight for Congress. Santos is the sixth member ever to be expelled from the House and is the first member in modern times to be expelled without having been convicted of a crime. His absence will shrink the House GOP's already razor-thin majority to 221 seats over Democrats' 213 seats.\n\nTo make matters worse for Republicans, Santos' district leans Democratic, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, offering Democrats a pick-up opportunity to narrow the GOP's majority further. New York law mandates Gov. Kathy Hochul must declare a special election within ten days of a seat's vacancy, and the state must hold the election between 70-80 days after Hochul's proclamation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/30/who-expelled-congress-george-santos/71741609007/", "title": "Who was expelled from Congress? George Santos and 5 others", "text": "WASHINGTON — Embattled Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., was expelled from Congress on Friday, making him the sixth House lawmaker in history to be ousted from his post.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee released a scathing report earlier this month that alleged Santos “blatantly stole from his own campaign,” deceived donors into making payments for his own benefit and violated federal criminal laws. Some of the items he misused his campaign funds on allegedly include Botox and a honeymoon in Vegas.\n\nDespite Santos' dismissal of the report, which he described as an attempt to smear him and force him out of his seat, the House voted 311-114 in a bipartisan fashion to oust Santos.\n\nThough Santos is out of his job, he isn't alone in his predicament. Here's a look at the five House members who have been expelled throughout American history.\n\nCivil War expulsions\n\nThree members of the House were expelled in 1861 for their disloyalty to the union as the nation faced the Civil War: John Bullock Clark and John William Reid of Missouri and Henry Cornelius Burnett of Kentucky.\n\nClark served as the brigadier general of Missouri Confederate state troops. Reid served in the Confederate Army during the Civil War as volunteer aide to General Sterling Price. Burnett served as a colonel in the Kentucky infantry in the Confederate Army.\n\nRep. Michael “Ozzie” Myers ousted after Abscam operation\n\nRep. Michael “Ozzie” Myers, D-Pa., was ousted from the House in 1980 by an overwhelming vote of 370-30. The move came after he was caught taking bribes in the Abscam sting operation.\n\nThe operation consisted of FBI officials posing as Middle Eastern businessmen and offering money to government officials in exchange for political favors, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum. The goal of the mission was to trap corrupt public officials.\n\nMyers was convicted of bribery and conspiracy for taking $50,000 from an undercover agent. He was also sentenced to 30 months in prison last year for election fraud after he pleaded guilty to charges tied to fraudulently stuffing ballot boxes for Democrats.\n\nRep. James Traficant removed over corruption\n\nTraficant was expelled from Congress in 2002 by a vote of 420-1 following his conviction by a federal jury on 10 corruption-related counts, including bribery, racketeering and tax evasion charges, according to the Associated Press.\n\nAmong other accusations, prosecutors alleged he used his office to extract bribes from businesspeople and forced staffers to work on his farm and his house boat on the Potomac River in Washington. After he was expelled, Traficant ran as an independent candidate for another House term while incarcerated.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/29/george-santos-expulsion-house-gop/71732297007/", "title": "House to vote on expelling Republican George Santos as outrage ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Momentum is surging among House lawmakers to expel indicted Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., and the lower chamber was expected vote on whether to boot him as early as Wednesday afternoon − a rare sight in Congress.\n\nSantos all but accepted his fate this week as support quickly built for his expulsion among members on both sides of the aisle. The Long Island Republican has said he will take his expulsion in stride and “wear it like a badge of honor.”\n\nTwo House Democrats, Robert Garcia of California and Dan Goldman of New York, filed a privileged resolution Tuesday afternoon to force a vote on the House floor, essentially guaranteeing lawmakers will have to decide Santos’ fate this week. A privileged resolution is a procedural move to force the House to take up a measure within two legislative days.\n\n“He has clearly committed massive crimes. He has lied to his constituents. His whole life is a fabrication, and he himself is prepared to be expelled,” Garcia said Tuesday after filing the resolution, though Santos has maintained his innocence as he faces federal charges.\n\nEfforts to expel Santos, who has already survived two expulsion attempts, picked up steam after the House Ethics Committee released a scathing report earlier this month finding substantial evidence Santos broke federal laws and misused his campaign for his personal benefit.\n\nAmong the findings in the committee’s 56-page report was Santos allegedly misrepresenting his campaign finances and using money for his own financial benefit. In one instance, Santos is accused of taking $50,000 from his campaign to make purchases at Hermes, a luxury apparel store; at OnlyFans and Sephora; and for meals and parking.\n\nThe freshman GOP member has long been a controversial figure in Congress after it was reported he fabricated his resume on the campaign trail and misrepresented his background to constituents. During his tenure, Santos also has been hit with multiple federal charges related to his campaign, including money laundering, wire fraud, credit card fraud and identity theft.\n\nThough Santos has admitted to lying about his background, he has denied all wrongdoing related to his campaign and has pleaded not guilty to the charges leveled against him.\n\nHouse Ethics Committee Chair Michael Guest, R-Miss., had filed an expulsion resolution against Santos after the report’s release. But the resolution was not noticed as privileged until Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y., on Tuesday evening also forced the House to take up the effort within two legislative days.\n\nGuest's resolution, which is led by Santos' GOP opponents, is expected to be the bill taken up on the House floor to remove Santos.\n\nGarcia and Goldman described their expulsion efforts as an “insurance policy” to ensure the House votes to expel Santos this week and deter House GOP leadership from stalling his potential removal.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has been staying in touch with Santos and has been discussing alternative avenues for the embattled New York Republican. Johnson has not urged Santos to resign but told him a resignation would prevent GOP lawmakers from having to take a tough vote, Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., told reporters Tuesday afternoon after a closed-door meeting of Republican leadership.\n\nSantos confirmed to reporters Tuesday that he was in contact with Johnson and said he told the speaker he will stay in office until he is expelled or his term ends, daring his detractors to put an expulsion vote on the floor.\n\nIt's time for his opponents to \"put up or shut up at this point,\" Santos said.\n\nThere is largely bipartisan support to expel Santos, which, unlike most other votes, requires a two-thirds vote to pass.\n\nThe first expulsion resolution, which the House voted on in May, was led by Garcia and failed. It was referred to the Ethics Committee, which was already investigating Santos at the time.\n\nEarlier in November, Santos’ fellow New York Republicans led the second effort to expel him, but that effort also failed as both Democrats and Republicans deferred to the House Ethics Committee to release its long-awaited report. After the report’s release, multiple members who voted against expelling Santos have flipped and said they would now support removing him from Congress.\n\n“Rep. Santos’ actions warrant punishment and he should no longer serve in the House. If he does not resign, I would vote to expel him,” Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., who originally voted against Santos’ expulsion, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nSantos would be the first member in recent years to be removed from Congress without being convicted of a crime. He has argued he deserves due process and should not be expelled as he goes through the legal process.\n\nGoldman, a former federal prosecutor, disputed Santos’ arguments on the Capitol steps.\n\n“There is a very important standard in criminal law which is that you are innocent until proven guilty,” Goldman said. “That does apply to being a member of Congress. You do not need to have a criminal conviction to be unfit for office and to warrant expulsion.\n\n“It is time once and for all for George Santos to leave the halls of Congress.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/11/30/george-santos-expulsion-house-bullying-congress/71752002007/", "title": "George Santos claims expulsion vote is 'bullying' him out of Congress", "text": "WASHINGTON – George Santos remained defiant in the face of his likely expulsion at a press conference Thursday morning, arguing his detractors were “bullying” him out of Congress and denying a scathing House Ethics Committee report that accused him of wrongdoing.\n\nSantos, R-N.Y., has refused to resign and has promised to take his expulsion in stride: “If I leave, they win. If I leave, the bullies take place. This is bullying.”\n\nIn what could be one of his final acts in Congress, Santos is targeting one of his fellow New Yorkers and announced he will introduce his own privileged expulsion resolution on Thursday against Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., for pulling a fire alarm in a House office building. The privileged expulsion resolution would technically force a vote within two legislative days, but it is unclear if it would make it to the floor if Santos is expelled.\n\nSantos has argued his expulsion would break precedent in the House as he faces federal charges but has yet to be convicted. Bowman, who has already pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge related to the fire alarm incident, deserves to be expelled instead, Santos said.\n\n“Let’s hold our own accountable but let’s make sure we deal with the precedent of the House,” he said.\n\nBowman dismissed Santos' expulsion efforts, calling it in a statement, \"another meaningless stunt in his long history of cons, antics, and outright fraud.\"\n\nThe House is expected to vote on Santos’ expulsion on Friday.\n\nWhile the embattled and indicted freshman GOP member broadly defended himself against the claims in the House Ethics Committee report, which accused him of misusing campaign funds for his personal benefit, Santos declined to refute the details of the report.\n\nInstead, Santos said he would “unpack it entirely” in the future, calling it “counterproductive” for him to pick apart the report at the moment.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/12/18/december-2023-photos-of-the-year/71621660007/", "title": "Best photos of December 2023: USA TODAY's most memorable shots", "text": "Visual Editors\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nWe will update this page with more images as the month progresses.\n\nEmbattled Rep.

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Saturday, December 2nd, 2023. This is The Excerpt.\n\nToday, remembering former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, plus George Santos has been expelled from Congress, and we hear from the Golden Bachelor.\n\n♦\n\nRetired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has died. She was the first woman to serve on the nation's highest court and was a crucial swing vote during her nearly 25 year tenure. She was President Ronald Reagan's first nominee to the Supreme Court, joining in 1981 after previously serving as majority leader in Arizona State Senate. Also, the first woman to hold that title in the nation.\n\nDuring her time on the Supreme Court, O'Connor was often a pivotal vote in blockbuster cases. That includes helping to craft a 1992 opinion and Planned Parenthood versus Casey, which upheld a woman's right to an abortion, but allowed states to impose additional restrictions. That decision along with the 1973 ruling in Roe versus Wade was overruled by the court's conservative majority last year.\n\nO'Connor also cast decisive swing votes in landmark cases involving affirmative action, environmental protection, and religious freedom. Raised on an Arizona cattle ranch, she called herself the first cowgirl to serve on the Supreme Court. She stepped down from the court in 2006 to care for her husband, John Jay O'Connor, who had advanced Alzheimer's and died in 2009.\n\nAfter an active post court career, including serving as Chancellor of the College of William and Mary, O'Connor largely remained out of public view following her dementia diagnosis in 2018. Sandra Day O'Connor was 93.\n\n♦\n\nEmbattled Republican Congressman George Santos has been expelled from Congress. The House voted yesterday to boot him from the chamber by a bipartisan vote of 311 to 114. An expulsion vote requires a two-thirds vote to pass, a heavy lift in the divided house. The vote came after a scathing house ethics committee report found substantial evidence that Santos misused campaign funds for his own personal benefit and committed federal crimes.\n\nLawmakers who voted against Santos's expulsion did not try to defend his alleged misconduct, but they expressed concerns over setting a new precedent in Congress. Only two House members have been expelled in modern times and both were convicted of crimes before their expulsions. Those who pushed for Santos to be expelled took a victory lap, but also were frustrated he hadn't stepped down in the first place.\n\n♦\n\nFormer President Donald Trump faces gag orders or restricted speech in three of his ongoing legal sagas. He says they interfere with his 2024 presidential campaign, while judges are trying to protect staffers and witnesses. I spoke with USA Today Justice Department correspondent Bart Jansen for more.\n\nBart, thanks for hopping on.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart, I want to just walk through these gag orders Trump currently faces. We've talked about what's happened in the New York civil fraud trial a bit here on the show. Can you refresh our listeners how this gag order came to be?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThe New York case is a civil fraud case. We're still in the middle of it. It's going to run till toward the end of the year. Trump has been critical of the clerk who assists the judge in that case. He thinks she's partisan, he thinks she's got too much influence over the judge, and so the judge issued an order saying, \"You can't talk about my court staff.\" Then, through two violations of that order, Trump has been fined $15,000. He appealed the order and we just got a decision on Thursday from an appellate court saying the order would stand for now. The appeals panel is still considering the entire case, but at this point the gag order is on in the New York case.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTrump also faces a gag order in the federal election conspiracy case. What's that issue here, Bart?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThat trial is scheduled for March 4th, and in that the federal judge issued a gag order saying no talking about prosecutors, court staff, or potential witnesses in the case. It's a little bit broader. Her goal is to ensure a fair trial. Doesn't want too much information out tainting whatever witnesses might have to say in that case. Trump has also appealed that order, and we just had oral arguments at the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on November 20th. We're waiting for a decision from that court, and that's maybe the bigger deal because it would be a Federal Circuit for an entire region and potentially affect how these orders are viewed in a broader way, potentially nationwide. How much can you say about a criminal case while it's still pending? How do you balance First Amendment rights of the speaker against the Fifth Amendment rights of a fair trial?\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nTrump's bond agreement in the Georgia election racketeering case has some pretty specific requirements about who he can speak with. What are the conditions in this case?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nIn that case, his bond agreement required that he not contact witnesses in that case and not threaten or intimidate them. It's similar to a gag order, but it was part of the bond agreement. Of course, he has not challenged that. That was something he had to sign just to get released as the charges were filed. Those are the three major restrictions on his speech in those cases that are pending against him.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart, trying to get to the heart of the impact of these restrictions. Could Trump see jail time for violating any of these?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nYeah. The penalties open to the judges is basically for contempt of court. There's a whole bunch of ways that you can show your contempt for a judge, but in this case, the gag orders or the bond agreement would be punished initially by fines, usually. So he has already been fined in the New York case. That would be the threat in the DC case if her order is upheld, and if there are repeated violations with escalating fines, legal experts tell me it could sooner or later come to a threat of imprisonment. That would be a big step even if he weren't a former president of the United States, and legal experts are telling me it would depend on what the violation was, how much it had been repeated. So I don't think anything like that would be imminent. He also appears to have been very careful about how he comments while the orders are in place. But yes, potentially imprisonment is one of the sanctions on the table if a judge felt like he went too far.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart, what impact could all these gag orders have on Trump's presidential campaign?\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nWell, that's the big thrust about why he's trying to get the orders lifted. He's appealed both orders. The New York case is in the midst of being tried. He is appealing. The federal cases are pending and months away. It's in the middle of the primary season where he is the leading Republican candidate for the nomination for president in 2024. He's trying to win back the White House, and the major focus of all of his appeals is that his First Amendment right to political speech should allow him to say what he wants about these cases. He's trying to defend himself in the court of public opinion in addition to the trial court.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBart Jansen covers the Justice Department for USA Today. Thanks as always, Bart.\n\nBart Jansen:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIsrael has resumed its airstrikes on Gaza after a week long truce expired. Israel pounded targets in Southern Gaza earlier today, and at least 200 Palestinians have been killed since fighting resumed yesterday morning according to Gaza's health ministry. Israel initially halted the flow of humanitarian aid entering Gaza after resuming airstrikes yesterday, but later allowed a few dozen aid trucks to enter at the request of the Biden administration.\n\nSecretary of State, Antony Blinken, yesterday wrapped up his third Middle East tour since the war broke out. The US says it's pushing for another pause in fighting and for remaining hostages held by Hamas to be released.\n\n♦\n\nIf you haven't caught up yet with the Golden Bachelor on your DVR, here's a spoiler warning, but the world learned Thursday night that Gary Turner, the 72-year-old star of the season, is engaged to contestant Theresa Nist, who herself is 70. The couple sat down with USA Today's Brian Alexander to discuss the hit show and what's next for them.\n\nTheresa Nist:\n\nThat was crazy.\n\nGary:\n\nIt was. That's unnatural.\n\nTheresa Nist:\n\nYes.\n\nGary:\n\nTo have that big a secret and have to keep it for that long.\n\nTheresa Nist:\n\nI was able to go home and just scream to the rooftops with my daughter and her husband, and actually the three little boys kept this secret this entire time.\n\nBryan Alexander:\n\nI know.\n\nTheresa Nist:\n\nBut I kept it from the rest of the world and my two sisters who drove me crazy every day. \"Theresa, tell me. Tell me. Tell me.\"\n\nBryan Alexander:\n\nTheresa knew they had a spark, but was surprised when Gary chose her.\n\nTheresa Nist:\n\nOh, so surprised. I mean, really. When I was walking down to see whether... It was in my mind. A million things were going through my mind. Is he going to ask me to marry him? Is he going to ask Leslie? Will he ask no one? It was nerve wracking walking down to him to find out, and very, yeah, how surprised, because after he told me, he started out pretty poorly making it sound like he was saying goodbye to me, and my heart pretty much stopped and I said, \"Oh, he's saying goodbye. I can't believe this. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Someone come and take me away.\" I really felt that for I don't know how long, and then he quickly recovered. It was amazing when he actually asked me. So, yeah.\n\nBryan Alexander:\n\nAs to what it was like watching Gary court other women at the same time?\n\nTheresa Nist:\n\nYou know what? We had discussed the entire whole journey, so I really knew, but to see it on TV, it was a little more impactful. But we had discussed everything, and so I just had to absorb it after I actually saw it. But I knew the process. I knew that this was a journey that he had to take and that he had to fully explore it with every woman, or he would've done himself a disservice.\n\nGary:\n\nThat's very much indicative of something I was going to say too. Theresa deserves so much credit for being unselfish and open-minded and not jealous about things that occurred, because I really did have concerns, that if she's watching this, I would feel awful, and I thought she would feel awful about certain things. She did not and it is so, so big-\n\nTheresa Nist:\n\nYeah, thank you.\n\nGary:\n\n... that she was able to keep that frame of mind.\n\nTheresa Nist:\n\nI think I felt so secure in our love that I was able to deal with that.\n\nBryan Alexander:\n\nBoth say they're now in it for the long haul.\n\nGary:\n\nI committed to Theresa that I would not ask her to marry me if I wasn't 1,000% committed to it, and I am now as I was at that moment, 1,000%. When you're older, the clock ticks a little faster, so you realize that, hey, like Theresa said, if you love someone, say it.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find more of their conversation with a link in today's show notes.\n\n♦\n\nThanks for listening to The Excerpt.

It's the second Super Bowl for both, games both their teams won.\n\nThe brothers graduated from Cleveland Heights High School in Cuyahoga County in 2006 (Jason) and 2008 (Travis). While their football careers eventually converged at the University of Cincinnati, their roads to success had twists and turns.\n\nFormer UC football coaches Mark Dantonio, Brian Kelly and Butch Jones remember Jason and Travis Kelce\n\nTo those who witnessed their time around Nippert Stadium, the Kelces were always entertaining and somewhat mischievous.\n\nWatching Jason Kelce dress up as a Mummer's Parade member when the Eagles won Super Bowl 52 in 2018 or watching Travis Kelce, a 2019 Super Bowl champ, do the UC cheer after touchdowns, surprised no one who followed their time as Bearcats.\n\n\"I was just trying to make sure they made it to the next game,\" current LSU coach Brian Kelly said of his UC time with the brothers (December 2006-December 2009). \"They were great personalities. Jason was an emotional leader. He loved his teammates. He loved playing for Cincinnati.\"\n\nHow Jason Kelce went from Cincinnati walk-on to NFL All-Pro\n\nNow 35, Jason Kelce came to UC's campus as a walk-on linebacker. A few pounds and practice scuffles later, he was an offensive lineman and eventually a sixth-round pick of the Eagles in 2011.\n\nIn 2006, as a Bearcat redshirt for Mark Dantonio, Jason was Scout Team Defensive Player of the Year. At one point mid-year, Dantonio needed a scout team offensive lineman. He approached Jason even though at 240 pounds, he was some 50 pounds lighter than his current playing weight.\n\nJason Kelce sings national anthem:Former Cincinnati Bearcat sings prior to 76ers game\n\n\"We asked him to move over for just one week,\" Dantonio said. \"He did and played center. We got into a situation where we had to keep him there because of injuries. It's pretty crazy how his career sort of changed when he became an offensive center. He was so much more athletic than the guys that were around him.\"\n\nThat said, Dantonio admits he didn't see him as an All-Pro offensive lineman for all of these years. He credits Jason's hard work and toughness, something he preached relentlessly throughout his coaching career.\n\nJason Kelce wasn't the first diamond-in-the-rough Dantonio recruited at UC who became a Philadelphia Eagle. Dantonio also happened upon a two-star recruit playing basketball at Detroit Jesuit, Connor Barwin. He became a tight end for Dantonio then shifted to defensive line under Brian Kelly.\n\nAfter Michigan State hired Dantonio in November 2006, Jason Kelce continued the transition to center and guard under new coach Kelly. Kelly's offense at the time needed more athleticism from the linemen to be able to roll out. They had to drop weight to fit Kelly's scheme, but Kelce's build and attitude fit fine.\n\n\"We were going to a spread offense,\" Kelly said. \"His ability to move and pull and do the things we wanted to do, it was a great fit.\"\n\n'He's one of the smartest football players I've ever coached': Butch Jones on Travis Kelce\n\nBy 2010, Kelly was gone and Butch Jones was at the helm. Concerned about his size in terms of pro ball, Bearcat No. 60 lobbied Jones to switch him back to linebacker. Jones instead had him stay with the O-line and had him focus on his abilities at center.\n\nHe's been a mainstay at the position ever since as a six-time Pro Bowl selection, even though the Patriots did work him out as a fullback before he was drafted. At the 2011 NFL Combine, Jason Kelce had the fastest 40-yard dash of any offensive lineman at 4.89.\n\n\"He's one of the smartest football players I've ever coached,\" Jones said. \"It gets back to his competitiveness and his toughness. It's second to none. When you put the smarts and toughness together, that's what you get in Jason Kelce.\"\n\n'That is an NFL tight end!': Younger brother Travis Kelce makes impression on Brian Kelly\n\nTravis Kelce, 33, was a two-star recruit out of Cleveland Heights as a quarterback. Still, he was 6-foot-5 with athletic ability and an attitude. Kelly famously pointed out the lanky lad taking reps with the quarterbacks in 2008.\n\nTo all within earshot, he proclaimed, \"That is an NFL tight end!\"\n\nDantonio knew about the younger Kelce while recruiting for Michigan State but the Spartans stopped short of offering him at quarterback.\n\n'I'm not eating it':Travis Kelce discusses Skyline Chili\n\n\"You had to sort of project him to tight end or defensive end,\" Dantonio said. \"I know he went to Cincinnati and excelled and the rest is history.\"\n\nKelly would keep Kelce at quarterback using him as an occasional \"Wildcat\" option near the goal line, something the Chiefs have done every now and then.\n\n\"We saw him as an athlete that could do a lot of things for us,\" Kelly said. \"I think in his first game against Rutgers he had a couple touchdowns.\"\n\nKelly was careful not to immediately move the younger Kelce to tight end, instead making it gradual.\n\nHow Travis Kelce went from suspension to team leader at Cincinnati\n\nAhead of the Bearcats' 2009 Sugar Bowl against Florida, Kelly left to coach Notre Dame. Before that game, UC announced Travis Kelce's suspension for the upcoming season for violating team rules, which was later determined to be a positive marijuana test.\n\nWhen Travis returned in 2011, Jones was at the helm of the Bearcats, his older brother was keeping him on the straight and narrow and he was a full-time tight end. The former three-sport Cleveland Heights standout caught 11 balls in 2011, then 45 in 2022 with eight touchdowns.\n\n\"In all of my years of coaching, I've never had an individual change his ways, change his outlook, change his lifestyle, change anything like Travis has,\" Jones said.\n\nJones had a group of retired military trainers come in to assess his team and pick out leaders. The current Arkansas State and former Tennessee coach said they've never failed in their recommendations of leaders through shared adversity. Jones remembered looking at the trainers in shock as they rated Travis Kelce as his team leader.\n\n\"They try to expose you,\" Jones said. \"The leader said, 'He's got influence, coach. They go how he goes.' They were 100% right. His senior year was remarkable.\"\n\nTravis Kelce's Chiefs have never lost against Jason Kelce's Eagles\n\nThe blue-collar toughness of the family shows as neither Kelce was a celebrated first-round pick. Both overcame odds in college and in the pros to become among the all-time best at their positions. Since the brothers have been in the league, their teams have met three times, with the Chiefs winning each game. The latest gathering was Oct. 3, 2021, a 42-30 Kansas City win at Lincoln Financial Field and the last duel between Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes at quarterback.\n\nHurts threw for 387 yards and ran for 47 behind Jason Kelce's line but Mahomes was 24-of-30 for five touchdowns in the Chiefs' victory with four completions to Travis Kelce.\n\nTravis Kelce's eight Pro Bowl selections give the family 14 Pro Bowls, a pair of Super Bowl championships and likely a triumphant 58-mile drive from Cleveland Heights to Canton someday to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nBoth have returned to Cincinnati periodically to take in Bearcat games. Travis Kelce was in Dallas for UC's College Football Playoff semifinal in the 2021 Cotton Bowl vs. Alabama, along with teammate Mahomes.\n\nDue to their personalities, their careers will go on long past the playing field. Recently, they've started a podcast called \"New Heights,\" a once-a-week offering on Apple podcasts where they're labeled \"football's funniest family duo.\" Their topics have varied between Buffalo's Damar Hamlin, retired tight end Rob Gronkowski, Waffle House and alien conspiracies.\n\nSpirited combat between the Kelce brothers\n\nThere's rarely been a dull moment between the two brothers. If a scuffle broke out at a Bearcat practice, odds are Jason Kelce was involved. Media would sometimes try to guess at which point in practice the melee would begin. The Eagles center was one of UC's most prolific helmet throwers.\n\nTravis Kelce was also known for his ferocious play as coach Jones could attest. All know his talents as a receiver but he was also pretty good at taking his 250 pounds to move the opposition forcefully out of the way. Referees would often pre-warn Jones to keep a handle on his tight end.\n\n\"I would have officials come up to me before the game and say, 'You need to help us control No. 18 today,'\" Jones said. \"'He's borderline on every play. We're going to need your help.' I would just look at them and smile at them because the opposing coach must have said something. That was Travis.\"\n\nDonna Kelce supporting Philadelphia Eagles, Kansas City Chiefs in 2023 Super Bowl\n\nOn Feb. 12, Donna Kelce will again be supporting two sons in her custom-made double jersey. It's a combination of Jason's No. 62 for the Eagles and No. 87 for Travis. The jersey could accompany Ed and Donna's boys to Canton someday.\n\nRather than pick a squad, Mrs. Kelce has said she pulls for both offenses. Her competitive sons typically give her a reason to cheer.\n\n\"Even when they were at Cincinnati, there was a competitiveness that was there,\" Kelly said. \"They love each other, don't get me wrong. But, these two were as competitive as any two guys that I've had. As brothers, they didn't hide it. They're going to be pulling for each other in only one fashion: that they get to beat each other. It'll be quite a matchup.\"\n\nDonna Kelce:Mom delivers homemade cookies to sons Jason and Travis at Super Bowl Opening Night\n\nSaid Jones, \"What's kept their longevity is obviously they work very hard in the offseason. But, that internal drive, that competitive drive, they're always competing with each other to be better than they were the previous year. They're just gritty, tough, hard-nosed good teammates that play with a lot of energy and passion. It's fun to watch. They're the personalities of their team. You talk about two proud parents.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super-bowl/2023/02/12/super-bowl-2023-live-updates-chiefs-eagles/11218626002/", "title": "Super Bowl 2023 score: Chiefs top Eagles 38-35 with late Mahomes ...", "text": "On one leg, Patrick Mahomes finished the job.

A controversial holding penalty by Eagles cornerback James Bradberry gave the Chiefs a chance to run the clock down and kick a game-winning field goal with eight seconds left, which Harrison Butker nailed from 27 yards.\n\nMahomes finished 21 of 27 for 182 yards with three touchdowns. Kansas City scored a touchdown on its first three drives of the second half after trailing at halftime 24-14.\n\nEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was 27 of 37 for 304 yards passing, but was a force on the ground.

Patrick Mahomes is 27. He's on a team-friendly contract. In the five seasons he has been starter, the Chiefs have made it at least to the AFC title game. As long as Mahomes is under center, this will be the standard. He won his second Super Bowl MVP days after he won his second league MVP.\n\nMahomes had his right ankle injury reaggravated late in the second quarter when Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards fell on it as he dragged him to the turf. Ho hum. All Mahomes did after the injury was complete 13 of 14 passes for 93 yards and a pair of scores. As if that wasn't enough, with 2:55 left to play in a tie game, he outran the Eagles defense on a 26-yard scramble that set up the game-winning field goal.\n\nRead Lorenzo Reyes' full analysis of Super Bowl 57's winners and losers here.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles had a 10-point lead as Rihanna took center stage at halftime.

The playing conditions were less than pretty.\n\nPlayers from both the Eagles and Chiefs struggled to get traction on the natural grass and slipped many times. At least half a dozen Eagles players switched cleats during the first half in an attempt to get a better grip, including quarterback Jalen Hurts, who changed from Jordan 11 cleats to Jordan 1 cleats.\n\nEagles offensive lineman Jordan Mailata, who said he's \"not a grass expert,\" described the conditions as \"pretty slippery,\" similar to \"playing on a water park.\" — Cydney Henderson\n\nSuper Bowl 57 was one of the highest-scoring Super Bowl games ever played. It was a thrilling showdown that featured numerous records either broken (longest punt return) or tied (most points scored by a player, Jalen Hurts with 20).\n\nHere is a look at the highest-scoring Super Bowls.\n\nTravis Kelce was the winner of the unofficial \"Kelce Bowl,\" as his Kansas City Chiefs defeated his brother Jason's Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 57.\n\nBut as the Chiefs celebrated their victory and Travis Kelce gave a memorable postgame interview alongside Patrick Mahomes, he made sure to see his brother following the game, as the Kelce brothers shared an embrace and briefly spoke as the confetti fell down on State Farm Stadium.\n\nJason Kelce can be heard congratulating Travis, even cracking a smile and telling him to \"go celebrate.\" Before they part, both Kelce's told each other \"I love you.\" — Jordan Mendoza\n\nThe Super Bowl, like every other NFL game, has two halves. The Philadelphia Eagles only showed up for one of them.\n\nAfter pushing the Kansas City Chiefs to the brink and hobbling Patrick Mahomes, the Eagles imploded in the second half. They were outscored, outgained, outdisciplined – outhustled – and, as a result, they're out a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nMaybe that's harsh, given the final score was 38-35 and it took the Chiefs until the closing seconds to seal the victory. But when you have a 10-point lead, all the momentum and Mahomes barely able to run off the field at halftime, that's as close to a gimme as it gets in the NFL's biggest game.\n\nRead Nancy Armour's full column here.\n\nThe Blackest, most woke Super Bowl ever — can’t believe I wrote that since this is the Republican NFL, but here we are — started by again featuring the Black national anthem, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” this time performed by Sheryl Lee Ralph.\n\nThen Rihanna performed at halftime.

He found A.J Brown on the next third down for another first. Brown and Hurts connected again for 11 yards and another first.\n\nGiven plenty of time, Hurts found DeVonta Smith streaking down the left sideline on a blown coverage. Smith could not keep his balance and remain in bounds and went out at the 2-yard line, but not before picking up 45 yards. Hurts scored on the next play via a – you guessed it – quarterback sneak.\n\nHurts then tied the game on the ensuing two-point conversion attempt on a designed run to the left, breaking tackles and persevering over the goal line to even it at 35 with 5:15 left in the game.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nKansas City continues second-half domination\n\nKadarius Toney, Super Bowl MVP?\n\nToney had two of the biggest plays for the Chiefs during the fourth quarter, his latest was a 65-yard punt return - the longest in Super Bowl history - went to Philadelphia 5-yard line with 10:11 left in the game.\n\nThree plays later the Chiefs added to their fourth-quarter lead as Patrick Mahomes found receiver Skyy Moore for a 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Chiefs took a 35-27 lead with 9:22 left in the game.\n\nToney, acquired by the Chiefs during the season, is turning out to be a pivotal move that paid off in Kansas City’s favor during the biggest game of the season. His earlier 5-yard touchdown put the Chiefs ahead in the fourth quarter.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nChiefs take first lead in Super Bowl 57\n\nThe Chiefs waiting until the fourth quarter to finally go ahead of the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nPatrick Mahomes found receiver Kadarius Toney for a walk-in 5-yard touchdown, and kicker Harrison Butker made the extra point to put Kansas City ahead 28-27 with 12:04 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nToney went in motion toward the middle of the field, but turned quickly back to the right sidelinefor a wide-open touchdown.\n\nDuring the drive, running back Isiah Pacheco (with runs of 9 and 11 yards) and receiver Juju Smith-Schuster (with four catches for 38 yards) were instrumental for Mahomes and the Chiefs.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nReplay decision helps Eagles add to lead on Chiefs\n\nJalen Hurts could not have thrown a better ball. On third-and-14 from the Kansas City 47, Hurts dropped back on the team’s first drive of the half with a three-point lead. He found tight end Dallas Goedert near the sideline between two defenders past the sticks for what appeared to be yet another third down conversion.\n\nAlthough Goedert bobbled the ball, he regained possession in time to land both feet in bounds and the call was upheld. The challenge cost Andy Reid and the Chiefs their first timeout of the second half.\n\nPhiladelphia moved the ball inside the red zone after the play but had to settle for a field goal to make it 27-21 with 1:45 left in the third quarter.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nHurt ankle, no problem for Patrick Mahomes\n\nAfter injuring his ankle on his final play of the second quarter, Mahomes started the second half, and even ran for a 14-yard gain inside the 5-yard line on the first drive of the third quarter.\n\nMahomes led the Chiefs on a touchdown drive to start the second half, which included a low pass to tight end Travis Kelce that kept their drive alive.\n\nChiefs running back Isiah Pacheco scored on a 1-yard run to help the Chiefs trim their deficit. The Eagles are holding onto a 24-21 lead after the first possession in the second half.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nRihanna shines bright in Super Bowl halftime show\n\nRihanna has already evolved into an immensely successful singer, a business mogul with a net worth of more than $1 billion and, as of last year, a mom.\n\nOn Sunday, the multihyphenate added another accomplishment to the checklist: Super Bowl halftime headliner.\n\nTaking the State Farm Stadium stage in Glendale, Arizona, with her most visible outing in years, Rihanna stormed through a vibrant production that spotlighted her flexible R&B grooves coupled with infectious pop hooks. And, of course, her distinctive fashion style.\n\nALL OF THE LIGHTS:Rihanna stuns in spectacular Super Bowl performance\n\n- Melissa Ruggieri\n\nSuper Bowl halftime stats: Patrick Mahomes held to 89 yards passing\n\nOnly once has a team lost the Super Bowl after leading by double-digits at halftime: the Atlanta Falcons before the New England Patriots staged their famous comeback from a 28-3 deficit six years ago.\n\nThe Eagles, who lead 24-14 at the break, finished the first half with a time of possession of 21:54, leaving the Chiefs with 8:06. They ran 44 plays compared to the Chiefs’ 20 and outgained them 270-128.\n\nHere are some other statistics from the first half:\n\nNotable Eagles stats\n\nThird-down efficiency: 6-for-10,\n\nJalen Hurts: 17-for-22, 183 yards, TD; 11 rushes, 63 yards, 2 TD\n\nDeVonta Smith: six catches, 55 yards\n\nA.J Brown: three catches, 74 yards, TD\n\nNotable Chiefs stats\n\nThird-down efficiency:0-for-3\n\nPatrick Mahomes: 8-for-13, 89 yards, TD\n\nIsiah Pacheco: five carries, 28 yards\n\nTravis Kelce: three catches, 60 yards, TD\n\nBolton: three tackles, fumble recovery, TD\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles take 24-14 lead at halftime after late field goal\n\nIn the NFC championship game, DeVonta Smith quickly got his team to the line of scrimmage and snapped the ball after a questionable catch on the Eagles’ first drive of their victory over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIt did not work against the Chiefs in the Super Bowl.\n\nA replay review late in the second quarter showed Smith did not maintain control of the ball after a catch to the Kansas City 13, and it was ruled incomplete. The Eagles tried to snap the ball right away, but since there were less than two minutes in the first half, the officials in the booth called down to the field for a review.\n\nAfter the over turn, A.J. Brown, had a 22-yard catch-and-run that put Philadelphia in field goal range. Jake Elliott connected from 35 yards out as time expired in the first half, with the Eagles taking a 24-14 advantage into the locker room.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nPatrick Mahomes limps off after appearing to re-injure ankle\n\nWell, Patrick Mahomes’ injured right ankle was looking good until it wasn’t.\n\nMahomes, who was suffered a high-ankle sprain against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the divisional playoff game, scrambled on third down shortly before halftime, and his injured right foot took the brunt of the fall after he was tackled by Eagles linebacker T.J. Edwards with 1:44 left in the second quarter.\n\nMahomes limped off the field in obvious pain and was later shown in difficulty while his ankle was being evaluated by trainers on the sidelines.\n\nEarlier in the game, Mahomes appeared to run with ease like his foot was healed after a high-ankle sprain suffered last month.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles back in front on another Jalen Hurts touchdown run\n\nThe Eagles entered the Super Bowl with 35 fourth-down attempts. The 36th and 37th were the most important of the season thus far.\n\nOn fourth-and-5 from the Kansas City 44, Hurts ran to daylight and converted the first fourth down of the drive with a 28-yard carry down the right sideline. Facing a fourth-and 2, the Eagles got Kansas City to jump inside the red zone to set up a first-and-goal and Hurts scored his second rushing touchdown of the game on the next play to make it 21-14 with just over two minutes left in the second quarter.\n\nThe drive was 12 plays and took 7:19 off the clock. The Eagles are dominating time of possession. They have had the ball for 20:32, while Mahomes and Kansas City have had it for 7:08.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs erase deficit with defensive touchdown after Eagles miscue\n\nThe Eagles had a seven-point lead and were in Chiefs territory once again.\n\nInstead of putting Kansas City back on its heels, they let them back in the game.\n\nFacing a thrd-and-1 from the Chiefs’ 47, right guard Isaac Seumalo jumped early and moved the Eagles back five yards. On the next play, Hurts began to run on a quarterback keeper, but he dropped the ball and Nick Bolton – the Chiefs’ leading tackler – scooped it up and scored on a 36-yard return that tied the game.\n\nIt was the first fumble Hurts lost since Week 10 against Indianapolis and the team's first turnover of the playoffs.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nA.J. Brown puts Eagles ahead with long touchdown catch\n\nThe ability to hit the big play has been a hallmark for the Eagles offense all season.\n\nIn the Super Bowl, Brown made it.\n\nOn the first play of the second quarter, Hurts had all day in the pocket to watch Brown streak down the field and into double-coverage. Hurts threw to a place anybody who could catch the ball would have to make an adjustment.\n\nJuan Thornhill and McDuffie in coverage weren’t able. Brown did, and the Eagles regain the lead 14-7d on the 45-yard completion.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs fail to take lead as Harrison Butker field goal goes 'doink'\n\nThe Chiefs moved the ball well, but settled for a field-goal attempt when facing a fourth-and-3 at the end of their second drive. Butker’s 42-yard kick drifted left and was no good after hitting the upright, keeping the score tied at 7.\n\nThe possession by the Chiefs drive featured a stellar 22-yard pass from Mahomes to Kelce, and even some trickery from Kansas City. Kelce and receiver Juju Smith-Schuster signaled to the Chiefs sidelines like they did not know a play call, then turned around after Mahomes found running back Jerick McKinnon for a 7-yard completion on the right side.\n\nMahomes nearly threw an interception on the next play, and the Chiefs’ field-goal kick miss could come back to haunt them later this game.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles RB Miles Sanders sidelined after hit on game's first play\n\nOn the first play of the game, Sanders carried for a one-yard loss. Chiefs cornerback Trent McDuffie tracked him down near the sideline and delivered a large hit, knocking the ball out of bounds.\n\nSanders, a fourth-year player from Penn State, was seen shaking his hand after the play and went into the locker room before returning to the field. Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell handled the ball-carrying duting in his absence. Sanders returned to the field in the second quarter.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs respond quickly to tie game against Eagles\n\nThe Chiefs did not waste any time responding to the Eagles’ first score.\n\nChiefs star quarterback Patrick Mahomes found who else than his favorite target, tight end Travis Kelce, for a 18-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7 with 6:57 left in the first quarter.\n\nMahomes’ first pass of the game was a 20-yard completion to Kelce. More important: Mahomes’ ankle looks great, too, after he galloped for an 8-yard run during the drive.\n\nThe Chiefs got near the red zone with a 24-yard run to the left side by running back Isaiah Pacheco.\n\nKelce also celebrated his touchdown with a dance in the end zone.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nEagles jump out to early Super Bowl lead on Jalen Hurts touchdown run\n\nThat was quick.\n\nThe Eagles received the opening kickoff and drove 75 yards in 11 plays for a touchdown on the game’s first possession. Jalen Hurts found receiver DeVonta Smith on a key third down and later hit him for 23 yards to move Philadelphia into the red zone on a run-pass option that was initially snuffed out.\n\nKenneth Gainwell initially had the score, but replay review quickly confirmed his elbow was down short of the goal line. The call was Hurts’ specialty: a quarterback sneak. Behind the Eagles’ elite offensive line, Hurts plowed ahead for six points. Extra point was good and it's Philadelphia 7-0 early.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs win Super Bowl coin toss, Eagles get ball first\n\nIf you bet on the Chiefs to win the Super Bowl coin toss, congratulations.\n\nThe Chiefs called tails. And the Chiefs won the toss. They chose to defer and will kickoff to the Eagles start the game, and then get the ball to start the second half.\n\nTails breaks a two-game streak by heads, and has been the coin toss winner in seven of the last 10 Super Bowls, according to Oddsshark.com.\n\nAt +100, one would have doubled their money picking the Chiefs to win the coin toss.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nChris Stapleton, Sheryl Lee Ralph shine with Super Bowl national anthems\n\nWith nearly as much attention paid to the music as the game during the Super Bowl, the trifecta of artists who took the field Sunday prior to kickoff knew the importance of their platform.\n\nChris Stapleton, Sheryl Lee Ralph and Babyface were tapped for the honors. Ralph singer infused the Black national anthem - \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" - with the type of gusto exhibited during her Emmy acceptance speech last fall.\n\nBabyface followed with \"America the Beautiful\" and the festivities were capped by Stapleton's rendition of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" that showcased his vocal skills.\n\nRIGHT NOTE:Reviewing the pregame Super Bowl singing performances\n\n- Mellissa Ruggieri\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni, center Jason Kelce both cry during Super Bowl national anthem\n\nAs Chris Stapleton performed the national anthem before the kick of the Super Bowl, cameras found Sirianni and Kelce, both of whom had tears in their eyes.\n\nKelce spoke about tears on the big stage after the Eagles’ Super Bowl 52 victory, saying he would find himself crying in the shower in the lead-up to that game against the New England Patriots.\n\n- Chris Bumbaca\n\nDamar Hamlin introduced on field at Super Bowl 57, speaks to Fox's Michael Strahan\n\nThe NFL continues to celebrate the remarkable recovery by Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin from cardiac arrest he suffered in a Jan. 2 game.\n\nHamlin received a warm ovation from the crowd at State Farm Stadium.\n\nEarlier, on Fox's pregame show, Hamlin spoke with Michael Strahan about what he remembered when he made that fateful tackle on Bengals WR Tee Higgins.\n\nHamlin paused for nearly nine seconds.\n\n\"That's something I don't really want to get too deep into, in the detail,\" Hamlin said. \"That's something I'm still trying to work through. Why did it happen to me?\"\n\nThe full interview will air Monday morning on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nEagles fans boo Cowboys QB Dak Prescott pregame\n\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott received a rousing ovation after being recognized as the Walter Payton Man of the Year for his philanthropy and community impact.\n\nBut not the ovation you’d think one would receive for winning one of the NFL’s highest honors.\n\nEagles fans at the Super Bowl booed Prescott, because division rivalries don’t cease even for special awards.\n\nPrescott was a good sport about the reaction he received.\n\n- Safid Deen\n\nWith injured ankle, Patrick Mahomes goes for Super Bowl win No. 2\n\nThis is the third Super Bowl start for the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback. Mahomes split his previous two appearances, beating the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl 54 before losing the championship game the following season against Tom Brady and the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nMahomes’ recovery from a right high-ankle sprain in the divisional playoff and his dart to the sidelines that set up a game-winning field goal to help the Chiefs beat the Bengals in the AFC championship game on Jan. 29 only added to his growing legacy.\n\nMahomes also has a chance to further separate himself from the rest of the current pack of active quarterbacks. With Brady’s retirement, Mahomes could have more rings than any other with his second championship.\n\n— Safid Deen\n\nThree keys to victory in Super Bowl 57\n\nThe pregame hype is finally dying down and the focus of Super Bowl 57 is ready to be turned to the gridiron where it belongs.\n\nBoth the Chiefs and Eagles have been the class of their respective leagues this season, so the most important thing for either team may only be the ability to execute what they already do well.\n\nHere are three keys to winning, according to USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon:\n\nEagles pass rush vs. Chiefs offensive line\n\nChiefs aerial attack vs. Eagles pass defense\n\nEagles rushing offense vs. Chiefs defense\n\nSuper Bowl X-factors: Unknown to hero?\n\nThe Super Bowl is where a relative nobody can become a household name, a place where Malcolm Butler and David Tyree were transformed from obscurity to an association with football's biggest stage, forever.\n\nThe stars will attract the attention and have the most impact on Super Bowl 57. The X-factors, however – the ones the majority of the 100-plus-million viewers do not know – will also play pivotal roles in determining who lifts the Lombardi Trophy.\n\nHere are a few who could find themselves in the spotlight on Sunday, according to USA TODAY Sports' Chris Bumbaca:\n\nEagles DT Jason Hargrave\n\nEagles RB Kenneth Gainwell\n\nChiefs OT Andrew Wylie\n\nChiefs LB Nick Bolton\n\nHow do Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts stack up?\n\nThis margin isn't as wide as you might think. Jalen Hurts, 24, is a star who is going to be a problem in the NFC for a long time. He worked with Tom House this offseason and has refined his mechanics. His ability to compromise defenses with his rushing ability has made it increasingly difficult to defend Philadelphia. And, if the Chiefs use a spy to try to limit what Hurts can do out in open space, it takes away a potential defender Kansas City can use in the secondary.\n\nAll that said, Patrick Mahomes is the most gifted passer in the NFL, possibly of all time. His arm makes it so that the Chiefs can score on any given play. And while he may not rack up rushing yards, his mobility — though it may be tested Sunday by a high ankle sprain — allows him to extend plays and find receivers who can break off their routes.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWhere Kansas City has a potential home run hitter in Isiah Pacheco, the Eagles carry significant depth in the backfield. Philadelphia’s top three running backs — Miles Sanders, Boston Scott and Kenneth Gainwell — are all capable of taking over a game. Just look at Gainwell’s production; he averaged just 3.1 rushes per game in the regular season. In the playoffs, that number has jumped to 13 per and he has responded by leading the Eagles in rushing in both the divisional and conference championship rounds. Sanders, meanwhile, has a nose for the end zone.\n\nPacheco is explosive both rushing the ball and catching it out of the backfield, but Kansas City often doesn’t give him enough touches to be a major factor. The team also activated Clyde Edwards-Helaire (ankle) off of injured reserve and he’d provide a huge boost if he’s able to play.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThis is perhaps the one position where a team has the strongest advantage over the other. A.J. Brown and Devonta Smith are both star playmakers whose different skill sets complement each other; Brown is physical and quick and can beat defenders with power and Smith is a silky route runner who is elusive in space.\n\nOn the other side, the Chiefs have navigated their first season without Tyreek Hill quite well, with Marquez Valdes-Scantling, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Kadarius Toney making plays. Still, no Kansas City wideout eclipsed 1,000 receiving yards in the regular season. Making matters worse for the Chiefs is that they are facing several nagging injuries at the position, with Mecole Hardman placed on injured reserve. Better put this way, Mahomes and the Chiefs system elevate Smith-Schuster, Valdes-Scantling and Toney, while Brown and Smith are stars who would flourish anywhere.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nDallas Goedert has been a solid and steady option for Hurts. But in 14 games this season, including the playoffs, he reached the 100-yard mark only once.\n\nTravis Kelce isn’t just in the conversation for the best tight end in football — he’s already there — he’s in the conversation for the best of all time. Kelce has secured four All-Pro nominations in the last seven seasons, he’s rewriting the record book and he has become Mahomes’ preferred target and a near-unguardable player in the middle of the field.\n\nGoedert does have a clear advantage over Kelce in run blocking; because Philadelphia sets its identity on the ground, Goedert has become a key piece in the scheme. Still, Kelce is generational.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nWho are the commentators on FOX NFL Sunday's Super Bowl pregame show?\n\nAs is the case during the regular season, Fox Sports has Curt Menefee hosting its NFL Sunday pregame show, which is being broadcast live at State Farm Stadium.\n\nProviding analysis and commentary are Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, Michael Strahan and Jimmy Johnson. Joining the set for the playoffs is retired NFL tight end-turned-kicker Rob Gronkowski.\n\nReporting from around the stadium: Erin Andrews, Tom Rinaldi, Charissa Thompson and Jay Glazer.\n\nStars from every industry are descending on State Farm Stadium to watch the Kansas City Chiefs take on the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIn the stadium early was NBA star LeBron James and his wife, Savannah.\n\nEagles superfan Bradley Cooper was also in attendance ready to cheer his team to victory.\n\nRap mogul Jay Z was spotted on the sidelines taking pictures of his daughter Blue Ivy.\n\nJuJu Smith-Schuster, Travis Kelce, Fletcher Cox make fashion statements as kickoff approaches\n\nEveryone knows what the players will be wearing when Super Bowl 57 kicks off. The Chiefs will be wearing white uniforms with red pants, red numerals and yellow trim. The Eagles will be wearing green uniforms with either green or white pants.\n\nHowever, pregame fashions can be any style and color under the rainbow, as evidenced by Chiefs WR JuJu Smith-Schuster.\n\nNot to be outdone, Chiefs TE Travis Kelce.\n\nAnd then there's Eagles DT Fletcher Cox.\n\nThis is another fascinating battle, as these are two of the top units in the NFL. The Eagles, however, have the best O-line in football. Their communication and ability to work together are unrivaled. They have two of the best players at their positions, center Jason Kelce and right tackle Lane Johnson (both of whom were first-team All-Pro selections). They bore open holes in Nick Sirianni’s zone read offense and are disciplined and clean in avoiding penalties.\n\nBut where Philadelphia has two All-Pros on its offensive line, the Chiefs have a pair of second-teamers in center Creed Humphrey and left guard Joe Thuney. Orlando Brown has been excellent after moving to left tackle and, considering this is a unit that has been remade, it has done a remarkable job of keeping Mahomes clean.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Eagles are five sacks in the Super Bowl from breaking the record of the 1984 Bears for total sacks in the regular and postseason combined (82). Three of Philadelphia’s starting four defensive linemen, defensive tackle Javon Hargrave and defensive ends Josh Sweat and Brandon Graham notched double-digit sack totals in the regular season, as each posted 11. The other starter, defensive tackle Fletcher Cox, is one of the game’s best interior linemen and recorded seven. The unit has depth with end Robert Quinn and tackles Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh coming on in relief.\n\nTo be clear, the Chiefs aren’t bad, they’re just not this good. Chris Jones is a force and the best interior lineman in football and Frank Clark can disrupt the timing and rhythm of opposing offenses. Kansas City just doesn’t have the depth or wealth of star talent to match Philadelphia in this spot.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nIt’s almost unfair to consider Haason Reddick as a pure linebacker, since Philadelphia loves using him in five-man fronts, rushing off the left side of the line of scrimmage — or even at defensive tackle — so his presence is frankly more of a consideration for the defensive line. With that in mind, where this Eagles defense is weakest is at the other two linebacker spots. And, considering that linebackers and safeties are among the players asked to cover tight ends, this could be a spot where the Chiefs exploit Philadelphia, using Travis Kelce.\n\nThe Chiefs unit that included Nick Bolton and Willie Gay Jr. took some time to get settled this season, but it improved after Gay returned from suspension and as the group got healthier. They have speed and excellent range, though they are sometimes caught out of position, in part because of the relative inexperience of Bolton and Gay.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThis is another spot in which Eagles executive vice president and general manager Howie Roseman’s aggressive moves in recent seasons have paid off. The three best players on the unit — corners James Bradberry and Darius Slay and strong safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson — were all acquired via trade or free agency. Bradberry had bounced around the league but found a home in Philadelphia’s defense, earning a second-team All-Pro nod.\n\nFor the Chiefs, cornerback L’Jarius Sneed clearing concussion protocol is a welcome sight; he doesn’t shy away from contact and actually helps out quite a bit in stopping the run along the outside. Trent McDuffie is a player who has perhaps been overlooked, though he has had a huge impact as a press corner. Rounding out the starters, at safety, Justin Reid and Juan Thornhill have become capable players. The biggest issue with the Kansas City secondary is the occasional blown coverage that can lead to chunk plays.\n\nAdvantage: Eagles\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nAs far as kicking and punting goes, this becomes tricky because where the Eagles are strong with place kicker Jake Elliott, the Chiefs are stronger with punter Tommy Townsend, a first-team all-pro. Kansas City place kicker Harrison Butker had the worst season of his career, missing six field goals for a 75% conversion rate. Still, in his last three games, Butker has converted all field goals and extra points.\n\nThe Eagles may be without punter Arryn Siposs (ankle), who has said he is ready to play. He presents an upgrade, though backup Brett Kern has been solid in relief. Where the Chiefs separate themselves is with their return men. Both Isiah Pacheco and Skyy Moore are flashes of lightning who can slip through creases and flip field position.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nThe Chiefs have the wealth of experience and Andy Reid may be the best coach not named Belichick over the last three decades. Offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy should be a head coach. And defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo has kept Kansas City’s defense competitive and loves to disguise blitzes, making it difficult for young quarterbacks to read the field.\n\nThe narrative that the Eagles have had a favorable path to the Super Bowl, while accurate, shouldn’t discount the effort and work it takes to win week in and week out. Coach Nick Sirianni’s players swear by him and offensive coordinator Shane Steichen could end up as a head coach this cycle. The zone read offense the pair have assembled requires defenses to make decisions in split seconds. Defensive line coach Tracy Rocker brings decades of experience and coordinator Jonathan Gannon oversees a unit that has taken a huge stride since last season.\n\nAdvantage: Chiefs\n\n— Lorenzo Reyes\n\nChiefs unlikely to face 49ers catastrophe if Mahomes gets hurt\n\nThe NFC championship game was a cautionary tale to NFL teams, particularly those vying for a title, about the risks of having only two quarterbacks active on game day.\n\nHowever, if catastrophe befalls the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday in Super Bowl 57, they have a plethora of emergency quarterback options – so many, that it's not immediately clear who would take snaps if presumptive MVP Patrick Mahomes and his, backup, Chad Henne, were unable to go. Obviously, that would be a worst-case scenario. But at least the AFC champs might become so wildly unpredictable that it could keep them in a game – at least temporarily.\n\n— Nate Davis\n\nEx-Broncos coach helps Eagles prepare for Chiefs offense\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles reportedly brought in some veteran experience ahead of their Super Bowl 57 appearance against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAccording to reports, the Eagles hired Vic Fangio to assist with game preparations that include self-scouting and analysis. NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport reported Fangio signed a two-week contract that is expected to expire after the Super Bowl.\n\nFangio agreed to become the Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator last month.\n\n— Jaylon Thompson\n\nFathers of Super Bowl 57 QBs wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nDuring Super Bowl 57 you will see more than a game. You'll see two Black quarterbacks — raised lovingly by two Black dads (and also by their moms). You will also see one more thing: a stereotype busted.\n\nIf you're looking for the story — the often repeated one, the ever-lasting one, the stereotypical one — of the Black kid who grew up impoverished and still made it. If you're looking for the same ol' story about the Black kid without a father who overcame this and that and the other thing and golly gee, goodness gracious look at him now. Well, this Super Bowl quarterbacks story is not for you.\n\n— Mike Freeman\n\nSpecial game-day deliveries for 2 Chiefs players\n\nJust playing in the big game is already memorable enough, but two members of the Kansas City Chiefs will have even more reason to remember this Super Bowl Sunday.\n\nWhile he was busy preparing to face off against the Philadelphia Eagles, Chiefs guard Nick Allegretti learned his wife Christina went into labor and delivered healthy twin girls early Sunday morning in Chicago.\n\nAt about the same time the Allegretti girls were arriving, Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman was frantically tweeting that his girlfriend Chariah Gordon was also about ready to give birth.\n\nThere could also be another Super Bowl baby before long on the other sideline.\n\nEagles center Jason Kelce and his wife Kylie are also expecting a baby.\n\nAndy Reid could win second Super Bowl – against his former team\n\nReid, 64, is a no-nonsense coach who has become endearing, never too shy to be himself or make others laugh at his own expense. He proudly wears Hawaiian shirts and professes his love for a good cheeseburger. He’s also one of the most accomplished coaches.\n\nReid was the Eagles’ coach for 14 seasons (1999-2012) and did mostly everything for the franchise – six NFC East titles, five NFC title games, one Super Bowl appearance – except win it all.\n\nWhen he was fired by Philadelphia, Kansas City pounced at the opportunity to hire him, and it has been rewarded with 10 winning seasons, nine playoff berths and a Super Bowl during the 2019 season.\n\nReid has the respect and the résumé to match, and he has an opportunity to solidify his Hall of Fame career with a second Super Bowl title. To do it against his former team would be special, too.\n\nSUPER BOWL STORYLINES: Reid, Kelce brothers, Mahomes' ankle all worth watching\n\n— Safid Deen\n\nWho will perform at the Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nWhile the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles take a break from shining bright like a diamond, Rihanna will be the Super Bowl 57 halftime show performer.\n\nIt's a show that's so exciting, at least one player is hoping to catch a glimpse.\n\nThe nine-time Grammy award-winner will perform a slew of hits with (or maybe without) some surprise guests. This will be her first public performance since 2018 when she performed DJ Khaled's \"Wild Thoughts\" at the Grammys.\n\n– Victoria Hernandez\n\nWith 10 Super Bowl appearances, Tom Brady has made his mark on the game's history, setting a plethora of individual records.\n\nBrady, who made 10 Super Bowl appearances with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice – who appeared in four Super Bowls during his career with the San Francisco 49ers and Oakland Raiders – hold multiple standards in the NFL's annual championship showcase.\n\nFrom a team perspective, Brady's New England Patriots and Rice's San Francisco 49ers figure prominently.\n\nSUPER BOWL RECORDS: Will any legendary marks be surpassed in Super Bowl 57?\n\nSUPER BOWL HISTORY: All-time results, winners, MVPs, more\n\nSUPER BOWL HIGHLIGHTS: Nate Davis' 57 greatest moments in Super Bowl lore\n\nHow 'No crush, no rush' slogan has Philadelphia Eagles defense on historic sack pace\n\nThe four-word phrase coined by defensive ends and outside linebackers coach Jeremiah Washburn means the defense has to stop the run to earn the right to rush the quarterback. Entering Super Bowl 57, the defense has lived up to its motto.\n\n“If you don’t stop the run, you can’t pass rush nobody,” Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham said. “You got to take care of business. Early on, you got to send a message and let them know what the game is gonna be. You got to be the dictators. That’s any defense that wants to win a game, you got to let them know what it’s gonna be for the day.”\n\nThe Eagles had the NFL’s second ranked defense in the regular season and the unit hasn’t given up more than seven points in each of its postseason wins leading up to Super Bowl 57. When it comes to rushing the quarterback, the Eagles are on an historic pace.\n\nThe Eagles defense has amassed 78 total sacks across the regular season and postseason, the third most in NFL history. Philadelphia is three sacks away from surpassing the 1985 Chicago Bears for the second most sacks ever and five sacks shy of eclipsing the 1984 Bears (82 sacks) for the NFL single-season record.\n\n— Tyler Dragon\n\nJoe Biden's pregame Super Bowl interview with Fox called off\n\nPresident Joe Biden won’t be giving a pregame Super Bowl interview to Fox Soul after all.\n\nPresidents in recent years have granted wide-ranging interviews to the network hosting the Super Bowl. But last week there was confusion over whether Biden would follow the tradition.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted Friday that Biden had been looking forward to an interview on Fox Soul, a streaming sister service to the conservative Fox News. But she said the White House had been informed that the network’s parent company, Fox Corp., canceled the interview.\n\nBiden did pregame interviews with CBS in 2021 and with NBC in 2022.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n'Superhero?' What other Chiefs say about QB Patrick Mahomes\n\nPatrick Mahomes exploded into an NFL superstar almost from the moment when he became the Kansas City Chiefs' starting quarterback in 2018, the year he also won his first MVP trophy.\n\nBut what we all see is not necessarily what Mahomes' teammates see.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports closely monitored and asked Chiefs players and coaches during the days leading up to the big game about what it's like being around their intrepid leader, and some common themes quickly emerged.\n\n— Nate Davis\n\nEagles' success starts at the top\n\nTo compare the team-building philosophies of the Philadelphia Eagles and last year's Super Bowl champion Los Angeles Rams, and classify them as similar would be to miss the point.\n\nThere is a difference between mortgaging the future and having a foundation for continued success in place. The Rams, quite literally, employed a “(expletive) them picks” strategy. The Eagles have a pair of first-round picks in the 2023 draft and Jalen Hurts, an MVP-level quarterback on a rookie (second-round selection) contract.\n\nLeadership starts at the top. Knowing the right time to push the chips toward the middle is essential to winning it all, and Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie has given general manager Howie Roseman, who has been with the organization since 2000, the latitude – and payroll – to be aggressive.\n\nIn Super Bowl 57 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Roseman's fingerprints will be all over the field.\n\n– Chris Bumbaca\n\n'Special' Super Bowl for Black quarterbacks\n\nWhen Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts take the field Feb. 12, they will be the first two Black quarterbacks to start against each other in the Super Bowl. It’s an accomplishment both quarterbacks fully embrace.\n\n“It is history. It’s come a long way. I think there has only been (eight) African American quarterbacks to play in a Super Bowl. To be the first for something is pretty cool. I know it’ll be a good one,” Hurts, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, told reporters Thursday. “It’s history.”\n\nThere will be eight Black quarterbacks to start in a Super Bowl once the championship game kicks off: Doug Williams, Steve McNair, Donovan McNabb, Colin Kaepernick, Russell Wilson, Cam Newton, Mahomes and Hurts.\n\n– Tyler Dragon\n\nTHE 100-YEAR LONG ROAD: Fritz Pollard paved the way for Hurts, Mahomes\n\nOPINION: Fathers of Super Bowl 57 quarterbacks wreck stereotype of absent Black dad\n\nReport: Colts target Eagles offensive coordinator as next head coach\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts have reached a decision on who they want as their next head coach – but the process will have to wait until Super Bowl 57 concludes.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen is the Colts' top choice, and, according to ESPN, the team has already begun informing the other candidates that they are no longer being considered.\n\nSteichen, 37, has run the Eagles offense for the past two seasons. On the way to reaching the Super Bowl, Philadelphia ranked first in rushing yards and third in points per game in 2022. That would seem to mesh well with the Colts, whose offense revolves around 2021 NFL rushing champion Jonathan Taylor.\n\nIn addition, the Arizona Cardinals plan to interview Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon for their head coaching vacancy, according to NFL.com.\n\nEx-Eagles, Chiefs coach Dick Vermeil can't pick a favorite\n\nDick Vermeil led the Philadelphia Eagles to the franchise’s first Super Bowl appearance. He also finished his Hall of Fame career coaching the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nSo, in what direction is Vermeil’s allegiance flowing for Super Bowl 57?\n\n“I’ve put in my frame of mind right now, philosophically, I’m going to root for both teams to win,” Vermeil told USA TODAY Sports. “And I’ll feel very bad for the team that loses.”\n\nThe only person other than Andy Reid to have coached both the Eagles and the Chiefs, Vermeil, 86, won’t even be inside State Farm Stadium on Sunday.\n\n– Jarrett Bell\n\nSUPER BOWL RECORDS: Will any of these marks be broken in Super Bowl 57?\n\nJason or Travis? Donna Kelce has a plan for which son she'll visit first after Super Bowl 57\n\nDonna Kelce, the mother of Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, has a game plan for after Super Bowl 57.\n\nShe is going to visit the winner first.\n\nBut Donna Kelce told USA TODAY Sports that it's not about favoritism. It's logistics.\n\n\"In the Super Bowl, you only have a chance to see the winner,\" Kelce said at Super Bowl 57 Radio Row at the Phoenix Convention Center. \"The losers are immediately sent to their hotel, like go to your room.\"\n\n— Cydney Henderson\n\nSIBLING RIVALRY: Kelce brothers embrace 'enjoyable chaos'\n\nSuper Bowl expert picks\n\nComing off a pair of dominant postseason wins, the Eagles enter the game as slight favorites. However, the Chiefs seem to have more big game experience as they prepare for their third Super Bowl in the past four seasons, led by presumptive league MVP and Super Bowl 54 MVP Patrick Mahomes.\n\nOur writers offer up their predictions and how they see the game unfolding:\n\nJarrett Bell: Chiefs\n\nChiefs Chris Bumbaca: Chiefs\n\nChiefs Nate Davis: Chiefs\n\nChiefs Safid Deen: Chiefs\n\nChiefs Tyler Dragon: Chiefs\n\nChiefs Lorenzo Reyes: Eagles\n\nHere are USA TODAY Sports' expert picks for Super Bowl 57 MVP:\n\nJarrett Bell: Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes\n\nChiefs QB Patrick Mahomes Chris Bumbaca: Chiefs RB Jerick McKinnon\n\nChiefs RB Jerick McKinnon Nate Davis: Mahomes\n\nMahomes Safid Deen: Mahomes\n\nMahomes Tyler Dragon: Mahomes\n\nMahomes Lorenzo Reyes: Eagles QB Jalen Hurts\n\nWho is announcing Super Bowl 57?\n\nFOX's Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen will be the broadcasters for Super Bowl 57.\n\nRead more on how these two guys from Jersey became NFL broadcast stars.\n\nWho are the Super Bowl officials?\n\nCarl Cheffers will be the referee for Super Bowl 57. This is his third Super Bowl. He will be joined by umpire Roy Ellison, down judge Jerod Phillips, line judge Jeff Bergman, field judge John Jenkins, side judge Eugene Hall, back judge Dino Paganelli and replay official Mark Butterworth.\n\n— Jim Sergent\n\nAs Eagles' Nick Sirianni reaches Super Bowl, his brothers find success on parallel paths\n\nOver the past 20 years, Mike Sirianni has quietly become one of the top coaches in college football. He's never had a losing season. Never lost back-to-back regular-season games. His win percentage (.807) ranks sixth among active head coaches with tenures of at least 100 games, ahead of Dabo Swinney (.805) and Nick Saban (.801).\n\n\"People are like, 'You have the (sixth)-highest win percentage in college football right now,' \" he said. \"And I’m like, 'Yeah, but I’m the third-best coach in my own family.' \"\n\nThat would be behind middle brother Jay, who coached their high school alma mater to three New York state title games, winning two.\n\nAnd behind youngest brother, Nick, who will of course make his Super Bowl debut when the Philadelphia Eagles face the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.\n\n\"In my opinion, until Nick wins a Super Bowl, Jay’s got two state championships,\" Mike said. \"So to me, I’m still voting him No. 1.\"\n\n— Tom Schad\n\nGannett may earn revenue from Tipico for audience referrals to betting services.

Hurts and D’Andre Swift scored all three of the Eagles’ touchdowns on the ground. Philadelphia was down 17-7 at halftime and the Chiefs failed to score after the break.\n\n“In this league, it’s all about finding a way to win, whether it’s ugly in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, how are you gonna find a way in the end,” Hurts told ESPN’s Laura Rutledge after the game. \"That’s one thing about this team tonight is we had resilience, we persevered, regardless of what happened early on, we found a way to win in the end and that’s what matters.”\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nLate in the fourth quarter, Patrick Mahomes faced fourth-and-25 after Marquez Valdes-Scantling dropped a pass en route to the end zone. Justin Watson dropped the deep ball on the fourth-down conversion attempt as he was covered by three Eagles defenders. The Chiefs offense has dropped a league-high 26 catches this season, according to the ESPN broadcast.\n\nThis is the first time Eagles center Jason Kelce defeated his brother, Travis Kelce. The Chiefs tight end had seven receptions for 44 yards and a touchdown. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nNFL PLAYOFF PICTURE: Chiefs losing grip on AFC's top seed\n\nWinners and losers from Eagles' win over Chiefs\n\nWINNERS\n\nDeVonta Smith comes up big: Smith provided the big plays for Philadelphia on Monday night. The wideout caught a 41-yard deep pass from Jalen Hurts that setup the game-winning touchdown midway throw the fourth quarter.\n\nSmith’s speed and route running caused problems from Kansas City’s secondary. He finished with a game-high six catches and 99 yards. His 41-yard reception was the longest play of the night.\n\nTush Push, a.k.a. the Brotherly Shove: The Eagles ran the glorified quarterback sneak on three occasions and were successful each time, including on a 1-yard Jalen Hurts touchdown in the fourth quarter that turned out to be the game-winning score.\n\nEagles defense pitches shutout in second half: The Eagles erased a 10-point deficit at halftime, in large part due to their defense. Philly produced a shutout in the second half.\n\nPhiladelphia’s defense only allowed one drive of more than 50 yards in the second half and that Chiefs possession ended when Eagles CB Bradley Roby stripped the football loose from Travis Kelce for a takeaway.\n\nThe Eagles defense forced two turnovers, one in each half.\n\nPhilly’s red zone offense: The Eagles scored on all three of their red zone trips. All three of Philadelphia’s touchdowns came on the ground. Hurts had two rushing touchdowns. He now has nine rushing TDs this season to lead all QBs.\n\nBaltimore Ravens on top of AFC: Kansas City’s loss (7-3) gave the Ravens (8-3) sole possession of the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoff standings.\n\nLOSERS\n\nChiefs' pass offense: The Chiefs dropped a season-high five passes, including three on the final drive.\n\nMarquez Valdes-Scantling dropped a deep pass from Mahomes that might’ve resulted in the go-ahead touchdown with under two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Two plays later, Justin Watson had the football go right through his hands on fourth-and-25.\n\nThe Chiefs' pass offense still continues to be too reliant on Mahomes and Travis Kelce. Kelce was contained to seven catches, 44 yards and a touchdown, but even the star tight end had a dropped pass.\n\nChiefs' second-half offense: The Chiefs offense ran out of gas again after halftime.\n\nKansas City had to punt four times in the second half, plus they lost a fumble and turned the ball over on downs to end the game.\n\nThe Chiefs haven’t scored in the second half in three straight games. Their last second half score was Oct. 22 against the Chargers. — Tyler Dragon\n\nEagles vs. Chiefs highlights\n\nJalen Hurts ran for a pair of touchdowns, including a go-ahead \"Brotherly Shove\" score in the fourth quarter, and the Eagles rallied from a 10-point halftime deficit to defeat the Chiefs in a Super Bowl rematch.\n\nThe Swift effect\n\nTaylor Swift's absence from Chiefs games continues to feed a noteworthy, if not causative, statistical split. Kansas City dropped to 3-3 in games the pop star didn't attend this season, averaging 18.5 points in those contests — a full 10 points fewer than when she's present. Tight end Travis Kelce has averaged 8.5 receptions and 108 yards when she's watching him in person. Those numbers drop to six and 41.8, respectively, otherwise. — Nate Davis\n\nMarquez Valdes-Scantling drop costs Chiefs dearly\n\nMarquez Valdes-Scantling had the game in his hands.\n\nAnd then it was on the ground next to him.\n\nThe Chiefs receiver had sped past the Eagles’ secondary and was on the other side of a perfectly timed and thrown Patrick Mahomes missile. Valdes-Scantling would have caught the game-winning 51-yard touchdown had he secured the ball as he dove and fell to the ground.\n\nThe Chiefs started deep in their own territory but advanced the ball to midfield thanks to a roughing the passer penalty drawn by Mahomes on a questionable flag.\n\nDrops have plagued the Chiefs all night. Receiver Justin Watson had a fourth-and-25 attempt to save the game that hit him in his hands and had an earlier miss. Travis Kelce dropped multiple passes too\n\nThe slippery circumstances thanks to the rain falling all game certainly did pass catchers no favors for either team. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles 21, Chiefs 17: Philly takes lead on 'Brotherly Shove'\n\nD’Andre Swift and Devonta Smith revived the Eagles’ offense.\n\nFollowing the Chiefs’ punt that wandered into the end zone, Swift took a short pass 20 yards on the second play of the drive.\n\nThree plays later, facing a third-and-5, Jalen Hurts connected with Smith for a first down and a 13-yard gain. Then came the big play.\n\nSwift ran a go route down the right sideline and Hurts dropped the ball right in the breadbasket. The receiver was down at 1-yard line, so the Eagles got in their customary “tush push” formation and shoved Hurts over the goal line for a 1-yard touchdown.\n\nPhiladelphia led 21-17 with 6:20 to go. Philadelphia went 80 yards in two minutes, 36 seconds. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nPatrick Mahomes throws 17-yard dime to Justin Watson\n\nPatrick Mahomes perhaps threw his best pass of the night in the fourth quarter.\n\nOn third-and-9, Mahomes threw a 17-yard dime to wide receiver Justin Watson for a first down. The pass dropped perfectly in Watson’s hands in tight coverage.\n\nUnfortunately for the Chiefs, the drive stalled a few plays later and they were forced to punt the ball away on Philadelphia’s 39-yard line. — Tyler Dragon\n\nTravis Kelce fumbles\n\nHopefully Taylor can fast-forward through that part of the highlights.\n\nThe Chiefs were on their way to securing some breathing room and had converted a fourth-and-1 the play prior when Kelce caught a 5-yard pass. Eagles safety Bradley Roby punched the football out and Nicholas Morrow recovered it.\n\nKansas City had gone 54 yards over 12 plays before the turnover, and still led 17-14 with the Eagles taking over at their own 10-yard line. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nEagles, Chiefs locked in close game heading into final quarter\n\nThe Eagles have inched closer to the Chiefs in the third quarter and are down 17-14 at the end of the period.\n\nKansas City has not scored after the break, but have added 41 rushing yards against a defense who usually allows 66 yards on the ground per game.\n\nJalen Hurts had the Eagles’ touchdown in the third quarter, a 10-yard rush on a drive that was boosted by a tush push and a 35-yard run from D’Andre Swift, who has 78 yards on the night.\n\nIn the Super Bowl, the Chiefs were down 27-21 at the end of the third quarter and scored 17 fourth quarter points to take the victory. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nChiefs 17, Eagles 14: Jalen Hurts gives Eagles a boost with rushing TD\n\nJalen Hurts breathed new life into the Eagles with a 10-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter. According to the ESPN broadcast, the score is Hurts’ 34th career rushing touchdown, the most in the NFL since his first start in 2020.\n\nThe drive was helped by a 35-yard run from D’Andre Swift and a tush push.\n\nThe Eagles had punted on their last four drives and are now within a field goal as the Chiefs lead 17-14. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nEagles opt out of tush push?\n\nThe conditions for a tush push couldn’t have been better. In the heavy rain, facing a third-and-1 from their own side of the field and needing their first first down in three drives, the Eagles could have deployed their virtually unstoppable short-yardage play.\n\nInstead, Jalen Hurts lined up in shotgun for a handoff to D’Andre Swift, who was dropped by Chiefs linebacker Willie Gay for a 3-yard loss. The Eagles punted for the third straight drive.\n\nThe Eagles effectively used the maneuver on their next drive to convert a first down. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs defense setting the tone\n\nKANSAS CITY — Defense wins championships. And maybe Super Bowl rematches, too.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs defense seized the big stage during the first half of the Monday night showdown, leading the way to a 17-7 halftime edge.\n\nThe Chiefs, which entered Week 11 allowing an NFL-low 143 points (15.9 per game), made life so miserable for Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts & Co.\n\nHurts passed for just 46 yards, with an interception and was sacked five times — twice apiece by Chris Jones and Trent McDuffie — and managed a mediocre 49.4 passer rating. The Eagles totaled just 78 net yards in the first two quarters (KC logged 190) and didn't convert a single third down (0 for 3).\n\nAll in all, the foundation was set for a signature performance by coordinator Steve Spagnuolo's vastly improved unit. — Jarrett Bell\n\nChiefs 17, Eagles 7: Kansas City takes 10-point lead into halftime\n\nIt’s been a rainy Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium, but it hasn’t exactly been showering touchdowns.\n\nAt Super Bowl 57, the Chiefs and Eagles went into the locker room at halftime with 38 points between the two of them.\n\nBut in the rematch, they’ve scored 24 points with the Chiefs up 17-7.\n\nHarrison Butker made a 43-yard field goal to end the half and put the Chiefs up. The Chiefs regained possession with 3:49 left in the second quarter when Jalen Hurts was tackled in a near strip-sack by Trent McDuffie, his second sack of the night. Hurts fell on the ball, but Philadelphia soon faced fourth-and-15 and punted the ball away.\n\nThe Chiefs are seeing productivity from their run game with 121 rushing yards between four players against one of the stiffer run defenses in the league. Patrick Mahomes has thrown two touchdowns, one to Justin Watson and another to Travis Kelce. The star tight end didn’t get a catch until midway through the second quarter.\n\nThe Eagles, meanwhile, are moving along a bit slower on offense as Jalen Hurts’ knee seems to be less than one hundred percent. He’s only thrown for 46 yards and ran for 6 and has been sacked five times. D’Andre Swift has eight carries for 47 yards and Philadelphia’s lone score.\n\nThe teams traded interceptions in the second quarter and each had major sacks in the first two drives, which forced each offense to go three-and-out. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nChiefs have advantage early on the ground\n\nThe Eagles came into Week 11 with the top run defense in the NFL, allowing 66 yards per game. Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco has 66 rushing yards in the first half. Kansas City’s produced 121 yards on the ground already. — Tyler Dragon\n\nChiefs 14, Eagles 7: Travis Kelce gives Kansas City the lead\n\nThe Chiefs took advantage after a 21-yard punt return by Kadarius Toney.\n\nStarting with the football on Philadelphia’s 45-yard line, Kansas City drove down the field in seven plays. On Kansas City’s seventh play, Patrick Mahomes threw a short pass to Travis Kelce for a 4-yard touchdown to give them a 14-7 lead. Kansas City’s drive included five runs and two pass attempts.\n\nKelce had been quiet for most of the first half until the touchdown. The Chiefs' standout tight end has two catches, 11 yards and a touchdown late in the second quarter.\n\nThe Chiefs have produced 121 total rushing yards. — Tyler Dragon\n\nIs Jalen Hurts wearing a knee brace for 'Monday Night Football'?\n\nEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts is wearing a protective sleeve over his left knee for the game against the Chiefs.\n\nSideline reporter Laura Rutledge said that Hurts did not wear the knee brace during practice leading up to the Monday night matchup, but that the quarterback wore it during the game for “extra protection and precaution.”\n\nThe quarterback was injured earlier this season and wore a knee brace in the second half of the Week 7 win over the Miami Dolphins. He hasn't missed any time, but was visibly struggling in a Week 9 win over the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nPhiladelphia had their bye last week, which helped Hurts heal and allowed him to practice without a brace.\n\n“I think time is a sign of progress,” Hurts said, per NBC Sports Philadelphia. “... The bye week came at a great time. We all took advantage of that or tried to take advantage of that time off. Everything is trending forward.” — Victoria Hernandez\n\nChiefs, Eagles trade interceptions\n\nFirst they traded scores. Now they’re trading interceptions.\n\nKansas City had a chance to take the lead again and were driving in the red zone. On a first-and-10 play from the Philadelphia 14-yard line, Mahomes dropped back and underthrew the ball for an interception in the end zone to Eagles safety Kevin Byard.\n\nByard was the Eagles’ marquee acquisition ahead of this season’s trade deadline, as general manager Howie Roseman traded with Tennessee to bring in the two-time first-team All-Pro. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nTravis Kelce catch-less early\n\nKANSAS CITY — It has become rather fashionable during Kansas City Chiefs games for fans to ask: Where's Taylor Swift?\n\nA better question during the early stages of the Monday night showdown: Where's Travis?\n\nStar tight end Travis Kelce didn't post a catch — and wasn't even targeted — on any of Kansas City's first three possessions, which included the first series of the second quarter. This, after Kelce was targeted on just 16.9% of the routes during KC's game in Germany against Miami in Week 9.\n\nInterestingly, Philadelphia's biggest receiving threat, A.J. Brown, also didn't see a pass come his way during the first quarter. Brown didn't post his first reception until Philadelphia's first snap of the second quarter, an 8-yard grab with 13:57 on the clock. Brown was also targeted on the pass from Jalen Hurts early in the second quarter that was intercepted by L'Jarius Sneed for the game's first turnover. — Jarrett Bell\n\nChiefs defense forces turnover\n\nJalen Hurts was picked off by L'Jarius Sneed on a pass intended for A.J. Brown on Kansas City’s 30-yard line.\n\nHurts had to throw the ball quickly because Kansas City sent a blitz. The pressure forced Hurts to underthrow Brown who had originally beat Sneed off the line of scrimmage.\n\nAfter the interception, Brown was shown on camera a little frustrated with the turnover.\n\nThe interception was the first turnover of the contest and Sneed’s second INT of the season.\n\nHurts has thrown nine interceptions this year. — Tyler Dragon\n\nChiefs, Eagles tied up after first quarter\n\nThe Chiefs and Eagles both went three-and-out to start the game. But the offenses got things going from there.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is 5-for-6 for 33 passing yards and had a jump-throw touchdown to Justin Watson. Isiah Pacheco and Kadarius Toney have combined for 46 rushing yards.\n\nA Swift not named Taylor has been making an impact for the Eagles as D’Andre Swift has seven carries for 31 yards and Philadelphia’s lone score, a 4-yard touchdown. Jalen Hurts has 31 passing yards, all to DeVonta Smith.\n\nThe Eagles and Chiefs are tied at 7 at the end of the first quarter. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nChiefs 7, Eagles 7: Philly evens things upafter D'Andre Swift TD\n\nIf there’s one thing the Chiefs and Eagles have made clear when they play each other, it’s that no team is going to build an insurmountable lead without the other having something to say about it.\n\nPhiladelphia evened the score at 7 on their ensuing drive after the Chiefs opened the game’s scoring. D’Andre Swift – no relation to Taylor – ran for 33 yards on the possession, including a 4-yard touchdown rush. He scampered for 17 yards on the play prior to set up the score. DeVonta Smith had two catches to help move the Eagles down the field and offensive coordinator Brian Johnson called a quarterback run for Jalen Hurts near midfield that went for a first down.\n\nPhiladelphia has been cautious in running Hurts on purpose as he deals with a knee injury that has clearly affected him. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nChiefs 7, Eagles 0: KC strikes first with Patrick Mahomes TD throw\n\nThe Chiefs offense went three-and-out on their first series, but they had better success on the second time around.\n\nIsiah Pacheco had a 24-yard run and Rashee Rice had a 14-yard catch and run to put Kansas City in the red zone. A few plays after Rice’s reception, Patrick Mahomes bought time in the pocket and then threw a jump pass to Justin Watson in the back of the end zone for a three-yard touchdown.\n\nWatson’s touchdown catch capped off a 10-play, 80-yard drive for Kansas City. — Tyler Dragon\n\nChiefs, Eagles both open with three-and-out drives\n\nNine months ago, both the Chiefs and Eagles scored touchdowns on their opening drives in Super Bowl 57.\n\nOn Monday, the rematch started with a much different tone as both teams went three-and-out in their first drives.\n\nThe Eagles defense made the first statement of the night when, on the second play from scrimmage, Haason Reddick sacked Patrick Mahomes for a 9-yard loss. Then, a short pass to Jerick McKinnon wasn't enough to move the chains.\n\nAfter the Chiefs punted, Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia offense didn’t fare any better on its first drive. On third-and-6 after two short runs from D'Andre Swift, Trent McDuffie sacked the Hurts and forced the Eagles to boot the ball away. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nWhat time is Chiefs vs. Eagles?\n\nDate: Monday, Nov. 20\n\nMonday, Nov. 20 Start time: 8:15 p.m. ET\n\nThe Chiefs and Eagles meet on Monday, Nov. 20 at 8:15 p.m. ET.

But the two brothers both reflected on moments from the past by wearing letterman jackets ahead of their “Monday Night Football” matchup.\n\nA man who is always on top of the trends, Travis showed up wearing a red letterman jacket representing the Dallas Texans, the American Football League team that became the Kansas City Chiefs in 1963. The tight end completed the look with a pair of classic tan Timberland boots.\n\nJason arrived at Arrowhead Stadium in his own signature style: sweatpants and flip-flops. Kelce’s letterman jacket also had significance as it’s from the brothers’ early days at Cleveland Heights High School. The back featured the school's fierce tiger mascot. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nChiefs vs. Eagles expert picks\n\nHere are the USA TODAY Sports’ staff picks for this game:\n\nLorenzo Reyes: Eagles\n\nTyler Dragon: Chiefs\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Eagles\n\nJarrett Bell: Chiefs\n\nSafid Deen: Chiefs\n\nNate Davis: Eagles\n\nChris Bumbaca: Chiefs\n\nMichael Middlehurst-Schwartz: Chiefs\n\nEagles vs. Chiefs: 'Monday Night Football' betting advice\n\nHighlighting Monday Night Football odds, the Chiefs are among the best bets for NFL Week 11 as home favorites.

Kansas City’s defense might be the most underrated in the league, but I like Philly to exact a little revenge here in this rematch of Super Bowl 57.\n\n— This will be fascinating.

Kansas City’s defense might be the most underrated in the league, but I like Philly to exact a little revenge here in this rematch of Super Bowl 57. Tyler Dragon: Chiefs 24, Eagles 23 — The main event is fittingly the final game of Week 11. This Super Bowl 57 rematch is easily the game of the week. Both teams had a Week 10 bye. The Eagles are the more complete team and can win in a variety of ways. But the Chiefs are at home, Patrick Mahomes is the best player on the field, the Chiefs have a top-five defense and at some point (you’d think) Kansas City’s wide receivers are going to step up.\n\n— The main event is fittingly the final game of Week 11.

Safid Deen: Chiefs 27, Eagles 23 — Still the two best teams in the NFL, it’s truly hard to decipher which team has the edge going into this Super Bowl rematch. The Eagles are on a roll on both sides of the football with the best record, while the Chiefs may have their best defense since Patrick Mahomes became their starter. To be the best, you have to beat the best. And I’m going to roll with the defending champs at home in this one. Mahomes will find a way to outplay Jalen Hurts in crunch time to secure the win.\n\n— Still the two best teams in the NFL, it’s truly hard to decipher which team has the edge going into this Super Bowl rematch.

Victoria Hernandez: Eagles 27, Chiefs 24 — Get your popcorn ready. In a rematch of last year’s Super Bowl, both teams will be fresh off their bye and Kansas City will have recovered from their jet lag — except for maybe Travis Kelce who took an extra international trip to support boo Taylor Swift. But even if the Eagles are still a bit banged up, they will get revenge against a Chiefs offense that’s struggled to find quite the same prowess this season.\n\n— Get your popcorn ready.

But even if the Eagles are still a bit banged up, they will get revenge against a Chiefs offense that’s struggled to find quite the same prowess this season. Jordan Mendoza: Chiefs 34, Eagles 30 — These two teams gave us one of the highest-scoring Super Bowls the last time they faced off. With both teams eager to prove themselves as the top Super Bowl favorite, expect the offenses to once again go crazy in the rematch. You could go either way, but the crowd at Arrowhead Stadium will make the difference in this one. Karma might be the guy on the Chiefs leading his team to a win.\n\nWhat's at stake on Monday night?\n\nThis game has more immediate playoff implications for the Chiefs (7-2), who would surrender the No. 1 overall spot in the AFC standings to the Baltimore Ravens (8-3) with a loss. Kansas City currently has the inside edge for home-field advantage and potentially hosting a sixth consecutive conference championship game.\n\nWin or lose, the Eagles (8-1) will retain the top spot in the NFC as their bid to secure the home field for the second straight season continues. A loss would tie Philadelphia with the Detroit Lions (8-2), but Detroit's inferior record in conference games would keep them in the No. 2 slot. Still, with the Bills, 49ers, hard-charging Cowboys and Seahawks set to follow on the schedule, Philly can hardly afford a stumble. — Nate Davis\n\nNinth-ever Super Bowl rematch\n\nTonight’s game will be the ninth rematch of a Super Bowl to occur in the subsequent season. The teams that won the Super Bowl are 6-2 in Round 2, including four victories in a row. Most recently, the New England Patriots defeated the Atlanta Falcons in the 2017 season following their historic overtime comeback from a 28-3 deficit in Super Bowl 51. In the past six rematches, six teams went on to advance to that season’s Super Bowl, including the 2017 Patriots … who lost to Jason Kelce’s Eagles. — Nate Davis\n\nEagles vs. Chiefs inactives: Dallas Goedert is out\n\nEagles tight end Dallas Goedert suffered a forearm injury during Philadelphia's win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 9, and will miss Monday night's Super Bowl 57 rematch. In his absence, the Eagles will count on a committee of tight ends to help make up for the loss of Goedert's production. Jack Stoll, Albert Okwuegbunam and Grant Calcaterra will be called on to fill Goedert's shoes. Recently signed wide receiver Julio Jones also could play a larger role in the Eagles offense.\n\nEagles' inactive players:\n\nQB Tanner McKee (third QB)\n\nRB Rashaad Penny\n\nDT Moro Ojomo\n\nOG Sua Opeta\n\nTE Dallas Goedert\n\nDE Derek Barnett\n\nChiefs' inactive players:\n\nWR Richie James\n\nDE BJ Thompson\n\nOL Mike Caliendo\n\nDT Neil Farrell\n\nDE Malik Herring\n\nKelce Bowl 4\n\nMonday night’s game will be Eagles center Jason Kelce’s fifth attempt to beat the Chiefs, the five-time All-Pro is currently 0-4 against the team coached by Andy Reid – the man who drafted Kelce in Philadelphia in 2011. Of course, Kelce also badly wants to beat his younger brother Travis, the reigning champs' star tight end. Travis Kelce has never known defeat against his big bro in the NFL but was inactive for the 2013 matchup, which occurred during his rookie season. — Nate Davis\n\nAndy Reid is winningest coach for each franchise\n\nReid is the only coach in NFL history to hold regular-season wins record for two teams (Eagles and Chiefs). Reid won 130 games in 14 seasons in Philadelphia. He’s currently won 124 games as the Chiefs head coach. — Tyler Dragon\n\nAnother Andy Reid record?\n\nWith a win Monday night, Andy Reid will break a tie with Hank Stram by winning his 125th regular-season game with the Kansas City Chiefs – which would be the most in franchise history. When postseason is factored in, Reid is the king of K.C. HCs, his overall record 136-54, including titles in 2019 and 2022. Of course, Reid is also the winningest coach in Eagles history, 140-102-1, including a loss in Super Bowl 39.\n\nReid’s 4-0 record against Philadelphia, including February’s 38-35 win in Super Bowl 57, has come be a collective score of 133-101. Reid is the only coach in NFL history to notch the most wins for two separate franchises and the lone one to win at least 100 games for multiple clubs. He’s also one of seven NFL coaches to take two organizations to Super Sunday. — Nate Davis\n\nFor Taylor Swift, these days, \"Karma\" is \"the guy on the (Kansas City) Chiefs.\"\n\nThat makes some Philadelphia Eagles fans wish for a dose of lower-case, not-the-song-title karma Monday night when the Chiefs host the Eagles in a rematch of Super Bowl 57. It’s also a test of the pop star’s allegiances – and people, especially Eagles fans, are paying attention. — Chris Bumbaca\n\nWhile everyone agrees it’s great that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are dating, both Chiefs and Eagles fans had mixed reactions regarding the hype around the relationship as they tailgated ahead of \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\nSwift was unable to attend the game on Monday because of a makeup show in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Kelce attended one of Swift's concerts in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this month. — Bryan West\n\nPatrick Mahomes, Jalen Hurts both franchise QBs and winners\n\nPatrick Mahomes has the highest quarterback winning percentage in the NFL since 1970 (for a quarterback with a minimum of 25 starts). The Chiefs' star quarterback has a 71-18 career record, resulting in a .798 winning percentage.\n\nJalen Hurts has the fifth highest winning percentage. The Eagles' star quarterback has a 31-12 career record. His winning percentage is .721.\n\nThe Chiefs (7-2) and Eagles (8-1) are both on top of their respective conferences. Superb quarterback play is a major reason why. — Tyler Dragon\n\nDo you like football 🏈?

Now, Reid will have the chance to avenge his dismissal from the Eagles with a Lombardi Trophy. To do so, he'll need another big game out of quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who will face off against Jalen Hurts of the Eagles. And Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and Eagles center Jason Kelce will become the first set of brothers to play against each other in Super Bowl history.\n\nHere are the winners and losers from conference championship Sunday.\n\nWINNERS\n\nThe most gifted passer of all time\n\nHe’s not yet the G.O.A.T. — he’ll need many more years in the league to compete with Tom Brady —but Patrick Mahomes has left no doubt that he is a magician with the ball in his hands and is the most talented passer we have ever seen.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nThrowing for 326 yards and two touchdowns eight days after sustaining a high ankle sprain is as tough a performance as we have seen in recent memory. That Mahomes fought through the pain and made some of his biggest plays while on the move speaks to the value his mobility brings. He earned his second all-pro berth and is the overwhelming favorite to win the MVP award. What’s absurd is that he’s only 27 and just getting started.\n\nPhilly found another playmaker\n\nYou know things are going well when your third-string running back blossoms into an impact player in the postseason. Eagles running back Kenneth Gainwell, a second-year pro, led Philadelphia in rushes (14) and rushing yards (48) and also added two catches for 26 yards.\n\nGainwell actually has 160 combined rushing yards in Philadelphia’s two playoff games and has showed he can be yet another playmaker on the Eagle offense.\n\nKansas City D-line feasted\n\nPatrick Mahomes will draw the buzz and coverage, but Kansas City’s defense deserves just as much love for pushing the Chiefs past Cincinnati. Kansas City’s defensive front set the tone, sacking Joe Burrow three times in the first quarter and five times in the game. In fact, those came on consecutive dropbacks and were why the Bengals were held to 0 net yards in the period.\n\nKansas City defensive tackle Chris Jones, whether he was feasting on backup right guard Max Scharping or whether he was moved outside on third downs and passing situations, impacted the game and disrupted the timing of Cincinnati’s offense. His sack of Burrow on third-and-8 with 44 seconds left in the game was the catalyst that got Kansas City the ball back for the game-winning field goal.\n\nBetter days ahead for San Francisco\n\nThough this is as dismaying a loss as a team can take, the 49ers should be set for plenty of future success in the years to come. This assumes that Trey Lance can return to full health and that coach Kyle Shanahan can develop him. But having a defense this talented, offensive weapons all over the field and a quarterback on a rookie contract, the Niners can afford to be aggressive in free agency to flesh out the roster.\n\nThe Niners will need to navigate the impending free agency of right tackle Mike McGlinchey and safety Tashaun Gipson among a handful of key contributors, but with young stars like two-time all-pro linebacker Fred Warner in place, the Niners should expect to be competing for NFC titles for years to come.\n\nSimilarly, Cincy will be back, too\n\nAlong the same lines, the Bengals have the luxury of two more years of Joe Burrow at below market value with the fourth and final season of his rookie contract, as well as his fifth-year option for 2024. Cincinnati will likely look to begin negotiating his contract well before Burrow is set to hit free agency, possibly at the end of next season. Cincinnati also has a similar situation with star receiver Ja’Marr Chase, whose fifth-year option comes in 2025.\n\nKansas City's training and medical team\n\nAs good as Mahomes was, the work the Kansas City training staff did behind closed doors needs to be lauded. Though the team won’t reveal details of exactly what it did to get Mahomes’ ankle ready, there undoubtedly were hours of treatment and rehab that helped mend the injury.\n\nNow, with the luxury of having a whole week off in the leadup to the game, the training staff will do everything it can to get Mahomes in even better shape.\n\nEagles roll on the ground\n\nWhile no individual Eagle rusher dominated, Philadelphia's collaborative effort showed just how dangerous the team can be when it gets its rushing attack rolling. Philadelphia rolled up 148 yards — with four different players recording at least 20 yards each — against a San Francisco defense that ranked second in the NFL in the regular season, having allowed just 77 rushing yards per game.\n\nThis all, of course, wouldn't be possible without Philadelphia's offensive line, the most complete unit in the NFL.\n\nLOSERS\n\nToo many 49ers flags\n\nThough it was an uneven day at the office for referee John Hussey and his crew, the 49ers lacked discipline and poise on key downs and committed far too many penalties. In a game when both quarterbacks who were dressed got injured, those unforced errors were devastating.\n\nSan Francisco had 11 penalties enforced for 81 yards. Seven of those penalties resulted in Eagles first downs. In fact, on the fifth Philadelphia drive, the one that gave it a 14-7 lead, the 49ers committed three defensive penalties that gifted the Eagles first downs and kept the drive alive. By comparison, the Eagles had only four penalties enforced for 34 yards.\n\nSan Francisco just can't catch a break\n\nCoach Kyle Shanahan tenure in San Francisco had been marked by luckless injuries at quarterback. This, however, was on another level. Already down to their third-string quarterback, the Niners saw Brock Purdy exit the game midway through the first quarter with a right elbow injury. That brought in journeyman back Josh Johnson, who … left the game shortly after with a concussion. Purdy was forced back into action and clearly was not capable of throwing the ball down the field; San Francisco ran it 12 times after Purdy returned and threw the ball just three times. Running back Christian McCaffrey attempted one of those passes.\n\nWhile Shanahan miscalculated at times — he should’ve challenged the Devonta Smith catch in the first quarter as soon as Smith was calling for a quick snap, for instance — this was a disadvantage no coach would’ve been able to overcome.\n\nThe critics of 'Burrowhead'\n\nLet’s be clear: the Cincinnati Bengals did not lose because they were confident and brash and coined the term Burrowhead. They ran into a generationally dominant offense and a defense that brought pressure and forced turnovers. Being confident is part of Cincinnati’s identity. To strip that away would be to erase something integral to the way they operate.\n\nAnd, frankly, the Bengals had the track record to back up the talk, previously going 3-0 against the Chiefs — including last season’s victory in Kansas City in the AFC title game — when Joe Burrow and Patrick Mahomes both started. As the league looks to cut down on taunting penalties and tamp down player celebrations, the Bengals-Chiefs rivalry is the most exciting one in football right now. The star talent and play of these teams is the main reason why, but don't discount the weight of the personalities on both sides.\n\nHow the 49ers handled Philly's best defender\n\nEagles linebacker Haason Redick is in contention for the NFL’s Defensive Player of the Year Award. He’s relentless in generating pressure off the edge. And, for some reason, the 49ers opted at times to chip or block him with a backup tight end and receivers.\n\nIn fact, on the game-changing play, the one that injured Brock Purdy, San Francisco had reserve tight end Tyler Kroft in a one-on-one situation against Reddick (three tackles, two sacks, one forced fumble, one fumble recovery).\n\nThe FOX broadcast\n\nThis is not a comment at all on Greg Olsen, who is quickly becoming the top gameday analyst among NFL broadcast partners. But the Fox broadcast of the NFC championship game got off to a rough start. First, the production team was slow to show a replay of the one-handed Devonta Smith reception that shouldn’t have counted on a fourth-and-3 on the first drive of the game. Then, when Eagles punter Brett Kern booted a ball that traveled only 34 yards after it apparently hit the Skycam wire, Fox couldn’t provide any angles that would confirm that for the officiating crew.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/01/30/super-bowl-57-matchup-time-tv/11121683002/", "title": "Super Bowl 2023 guide: matchup, time, TV, halftime show, what to ...", "text": "The matchup for the Super Bowl, the most-anticipated sports championship and the biggest television program of the year, has been set.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles take on the Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\n\nThere is plenty of excitement around the two best teams in the NFL and the superstar entertainment.

Chiefs head coach Andy Reid is facing off against his former team and it will also be a battle of brothers. Tight end Travis Kelce has broken records with quarterback Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs while center Jason Kelce has bolstered the offensive line for the Eagles and quarterback Jalen Hurts.\n\nThe Eagles are headed to their first Super Bowl since the 2017 season when they beat the New England Patriots 41-33. This year, Hurts led the team to an 8-0 start and found success with receivers DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown. He has rushed for 15 touchdowns, 13 of which came in the regular season. The second-ranked defense is bolstered by safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson and linebackers T.J. Edwards and Haason Reddick, who was second in the league with 16 sacks in the regular season.\n\nThe Chiefs appear in their third Super Bowl in four years. Mahomes has led a high-powered offense, assisted by Kelce. The quarterback led the league with 5,250 passing yards and 41 touchdowns. Mahomes sprained his ankle in the divisional round, but bounced back to defeat the Cincinnati Bengals in the AFC championship. The Chiefs went 14-3 in the regular season and won their seventh straight AFC West title. This is head coach Andy Reid's fourth time serving as head coach in the Super Bowl. He lost Super Bowl 39 when he was with the Philadelphia Eagles during the 2004 season, but got his first win when the Chiefs captured Super Bowl 54 following the 2019 season. His Chiefs lost Super Bowl 55 to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nWhat TV channel is the Super Bowl on?\n\nSuper Bowl 57 will air on FOX and will kick off at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\nWho is announcing Super Bowl 57?\n\nFOX's Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen will be the broadcasters for Super Bowl 57.\n\nBOOTH BROTHERS:How 'two guys from Jersey' – Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen – became NFL broadcast stars\n\nWhere is the Super Bowl being played this year?\n\nSuper Bowl 57 will be played at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. It is the home of the Arizona Cardinals, who did not make the playoffs this season. The venue has hosted two previous Super Bowls, in 2008 and 2015, when it was called University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWho will sing the national anthem for Super Bowl 57? Who is singing the Black national anthem?\n\nCountry star Chris Stapleton is performing the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" at Super Bowl 57. Academy Award-winning actor Troy Kotsur will be alongside him, signing the national anthem. Multi-platinum singer Babyface will sing \"America the Beautiful\" and Emmy award-winning performer Sheryl Lee Ralph is performing \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" the Black national anthem, prior to kickoff.\n\nWho is performing at the Super Bowl 57 halftime show?\n\nRihanna is the Super Bowl 57 halftime performer. The superstar singer will be giving her first public performance since 2018. Her last album was 2016's \"ANTI.\" She made a return to music this year as part of the \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" soundtrack with the song \"Lift Me Up,\" which gave Rihanna her first Oscar and Golden Globe nominations. Besides that, she has nine Grammy awards for her immense impact on the music industry.\n\nWATCH:Rihanna acknowledges hiatus in Super Bowl 57 halftime show teaser\n\nWho are the Super Bowl officials?\n\nCarl Cheffers will be the referee for Super Bowl 57. This is his third Super Bowl. He will be joined by umpire Roy Ellison, down judge Jerod Phillips, line judge Jeff Bergman, field judge John Jenkins, side judge Eugene Hall, back judge Dino Paganelli and replay official Mark Butterworth. Ellison, Bergman, Hall and Paganelli have previously worked two other Super Bowls. This is the first championship game for Phillips, Jenkins and Butterworth.\n\nWho is predicted to win Super Bowl 57?\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are the favorite (-1.5) to win the Super Bowl, according to Tipico Sportsbook.\n\nGannett may earn revenue from Tipico for audience referrals to betting services.

The big advantage: Travis is 2-0 against his older brother.\n\nThe Kelce brothers face off one more time when the Philadelphia Eagles (1-2) host the Kansas City Chiefs (1-2) on Sunday.\n\nBoth teams have lost two in a row so neither brother has room to brag this week.\n\n“There’s hardly much of any trash-talking, especially when we both just we’re coming off two losses each, so I’m pretty sure we’re both just focused on trying to get in the right direction and get back to the winning aspect of football,” Travis said on the AP Pro Football Podcast.\n\nJason, a four-time Pro Bowl center, is one of only two remaining healthy starters on Philadelphia’s offensive line.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nTravis, a six-time Pro Bowl tight end, is in an unfamiliar spot with the two-time defending AFC champion Chiefs, who haven’t had a losing record since Week 10 of the 2015 season.\n\nJason has to handle ticket requests for friends and family since the Eagles are the home team. Travis is well aware of the reputation of the fans in Philadelphia, but he’s not warning anyone to keep their red jerseys at home.\n\n“Eagles fans have been good to me, the Gang Green has been good to me so maybe if they have an 87 jersey on they might be a little more lenient toward those Chiefs fans in the stands,” he said.\n\nANDY’S HOMECOMING\n\nWhile the Kelce brothers have a reunion, Chiefs coach Andy Reid returns to Philadelphia for the second time since he was fired following the 2012 season. Reid has more wins than any coach in Eagles history and he’s 2-0 against his former team. He’s seeking his 100th win with the Chiefs.\n\n“I look forward to coming back, I look forward to the game, I look forward to the challenge of facing the Eagles,” Reid said in his typical stoic fashion.\n\nPATRICK’S MONTH\n\nPatrick Mahomes had been 11-0 with 35 touchdowns and zero interceptions before the Chiefs lost to Baltimore two weeks ago. He threw his first two picks of the month in last week’s loss at the Chargers.\n\n“We’ve kind of dug ourselves a hole,” Mahomes said. “We’ve lost these games we don’t usually lose until later in the season. It’s my first time coming out of September or right at the end of it and not having a winning record so it’s about how we respond. That comes with every single day and how we practice. It comes with how we study the film and at the end of the day it’s how we play on Sundays so I’m for the challenge and I know the guys in the locker room are excited as well.”\n\nACCOUNTABLE HURTS\n\nJalen Hurts threw his first two picks of the season in Philadelphia’s 41-21 loss at Dallas on Monday night. One of those was returned for a touchdown and the other was another underthrown deep ball. Hurts finished strong with a pair of TD passes in the second half and 326 yards passing overall. He blamed himself for the loss afterward.\n\n“I don’t think he played his best game, I don’t think he played a bad game,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. “There’s improvement. We all need to improve. When you lose like we lost on Monday night, everybody needs to improve. Everybody needs to look in the mirror, starting with myself. And people are going to look up to Jalen and the things that he says and he does, and he leads by example, so I’m glad that he’s living that way and taking his responsibilities as he needs to. That doesn’t surprise me, though.”\n\nRUN NICK RUN\n\nThe Eagles had three runs by their running backs against Dallas. Hurts carried nine times on run-pass option plays, scrambles and broken plays. Miles Sanders gained 24 yards on one of his two carries and has the NFL’s third-best average yards per rush (4.9) since his rookie season in 2019.\n\nHe wants the ball without saying it.\n\n“Not necessarily myself, but to have a successful offense you have to run the ball,” he said.\n\nHurts was more precise.\n\n“He’s a pivotal part of this offense, one of the top running backs in the league,” Hurts said. “He’s got to get his.”\n\nNEW ADDITION\n\nThe Chiefs signed former All-Pro wide receiver Josh Gordon this week, but Reid already said he’s not playing against the Eagles. The 30-year-old Gordon led the league with 1,646 yards receiving during the 2013 season in Cleveland. But he struggled with off-the-field issues that led to six suspensions over a span of six years, five of them for some form of substance abuse.\n\n___\n\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter at https://twitter.com/robmaaddi and his work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/robmaaddi\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/10/01/chiefs-jets-taylor-swift-sunday-night-football-live-updates/71016191007/", "title": "Sunday Night Football highlights: Chiefs-Jets score, top plays, more", "text": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The Kansas City Chiefs did not look like the version of themselves that has gone to three Super Bowls in the past five years.\n\nBut a fast start in the form of a 17-point advantage accrued over the first 12 minutes of their “Sunday Night Football” tilt against the New York Jets compensated for tight contest that came down to the end.\n\nLeading 23-20 out of the two-minute warning, quarterback Patrick Mahomes could have scored a touchdown.

Running back Isiah Pacheco ran 48 yards for a touchdown, Noah Gray caught a 34-yard TD pass from Mahomes, and Harrison Butker kicked a 37-yard field goal.\n\nPacheco finished with 115 rushing yards, 48 of those coming on his touchdown run.\n\nBut the Jets didn't let it go. They went on a 20-3 scoring run to tie the game entering the 4th quarter. The scores came with a safety, 31-yard field goal from Greg Zuerlein, and 1-yard and 10-yard TD passes from Wilson to C.J. Uzomah and Allen Lazard, respectively.\n\nJets quarterback Zach Wilson had one of his more promising performances, leading a comeback and tying the game at 20 on the first drive of the second half with the touchdown pass to Lazard and a two-point conversion he ran in himself. He finished 28 of 39 with 245 passing yards and two touchdowns.\n\nBut he also made a critical error that could have cost the Jets the game, fumbling the ball in the fourth quarter.\n\nMahomes had an uncharacteristic outing. The two-time MVP had a third interception negated by defensive holding on the final drive of the game. But his scrambling, including a 24-yard dash on 3rd-and-23, bailed out the Chiefs on a night the offensive line struggled against the Jets and receivers could not find much wiggle room in the secondary.\n\nHarrison Butker’s 26-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter made it 23-20 and held as the game-winning score.\n\nThe Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce romance is fake. You know it is. So what? Let's enjoy it.\n\nYou know it. Deep inside your soul. Where you tell yourself the truth. In fact, everyone knows it. Your friends. Your family. Your kids. The country. The President. Outer space. We. All. Know. It. We know the Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce romance is fake.\n\nDon't hate me for telling the truth that you already intuitively feel. You have told yourself this inevitable truth over and over as this story has washed over the nation. Your significant other even asked you recently: \"Do you think it's real?\" And you replied: \"Of course it is.\" You knew this was a a lie and it landed you in therapy but you want to believe. But you know what?\n\nIt's OK. This moment is actually interesting and fun. A certain sort of goofy obsession has seeped in. No, it's not real, but who cares? We all love this phony love affair. We will continue to love it. We will keep loving it until this spectacularly fake relationship dies and Kelce becomes a cautionary lyric on one of Swift's future albums. — Mike Freeman\n\nJets postgame press conference: Zach Wilson takes blame, Robert Saleh supports players\n\nJets quarterback Zach Wilson took full blame for the loss during a postgame interview.\n\n\"Yea, that's on me. Critical situation, I can't have a play like that. I can not drop the ball,\" Wilson said of his fourth-quarter fumble recovered by the Chiefs. \"To drop a snap, I can not do that. I lost us that game, and I can not do that. \"I was making it clear to those guys that I needed to be better. I needed to be better on the little things, the details. It can't happen.\"\n\nChiefs postgame press conference\n\nTaylor Swift and Donna Kelce hug it out at Chiefs game\n\nThe NBC broadcast cameras zoomed in on Taylor Swift chatting in a suite with Travis Kelce's mom, Donna. The two looked close, smiling and whispering while Swift put her arm around Donna multiple times.\n\nPatrick Mahomes recovers from near-interception: Holding?\n\nJets cornerback Sauce Gardner was called for a controversial hold that wiped out a Patrick Mahomes interception. The penalty resulted in an automatic first down on Kansas City’s final possession. Following the penalty, the Chiefs picked up a couple first downs, including a game-clinching nine-yard scramble by Mahomes on third-and-8 to ice the game.\n\nMahomes didn’t have his best performance Sunday night, but he did just enough for the Chiefs to survive. The quarterback went 18 of 30 passing for 203 yards, to go with one touchdown and two interceptions.\n\nJets turnover: Zach Wilson fumble recovered by Chiefs' Tershawn Wharton\n\nThe Jets battled back from a 17-point deficit to even the game at 20, but needed to score again as they trailed by 23-20 midway through the fourth quarter. With the ball at midfield, and the offense moving the ball incrementally, it looked like they’d have that chance for at least a game-tying field goal.\n\nBut Zach Wilson could not handle a shotgun snap and Chiefs defensive tackle Tershawn Wharton jumped on the pigskin before anybody else could. The Chiefs took over in Jets territory with 7:24 remaining. It was the Jets’ first turnover of the game.\n\nHarrison Butker makes 3rd field goal, Chiefs reclaim lead\n\nAfter going scoreless in the third quarter, the Chiefs put together a 14-play, 80-yard drive to get into scoring position. The Jets were able to stop the Chiefs on third down to force a 26-yard field goal with 10:51 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nButker’s made all three of his field goal attempts tonight.\n\nJets vs. Chiefs third-quarter highlights\n\nAllen Lazard’s 10-yard touchdown reception served as the only points in the third quarter.\n\nThe Jets have played solid defense against Kansas City for two straight quarters. New York held the Chiefs to just 42 total yards and three first downs in the quarter. Zach Wilson produced 79 passing yards and one touchdown. While running back Breece Hall had 43 rushing yards.\n\nThe contest is tied 20-20 at the end of three quarters.\n\nHas Travis Kelce scored a touchdown for the Chiefs today?\n\nNo, Kelce did not give Taylor Swift a reason to scream and cheer, but the Chiefs star tight end had a team-high six catches for 60 yards in the win. Kelce was targeted nine times.\n\nKansas City’s go-to guy on offense Sunday night was running back Isiah Pacheco who produced 158 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown playing in his home state of New Jersey.\n\nJets' Zach Wilson vs. Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes stats\n\nLet's take a look at the quarterback stats right now, after the first two drives of the third quarter:\n\nZach Wilson: 25 of 34 passes complete, 220 yards, two touchdowns, no interceptions\n\nPatrick Mahomes: 8 of 17 passes complete, 135 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions\n\nAllen Lazard touchdown: Zach Wilson ties it up with 2-point conversion\n\nOn the first drive of the second half, the Jets offense drove 75 yards and left the field with the ballgame knotted at 20.\n\nWilson found tight end Tyler Conklin for 25 yards to open the half. He then had first-down completions to receiver Allen Lazard and tight end Jeremy Ruckert.\n\nFrom the Chiefs’ 10-yard line, Wilson dropped back and fed Lazard a pass for a touchdown to make it 20-18. Wilson then scrambled to his left and extended the ball over the goal line to make the two-point conversion successful and tie the game.\n\nJoe Klecko honored at halftime of Jets vs. Chiefs\n\nSporting his gold jacket and standing on the Jets logo at midfield, Joe Klecko took the microphone next to his Hall of Fame bust that will be displayed at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio for eternity.\n\nHe thanked Jets fans as the team honored him for his induction to the Hall this past August. Klecko played for the Jets from 1977-1987 and was a two-time All-Pro defensive end. His 20.5 sacks in 1981 led the league that season.\n\nFirst-half recap: Chiefs lead Jets 20-12\n\nThe Chiefs jumped out to a 17-0 first quarter lead, but the Jets rallied back in the second quarter to go into halftime down 20-12.\n\nNew York outscored Kansas City 12-3 in the second quarter, thanks to two interceptions by the Jets defense.\n\nSafety Ashtyn Davis’ interception led to the Jets’ one and only touchdown thus far in the game. Linebacker C.J. Mosley also had a pick.\n\nThe Jets had 152 yards in the quarter compared to just 59 by Kansas City.\n\nStill, the Chiefs have an advantage at halftime due to a hot start. Kansas City’s gained 259 total yards. Running back Isiah Pacheco has 126 yards from scrimmage and one touchdown in the game.\n\nTaylor Swift welcomed by fans: 'I've never seen this much attention paid to the Chiefs'\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – The last time Taylor Swift entered MetLife Stadium it was as a performer, the third of three nights she played in the stadium as part of her “Eras Tour” in May.\n\nOn Sunday, she was just a spectator, cheering on beau Travis Kelce as his Kansas City Chiefs faced the New York Jets on “Sunday Night Football.”\n\nFor the many Chiefs – and Jets – fans in attendance, the rumored Swift-Kelce relationship represented the apex of the hype surrounding the organization's “Winning Era,” a stretch that has included three Super Bowl appearances (two championships) and plenty of victories.\n\n“I’ve never seen this much attention paid to the Chiefs,” said Chiefs fan Josh Mayer, from Reading, Pennsylvania. “Every single TV show is talking about it, which is nice. Every TikTok I’ve seen is all about the Chiefs and how these Swifties are into football. It’s like ‘Oh, this is cool.’”\n\nRead the full story from reporter Chris Bumbaca.\n\nPatrick Mahomes intercepted again: Jets' C.J. Mosley makes catch\n\nMahomes nearly threw an interception to Jets linebacker C.J. Mosley while looking for Travis Kelce over the middle on the Chiefs’ previous drive. But Mosley dropped the pass, as Kelce and Mahomes’ telepathic communication stopped for at least a play.\n\nAs the second half came to a close, Mahomes was not as fortunate. This time, with Mosley roaming the middle of the field, Mahomes floated a pass off his back foot and straight into the linebacker’s hands for his second pick of the game.\n\nNew York, however, was unable to do much with the 26 seconds left on the clock.\n\nHarrison Butker field goal extends Chiefs lead 20-12\n\nAfter throwing an interception on Kansas City’s previous possession, Patrick Mahomes led the Chiefs on a 10-play, 56-yard drive that ended with a Harrison Butker 37-yard field goal.\n\nWide receiver Kadarius Toney had a nice 15-yard catch to put the Chiefs in field goal range.\n\nButker’s field goal gave Kansas City a 20-12 lead. Butker’s made both his field goal attempts in the first half.\n\nJets Brandin Echols out with hamstring injury\n\nPhantom horse collar, C.J. Uzomah touchdown helps Jets\n\nTaylor Swift won’t have to witness a first-half blowout after all.\n\nFollowing Mahomes’ interception, the Jets had excellent field position and were aided by a horse collar penalty – although replay appeared to contradict that call – to reach the red zone. Zach Wilson missed a wide-open Garrett Wilson for a touchdown on the next play, but he eventually found tight end C.J. Uzomah from one-yard out for the Jets’ first touchdown of the game. New York trailed 17-12 after the extra point with 6:26 until halftime.\n\nPatrick Mahomes pick: Jets' Ashtyn Davis intercepts throw\n\nPatrick Mahomes threw an interception in the second quarter against the New York Jets.\n\nBeginning a drive after the Jets kicked a field goal, Mahomes took the snap, faked a handoff and rolled right. He shuffled around in the pocket before throwing downfield for Noah Gray.\n\nJets safety Ashtyn Davis leaped up and caught the ball before it could get to the tight end and New York had the ball back.\n\nGreg Zuerlein field goal puts Jets offense on board\n\nZach Wilson and the Jets offense put together their best drive of the first half and gained some points and momentum, now trailing 17-5.\n\nWilson had a deep 39-yard pass to wide receiver Allen Lazard to put the Jets in scoring position. Wilson almost threw his first touchdown pass off the night a few plays later, but tight end Tyler Conklin couldn't hold onto the football in the end zone, so the club settled for a 31-yard field goal by kicker Greg Zuerlein.\n\nThe 62-yard drive was New York’s longest of the half.\n\nChiefs' Cole Christiansen is out with hamstring injury\n\nChiefs facemask penalty gives Jets safety, first points\n\nChiefs right tackle Jawaan Taylor has taken his share of penalties and criticism through the first three weeks of the season.\n\nThis play won’t make his highlight reel, either.\n\nTaylor was called for a facemask penalty in Kansas City’s end zone as the team started its drive deep in its own territory. Since the foul occurred in the end zone, it was ruled a safety.\n\nThe points were the Jets’ first of the game, and they trailed 17-2 early in the second quarter.\n\nNoah Gray touchdown: Chiefs lead Jets 17-0\n\nThe Chiefs came is as the heavy favorite, and they are playing like it.\n\nKansas City jumped out to a 17-0 lead after Patrick Mahomes engineered a six play, 89-yard touchdown drive. The Chiefs’ drive was capped off by a Mahomes 34-yard touchdown pass to tight end Noah Gray.\n\nThe Chiefs have scored on all three of their possessions and have 200 total yards late in the first quarter.\n\nWho is Chiefs' No. 10 Isiah Pacheco?\n\nIsiah Pacheco is a running back for the Kansas City Chiefs who scored the team’s first touchdown in its Sunday night matchup against the New York Jets.\n\nThe game served as a homecoming for the 24-year-old, who grew up in Vineland, New Jersey and played college football at Rutgers. He finished his college career at Rutgers as seventh in school history with 2,442 rushing yards.\n\nPacheco was drafted by the Chiefs in the seventh round of the 2022 NFL draft. His rookie year, he started 11 games and played in all 17. He ran for 830 yards and five touchdowns. The Chiefs won the Super Bowl, beating the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nPacheco goes by the nickname “Pop,” which he says comes from his time as a kid when he played Pop Warner and made a big tackle on defense. It also serves as a tribute to his older brother, who called him the name and passed away in 2016 at the age of 29.\n\nIsiah Pacheco touchdown gives Chiefs 10-0 lead over Jets\n\nThe Chiefs offense scored quickly after their defense forced a three-and-out.\n\nRunning back Isiah Pacheco followed his blockers to the left, found space and scampered for a 48-yard touchdown to extend Kansas City’s first-quarter lead. Butker hit the extra point to make it 10-0.\n\nThe Chiefs’ second series went 69 yards in just 5 plays. It lasted just over two minutes. The Chiefs have eight carries, 82 rushing yards and one rushing TD in the first quarter.\n\nChiefs' Harrison Butker hits 37-yard field goal\n\nChiefs kicker Harrison Butker made a 37-yard field goal to open scoring after Patrick Mahomes’ short pass to wide receiver Skyy Moore fell incomplete on third down. Chiefs lead 3-0.\n\nTight end Travis Kelce had two catches for 29 yards during Kansas City’s first series.\n\nIs Taylor Swift at Chiefs vs. Jets game? Yes, she has arrived\n\nThe NFL has welcomed Taylor Swift to New York — New Jersey, technically.\n\nThe popstar was seen in a video captured on social media entering MetLife Stadium ahead of the Kansas City Chiefs game against the New York Jets. She went through security with Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively.\n\nThis will be Swift’s second straight week attending a Chiefs game as she’s been rumored to be dating Travis Kelce. Last week, she was seen in a suite with Kelce’s mom, Donna, and cheered Kansas City on to victory.\n\nSwift had three shows at MetLife Stadium this summer as part of her Eras Tour. New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers is a Swiftie and was seen singing and dancing at one of the shows. The quarterback, who tore his Achilles in Week 1, is also at the Chiefs-Jets game.\n\nFollow all things Taylor during the game with our Swift-Kelce live blog.\n\nAaron Rodgers, Paul Rudd early stars at MetLife Stadium\n\nAaron Rodgers made his return to MetLife Stadium on Sunday after tearing his Achilles in the New York Jets’ season opener.

(AP) — The Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles face off in the Super Bowl. Follow for the latest live updates and news from The Associated Press. All times MST.\n\n8:35 p.m.\n\nPatrick Mahomes has a Super Bowl MVP trophy to go with his regular season MVP, and the Kansas City Chiefs are once again hoisting the Vince Lombardi trophy.\n\nMahomes was named the game’s MVP in a postgame ceremony after a gutsy performance that included 182 yards passing and three touchdowns. He played the entire game despite a right ankle injury that obviously limited how well he could move.\n\n“There was nothing that was going to keep me off the football field,” Mahomes said as Chiefs fans celebrated at State Farm Stadium.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nIt’s the second time in four seasons that the Chiefs have won the Super Bowl. Mahomes was asked if Kansas City’s recent run of success could be called a dynasty, and the quarterback said no because “we’re not done yet.”\n\n8:15 p.m.\n\nPatrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs are the winners of Super Bowl 57.\n\nMahomes — hobbling around on a hurt ankle — led the Chiefs downfield for the winning drive that was capped by Harrison Butker’s 27-yard field goal with 8 seconds left, sealing a 38-35 victory.\n\n“He's the MVP,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said about Mahomes. “That's all that needs to be said. MVP. And you saw it tonight.”\n\nThe Eagles took the ensuing kickoff but there would be no miracle. Jalen Hurts’ desperation heave on the final play fell way short of the end zone, and the Chiefs’ celebration began.\n\nThe Chiefs won the Super Bowl for the second time in four seasons. They beat the 49ers following the 2019 season before losing to the Buccaneers after 2020. This time, they trailed for most of the evening before rallying in the second half to beat the Eagles.\n\nIt’s a tough loss for Philadelphia, which got a great performance from quarterback Jalen Hurts, who threw for 304 yards and ran for three touchdowns.\n\nMahomes, who was named the AP NFL MVP on Thursday, threw for three touchdowns. The Chiefs overcame a 10-point halftime deficit and never led until taking a 28-27 lead early in the fourth quarter.\n\n8:00 p.m.\n\nThe scoring won’t stop at the Super Bowl, and it’s getting down to the wire.\n\nThe Eagles tied the game at 35 with 5:15 remaining when Jalen Hurts scored his third rushing touchdown of the night on a 2-yard run. The quarterback then also ran for the crucial 2-point conversion that tied the game.\n\nHurts continues his brilliant performance in his first Super Bowl, throwing for 304 yards and a touchdown while also running for three scores.\n\n7:50 p.m.\n\nKansas City’s Kadarius Toney turned in a crucial play for Kansas City early in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Chiefs forced the Eagles to punt and Toney was there to catch it, breaking a few tackles before reversing field, where he had a convoy of Chiefs players waiting to provide blocking.\n\nToney made it 65 yards, all the way down to the Eagles 5-yard line, before getting knocked out of bounds. Three plays later, Mahomes hit a wide open Skyy Moore for a 4-yard touchdown and a 35-27 lead.\n\nToney also had the touchdown catch that put the Chiefs ahead 28-27 earlier in the fourth.\n\n7:40 p.m.\n\nRihanna was pregnant with her second child as she performed her Super Bowl halftime show Sunday.\n\nThe singer’s representative confirmed the pregnancy shortly after she ended her 13-minute set at Super Bowl 57.\n\nThe baby bump that was visible in the tight clothes she wore under her baggy red jumpsuit during the show set off a wave of social media speculation that she might be pregnant again.\n\nThe 34-year-old has a 9-month-old son with rapper A$AP Rocky.\n\n7:35 p.m.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have taken their first lead of the night.\n\nPatrick Mahomes threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to a wide open Kadarius Toney, pushing the Chiefs ahead 28-27 with 12:04 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nMahomes has bounced back nicely after hobbling off the field late in the second quarter. He appeared to re-aggravate an ankle injury that’s been bothering him throughout the playoffs.\n\nThe veteran QB has still been very good, completing 17 of 22 passes for 161 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\nMeanwhile, players from both teams have been struggling to keep their footing on a slippery playing surface, leading several to change their cleats.\n\n7:25 p.m.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles are clinging to a 27-21 lead in the Super Bowl as the game moves to the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Eagles had a 24-14 halftime lead, but the Chiefs responded with a touchdown on the opening drive of the third quarter to pull within 24-21. Philadelphia pushed ahead 27-21 with 1:45 left in the third after Jake Elliott made a 33-yard field goal.\n\nEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has been stellar in his first Super Bowl appearance, completing 22 of 31 passes for 234 yards, one passing touchdown and two rushing touchdowns. His 66 yards rushing are the most ever by a QB in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Eagles are trying to win their second Super Bowl in six seasons. The Chiefs are trying to win for the second time in four years.\n\n7:15 p.m.\n\nFanDuel says it is still going to give $10 million in free bets to spread among its Super Bowl bettors.\n\nIn a much-hyped ad for betting site FanDuel customers, Rob Gronkowski attempted a 25-yard field goal. A voiceover said he missed the kick, but they’d still give out the free bets. But online, onlookers were confused and thought it was good.\n\nGronk’s “Kick of Destiny” landed the gaming site plenty of free publicity for the stunt, as well as plenty of new customers who registered to be part of the campaign.\n\n6:58 p.m.\n\nPatrick Mahomes is still pretty good with only one fully functioning ankle.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs quarterback led his team on a touchdown drive to open the third quarter. Isiah Pacheco ran for a 1-yard score to cut the Eagles’ lead to 24-21 with 9:30 left in the third quarter.\n\nMahomes appeared to re-aggravate a right ankle injury in the first half, limping off the field late in the second quarter.

Brown. Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes also threw a touchdown pass and Nick Bolton returned a fumble 36 yards for another score.\n\nAn important development to watch: Mahomes limped off the field late in the second quarter. The two-time NFL MVP has been fighting a badly sprained right ankle and looked like he re-aggravated the injury.\n\n5:55 p.m.\n\nJalen Hurts made up for a costly mistake earlier in the second quarter with his second rushing touchdown of the evening a few minutes later.\n\nHurts ran 4 yards for the touchdown and a 21-14 lead as the pro-Eagles crowd chanted “MVP! MVP!” Hurts was the AP NFL MVP runner-up to Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes.\n\nA few minutes before his TD, Hurts fumbled around midfield and Kansas City’s Nick Bolton recovered the fumble and ran it 36 yards for a touchdown, which tied the game at 14.\n\nHurts is already putting together a solid Super Bowl. He joins Jim McMahon as the only quarterbacks with two TD runs in a Super Bowl. His 61 yards rushing are already third-most for a QB in a Super Bowl behind Steve McNair and Colin Kaepernick.\n\n5:40 p.m.\n\nIt’s a tie game again at Super Bowl 57 after a stunning scoop and score by Kansas City linebacker Nick Bolton.\n\nThe Eagles were in control with the ball and a 14-7 lead but Philadelphia quarterback Jalen Hurts fumbled on third down around midfield. Bolton was there to grab the football and ran 36 yards untouched to the end zone.\n\nThe score was 14-14 with 9:39 left in the first half.\n\n5:35 p.m.\n\nBrittney Griner is in the crowd representing the Philadelphia Eagles at the Super Bowl.\n\nIt was the third public appearance for the WNBA star since her release from a Russian prison.\n\nGriner has said she’ll play for the Phoenix Mercury again this season, although she’s still an unsigned free agent. She hasn’t talked about her international future and potentially playing in the Olympics next year in Paris.\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles have taken the lead again thanks to a big strike from Jalen Hurts to A.J. Brown.\n\nOn the first play of the second quarter, Hurts lofted a 45-yard throw toward the end zone. Brown outmaneuvered the scrambling Kansas City defense before catching the ball and then raising his arms to flex his muscles.\n\nThe Eagles lead 14-7.\n\nHurts — the AP NFL MVP runner-up to Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes — is off to a good start in his first Super Bowl. He’s 8-of-10 passing for 116 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions.\n\n5:25 p.m.\n\nThe Super Bowl has settled down after a frantic start.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles are tied at 7 after the first quarter. The teams exchanged touchdowns on their opening offensive drives before each team’s defense recovered.\n\nThe Chiefs had a slight edge in the first quarter with 112 total yards to the Eagles’ 99. The Chiefs are averaging 9.3 yards per play.\n\nKansas City missed an opportunity to take a lead late in the first quarter when Harrison Butker’s 42-yard field goal attempt bounced off the left upright.\n\n5:10 p.m.\n\nIn its first Super Bowl ad, Dunkin’ Donuts enlisted superfan Ben Affleck and wife Jennifer Lopez for its spot.\n\nIn the ad, Affleck mans the drive-through booth at a Dunkin’ Donuts in Medford, Massachusetts and shocks customers. Finally, Lopez comes through the drive-through and asks Ben what he’s doing. “You’re embarrassing me in front of my friends,” he says. “Grab me a glazed” she demands.\n\nAffleck has a long association with the brand, often spotted carrying Dunkin’ Donuts drinks in paparazzi photos. He directed the ad, too.\n\n5:02 p.m.\n\nOffense rules so far in at this Super Bowl.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs tied the game at 7 midway through the first quarter when Patrick Mahomes found Travis Kelce on a beautiful fade route to the back corner of the end zone for an 18-yard touchdown.\n\nThe drive went 75 yards on just six plays. Rookie Isiah Pacheco had 29 yards rushing in the drive.\n\n4:55 p.m.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles wasted little time taking a lead.\n\nQuarterback Jalen Hurts ran for a 1-yard touchdown to cap an efficient opening drive that traveled 75 yards on 11 plays. DeVonta Smith was Hurts’ favorite target on the drive, catching three passes for 41 yards.\n\nThe Eagles are the first team to take the opening kickoff in the Super Bowl and drive for a touchdown on offense since Super Bowl 32 when the Green Bay Packers did it against the Denver Broncos 25 years ago.\n\nThe Chicago Bears also scored on Devin Hester’s kickoff return for a TD in Super Bowl 41.\n\n4:45 p.m.\n\nThe Super Bowl is officially underway.\n\nThe Chiefs won the coin toss and elected to receive the ball to start the second half. That means the Philadelphia Eagles have the first offensive possession.\n\nKansas City’s kicker Harrison Butker booted the opening kickoff through the back of the end zone and the Eagles started with the ball on their own 25-yard-line.\n\nThe retractable roof is open and the weather is essentially perfect, with temperatures in the 70s. The Chiefs and Eagles both have plenty of fans in Arizona, but it’s a decidely pro-Philadelphia crowd.\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nCountry musician and songwriter Chris Stapleton performed the national anthem for Super Bowl.\n\nThe Super Bowl might be known for its extravagance, but the anthem was anything but fancy. All that was needed was a Stapleton’s smooth baritone voice and a guitar. Deaf actor Troy Kotsur — who won an Oscar for the movie “CODA” — signed the anthem alongside Stapleton.\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni and starting center Jason Kelce both had tears in their eyes during Stapleton’s emotional performance.\n\nBefore Stapleton stepped to the microphone, Grammy Award winner Babyface performed “America The Beautiful.”\n\nThe series of pregame canonical songs began with “Abbott Elementary” star Sheryl Lee Ralph performing “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” a song that’s been dubbed the Black national anthem.\n\nRalph, wearing a flowing red velvet gown, began the song as a reflective ballad, and it became a soaring hymn as it went on, with military-style drums joining her and a choir dressed all in white chiming in behind her.\n\nPLACE YOUR BETS\n\nThere will be plenty of action on the football field Sunday. And at the casinos.\n\nThe Super Bowl is one of the biggest sports betting days of the year, especially now that about two-thirds of the country can do so legally.\n\nSome of the most popular bets are also the most straightforward: The Eagles are favored by 1 1/2 points, according to FanDuel Sportsbook. The site’s over-under is currently set at 51 1/2 points.\n\nSportsbooks have also taken advantage of the increasing popularity of prop bets, which range from the team who wins the coin flip, to who scores the first touchdown, to whether the game goes to overtime.\n\nYou can even bet on the color of Gatorade used when the winning coach is given his postgame bath.\n\n3:45 p.m.\n\nDamar Hamlin is at the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Buffalo Bills safety made his third public appearance in Phoenix during Super Bowl week, this time on the field at State Farm Stadium prior to Sunday’s game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nIt’s another step in Hamlin’s remarkable recovery. It’s been a little more than a month since Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated on the field in Cincinnati.\n\nHe also appeared on stage at “NFL Honors” on Thursday night after the Bills and Cincinnati Bengals training and medical staffs, along with the staff at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, were recognized.\n\n3:40 p.m.\n\nThis is not the moment for the cable to go out in Philly, but here we are.\n\nComcast spokesperson Jen Bilotta said physical damage that severed fiberoptic cable in the Kensington section of northeast Philadelphia on Saturday afternoon resulted in an outage affecting a few thousand households in the Kensington and Fishtown neighborhoods and some surrounding areas.\n\nShe said crews have been “working furiously” for several hours to resolve the problem and some customers have started to come back online — they are hoping to restore service to everyone by kickoff.\n\nSUPER BOWL HISTORY\n\nFor the first time, young aspiring football players all over the world will get to watch two Black quarterbacks face each other in the Super Bowl.\n\nAP NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes leads Kansas City against the MVP runner-up, Jalen Hurts. The significance isn’t lost on Mahomes.\n\n“I think about it a lot,” Mahomes said. “The quarterbacks that came before me — Shack Harris, Doug Williams — that laid the foundation for me to be in this position. It goes across all sports. If you think about Jackie Robinson and the people who broke the color barrier in baseball, I wouldn’t be standing here today if it wasn’t for them.\n\n3:20 p.m.\n\nArryn Siposs is active for the Philadelphia Eagles and will handle punting duties against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nSiposs went on injured reserve after injuring an ankle against the Giants in December. He was activated after the Eagles beat the 49ers for the NFC championship, raising expectations that he would play in the big game.\n\nBrett Kern had been punting for the Eagles. He was inactive for the Super Bowl.\n\nThe other inactive players for Philadelphia: quarterback Ian Book, cornerback Josiah Scott, running back Trey Sermon, safety Anthony Harris, linebacker Kyron Johnson and wide receiver Greg Ward.\n\nInactive for the Chiefs: quarterback Shane Buechele, running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire, defensive ends Josh Kaindoh and Malik Herring, tight end Blake Bell and offensive linemen Austin Reiter and Darian Kinnard.\n\nSUPER BROS\n\nFor the first time in Super Bowl history, a pair of siblings will play each other on the NFL’s grandest stage.\n\nTravis Kelce helped the Kansas City Chiefs return to their third championship game in four seasons, while brother Jason has the Eagles back for the second time in six years.\n\n“Cool scenario to be in, you know?” Travis Kelce said. “My mom can’t lose.”\n\nDonna Kelce said on Thursday before the “NFL Honors” show that she did her best to keep up with her two sons’ voracious appetites, but it was easier said than done.\n\n“The refrigerator was always packed, but it didn’t last more than a day or so,” she said. “Whole chickens, they would eat lots of pork, ribs. I’d have leftovers in the refrigerator and it never lasted past the day.\n\n“When they left for college, I got a raise.”\n\nIMPORTANT DELIVERIES\n\nTony Conigliaro’s Super Bowl started long before kickoff.\n\nThe owner of Tony’s Pizza in Brooklyn said he was taking orders Saturday, a day ahead of the big game, especially for the “family deal”: a large pie, 10 wings, garlic knots, soda and other extras for $32 — delivered.\n\n“The Super Bowl is a little crazy,” said Conigliaro, who has been selling pizzas for more than 30 years. “Everybody wants to eat at the same time. That’s the problem. Everybody wants 5:30, quarter to six, six o’clock. It comes to a point that we don’t pick up the phones no more because everybody’s calling back — ‘Where’s my pizza?’”\n\nThen the game starts and his ovens cool off a bit.\n\n“Then we get busy again. What do you call it — halftime?” Conigliaro said. “The phone starts ringing.”\n\nHe estimates his staff would make 200 pizzas Sunday, but not after 8 p.m.\n\n“We just clean up and go home,” Conigliaro said.\n\nHALFTIME LOOKAHEAD\n\nRihanna has put in the work ahead of her Super Bowl halftime show, focusing so hard on what she promises will be “a jam-packed show” that her upcoming birthday and Valentine’s Day almost slipped her mind.\n\n“The setlist was the biggest challenge. That was the hardest, hardest part. Deciding how to maximize 13 minutes but also celebrate — that’s what this show is going to be. It’s going to be a celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together,” Rihanna said.\n\nIt’ll be her first live performance in seven years.\n\nPHILLY GIRL\n\nJill Biden is expected to be among the fans at State Farm Stadium cheering on her beloved Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe first lady grew up in suburban Philadelphia and has never been shy about her allegiance to the hometown team. She and her grandson, Hunter, were at the stadium in Philadelphia on Jan. 29 when the Eagles won the NFC championship.\n\nThe 16-year-old will join her again on Sunday.\n\nNo sitting president has attended a Super Bowl, mainly because of the strict security requirements authorities would need to impose upon the tens of thousands of fans. President Biden will be at the White House on Sunday.\n\nPresident Biden says he’s a Philadelphia sports fan, too, out of necessity, and often jokes that “I’d be sleeping alone” otherwise.\n\n2:20 p.m.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs welcomed two new fans to the world on Super Bowl Sunday, with a third apparently on the way.\n\nChiefs offensive lineman Nick Allegretti’s wife, Christina, gave birth in the early hours to twin girls back home in Chicago, a team official confirmed to The Associated Press. Allegretti was able to watch everything unfold on FaceTime from the lobby of the team hotel while the rest of the Chiefs slept ahead of their game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nAllegretti, who has started three games this season, will be available for the Chiefs in the big game.\n\nAbout the same time his wife was giving birth, Chiefs wide receiver Mecole Hardman tweeted that his girlfriend, Chariah Gordeon, had gone into labor. Hardman went on injured reserve this week and was not available to play in the game.\n\nThere are plenty of Eagles on baby watch, too.\n\nStarting center Jason Kelce, whose brother Travis is a tight end for Kansas City, and his wife are expecting their third child at any moment. In fact, Kylie Kelce, who is 38 weeks pregnant, has said that her obstetricians would be on hand at State Farm Stadium on Sunday should the baby make a dramatic appearance during the game.\n\nPHILLY FAITHFUL\n\nPhiladelphia native Dawn Staley donned an Eagles jersey during Sunday’s South Carolina-LSU SEC matchup of undefeated teams in women’s basketball ahead of the Super Bowl. And after her top-ranked Gamecocks rolled to an 88-64 victory, Staley was asked about the Chiefs-Eagles matchup.\n\n“The Eagles have already won,” the coach beamed. “It’s divine order. Jalen Hurts, it’s divine order.”\n\nAD TALK\n\nBooze was a big buyer for Super Bowl ad space this year. Crypto, not so much.\n\nAnheuser-Busch will again be the biggest advertiser during the Super Bowl, with three minutes of national airtime. But the beverage giant gave up its deal to be the game’s exclusive alcohol advertiser, so Heineken, Diageo, Remy Martin and Molson Coors are also in.\n\nAfter last year’s “Crypto Bowl” featured four cryptocurrency companies running splashy ads, there won’t be any this year.\n\nSeveral 30-second ad slots sold for more than $7 million this year, with most going for between $6 million and $7 million.\n\nHEALTH WATCH\n\nPatrick Mahomes says he’s “definitely in a better spot” when it comes to his ailing right ankle than he was for the AFC championship game, and the AP MVP doesn’t expect to be limited by it when he leads the Kansas City Chiefs against the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl.\n\nThe quarterback said this week that he continues to get treatment on the ankle, which he hurt in the divisional round against Jacksonville, and that it will probably continue up until Sunday’s kickoff.\n\n“You won’t know exactly how it is until you get to game day,” he said.\n\n1:50 p.m.\n\nEagles fan Lauren Clark strolled around State Farm Stadium with a wide grin, snapping pictures on her phone and taking in the experience of her first Super Bowl.\n\nThe Philadelphia native said she’s waited 40 years for this moment. As a 10-year-old, Clark listened to her first Super Bowl in 1981 on the radio and she's wanted to get a seat at the big game ever since.\n\nLife achievement, unlocked.\n\n“I was just tired of saying ‘Maybe next year,’” Clark said. “My Eagles are in the Super Bowl, my kids are grown, so I just said screw it, let’s go. You only live once. This is a dream come true.”\n\nClark was one of thousands of fans milling around the outside of State Farm Stadium at the NFL’s ‘Gameday Experience,’ which featured live music, food and drinks.\n\n1:40 p.m.\n\nThe Valley of Fun is in full force on Super Bowl 57 Sunday.\n\nFootball fans descended by the thousands on Glendale, Arizona, for the NFL’s title game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs. It was glorious weather for revelers, with partly cloudy skies and high temperatures in the 70s.\n\nThe Chiefs and Eagles are at the stadium, too, arriving more than three hours before the scheduled game time 4:30 p.m. local time. The NFL said it expects the retractable roof will be open at State Farm Stadium thanks to the nice weather, which was also the case for the previous two Super Bowls played at the stadium.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/02/03/from-reid-to-super-bowls-eagles-4-stalwarts-done-it-all/51252091/", "title": "From Reid to Super Bowls, Eagles 4 stalwarts done it all", "text": "AP\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Jason Kelce felt the pull of retirement after the Eagles slogged through a miserable 2020 season and a second Super Bowl any time soon seemed like a joke. The Christmas album crooner,honorary Mummer and All-Pro center — how many players have all those titles in their NFL.com bio? — considered walking away at the end of last season. His future was one of the more pressing offseason questions on tap, so Philadelphia Eagles coach Nick Sirianni shipped the big guy two cases of beer to coax him to stay.\n\nSo Kelce stayed.\n\n“I’ve learned now I don’t know when that last game is going to come,” the 35-year-old Kelce said.\n\nHey, at least Kelce knows for sure when the last game this season is going to come.\n\nKelce has tried not to consider that the Super Bowl against Kansas City could be his final game as an Eagle. But he’s not the only veteran Eagle and Super Bowl champion with a murky future. Kelce, Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham are the lone holdovers from former coach Andy Reid’s last season with the Eagles in 2012. There’s a chance none of the three will be back for the 2023 season.\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n“I know them personally and they are tough guys, tough-minded,” Reid said. “They’re good leaders, fun to be around, and they’re good football players. Each one has their own characteristic, but in general I’d tell you that about all of them, great team guys.\"\n\nLane Johnson completes the four veteran anchors and was a rookie in former coach Chip Kelly’s first season in 2013.\n\nThe tenured stars — the Core Four — have won a Super Bowl under former coach Doug Pederson and won just four games in 2020. They’ve been hurt and set records. They’ve also raised the standard on what it means to be an Eagle. The best way to do that is go out and win the big one in style.\n\n“Since the day I got here, that’s all they talk about,” defensive tackle Javon Hargrave said. “Tell me how they feel when they went to the Super Bowl and all the memories they had. It’s pretty cool to have people who have done it before.”\n\nHargrave’s nod to the veterans was interrupted when Graham pulled on his gaudy Super Bowl jacket — with tags dangling from the sleeve — at the neighboring locker. All they need is a new ring to complete the ensemble.\n\nIf they beat the Chiefs, some might go out in Philly on top.\n\nThis is no ordinary game for Kelce. On the Kansas City side, there’s Reid, the coach who drafted him. Also over there is his brother, tight end Travis Kelce, marking the first time siblings will face off in the Super Bowl. One more thing, Kelce’s wife Kylie is pregnant and the couple is bringing their ob-gyn to Arizona just in case.\n\nKelce has been as durable as they come, with the Super Bowl putting him at 149 consecutive games.\n\n“He’s out there at practice every day limping around and giving his all to the team,” tight end Dallas Goedert said.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the foursome’s finer moments:\n\n_____\n\nJason Kelce. Age 35. Center. Sixth-round pick, 2011. Five-time first-team All-Pro.\n\nThe burly, bushy-haired Bird has been a stalwart of the offensive line since he was drafted and as an Iron Man after he missed most of the 2012 season with a partially torn MCL and torn ACL. He’s in the last season of his contract.\n\nHe’s a fan favorite and has done it all outside the football field, such as singing the national anthem at a 76ers game, partying with the Phanatic and pounding a beer to a roaring ovation at a Phillies postseason game.\n\nBut the moment that endeared him for life to the Philly faithful came at the 2018 Super Bowl parade when he dressed as one of Philadelphia’s famed Mummer’s and the ultimate underdog delivered a fiery, profane speech that whipped the crowd into a frenzy.\n\n“No one likes us! No one likes us! No one likes us! We don’t care,” Kelce exclaimed. “We’re from Philly! (Expletive) Philly. No one likes us! We don’t care!”\n\n___\n\nBrandon Graham. Age 34. Defensive end. First-round pick. 2010. 2020 Pro Bowl.\n\nThe most famous moment in Eagles history is the trick play that saw QB Nick Foles catch a touchdown to lead them past the New England Patriots for the franchise’s first Super Bowl victory. Right behind it? Graham’s strip-sack of Tom Brady in the same game with 2:21 left in the fourth quarter. Derek Barnett recovered and the Eagles hung on to win 41-33.\n\nHe missed most of last season with a torn Achilles but came back to post a career-high 11 sacks. Graham said he’s not retiring and was excited about testing free-agency for the first time in his career.\n\n“I know I’m not the guy I was early on,” he said. “I do feel like I’m still pass-rushing the same. I’m able to be dominant in the run game. I’m enjoying being the leader for the guys.”\n\n___\n\nLane Johnson. Age 32. Right tackle. First-round pick. 2013. Two-time first-team All-Pro.\n\nJohnson, signed through 2025, bypassed surgery late in the season and has played through the postseason with a torn adductor in his groin. He did not allow a sack all season. But Johnson has received kudos for his openness in dealing with his mental health. Johnson took a leave during the 2021 season as he battled anxiety and depression and has since shared his story at depression treatment clinics in the area.\n\n“I felt the shame, I felt like it was a crutch,” Johnson said last year.\n\n___\n\nFletcher Cox. Age 32. Defensive tackle. First-round pick 2012. First-team All-Pro 2018.\n\nCox added seven sacks this season to give him 65 in his career. Cox was briefly released last season before signing a new deal for essentially one season. He may not be back in Philly next season but he’s not calling it quits.\n\n“I’m still playing at a high level,” Cox said. “That hasn’t crossed my mind once, at all.”\n\n___\n\nAP Super Bowl coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/super-bowl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2023/02/14/7-critical-eagles-offseason-jason-kelce-retire-jalen-hurts-coach-bradberry-super-bowl-chiefs/69897759007/", "title": "Jalen Hurts reacts to Eagles losing top 2 assistant coaches; 7 critical ...", "text": "GLENDALE, Ariz. − There is little time to relax. The Eagles' offseason began Monday, just hours after their 38-35 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nThat was evident Tuesday morning when the Indianapolis Colts announced they're hiring Eagles offensive coordinator Shane Steichen to be their next head coach.\n\nA few hours later, the NFL Network reported Tuesday that Eagles defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon and the Arizona Cardinals are finalizing details to make him their new head coach.\n\nObviously, those two will have to be replaced. And over the next four weeks, Eagles general manager Howie Roseman will have to make some critical decisions that could determine if the Eagles have a chance to return to the Super Bowl next season.\n\nHere, then, are seven offseason questions facing the Eagles, beginning with the coaching staff:\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\n1. How will Eagles replace top 2 assistants?\n\nEagles coach Nick Sirianni said last month that he was already preparing for the possibility that his two coordinators could leave.\n\nBoth Steichen and Gannon have been with Sirianni for the past two seasons. Steichen took over play-calling duties midway through last season. The Eagles have gone 23-8 since, including playoffs while quarterback Jalen Hurts has blossomed into an MVP finalist.\n\nDespite the Super Bowl, the Eagles had the No. 2 defense in the NFL this season under Gannon, falling two sacks short of the NFL record set by the 1984 Chicago Bears. They had the NFL's top-ranked pass defense.\n\nHurts has said often that the continuity on the coaching staff was critical to his success this season, but he also knows the impact of winning.\n\n\"It’s a good problem to have,\" Hurts said Tuesday. \"I know I’ve spoken on that a lot, and it’s been a huge reality for me. I give a lot of credit to Coach Steichen for what he’s been for me the last two years, the things that he’s taught me, what he’s been for me and this team − as a motivator, as a leader, as a coach, as an OC.\n\n\"I think he’s meant the world to us. Like I said, you want to give other people opportunities to chase their dreams. That’s been something he’s been able to do, and I know he’s going to do a great job in Indianapolis.\"\n\nHURTS SHINES:Jalen Hurts changed Eagles forever. Only this can keep him from another Super Bowl chance\n\nHEARTBREAKER:Eagles let Super Bowl 57 lead slip away in devastating 38-35 loss to Chiefs\n\nThere is a way for Hurts and the Eagles to have that continuity even with Steichen and Gannon leaving.\n\nOn offense, that would mean having quarterbacks coach Brian Johnson promoted to offensive coordinator to replace Steichen. Johnson, who's 35, has known Hurts since Hurts was 4 years old. That was when Johnson was in high school, playing for Hurts' father, Averion.\n\nOn defense, the likely in-house candidate is defensive backs coach Dennard Wilson.\n\nIf the Eagles go that route, that will lead to openings at their positions that the Eagles will have to fill. And it's likely that Steichen and Gannon will take a few assistants as well, creating even more openings.\n\n2. Is Jason Kelce retiring?\n\nKelce, the Eagles' perennial All-Pro center, has contemplated retirement in each of the last four offseasons. He will consider it again. But this time, he might actually do it.\n\nAfter all, Kelce made it back to the Super Bowl, and he got to do it by going against his brother, Travis. The Eagles also drafted Kelce's replacement in Cam Jurgens last spring, with Kelce's endorsement.\n\nOn a personal level, Kelce is 35 years old. He has two young daughters, and his wife, Kylie, is due any day now with their third.\n\nHOLDING CALL:James Bradberry says he held JuJu Smith-Schuster in Super Bowl but was hoping for no call\n\nCRYING MAN:Tears stream down Eagles coach Nick Sirianni's face during Super Bowl national anthem\n\nNaturally, Kelce was asked after the game if he's returning for a 13th season.\n\n\"I’m not saying that yet. We’ll see,\" he said.\n\nBut his decision could lead to a chain reaction on the offensive line.\n\nIf Kelce returns, it's likely that right guard Isaac Seumalo, who's eligible for free agency, won't. So Jurgens would then replace Seumalo. If Kelce retires, then Jurgens would take over at center.\n\n3. Jalen Hurts' new contract\n\nWe all know it's coming. Hurts is entering the final year of his rookie contract. For 2023, that means he will count just $1.9 million against the salary cap.\n\nBut it's very likely that the Eagles will try hard to sign Hurts to a contract extension worth somewhere in the $50 million per year range. Hurts is only 24 years old, and he proved over and over again this season that he is the present and future of the franchise.\n\nBy signing Hurts this offseason, the Eagles can spread out the money to count more against the cap this season, while not preventing the Eagles from having salary cap space to make decisions about their own free agents, or even chase free agents from other teams.\n\n4. Is Miles Sanders gone?\n\nBy all accounts, Sanders had a career year with 1,269 yards rushing. But Sanders will be a free agent, and it sure seems like the Eagles are ready to move on.\n\nSanders had an awful game Sunday, with seven carries for 16 yards. He lost a yard on the first play of the game and injured his wrist as he fumbled the ball out of bounds. Sanders was seen in the locker room afterward with a splint on his wrist.\n\nSanders' production had diminished during the final games of the regular season and in the playoffs. He hasn't had 100 yards or more in a game since Dec. 11 against the Giants, a span of eight games.\n\nDuring that time, Kenny Gainwell and Boston Scott have each seen more touches. It should be noted that neither Gainwell (21 yards on seven carries) nor Scott (8 yards on three) played well against the Chiefs.\n\nBut the Eagles do have four picks in the first three rounds of the draft, and it's quite possible they could take a running back there rather than paying to keep Sanders.\n\n5. James Bradberry or Chauncey Gardner-Johnson?\n\nIt could very well come down to which defensive back the Eagles can afford to keep.\n\nLast spring, Bradberry had little choice but to accept a one-year, prove-it-type deal from the Eagles after the Giants released him. He'll want to get paid after being selected for the Pro Bowl.\n\nSo will Gardner-Johnson, who is 25 years old and hitting free agency for the first time. He tied for the NFL lead in interceptions with six despite missing five games with a lacerated kidney.\n\nIt's hard to fathom the Eagles signing both to long-term deals averaging more than $10 million per season.\n\n\"For the most part, I’m just trying to be in the moment, not really trying to think about free agency right now,\" Bradberry said. \"I’m just sad that we lost.\"\n\n6. A reunion with Fletch and BG?\n\nDefensive linemen Fletcher Cox and Brandon Graham are the longest-tenured Eagles on defense.\n\nIf they want to finish their careers as Eagles, they will likely have to take less money to return. Cox already did this last year when the Eagles released him, then signed him three days later, to reduce the salary cap hit.\n\nWill Cox want to do it again? Or Graham?\n\nEither way, the Eagles will have to bolster their defensive line in the draft, very likely with their first of two first-round picks at No. 10.\n\n7. Are Jordan Davis, Nakobe Dean ready to play?\n\nAccording to KC Sports Net, the Eagles had the fewest snaps among the rookie class during the season. The Chiefs, meanwhile, ranked seventh, and the six teams above the Chiefs all missed the playoffs.\n\nIn the Super Bowl, first-round pick Jordan Davis, a defensive tackle, played 10 snaps, or 18%. Jurgens didn't play at all. And third-round pick Nakobe Dean, a linebacker, played only on special teams.\n\nThat will change next season.

And the good vibes continued in the best actor category, where Brendan Fraser completed a great awards-season comeback story and won for \"The Whale.\"\n\nHere are all the winners and highlights from the main Oscar ceremony, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel:\n\nOscars winners:See who took home gold at Academy Awards\n\nWho made Oscars history in 2023? See the many 'firsts' from Michelle Yeoh, 'Naatu Naatu,' more\n\n'Everything Everywhere All at Once' wins the Oscars' top prize, best picture\n\n\"We've said enough tonight. You inspire me,\" says director Daniel Kwan, accepting best picture for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\"\n\nMichelle Yeoh takes best actress for 'Everything Everywhere'\n\nThe longtime action-movie icon finally gets her Oscar and becomes the first Asian woman to win the category. \"For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, let this be a beacon of hope and possibilities. This is proof dreams come true. And ladies, don't let anyone ever tell you you are past your prime,\" Michelle Yeoh says, winning best actress for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" She dedicates the win to her 84-year-old mom and promised to bring Oscar \"home to you and my extended family in Hong Kong where I started in my career. Thank you to the Academy, this is history in the making.\"\n\n'A beacon of hope and possibilities':Michelle Yeoh wins best actress, making Oscars history\n\n'The Whale' comeback kid Brendan Fraser wins best actor\n\nBrendan Fraser shakes fellow nominee Colin Farrell's hand before accepting the best actor honor for \"The Whale.\" \"So this is what the multiverse looks like!\" Fraser says, out of breath with excitement. \"I just want to say thank you for this acknowledgement. It's like I've been on a diving expedition,\" he adds, shouting out his kids and director Darren Aronofsky for \"throwing me a creative lifeline.\"\n\nBrendan Fraser:'The Whale' star wins best actor Academy Award and proves nice guys can finish first\n\n'Everything Everywhere' snags Oscars for film editing, directing\n\n\"This is too much. This is my second film, y'all. This is crazy,\" Paul Rogers says, accepting the Oscar for best film editing for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" Then the best picture frontrunner runs its tally to five awards when Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert take best directing. \"Our fellow nominees, you guys are our heroes, This is weird,\" Scheinert says. He thanks all the \"mommies\" in the house and his parents \"for not squashing my creativity when I was making really disturbing horror films or really perverted comedy films, or dressing in drag as a kid, which is a threat to nobody\" – a shot seemingly at anti-drag legislation popping up around the country.:\n\nAdds Kwan: \"There is greatness in every single person. You have a genius in you that is waiting to be unlocked.\"\n\n'Top Gun' takes best sound, 'RRR' gets original song Oscar for 'Naatu Naatu'\n\nSomewhere, Tom Cruise is smiling. \"Top Gun: Maverick\" finally wins an Oscar, for best sound. And the Academy Award for best original song goes to \"RRR\" dance number \"Naatu Naatu.\" \"I grew up listening to The Carpenters and here I am with the Oscars,\" says composer M.M. Keeravani, doing his own spin on The Carpenters' \"Top of the World.\" John Travolta comes out and chokes up when introducing Lenny Kravitz, who sings \"Calling All Angels\" during the \"In Memoriam\" segment (which includes Travolta's \"Grease\" co-star Olivia Newton-John).\n\nBrutally honest rankings:All the Oscars song performances, from ‘Naatu Naatu’ to Lady Gaga\n\n'Everything Everywhere,' 'Women Talking' win screenplay Oscars\n\n\"Everything Everywhere\" filmmaker Daniel Scheinert thanks his teachers for helping him be \"less of a butthead\" when accepting the original screenplay Oscar alongside partner Daniel Kwan, who admits \"my imposter syndrome is at an all-time high.\" And when accepting the adapted screenplay honor, \"Women Talking\" director Sarah Polley slyly shouts out the Academy for \"not being offended by the words 'Women' and 'Talking' so close together.\"\n\n'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' presents Chadwick Boseman tribute, Rihanna number\n\n\"Wakanda Forever\" star Danai Gurira arrives on stage to pay tribute to late \"Black Panther\" actor Chadwick Boseman, saying in Wakandan: \"Thank you, king.\" Gurira then introduces Rihanna, who sings her nominated tune \"Lift Me Up\" and receives a standing ovation.\n\n'Lift Me Up':Rihanna soars at 2023 Oscars with powerful first performance of song\n\n'Avatar: The Way of Water' gets the gold for visual effects\n\nElizabeth Banks and the Cocaine Bear come out to present the award for visual effects. The Oscar goes to \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" which makes sense because the Na'vi main characters are all digital. Afterward, Jimmy Kimmel is ready with an A-plus dad joke: \"The afterparty is at CGI Friday's.\"\n\n'All Quiet on the Western Front' wins two more technical honors\n\nThe Netflix war movie is starting to gain some momentum, as \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" runs over the likes of \"Babylon,\" \"The Fabelmans\" and other Oscar favorites for best production design and score.\n\nLady Gaga sings a raw, rousing version of 'Top Gun' song 'Hold My Hand'\n\n\"It's deeply personal for me and we all need a lot of love to walk through this life. And we all need a hero sometimes. You might find that you can be your own hero, even if you feel broken inside,\" Lady Gaga says before performing her nominated song \"Hold My Hand\" (from \"Top Gun: Maverick\") with stripped-down piano, guitar, bass and drums.\n\nOscars best-dressed:Jaw-dropping looks from Lady Gaga, Michelle Yeoh, Angela Bassett\n\n'Elephant Whisperers' and 'The Boy, the Mole' conquer shorts categories\n\n\"The Elephant Whisperers,\" about an Indian couple that cares for an orphaned baby elephant, wins for best documentary short. And animated short goes to \"The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse,\" based on Charlie Mackesy's book.\n\n'All Quiet on the Western Front' wins best international film\n\nThis isn't a surprise: After ruling the BAFTAs (and with Indian action epic \"RRR\" not in its category), \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" takes the international film Oscar, its second honor of the night. \"This means so much to us,\" says director Edward Berger. He also thanks star Felix Kammerer: \"Without you, none of us would be here.\"\n\n'Wakanda Forever' nabs costume design honor\n\n\"Nice to see you again,\" Ruth Carter says, winning costume design for \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" – the same honor she took home for 2018's original \"Panther.\" The first Black woman to win two Oscars, Carter dedicates the award to her mom, who recently died at age 101, and thanks director Ryan Coogler and producer Nate Moore: \"We are reshaping how culture is represented.\" if that wasn't exciting enough, the original song performance of \"RRR\" tune \"Naatu Naatu\" delivers a ton of rousing dance moves that get the Oscar crowd going.\n\nBrendan Fraser's 'The Whale' wins for best makeup and hairstyling\n\nDigital and physical prosthetics were used to transform Brendan Fraser into the 600-pound main character of \"The Whale,\" and it pays off with an Oscar for makeup. Fraser is one of the first to get on his feet and excitedly cheer the win.\n\nBest cinematography Oscar goes to 'All Quiet on the Western Front'\n\nNetflix's acclaimed German war drama earns its first technical honor of the night. \"My fellow nominees, your work is just outstanding and inspiring,\" says James Friend, who wins best cinematography for \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Donnie Yen arrives on stage afterward to introduce the next original song nominee: \"Everything Everywhere\" star Stephanie Hsu, Son Lux and David Byrne doing a weird, ethereal performance of \"This Is a Life.\"\n\n'Navalny' is named best documentary\n\nDirector Daniel Roher's film about Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny wins the Oscar for best documentary. \"We must not be afraid to oppose dictators,\" says Roher, while Navalny's wife Yulia addresses her husband, currently being held in solitary confinement in Russia: \"I'm dreaming of the day you will be free and our country will be free.\" And the award for live-action short goes to \"The Irish Goodbye.\"\n\nJamie Lee Curtis wins her first Oscar, for supporting actress in 'Everything Everywhere'\n\n\"Woo-hoo,\" Jamie Lee Curtis exclaims, hugging Ariana DeBose and taking her supporting actress trophy for \"Everything Everywhere.\" \"I know it looks like I'm standing up here by myself but I am hundreds of people,\" Curtis says, shouting out her directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, \"my bae\" Michelle Yeoh, all her horror folks and her late Hollywood parents, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh. \"We all just won an Oscar together.\" She leaves the stage and then Sofia Carson and Diane Warren arrive with a choir to perform their original song nominee, \"Applause\" from \"Tell It Like a Woman.\"\n\nJamie Lee Curtis:First-time winner thanks castmates, late parents in touching Oscars speech\n\nKe Huy Quan takes best supporting actor for 'Everything Everywhere'\n\nAfter hugging co-star Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan goes to the stage to take his supporting actor trophy for \"Everything Everywhere\" and immediately starts crying. \"My mom is 84 years old and she's at home watching. Mom, I just won an Oscar!\" he says through tears. He tells how his journey started on a boat, involved spending a year in a refugee camp and \"somehow ended up on the Oscar stage. This is the American dream.\" He concludes by saying that \"dreams are something you have to believe in. I almost gave up on mine. Everyone out there, keep your dreams alive.\"\n\n'This is the American dream':Read Ke Huy Quan's emotional Oscars acceptance speech\n\nGuillermo del Toro's 'Pinocchio' wins best animated feature\n\nEmily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson arrive on stage to give out the first award of the night: best animated feature. And the winner is ... director Guillermo del Toro's Netflix stop-motion feature \"Pinocchio\"! \"Animation is cinema, animation is not a genre. Animation is ready to be taken to the next step. Please help us keep animation in the conversation,\" del Toro says, tearing up when thanking his parents. According to Netflix, del Toro becomes the first person to win best picture, best director and best animated feature Oscars.\n\n2023 Oscars:Why Cate Blanchett, Guillermo del Toro and more celebs wore blue ribbons\n\nJimmy Kimmel gets the 'Top Gun' treatment to begin the show\n\nJimmy Kimmel starts the show by being \"ejected\" out of a fighter jet by Tom Cruise and parachutes onto the Dolby Theatre stage. \"Give me a second to adjust my Danger Zone here. My Banshees are caught in my Inisherin,\" he jokes. Kimmel shouts out audiences returning to the theater to see movies and is also glad to see Nicole Kidman out of that \"abandoned AMC, where she has been held captive for two whole years now.\"\n\nThe host points out first-time nominees Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan, as well as Brendan Fraser: \"Two guys from 'Encino Man' are nominated for Oscar.\" Kimmel calls Steven Spielberg and Seth Rogen \"the Joe and Hunter Biden of Hollywood\" and can't believe Spielberg was sober doing \"E.T.\" \"You were high as a bike when you made that movie,\" Kimmel cracks. He also gives props to John Williams being a nominee at 91 – \"He's still scoring – if you know what I mean\" – and mentions the absence of Cruise and James Cameron: \"Two guys who insisted we go to the theater didn't come to the theater.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel:Angry actors would have to 'battle' Michelle Yeoh to slap him at Oscars\n\nFor Angela Bassett, the Oscars are all about 'the spirit of never giving up'\n\nSupporting actress contender Angela Bassett, the first actor from a Marvel superhero movie to garner a nod, told USA TODAY that her husband Courtney B. Vance has been an essential support system this Oscar season, accompanying her to awards shows and filming her acceptance speeches on his smartphone. \"He was supportive before the whirlwind,\" says the \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" star. \"He always trusted and believed that a nomination like this might one day happen for me.\"\n\nIn addition to being the subject of Ariana DeBose's viral rap, Bassett has loved going through the awards process with her fellow thespians: \"When I think of my girl Michelle Yeoh and it being her first nomination, it really is about the spirit of never giving up.\"\n\nA Brendan Fraser win would complete an epic Oscar comeback story\n\nThe best actor race seems to be down to Austin Butler, Colin Farrell and Brendan Fraser, though a win by the latter would finish one of this year's most noteworthy comebacks. After becoming a major Hollywood star in the 1990s, Fraser has been honest about his career hardships, including being sexually assaulted, and won accolades for his role in \"The Whale.\"\n\nIn an emotional Screen Actor Guild speech, Fraser shouted out to other actors who've weathered struggles: \"I know how you feel. But believe me, if you just stay in there and you put one foot in front of the other, you'll get to where you need to go.\"\n\nThe new Oscar best picture winner will join Hollywood's most hallowed hall\n\n\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is in the pole position to win best picture over \"The Banshees of Inisherin,\" \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" \"The Fabelmans\" and \"Elvis,\" among others.\n\nThe victor will join a long list filled with some of the greatest movies ever (and a few that don't quite fit that bill). We watched all 94 so far and ranked them, from the first winner – the 1927 silent war drama \"Wings,\" which holds up well! – to the feel-good 2022 Oscar champ \"CODA.\"\n\nGet a video tour of the ultra-exclusive green room at the Oscars\n\nUSA TODAY's Ralphie Aversa has been in LA all week for events leading up to the Academy Awards, and one of them was getting a look at the ultra-exclusive, swanky green room backstage at the Oscars. He was able to do a fun video tour for our readers but come Sunday night at the Dolby Theatre, no cameras will be allowed in – only performers, presenters and winners will be able to enjoy the comfy furniture, floral arrangements and food by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.\n\nMichelle Yeoh, Colin Farrell could be first-time Academy Award winners\n\nSixteen of the 20 acting contenders at Sunday's Oscars are first-time , including \"Everything Everywhere\" favorites Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, as well as best actor candidates Brendan Fraser, Colin Farrell and Austin Butler. The four returnees: Two-time winner Cate Blanchett (\"Tár\"), Angela Bassett (\"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\"), Michelle Williams (\"The Fabelmans\") and Judd Hirsch (\"The Fabelmans\"), who last received an Oscar nod for 1980's \"Ordinary People.\"\n\nBut the list of thespians who've never won an Academy Award is a pretty star-studded affair overall, including Scarlett Johansson, Antonio Banderas, Glenn Close, Willem Dafoe, Amy Adams, Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr.\n\nSupporting actor is Ke Huy Quan's to lose\n\n\"Everything Everywhere\" star Ke Huy Quan has dominated the competition and rolled through awards season. But his quest for a supporting actor victory has also been a Cinderella story for the actor, who was a child star in the 1980s with roles in \"The Goonies\" and \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" and then stepped away from Hollywood because of a lack of meaty roles for Asian actors.\n\n\"I'm grateful the landscape has changed, there’s a lot more progress now,\" Quan said backstage after winning at the Golden Globes. He's also made sure to have a bunch of fun heading to Oscar night, posting tons of selfies with peers on his Instagram account.\n\nBest supporting actress is a toss-up\n\nAs far as Oscar predictions go, most of the acting categories are fairly straightforward with a favorite moving out in front. Not so much with supporting actress, which can go a few different ways. \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" star Angela Bassett – the first actor to be nominated for a Marvel movie – had the early momentum with wins out of the Golden Globes and Critics Choice, but Jamie Lee Curtis of \"Everything Everywhere\" took an important Screen Actors Guild honor while \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" actress Kerry Condon picked up the supporting trophy at the British Academy Film Awards.\n\nGiven SAG and the \"Everything\" goodwill, Curtis probably has the best chance over Bassett, though it's possible the two beloved Hollywood types cancel each other out and Condon sneaks by for a victory.\n\nGood news: Lady Gaga will be performing 'Hold My Hand' after all!\n\nA bevy of original song contenders are slated for prime-time performances. Rihanna will sing \"Lift Me Up\" from \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" Sofia Carson and songwriter Diane Warren are slated to perform \"Applause\" from \"Tell It Like A Woman,\" Talking Heads frontman David Byrne teams with \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" supporting actress nominee Stephanie Hsu and music trio Son Lux for “This Is A Life,\" and Indian singers Rahul Sipligunj and Kaala Bhairava will perform the \"RRR\" song-and-dance number – and the frontrunner in the category – \"Naatu Naatu.\"\n\nAnd while Oscar producers previously said she wouldn't perform, Lady Gaga is now slated to sing “Hold My Hand” from \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" a person familiar with the production but not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY. (Fun fact: Gaga is shooting \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" with Joaquin Phoenix, who won best actor for the first \"Joker\" movie.)\n\nGlenn Close tests positive for COVID-19, won't be among Oscar presenters\n\nGlenn Close was expected to be among the dozens of A-list stars on tap to hand out trophies and appear on the telecast Sunday but has tested positive for COVID-19. A representative for the actress told The Associated Press she is isolating and resting.\n\nAriana DeBose, Troy Kotsur, Halle Berry, Nicole Kidman and Jessica Chastain are among the previous Oscar winners scheduled to be presenters. Also on the list is a raft of other high-profile names like Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Melissa McCarthy, Janelle Monáe, Zoe Saldaña and Harrison Ford.\n\nJust don't expect an appearance from Will Smith. Smith, who won best actor last year for \"King Richard\" and would traditionally present the award for best actress this year, was banned from Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences events for 10 years after he slapped Oscar presenter Chris Rock for making a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.\n\nRed carpet coverage is coming for the fashionistas\n\nAll the big stars will be hitting the \"champagne carpet\" and wearing their Sunday best. E!'s \"Live From the Red Carpet\" kicks off at 5 p.m. EDT/2 p.m. PDT while ABC starts its pre-show coverage at 6:30 EDT/3:30 PDT.

Its other trophies included adapted screenplay, cinematography, best score, best sound and best film not in English.\n\nAustin Butler was a surprise best actor winner for \"Elvis.\" Baz Lurhmann's flamboyant musical also won trophies for casting, costume design and hair and makeup.

It has British funding, and McDonagh was born in Britain to Irish parents.\n\n\"Banshees\" also won for McDonagh's original screenplay, and awards for Kerry Condon as best supporting actress and Barry Keoghan for best supporting actor.\n\nThe prizes — officially the EE BAFTA Film Awards — are Britain's equivalent of Hollywood's Academy Awards and will be watched closely for hints of who may win at the Oscars on March 12.\n\nMadcap metaverse romp \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" the Academy Awards front-runner, – was the night's big loser, winning just one prize from its 10 BAFTA nominations, for editing.\n\nActor Richard E. Grant was a suave and self-deprecating host — with support from TV presenter Alison Hammond — for the ceremony at London's Royal Festival Hall, where the U.K's movie academy heralded its strides to become more diverse but said there was more to be done.\n\nFact checking the 'Elvis' movie:Did he really fire Colonel Tom Parker onstage in Las Vegas?\n\nGrant joked in his opening monologue about the infamous altercation between Will Smith and Chris Rock at last year's Oscars. \"Nobody on my watch gets slapped tonight,\" he said. \"Except on the back.\"\n\nGuests and presenters walking the red carpet on the south bank of the River Thames included Colin Farrell, Ana de Armas, Eddie Redmayne, Brian Cox, Florence Pugh, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Cynthia Erivo, Julianne Moore and Lily James.\n\nHeir to the throne Prince William, who is president of Britain's film and television academy, was in the audience alongside his wife, Kate. William wore a tuxedo with black velvet jacket, while Kate dressed in a floor-length Alexander McQueen dress that she also wore to the 2019 BAFTAs.\n\nHelen Mirren paid tribute to William's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who died in September. Mirren, who portrayed the late monarch onscreen in \"The Queen\" and onstage in \"The Audience,\" called Elizabeth \"the nation's leading lady.\"\n\nBritain's film academy introduced changes to increase the awards' diversity in 2020, when no women were nominated as best director for the seventh year running and all 20 nominees in the lead and supporting performer categories were white.\n\nThis year there were 11 female directors up for awards across all categories, including documentary and animated films. But just one of the main best-director nominees was female: Gina Prince-Bythewood for \"The Woman King.\"\n\n'The Woman King,'a real-life epic, embodies the fight in Viola Davis and her fellow stars\n\nBAFTA chair Krishnendu Majumdar said the academy's soul-searching had been \"a necessary and humbling process.\" He said the \"vital work of levelling the playing field\" would continue.\n\n\"West Side Story\" star Ariana DeBose opened the show by performing \"Sisters are Doin' it for Themselves,\" with an added rap shoutout to some of the nominated women, including Michelle Yeoh, Cate Blanchett and Viola Davis.\n\nBlanchett said it had been \"an extraordinary year for female performers. To be counted among them is really special.\"\n\nIt was a strong year for Irish actors at the BAFTAs, with Deryl McCormack up for the BAFTA Rising Star award — though he lost out to Emma Mackey – and Condon, Keoghan, Farrell and Brendan Gleeson all getting acting nominations for \"Banshees.\"\n\nMcCormack hailed the event as \"the Irish BAFTAs.\" \"It is a small country, but to see the talent that comes out of it is quite amazing,\" he said.\n\nThree-time Oscar winner Sandy Powell became the first costume designer to be awarded the academy's top honor, the BAFTA fellowship.\n\nThe harsh world outside showbiz intruded on the awards when Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev, who works for investigative website Bellingcat, said he was now allowed to attend the awards because of a risk to public security. He features in \"Navalny,\" a film about jailed Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny that won the best documentary BAFTA.\n\n\"Navalny\" producer Odessa Rae dedicated the award to Grozev, \"our Bulgarian nerd with a laptop, who could not be with us tonight because his life is under threat by the Russian government and Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nJamie Lee Curtis, a supporting actress nominee for \"Everything Everywhere,\" said the chance awards season provides to celebrate cinema was more important than who wins.\n\n\"It's a moment of celebration in the midst of everything,\" Curtis told The Associated Press on the red carpet. \"It's hard out there.

'All Quiet on the ...", "text": "Remaking an Oscar-winning movie is a dicey proposition. Why mess with success?\n\nBut when German director Edward Berger decided to redo Lewis Milestone’s 1930 epic “All Quiet on the Western Front” for Netflix (streaming now), he was on a mission to tell the futile (and fatal) tale of a 17-year-old World War I German conscript from a German point of view.\n\nThat risky mission has been rewarded with seven British Academy Film Awards (out of 14 nominations), including best film, director and adapted screenplay. That makes the German-language film even more of a favorite for the upcoming Oscars, where \"All Quiet\" has nine nominations, including best picture and adapted screenplay.\n\nBerger's reasons for remaking the movie were simple. As he saw it, whenever American or British directors make war movies, it is impossible to avoid letting well-earned heroism seep into such efforts, befitting their victors' point of view.\n\nBAFTA Awards: 'All Quiet on the Western Front' sweeps with 7 wins, including best picture\n\nFrom 'Everything Everywhere' to 'Elvis':Here's where to stream these 15 Oscar-nominated movies now\n\nAs a result, Berger wanted to anchor his \"All Quiet\" to the national yoke of loss and shame that burdens many Germans.\n\n“When it comes to both world wars, as a German there is nothing to be proud of in that part of history. There’s only guilt, terror, horror and a deep sense of responsibility to the past,” says Berger. “That’s in me. That’s in my kids.”\n\nThe result is possibly one of the most searing and soul-crushing depictions of warfare that has ever muddied the screen. It has the staggering battle sequences of “Saving Private Ryan,” the gruesome trench warfare of “1917” and the exploration of quieter moments in soldiers' lives seen in \"Apocalypse Now.”\n\nDespite their nearly 100-year gap, both movie versions of Erich Maria Remarque’s enduring 1929 novel are echoes of each other, largely because of their reliance on the book.\n\nYoung men are lured into battle by passionate speeches; the brutal reality of battle sinks in quickly as they scrounge for food and watch each other die; Paul, the protagonist played by a haunting Felix Kammerer, kills a Frenchman in hand-to hand combat and immediately regrets it; and in the end, there is only ignominious defeat.\n\nBut Berger's version reaches a new level of poignancy and even urgency given the tenor of the times.\n\nIt does so first by focusing on the way in which young German boys were turned into cannon fodder by adults spouting nationalist dogma, and secondly by spotlighting how Germany’s capitulation at the end of World War I – and the sense of shame in defeat stoked by politicians – gave rise years later to Nazism and ultimately World War II.\n\nIn that, says Berger, is a lesson for us all.\n\nKen Burns tackles U.S. role in Holocaust:'I won’t work on a more important film than this'\n\n“I’m sensitive to nationalist movements, so with the rise of Trump and Brexit and the far right in Hungary and Italy, it’s important to remember that 100 years ago, this all led us to a catastrophe,” he says.\n\nSpecifically, the armistice signed between Germany and France to end World War I immediately generated feelings of shame and anger among German army officers, sentiments that would fester into full-blown revenge in the form of Hitler's populist rise.\n\nAs a result, Berger's \"All Quiet\" notably departs from the book and the 1930 film to include many scenes showing German politicians deciding to surrender while their military counterparts fume. The director is hopeful yet realistic about whether his central message will be received.\n\n\"Whether the anti-war sentiment of the movie lands, that's up to the viewers to decide,\" he says.\n\nTwo Brits from LA were instrumental in bringing Netflix's 'All Quiet on the Western Front' to life\n\nThe original “All Quiet” holds up remarkably well, with its deft camerawork, solid performances and stirring-for-its time visuals. The film won two Oscars, for best picture and best director.\n\nBut Berger was able to bring a new level of both lyricism and terror to his version that could only be delivered by modern technology – and a healthy (though undisclosed) Netflix budget.\n\n“The budget was likely less than what you think it was,” says Berger with a laugh. “But it was all about doing what we could to put the camera right there next to Paul as much as we could. In the mud. In the trenches. With death.”\n\nBerger’s skill aside, this “All Quiet” would never have made it to the screen if it weren't for Los Angeles-based British writing and producing team of Ian Stokell and Lesley Paterson, who bought the rights to the novel in 2006 and have waited 16 years to bring it to the screen.\n\n“The timing had to be right to make this, and finally it was. We had a German director to do this story justice and a streamer (Netflix) that was willing to back it financially,” says Paterson, who adds that the pandemic helped push foreign moviemaking to the forefront as evidenced by the 2020 Oscar win for South Korea’s “Parasite.”\n\nAlthough the film is in German with subtitles, the screenwriters, who share that credit with Berger, expressed no concern that this will put off American viewers.\n\n“This novel is still taught in American schools, and people are fine with subtitles when they want to see something good,” says Paterson.\n\nStokell says that beyond any particularly powerful dialogue, he hopes that what really hits home is “that sense of betrayal of these young kids by those in power, something you can see happening right now in terms of what Russian leaders are telling the soldiers heading off to Ukraine.”\n\nThings were never quiet on the Western front, where 3 million died\n\nThe new movie offers a particularly powerful moment that Paterson came up with while training for yet another triathlon (she’s a multiple world champion in the Xterra series). In the brief but powerful sequence, we see rows and rows of women wordlessly washing a mountain of bloody uniforms only to hand them back to a new group of eager recruits.\n\nThe western front – where Germany was hoping to break through in order to conquer France – was never quiet. It also never moved much, as neither side gained significant ground. Over multiple years, some 3 million young men died there.\n\nKammerer says as an Austrian he feels “especially responsible for retelling that grim part of history,” given that Austria’s quick envelopment into the Third Reich help set the stage for more takeovers to come.\n\n“My hope is that especially younger viewers are drawn into the narrative of this absurd and brutal part of our history, and can start thinking about violence, war and humankind in different ways, helping them reimagine a world in which the horrors of war could become a bitter relic of the past,” he says.\n\n“But first,” he adds, \"we have to see the atrocities before we can overcome them.”\n\nBerger’s version of “All Quiet on the Western Front” offers just such a front row seat, conjuring up senseless horrors one would only want to experience at the movies.\n\nOscar nominations 2023: 'Everything Everywhere' leads with 11, Jamie Lee Curtis gets first nod\n\nSnubbed by the Oscars!Brad Pitt, Viola Davis, Adam Sandler shut out of Academy nominations", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/01/24/where-to-watch-oscar-nominated-movies-2023/11111780002/", "title": "2023 Oscar movies: Where to stream winners like 'The Whale ...", "text": "This year's Academy Awards ceremony might be over but before you start prepping for the 96th Oscars in 2024, why not catch up on some award-worthy fare you missed (or want to see again)?\n\nFrom box-office blockbusters to film-festival favorites, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences handed out trophies to a bunch of different movies on Sunday.

See the many 'firsts' from Michelle Yeoh, 'Naatu Naatu,' more\n\n'Everything Everywhere All at Once'\n\nDon't worry about having your brain broken and just go with the wild flow of this action-packed, multiverse-hopping genre mashup that won seven Oscars including best picture, original screenplay, directing (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert), actress (Michelle Yeoh), supporting actor (Ke Huy Quan) and supporting actress (Jamie Lee Curtis). Yeoh dazzles as a laundromat owner whose tax issues get shoved aside when she gets a crash course in alternate realities (including one where she has hot dog fingers!) and has to learn from the lives of her other selves to stop a nihilistic villain.\n\nWhere to watch: Showtime, Apple TV\n\n'The Banshees of Inisherin'\n\nGetting ghosted by a friend or a loved one is a relatable bit of stress and heartbreak. Add a 1920s remote Irish island setting, toss in two of the greatest actors of their generations, and you've got a best picture nominee with something to say. Martin McDonagh's wonderfully bleak exploration of isolation, desperation and mortality lets Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson loose as ex-best pals in a sudden fiery feud, with nice supporting turns from Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan as characters caught up in their not-so-civil war.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\n‘Elvis’\n\nNot sure if everyone’s heard, but Elvis Presley was a big deal. And Baz Luhrmann’s stylish musical drama – nominated for best picture – pays tribute to the King of Rock ’n’ Roll from his early 1950s gigs to his later days as a Vegas headliner. When a burgeoning Elvis (top-notch leading man Austin Butler, who earned his first best actor nod) lays into the rockabilly tune “Baby Let’s Play House” and wiggles his hips, young women (and older ones, too) scream and swoon in preternatural delight, possessed by the power of a fledgling rock god.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\n'The Whale'\n\nBrendan Fraser took home the best actor Oscar for a career-defining, big-hearted showing in Darren Aronofsky's latest psychological drama, a soulful, intimate character study of a 600-pound writing teacher desperate to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter (Sadie Sink), who's a bit of a pill. Fraser delivers an astounding and incredibly compassionate portrayal, and the film acts as an empathy test in a supremely cynical social media landscape.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV\n\n'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever'\n\nAs Queen Ramonda, Angela Bassett was a top contender for supporting actress and also rules Wakanda in Ryan Coogler's thoughtful Marvel sequel, which won costume design for Ruth Carter and made history (she's the first Black woman to win two Oscars). After the death of King T'Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman), Ramonda and her daughter Shuri grieve their loss and face the new threat of Namor (Tenoch Huerta Mejía) and his underwater kingdom. Wakanda is filled with compelling women who come into their own in the film: They question each other, make hard decisions and wrestle with complications in ways that make them a joy to watch.\n\nWhere to watch: Disney+, Apple TV\n\n'All Quiet on the Western Front'\n\nLike its 1930 counterpart (which won a best picture Oscar), the latest adaptation of the Erich Maria Remarque novel – told from a German point of view – is harrowing and deeply effective with its anti-war message. And the Academy voters loved it, giving it four Oscars including best international film. A 17-year-old (Felix Kammerer) lies about his age to proudly go to the front lines of World War I, witnesses carnage and becomes numb to the brutality while an officer (Daniel Brühl) desperately negotiates for an armistice.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\n'The Fabelmans'\n\nSteven Spielberg's semi-autobiographical coming-of-age tale – which snagged nods for best picture, directing, actress (Michelle Williams) and supporting actor (Judd Hirsch), among others – flashes back to the 1950s and ’60s and the legendary filmmaker's childhood growing up in a Jewish family. Newcomer Gabriel LaBelle amazes as teenage Spielberg, here named Sammy Fabelman, a kid whose creative world just explodes when he gets a camera in his hands while also navigating parental drama and antisemitic bullying.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV\n\n'Top Gun: Maverick'\n\nTom Cruise is known for jumping off planes in crazy \"Mission: Impossible\" stunts but come on, he's much better in the cockpit of a fighter jet. Even though he didn't snag a best actor nomination, Cruise still oozes A-list cool as the returning flyboy from the 1986 original training a new crop of young pilots in an endlessly entertaining, nostalgic sequel that scored best picture, screenplay and original song nods – and won the best sound Oscar! – plus made a major movie star out of Glen Powell.\n\nWhere to watch: Paramount+\n\n'Tár'\n\nBest actress nominee Cate Blanchett soars in Todd Field’s classical music drama, which also scored nods for best picture, directing and original screenplay. Powered by Blanchett’s baton-wielding tour de force, the film is a modern tale about a cultural giant who uses her power in not-so-great fashion, so there are #MeToo factors at play. However, “Tár” has more of a timeless quality, playing out in the style of a Greek tragedy with the epic downfall of a woman behaving badly.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV, Peacock\n\n'Triangle of Sadness'\n\nSelf-obsessed models, Russian oligarchs, polite English arms manufacturers – everybody's sent up in Ruben Östlund’s deliciously grotesque class satire nominated for best picture. Harris Dickinson and the late Charlbi Dean play a beautiful couple who are invited on a trip for the super-rich aboard a yacht captained by a gonzo, Marxist-loving American (Woody Harrelson). The ship hits an unruly storm – leading to the most heinous, vomit-drenched dinner you could ever imagine – and then sinks in a ridiculous fashion, turning the tables on the wealthy and showing who really rules.\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu, Apple TV\n\n'Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery'\n\nA tech billionaire (Edward Norton) invites his longtime crew (including Janelle Monáe, Dave Bautista, Leslie Odom Jr., Kathryn Hahn and Kate Hudson) for a murder mystery getaway on his absurdly posh private Greek island. Daniel Craig's Southern sleuth Benoit Blanc inexplicably shows up, a body hits the floor and the game is afoot for director Rian Johnson's fun and twisty sequel, which like the first \"Knives Out\" earned Johnson a screenplay Oscar nomination.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\n'Women Talking'\n\nDirector Sarah Polley won a screenplay Oscar for her adaptation of the Miriam Toews novel, an intimate drama that centers on a group of women in a religious colony who, after a series of rapes, meet to determine if they'll stay and be forced to forgive or leave and risk not being welcomed into heaven. The acting is phenomenal, with Jessie Buckley, Claire Foy and Rooney Mara among those playing characters determining their fate in a life-altering barn debate.\n\nWhere to watch: Apple TV\n\n'Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio'\n\nGuillermo del Toro, a modern master of the macabre, gives the classic fairy tale a twisted bliss with this enjoyable stop-motion take set in 1930s Italy that won best animated feature. With a precocious, troublemaking wooden puppet desperate to be a real boy and a star-studded voice cast (from Ewan McGregor to Cate Blanchett), the whimsical narrative takes on war and fascism – you haven't lived until you've seen Pinocchio mocking Mussolini – plus tackles dark and fairly mature matters with life-affirming zeal.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\n'RRR'\n\nAn action epic that manages to be more glorious and bromantic than a \"Top Gun\" movie, the Indian blockbuster stars N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan as buff heroes who take on 1920s British colonialists in a must-see movie – the best of last year, actually – with love stories and over-the-top spirit. It didn't get a best picture Oscar nomination but its original song \"Naatu Naatu\" – which accompanies our two protagonists in a dance battle with a smarmy British guy – won the original song Oscaragainst the likes of Lady Gaga and Rihanna.\n\nWhere to watch: Netflix\n\n'Navalny'\n\nDaniel Roher's film, the winner for best documentary, is a riveting and inspiring stranger-than-fiction deep-dive into the life and almost death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The movie chronicles the investigation into the 2020 poisoning of the charismatic dissident (and President Vladimir Putin's chief political rival), but it also hits on an emotional level, including interviews with the subject's children and Navalny himself, a man willing to go to extreme lengths to better his country.\n\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\n\nThe best of the Oscars 2023:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2020/02/02/bafta-awards-1917-wins-best-picture-british-equivalent-oscars/4641863002/", "title": "BAFTA Awards: '1917' wins best picture at British equivalent of Oscars", "text": "Jill Lawless\n\nThe Associated Press\n\nLONDON – Gut-wrenching World War I epic \"1917\" was the big winner at Sunday's British Academy Film Awards, winning seven awards, including best picture and best director.\n\nSam Mendes' drama about one of the most devastating conflicts in British history bested hot American contenders \"Joker,\" \"The Irishman\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" at a glitzy London event that was overshadowed by criticism of the nominees' lack of diversity – even by some of the nominees themselves.\n\nThe director based \"1917\" on his grandfather's wartime experiences.

(Hannah Beachler became the first African-American woman to win that award.)\n\nWinners:See what took home awards\n\nMore:5 must-know moments from Oscars\n\nMore:Everything we overheard at the Oscars: What really happens in the wings\n\nHere's a minute-by-minute breakdown of the Oscars ceremony (in EST):\n\n11:14: \"Green Book\" wins for best picture, despite controversies involving its filmmakers and criticism of the movie by the family of Dr. Donald Shirley, who's played by Mahershala Ali in the film. \"We made this film with love and with tenderness and with respect,\" says producer Jim Burke. \"The whole story is about love, and about loving our differences,\" adds director Peter Farrelly.\n\n11:08: Alfonso Cuaron takes best director for \"Roma.\" \"Being up here doesn't get old,\" he says during his third acceptance speech of the night. \"I want to thank the academy for recognizing a movie about an indigenous woman.\"\n\n10:59: \"The Favourite\" star Olivia Colman wins best actress, upsetting Glenn Close. \"It's genuinely quite stressful,\" she says, shocked. She shouts out working with her co-stars Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz ' \"You can imagine, it wasn't a hardship\" - as well as Close. \"You've been my idol for so long, and this is not how I wanted it to be and I think you're amazing and I love you very much.\" Colman adds, \"To any little girl practicing her speech on the telly: You never know!\"\n\n10:45: Rami Malek takes home best actor for his portrayal of rock god Freddie Mercury in \"Bohemian Rhapsody.\" \"My mom is in here somewhere. I love you, lady,\" he says. \"My dad didn't get to see me do any of this but he's looking down on me right now.\" He thanks \"everyone who took a chance on me\" to play the iconic role: \"I may not have been the obvious choice, but I guess it worked out.\" He adds that the popularity of the movie \"is proof that we're longing for stories like this.\"\n\n10:23: \"Black Panther\" wins its third award of the night, as Ludwig Goransson snags best original score. And best original song goes to \"Shallow\" from \"A Star Is Born.\" \"There is not a single person on the planet that could've sang this song with me but you,\" a crying Lady Gaga, who co-wrote the tune, says to co-star Bradley Cooper during her uplifting speech. \"It's not about winning; what it's about is not giving up.\"\n\n10:14: Spike Lee finally gets an Oscar (and not one of the honorary kind) for adapted screenplay for \"BlacKkKlansman.\" The crowd goes nuts. Lee points out that this year is the 400th anniversary of slaves coming to Virginia: \"We all connect with the ancestors who have love (and) wisdom to regain our humanity.\" He also asks the crowd to mobilize for the next presidential election. \"Let's do the right thing! You know I had to get that in there.\"\n\n10:11: Original screenplay goes to \"Green Book,\" the film's second Oscar of the night. \"This is an amazing honor,\" says co-writer Nick Vallelonga, whose father is played by Viggo Mortensen in the movie.\n\n10:07: \"Skin,\" about racial violence, is named best live-action short film. \"This film is about education, about teaching kids a better way,\" says director Guy Nattiv.\n\n9:59: Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper walk up from their front-row seats, position themselves by the piano and sing their original song nominee \"Shallow\" from \"A Star Is Born.\" The twosome ends the tune with their heads side by side, greeted with a standing ovation from the audience.\n\n9:57: \"First Man\" takes the Oscar for best visual effects, beating out \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Solo: A Star Wars Story.\"\n\n9:44: Pixar's \"Bao\" grabs best animated short. \"To all of the nerdy girls who hide behind their sketchbooks, don't be afraid to tell your stories to the world,\" says director Domee Shi. And documentary short goes to \"Period. End of Sentence.,\" which is about the continuing stigma of menstruation in rural India. \"I can't believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar!\" says joyful director Rayka Zehtabchi.\n\n9:33: Gillian Welch and David Rawlings break out the twang to sing \"When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings,\" the original song nominee from \"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.\"\n\n9:30: \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\" snags best animated feature. \"When we hear that somebody's kid is watching the movie and says, 'That looks like me' ... we feel we already won,\" says producer Phil Lord.\n\n9:24: \"Green Book\" star Mahershala Ali wins best supporting actor for the second time in three years. \"Trying to capture Dr. Shirley's essence pushed me to my ends, which is a reflection of the person he was and the life that he lived,\" Ali says, dedicating the award to his grandmother, \"who has been in my ear my whole life. ... I know I would not be here without her.\"\n\n9:19: \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" gets its third win, for best film editing. \"Freddie Mercury brought us all together in a way, just like he did his audience,\" says honoree John Ottman.\n\n9:09: Bette Midler is surrounded by flying umbrellas to sing \"The Place Where Lost Things Go\" from \"Mary Poppins Returns.\"\n\n9:06: In the most unsurprising turn of the night, \"Roma\" wins for best foreign-language film. \"I grew up watching foreign-language films, learning so much from them. Films like 'Citizen Kane,' 'Jaws,' 'Rashomon,' 'The Godfather,' \" says Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron. \"The nominees tonight show that we are part of the same ocean.\"\n\n8:55: \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" is officially an Oscar-winning film, taking honors for best sound editing and best sound mixing.\n\n8:47: Jennifer Hudson arrives on stage to perform - nay, belt with gusto - the first original song contender, the Diane Warren-penned \"I'll Fight\" from the documentary \"RBG.\"\n\n8:44: Alfonso Cuaron scores best cinematography for \"Roma.\" \"Thank you very much, Mexico and my family,\" he says. (Cuaron's also up for best original screenplay, director and picture, so he might be back in a bit.)\n\n8:39: \"Black Panther\" gets its second Oscar, and Hannah Beachler becomes the first African-American woman to win best production design. \"I stand here stronger than I was yesterday because of (director) Ryan Coogler,\" she says.\n\n8:28: Melissa McCarthy and Brian Tyree Henry come out to present best costume design, and McCarthy wears a dress peppered with plush rabbits - plus she's puppeteering one of the stuffed bunnies. And the Oscar goes to ... Ruth E. Carter for \"Black Panther.\" \"I got it! This has been a long time coming,\" she says, laughing. She previously was nominated for \"Malcolm X\" and thanks Spike Lee for giving her her start: \"I hope this makes you proud.\" She dedicates the award to her 97-year-old mother. \"Mom, thank you for teaching me about people and their stories. You are the original superhero.\"\n\n8:25: \"Vice\" snags its first award of the evening, for makeup and hairstyling. Christian Bale gives the honorees - who turned him into a spitting image of Dick Cheney - a standing ovation.\n\n8:17: \"Free Solo\" takes best documentary. \"This film is for everyone who believes the impossible,\" says director Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi.\n\n8:11: The first award of the night - best supporting actress - goes to Regina King for \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\" \"To be standing here, representing one of the greatest artists of our time, (author) James Baldwin, it's a little surreal,\" King says tearfully. \"I'm an example of when love is important to someone,\" she adds when thanking her mom. \"God is good, all the time.\"\n\n8:07: Maya Rudolph, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are out to present but also act a little as a host's joke-filled monologue. \" 'Roma's' on Netflix? What's next, my microwave makes a movie?\" quips Fey, who also threw in a USA TODAY jab. (Thanks, Tina!)\n\n8:00: No host, no problem. Queen - with Adam Lambert as lead singer - opens the show with a rockin' version of \"We Will Rock You\" and then naturally segues into \"We Are the Champions.\" The crowd's into it, with many swaying their arms. Jordan Peele bobs his head while Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez sings along. \"Welcome to the Oscars!\" Lambert screams at the end.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2014/03/03/oscars-12-years-a-slave-takes-top-prize/5966211/", "title": "Oscars: '12 Years a Slave' takes top prize", "text": "JAKE COYLE\n\nAP Film Writer;\n\nLOS ANGELES – Hollywood named the brutal, unshrinking historical drama \"12 Years a Slave\" best picture at the 86th annual Academy Awards.\n\nSteve McQueen's slavery odyssey, based on Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir, has been hailed as a landmark corrective to the movie industry's virtual blindness to slavery, instead creating whiter tales like 1940 best-picture winner \"Gone With the Wind.\" ''12 Years a Slave\" is the first best-picture winner directed by a black filmmaker.\n\n\"Everyone deserves not just to survive, but to live,\" said McQueen, who dedicated the honor to those, past and present, who have endured slavery. \"This is the most important legacy of Solomon Northup.\"\n\nThe normally reserved McQueen promptly bounced up and down on stage, later matter-of-factly explaining his joy physically took over: \"So, Van Halen. Jump.\"\n\nA year after celebrating Ben Affleck's \"Argo\" over Steven Spielberg's \"Lincoln,\" the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences opted for stark realism over more the plainly entertaining candidates: the 3-D space marvel \"Gravity\" and the starry 1970s caper \"American Hustle.\"\n\nThose two films came in as the leading nominee getters. David O. Russell's \"American Hustle\" went home empty-handed, but \"Gravity\" triumphed as the night's top award-winner. Cleaning up in technical categories like cinematography and visual effects, it earned seven Oscars including best director for Alfonso Cuaron. The Mexican filmmaker is the category's first Latino winner.\n\n\"It was a transformative experience,\" said Cuaron, who spent some five years making the film and developing its visual effects. \"For a lot of people, that transformation was wisdom. For me, it was the color of my hair.\" To his star Sandra Bullock, the sole person on screen for much of the lost-in-space drama, he said: \"Sandra, you are 'Gravity.'\"\n\nBut history belonged to \"12 Years a Slave,\" a modestly budgeted drama produced by Brad Pitt's production company, Plan B, that has made $50 million worldwide — a far cry from the more than $700 million \"Gravity\" has hauled in.\n\nEllen DeGeneres, in a nimble second stint as host that seemed designed as an antidote to the crude humor of Seth MacFarlane last year, summarized the academy's options in her opening monologue: \"Possibility number one: '12 Years a Slave' wins best picture. Possibility number two: You're all racists.\"\n\nDeGeneres presided over a smooth if safe ceremony, punctuated by politics, pizza and photo-bombing. Freely circulating in the crowd, she had pizza delivered, appealing to Harvey Weinstein to pitch in, and gathered stars to snap a selfie she hoped would be a record-setter on Twitter. (It was: Long before midnight, the photo had been retweeted more than 2 million times and momentarily crashed Twitter.) One participant, Meryl Streep, giddily exclaimed: \"I've never tweeted before!\"\n\nBut in celebrating a movie year roundly considered an exceptionally deep one, the Oscars fittingly spread the awards around. The starved stars of the Texas AIDS drama \"Dallas Buyers Club\" were feted: Matthew McConaughey for best actor and Jared Leto for best supporting actor.\n\nMcConaughey's award capped a startling career turnaround, a conscious redirection by the actor to tack away from the romantic comedies he regularly starred in, and move toward more challenging films.\n\n\"It sort of feels like a culmination,\" he said backstage.\n\nLeto passed around his Oscar to members of the press backstage, urging them to \"fondle\" it. The long-haired actor, who has devoted himself in recent years to his rock band 30 Seconds to Mars, gravely vowed: \"I will revel tonight.\"\n\nCate Blanchett took best actress for her fallen socialite in Woody Allen's \"Blue Jasmine,\" her second Oscar. Accepting the award, she challenged Hollywood not to think of films starring women as \"niche experiences\": \"The world is round, people!\" she declared to hearty applause.\n\nDraped in Nairobi blue, Lupita Nyong'o — the Cinderella of the awards season — won best supporting actress for her indelible impression as the tortured slave Patsey. It's the feature film debut for the 31-year-old actress.\n\n\"It doesn't escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is thanks to so much pain in someone else's, and so I want to salute the spirit of Patsy for her guidance,\" said Nyong'o. She also thanked director Steve McQueen: \"I'm certain that the dead are standing about you and they are watching and they are grateful, and so am I.\"\n\nJohn Ridley won best adapted screenplay for \"12 Years a Slave,\" shifting praise to Northup: \"Those are his words. That is his life.\" Spike Jonze took best original screenplay for his futuristic romance \"Her,\" the category Russell had the best chance of winning.\n\nThough the ceremony lacked a big opening number, it had a steady musical beat to it. To a standing ovation, Bono and U2 played an acoustic version of \"Ordinary Love,\" from \"Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom.\" Pharrell Williams had Streep and Leonardo DiCaprio dancing in the aisles with \"Happy\" from \"Despicable Me 2.\"\n\nPink was cheered for her rendition of \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\" part of a 75th anniversary tribute to \"The Wizard of Oz.\" And Bette Midler sang — what else? — \"Wind Beneath My Wing\" for the in memoriam segment — an especially heartfelt one, considering the deaths of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Harold Ramis, James Gandolfini and others.\n\nBest documentary went to the crowd-pleasing backup singer ode \"20 Feet From Stardom.\" One of its stars, Darlene Love, accepted the award singing the gospel tune \"His Eye Is on the Sparrow\": \"I sing because I'm happy/ I sing because I'm free.\"\n\nDisney's global hit \"Frozen\" won best animated film, marking — somewhat remarkably — the studio's first win in the 14 years of the best animated feature category. (Pixar, which Disney owns, has regularly dominated.) The film's hit single, \"Let It Go,\" won best original song.\n\n\"We're all just trying to make films that touch people,\" said co-director Chris Buck backstage. \"Once in a while, you get lucky.\"\n\nThough the Oscar ceremony is usually a glitzy bubble separate from real-world happenings, international events were immediately referenced. In his acceptance speech, Leto addressed people in Ukraine and Venezuela.\n\n\"We are here and as you struggle to make your dreams happen, to live the impossible, we're thinking of you,\" said Leto.\n\nRussian state-owned broadcaster Channel One Russia said it would not broadcast the Oscars live because of the necessity for news coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. It will instead transmit the Oscars early Tuesday morning, local time.\n\nVenezuelan protesters, via social media, urged Oscar winners to bring attention to their plight. Anti-government protests have roiled the country in recent weeks.\n\nItaly's \"The Great Beauty\" won the Oscar for best foreign language film. In accepting the award for his rumination on life and Rome's decadence, director Paolo Sorrentino thanked his heroes, including Federico Fellini, Martin Scorsese and soccer star Diego Maradona.\n\nIn her opening, DeGeneres gently mocked Hollywood's insularity, referring to the headlines that have swamped the Los Angeles area lately with a slightly less serious news event.\n\n\"It has been raining,\" said DeGeneres. \"We're fine. Thank you for your prayers.\"\n\nABC, which aired the ceremony, hoped the drama of a razor-thin best-picture race would be enough to entice viewers. The show last year drew an audience of 40.3 million, up from 39.3 million the year before when the silent-film ode \"The Artist\" won best picture.\n\nThere was a sense of deja vu Sunday. As she hit the red carpet, \"American Hustle\" star Jennifer Lawrence briefly collapsed in a heap of laughter, just as she tripped ascending the stairs last year to accept best actress for \"Silver Linings Playbook.\"\n\n\"If you win tonight,\" said DeGeneres, \"I think we should bring you the Oscar.\"\n\nNo delivery was needed, as the night belonged to \"12 Years a Slave.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Anthony McCartney, Lynn Elber, Ryan Nakashima, Andrew Dalton, Nekesa Mumbi Moody and E.J.Tamara contributed to this report.\n\nList of winners at Sunday's 86th annual Academy Awards:\n\nBest Picture: \"12 Years a Slave.\"\n\nActor: Matthew McConaughey, \"Dallas Buyers Club.\"\n\nActress: Cate Blanchett, \"Blue Jasmine.\"\n\nSupporting Actor: Jared Leto, \"Dallas Buyers Club.\"\n\nSupporting Actress: Lupita Nyong'o, \"12 Years a Slave.\"\n\nDirecting: Alfonso Cuaron, \"Gravity.\"\n\nForeign Language Film: \"The Great Beauty,\" Italy.\n\nAdapted Screenplay: John Ridley, \"12 Years a Slave.\"\n\nOriginal Screenplay: Spike Jonze, \"Her.\"\n\nAnimated Feature Film: \"Frozen.\"\n\nProduction Design: \"The Great Gatsby.\"\n\nCinematography: \"Gravity.\"\n\nSound Mixing: \"Gravity.\"\n\nSound Editing: \"Gravity.\"\n\nOriginal Score: \"Gravity,\" Steven Price.\n\nOriginal Song: \"Let It Go\" from \"Frozen.\"\n\nCostume: \"The Great Gatsby.\"\n\nMakeup and Hairstyling: \"Dallas Buyers Club.\"\n\nAnimated Short Film: \"Mr. Hublot.\"\n\nDocumentary Feature: \"20 Feet from Stardom.\"\n\nDocumentary (short subject): \"The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life.\"\n\nFilm Editing: \"Gravity.\"\n\nLive Action Short Film: \"Helium.\"\n\nVisual Effects: \"Gravity.\"\n\n———\n\nHonorary Oscars:\n\n— Peter W.

Perhaps a biopic or a war movie, something huge in scale such as a \"Dances With Wolves\" or \"Titanic,\" or an absolutely singular film like the newest to win the Academy Awards' top trophy, \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\"\n\nWhat's pretty clear if you undertake watching all 95 (so far) films to take that vaunted prize – and it's not for the fainthearted, trust us – is that you come out of it changed. You love movies a little bit more.\n\nTo celebrate the latest entry in this storied canon, we're ranking every best picture winner, from iffy stuff where a recount seems in order to the very best of the best.\n\n95. 'The Broadway Melody' (1928/29)\n\nThe second best picture winner, it's a musical dud with vaudevillian sisters and romantic malarkey that could have won worst picture, too.\n\n94. 'Crash' (2005)\n\nA mess of interwoven stories centered on social and xenophobic tensions in LA, it has a good cast (Sandra Bullock, Don Cheadle) and little else.\n\n93. 'The Greatest Show on Earth' (1952)\n\nJimmy Stewart is a clown and Charlton Heston also signs up for this ostentatious and loathsome three-ring ode to P.T. Barnum’s circus.\n\n92. 'Cimarron' (1930/31)\n\nThe rocky drama about an 1800s Oklahoma family was the first Western to win the category, yet it has aged badly with unfortunate racist stereotypes.\n\n91. 'Cavalcade' (1932/33)\n\nThis sentimental tale of family, friends and servants experiencing ups and downs of life from 1899 to 1933 is like \"Downton Abbey\" but not good.\n\n90. 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989)\n\nMorgan Freeman plays a Black driver and Jessica Tandy is his elderly white charge in an emotionally manipulative dramedy made for random cable TV showings.\n\n89. 'Around the World in 80 Days' (1956)\n\nAn English dude (David Niven) travels the globe and meets colorful characters in a flighty three-hour affair. It's no \"Cannonball Run,\" though.\n\n88. 'The English Patient' (1996)\n\nThe pretentious World War II melodrama has Ralph Fiennes as a burned man, Juliette Binoche as his nurse and Kristin Scott Thomas as his already-married love.\n\n87. 'Out of Africa' (1985)\n\nMeryl Streep's married Danish writer falls for Robert Redford's big-game hunter over 160 snoozy minutes of Oscar-bait romance.\n\n86. 'Shakespeare in Love' (1998)\n\nThe biopic rom-com gone wrong finds Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) wooing the woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) who helps him write “Romeo and Juliet.\"\n\n85. 'The Great Ziegfeld' (1936)\n\nWilliam Powell plays the infamous title Broadway producer in an arduous and showy musical that is, suffice it to say, less than great.\n\n84. 'Million Dollar Baby' (2004)\n\nHilary Swank packed on muscle to play an up-and-coming boxer trained by an aging coach (director Clint Eastwood) in a film as depressing as \"Rocky\" is uplifting.\n\n83. 'How Green Was My Valley' (1941)\n\nOne of the Oscars' greatest unsolved mysteries is how this maudlin Welsh family coal drama upset \"Citizen Kane.\"\n\n82. 'Chariots of Fire' (1981)\n\nVangelis' catchy theme is the most memorable aspect of this emotionally deep but sluggish British sports drama that follows runners racing toward the 1924 Paris Olympics.\n\n81. 'Green Book' (2018)\n\nMahershala Ali plays a Black pianist touring the Jim Crow South and Viggo Mortensen is his uncouth driver in a feel-good film about race relations with a whitewashed perspective.\n\n80. 'Gentleman’s Agreement' (1947)\n\nGregory Peck stars as a journalist who pretends to be Jewish for a story on antisemitism, which probably sounded like a better idea in 1947.\n\n79. 'Tom Jones' (1963)\n\nThe courtly British comedy finds Albert Finney embracing saucy adventures and getting into swordfights as a squire cast out of his kingdom.\n\n78. 'Grand Hotel' (1931/32)\n\nThe episodic drama peeks at the various goings-on at a swanky Berlin hotel, like the budding relationship of a Russian ballerina (Greta Garbo) and jewelry-heisting gambler (John Barrymore).\n\n77. 'Slumdog Millionaire' (2008)\n\nDev Patel's orphan rises from the slums to win the Indian “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" but a Bollywood song-and-dance number botches the satisfying ending.\n\n76. 'The Lost Weekend' (1945)\n\nBilly Wilder's bracing, noir-ish exploration of alcoholism features Ray Milland as a writer whose life devolves into a desperate hunt for his next drink over several harrowing days.\n\n75. 'Forrest Gump' (1994)\n\nThe title character’s fanciful jaunt through American history veers schmaltzy, so thank goodness for Tom Hanks imbuing Gump with an enduring charm.\n\n74. 'Marty' (1955)\n\nOne of Hollywood’s great character actors, Ernest Borgnine is outstanding as a 30-something butcher who finally finds love and doesn’t know who to do with it.\n\n73. 'The Hurt Locker' (2009)\n\nDirector Kathryn Bigelow's Iraq War thriller makes you feel the constant stress and danger faced by a military bomb-disposal unit (including Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie).\n\n72. 'American Beauty' (1999)\n\nWho could have imagined 20-plus years later that the divisive \"dancing\" plastic bag from the suburban satire would be more respected than best actor winner Kevin Spacey?\n\n71. 'Terms of Endearment' (1983)\n\nShirley MacLaine and Debra Winger are a mother and daughter with a polarized relationship, yet Jack Nicholson stands out as a roguish astronaut.\n\n70. 'Gigi' (1958)\n\nYoung courtesan wannabe Gigi (Leslie Caron) and Parisian playboy Gaston (Louis Jourdan) see each other as just friends, until romance intercedes in the musical confection.\n\n69. 'You Can’t Take It With You' (1938)\n\nFrank Capra's folksy rom-com casts Jimmy Stewart as Tony, a grounded guy from a snobby family who falls for Alice (Jean Arthur), the most normal in a clan of oddballs.\n\n68. 'Nomadland' (2020)\n\nChloe Zhao’s look at older workers in modern America combines splendid scenery with a wondrous Frances McDormand as a woman who adores life on the road.\n\n67. 'Going My Way' (1944)\n\nBing Crosby is the singingest priest you've ever seen in the musical dramedy, a tune-filled battle of wills between Crosby's young holy man and Barry Fitzgerald's elder pastor.\n\n66. 'Argo' (2012)\n\nDirector Ben Affleck also stars in the historical thriller (and a sort of salute to the movies) about the CIA using a fake sci-fi movie as a ruse to rescue diplomats during the Iran hostage crisis.\n\n65. 'The Deer Hunter' (1978)\n\nPennsylvania friends (including Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken) go off to Vietnam and face the psychological aftermath. Well made but super-duper bleak, so maybe chase it with ...\n\n64. 'Oliver!' (1968)\n\nCharles Dickens' spunky characters from \"Oliver Twist\" get a crowd-pleasing all-ages revamp courtesy of a Victorian musical that doesn't skimp on the earworming showtunes.\n\n63. 'The Best Years of Our Lives' (1946)\n\nFredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell star in the drama that deals honestly with a theme of the time: World War II veterans returning home to face personal and professional struggles.\n\n62. 'Braveheart' (1995)\n\nMel Gibson's controversial stances aside, he is pretty good at making you want to put war paint on and fight for Scottish independence.\n\n61. 'Ordinary People' (1980)\n\nMary Tyler Moore veers unlikable for a change as the hard-to-please matriarch of a family shaken to its core by the death of one son and a suicide attempt by the other (Timothy Hutton).\n\n60. 'An American in Paris' (1951)\n\nGene Kelly stars as a World War II vet crushing on the French perfume girl (Leslie Caron) who's dating his singer pal (Georges Guétary). Awkward! But this one's all about the wowing 17-minute dance finale set to Gershwin's title tune.\n\n59. 'Mrs. Miniver' (1942)\n\nGreer Garson and Walter Pidgeon star as an English couple dealing with the early days of World War II in a drama that, unlike many other films on this list, was made during said war.\n\n58. 'The King’s Speech' (2010)\n\nThe sweet and inspirational story features Colin Firth as England's King George VI working through a childhood stutter to be the steady voice his country needs.\n\n57. 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' (1957)\n\n“Star Wars” fans will appreciate Alec Guinness owning the screen as a World War II British colonel leading whistling, bridge-building POWs at a Japanese prison camp in Thailand.\n\n56. 'Wings' (1927/28)\n\nThe first best picture winner holds up well almost a century later. The silent film stars Charles Rogers and Richard Arlen as rival pilots in World War I who dig the same girl (Clara Bow) back home.\n\n55. 'Dances With Wolves' (1990)\n\nKevin Costner takes a break from sports movies to direct and star in the solid Western epic as a Union soldier who befriends – and fights for – a Native American tribe.\n\n54. 'The Life of Emile Zola' (1937)\n\nMaybe not the most famous biopic but a quite effective one, with Paul Muni as the 19th-century French writer who speaks up for a Jewish captain tagged as a traitor.\n\n53. 'All the King’s Men' (1949)\n\nThe film noir tackles the corruptive tendencies of power, with Broderick Crawford as a populist politician who rises up as a Southern governor and wields dangerous influence.\n\n52. 'A Man for All Seasons' (1966)\n\nPaul Scofield brings steady nerve to his portrayal of Sir Thomas More, the British statesman who butted heads with King Henry VIII (Robert Shaw).\n\n51. 'A Beautiful Mind' (2001)\n\nA year after winning best actor for \"Gladiator,\" Russell Crowe returned to the Oscar race with his role as John Nash, a genius on an absorbing journey of math and madness.\n\n50. 'The Last Emperor' (1987)\n\nBernardo Bertolucci was the first Italian filmmaker to win best director for the immersive historical chronicle of Chinese emperor Puyi's life, from ruling as a toddler to being imprisoned as an adult.\n\n49. 'The Shape of Water' (2017)\n\nGuillermo del Toro's beautifully unconventional romance makes you believe in the love between a voiceless janitor (Sally Hawkins) and a captured fish man (Doug Jones).\n\n48. 'Rain Man' (1988)\n\nDustin Hoffman shows up on this list a few times as part of some dynamic duos. Here, he plays a savant with autism who reconnects with his brash younger brother (Tom Cruise) on the road.\n\n47. 'Gandhi' (1982)\n\nRichard Attenborough's biopic takes on the tale of the renowned Indian leader and succeeds, primarily because of the spirit Ben Kingsley gives his title character.\n\n46. 'The Sound of Music' (1965)\n\nJulie Andrews is a nun who teaches a family of kids to sing and gallivants tunefully across Austrian mountains, while Christopher Plummer rips up a Nazi flag. They understood the assignment, as the kids say.\n\n45. 'The Artist' (2011)\n\nThe (mostly) silent film is a joyous look at Hollywood’s yesteryear, finding something special with an aging star (Jean Dujardin), an infectious ingenue (Bérénice Bejo) and a ridiculously cute pooch.\n\n44.

Talks between the BBC and Lineker are thought to be “moving in the right direction”, said Metro, but the Mirror said that a return for Lineker would “infuriate Tories”.

Bakhmut battle rages on\n\nThere have been reports of heavy losses on both sides as the battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut continues. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces had suffered more than 1,100 deaths in the past few days while Moscow said it had killed more than 220 Ukrainian service members over the past 24 hours. Ukraine has insisted that the defence of Bakhmut would continue, said Al Jazeera, with top commanders explaining that the battle there allows them to gain time needed to prepare a broader counterattack.\n\nWhy is Bakhmut so important to Russia and Ukraine?\n\n4. Sunak plays down crisis fears\n\nThe collapse of Silicon Valley Bank will not trigger new financial crisis, said Rishi Sunak. Speaking to reporters on a flight to the United States, the prime minister said that there was “no systemic contagion risk” following the collapse of the lender. The Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said yesterday that he was working to find a solution for clients of its UK branch that “minimises, or if we possibly can, avoids” losses to companies caught up in the chaos. Some tech firms have told the BBC they could go bust if help does not come soon enough.\n\n5. Chain restaurants ‘won’t recover’\n\nChain restaurants will never be as commonplace as they were before the Covid pandemic, said the chief executive of Wagamama. Speaking to The Telegraph, Andy Hornby, chief executive of The Restaurant Group, which owns the noodles chain, said: “I don’t think the [casual dining] industry will ever be quite as big as it was.” However, he added, people were still “prepared to spend money on good quality food and drink” and predicted that “good performing, well-run food and drink operators do have a good future in this country”.\n\n6. Capaldi helps Tourette’s trial\n\nScientists have devised a bracelet that delivers electrical pulses that can significantly reduce the severity and frequency of tics for people with Tourette’s Syndrome. The Neupulse device works by “stimulating a motor nerve in the arm with rhythmic electrical pulses” that “trigger brain oscillations linked to the suppression of movement”, said The Telegraph. The pop singer Lewis Capaldi was among those who took part in trials, said Sky News. It helped him “feel calmer”, he said.\n\n7. PM’s heated pool requires local upgrade\n\nThe prime minister’s new private heated swimming pool uses so much energy that the local electricity network had to be upgraded to satisfy its power demands, according to The Guardian. Additional equipment has been installed in a remote part of North Yorkshire to provide extra capacity from the National Grid to Rishi Sunak’s constituency home. Sunak will personally pick up the cost of the electricity upgrade work and there is no suggestion he enjoyed preferential treatment.\n\n‘Rishi Rich’: How the Sunaks made their fortune\n\n8.

After bludgeoning 77-year-old Lawrence Scully, Levi Axtell drove to the sheriff’s office and handed himself in, covered in blood. Axtell from Cook County, Minnesota “had long been suspicious of Scully parking his vehicle at locations where children were present”, said the Daily Mail. Scully, who was convicted of molesting a six-year-old girl in 1979, died following the attack and Axtell has been charged with second-degree murder.\n\n9. Board sorry for rogue tweet\n\nThe Board of Deputies of British Jews has apologised to a journalist after a message on its Twitter account described her as an “asshole”. The tweet from the organisation’s account on Saturday was in response to Rachel Shabi’s comments about Gary Lineker and the government’s immigration policy. After the Board removed the tweet and apologised, Shabi tweeted: “Thanks for the apology, though the problem isn’t just the language but the substance of the post.

Here's a list of criminal and civil cases ...", "text": "WASHINGTON - Former President Donald Trump was indicted for a third time on Tuesday for allegedly tampering with 2020 election results − a move that comes amid Trump’s mounting legal troubles in other federal and state criminal investigations.\n\nThe newly-unsealed indictment says − among other things − that Trump allegedly used fake electors in a scheme to overturn President Joe Biden’s wins in several states, obstructed a congressional proceeding on Jan. 6 and spread false election fraud claims knowingly. Trump was charged with four counts.\n\nThe former president was previously indicted in a federal case related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Prior to that, a Manhattan grand jury in New York indicted him for allegedly falsifying business records in connection with hush money payments made to two women. He pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\nProsecutors in Georgia are also eyeing a potential indictment over his efforts to overturn the state's 2020 presidential election outcome. The decision in the case could come by Sept. 1.\n\nHere’s a rundown of the criminal and civil cases that Trump’s involved in as he continues to vie for the GOP presidential nomination for the 2024 election.\n\nCriminal cases\n\nMar-a-Lago classified documents case\n\nStatus: Indicted\n\nExpected trial date: May 2024\n\nTrump was indicted last month on 37 felony counts for allegedly storing hundreds of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate upon leaving the White House in 2021. Some of the charges include willful retention of national defense information in violation of the Espionage Act and conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all counts in a courtroom in Miami, Florida. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed federal prosecutor Smith in November 2022 as special counsel to oversee Trump’s documents probe.\n\nSmith brought three additional charges against Trump in a superseding indictment last week for allegedly seeking to destroy security footage of rooms in which subpoenaed boxes of classified information were kept and induced others to do so.\n\nTrump's aide, Walt Nauta, and Mar-a-Lago employee Carlos De Oliveira were also indicted in the case.\n\nNew York hush money case\n\nStatus: Indicted\n\nExpected trial date: March 2024\n\nTrump was indicted on 34 felony counts in March by a Manhattan grand jury for allegedly falsifying business records in an attempt to conceal hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, who alleged they had sexual relations with Trump, before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump had arranged for his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, to make the payments − $130,000 for Daniels and $150,000 for McDougal − to silence the women on their claims. His organization then paid Cohen reimbursements in the guise of legal fees.\n\nThe case made Trump the first former president to be indicted in history. It was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nHe pleaded not guilty to all counts in a Manhattan court room in April. The maximum sentence for a felony would be four years in prison under New York law, but first-time offenders can get shorter sentences.\n\n2020 election interference and Jan. 6 case\n\nStatus: Indicted\n\nExpected trial date: Not certain\n\nA federal grand jury indicted Trump on Tuesday for his alleged role in conspiring to overturn the 2020 election. He was charged with Conspiracy to Defraud the United States; Conspiracy to Obstruct an Official Proceeding; Obstruction of and Attempt to Obstruct an Official Proceeding; and Conspiracy Against Rights.\n\nSmith's indictment against Trump details several actions Trump took to undermine Biden's victory in 2020, including directing his supporters to march to the Capitol on Jan. 6, working with six co-conspirators to devise strategies to submit a fraudulent slate of electors and pressuring Vice President Mike Pence to reject the election results.\n\nThe indictment came after Trump had received a target letter earlier this month notifying him that he was the focus of Smith’s investigation into alleged election fraud − a warning to Trump that he would face criminal charges.\n\nTrump is expected to be arraigned in a courtroom on Thursday.\n\nGeorgia 2020 election interference case\n\nStatus: Pending\n\nExpected trial date: Pending\n\nGeorgia's Fulton County District Attorney Fanni Willis is overseeing an investigation related to Trump's alleged role in trying to overturn the state's 2020 election results.\n\nTrump allegedly recruited Republican electors as alternates to the official electors in Georgia and other states President Joe Biden won. He also pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find the votes he needed to win Georgia. A House of Representatives investigation found that Trump tried to call him 18 times.\n\nWillis said that a decision on charges against Trump could come by Sept. 1 in an interview.\n\n“The work is accomplished,” Willis told CNN affiliate WXIA. “We’ve been working for 2 1/2 years. We’re ready to go.”\n\nCivil lawsuits\n\nE. Jean Carroll case\n\nExpected trial date: January 2024\n\nWriter E. Jean Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump in 2019 for comments he made about her while he was president. A judge accepted the lawsuit this year and set the trial date for January.\n\nA federal jury in May found Trump liable for sexually abusing Carroll at a New York City department store in 1996 and for defamation in a separate case. Trump was ordered to pay $5 million in damages.\n\nThe jury in the case found that Trump for \"willfully or wantonly negligent, reckless, or done with a conscious disregard of the rights of Ms. Carroll\" − said yes. The jurors also found that Trump’s attacks against Carroll in social media posts were \"defamatory,\" \"false,\" and made \"with actual malice.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that he doesn't know who Carroll is.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James case\n\nExpected trial date: October\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit against Trump last year after a three-year investigation, alleging that Trump “falsely inflated his wealth by billions of dollars\" through massive fraud involving his namesake business, the Trump Organization.\n\nHe was allegedly aided by his children - Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. - and senior executives at the Trump Organization.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks $250 million in penalties, a ban on Trump or his children running businesses in New York and legal action attempts to prevent Trump and his organization from buying commercial real-estate for five years.\n\nTrump gave a deposition for the case in April, where he dismissed it as \"ridiculous.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/25/donald-trump-indictment-waco-rally/11541497002/", "title": "Donald Trump attacks prospective indictment during Waco rally", "text": "Staging his first public rally of the 2024 election cycle, President Donald Trump lashed out at the many criminal investigations against him – particularly the one in New York City that could lead to his indictment any day.\n\n\"They're not coming after me, they're coming after you,\" Trump told fervent supporters Saturday during a rambling speech in Waco, Texas, seeking support from his political base as he faces the prospect of becoming the first former president to face criminal charges.\n\nThe Waco rally – itself a source of criticism – came a week after Trump claimed he would be arrested by New York authorities in a case that revolves around hush money to an alleged mistress. That has not happened as a New York grand jury is reportedly continuing its investigation.\n\nDuring the week, Trump repeatedly urged his supporters to protest the investigations in New York and elsewhere, exhortations that some lawmakers interpreted as calls to violence.\n\nTrump did not specifically make such a plea during a Waco speech that lasted some 95 minutes.\n\nThe New York case:Alvin Bragg, Stormy Daniels, Michael Cohen: Meet the key players in Manhattan DA's Trump case\n\nArrest? Indictment?:Donald Trump claims he will be arrested Tuesday in Manhattan probe, calls for protests\n\nSecurity concerns: Secret Service has met with New York police on security plans in the event Trump is charged\n\nTrump in Waco rally targets investigations against him\n\nProsecutors in New York are investigating Trump over hush money to former adult film actress Stormy Daniels to buy her silence right before the 2016 presidential election. Investigators are looking into whether the payoff constituted an illegal campaign contribution that Trump tried to cover up.\n\nTrump is also under investigation in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the insurrection by Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nIn Waco, Trump attacked – but did not name – Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who has received death threats that included a letter with an undisclosed substance that was \"immediately contained,\" his office said.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are preparing security plans in New York and Washington in the event that Trump is indicted.\n\nThe former sprayed attacks on an array of government agencies, from the Manhattan DA's office to the Supreme Court itself, which has ruled against executive privilege and forced Trump to turn over documents to investigators.\n\nJudges have also allowed prosecutors to question Trump lawyers about his handling of classified documents, another investigation that Trump is trying to blunt.\n\nWhile he did not urge people to protest – at the rally at least – Trump did strike threatening notes in his speech. He again promised to be an agent of \"retribution\" if he is again elected president, and told the crowd at one point: \"Either the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state.\"\n\nWhy did Trump pick Waco?\n\nPolitical opponents assailed Trump's decision to hold an event in Waco during the 30th anniversary of the standoff between federal agents and members of the Branch Davidian religious sect. It ended in an inferno at the Branch Davidian compound that claimed nearly 80 lives.\n\nMary Trump, the former president's niece and one of his fiercest critics, called the site selection \"a ploy to remind his cult of the infamous Waco siege of 1993, where an anti-government cult battled the FBI.\" Before the event, Mary Trump tweeted that the former president \"wants the same violent chaos to rescue him from justice.\"\n\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a prominent Trump supporter who addressed the rally, used a barnyard epithet to describe claims that the former president went to Waco because of the violent events there.\n\nPatrick, who ascended the rally stage as the PA system played a Brooks & Dunn song called \"How Far to Waco,\" said he picked the site because the people of the region represent \"the American values and the Texas values and the godly values of this country ... that's that reason he's here.\"\n\nMcLennan County, which includes Waco, gave nearly 61% of its vote to Trump during the 2020 election.\n\nWhy Waco?:Where is Donald Trump holding his first 2024 campaign rally? Waco, Texas. Why?\n\nA message?:Trump holding his next rally in Waco, Texas, sends a message to the far right, experts say\n\n'Not gonna stop him'\n\nThe pro-Trump crowd that Trump seconded his attacks on law enforcement, and predicted that criminal charges would help him politically.\n\n\"They're doing whatever they can to stop him, but that's not gonna stop him,\" said Linda Robinson, 75, of Robinson, Texas, near Waco. \"It will push him to an election win.\"\n\nOthers were unsure how it would play out, especially with Trump being challenged by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republicans.\n\nBrad Cox, 43, from Teague, Texas, said criminal charges \"could go either way. Politicians do a good job of spinning things.\" While opponents like DeSantis would seek to \"capitalize on it,\" Cox said \"Trump's team would spin it in a positive manner.\"\n\nMembers of Congress and Texas state officials have defended Trump joined him in Waco. That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whom Trump suggested should considering running for the U.S. Senate.\n\nTrump's legal troubles:Jan. 6 Capitol attack 2 years later: Trump still plagued by multiple investigations\n\nTrump vs. DeSantis\n\nOther than the protests about law enforcement and investigations, Trump's speech in Waco featured the usual grab-bag of issue arguments and political attacks on President Joe Biden, \"open order fanatics,\" \"globalists,\" new election rules, military aid to Ukraine and other assorted \"vultures\" who oppose him.\n\nTrump again struck a near-apocalyptic tone as voters approach the 2024 election. Trump called it \"the final battle\" and claimed that the country is \"doomed\" if it does not go well for him.\n\nTrump offered a lengthy attack on DeSantis, the Florida governor who is polling the best among Trump's potential opponents for the Republican presidential nomination. He criticized DeSantis over plans to change Social Security and \"I'm not a big fan.\" rather than investigations.\n\nDeSantis has criticized the potential prosecution as politically motivated – he also repeated the sordid details behind the allegations, telling reporters that, \"I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair.\"\n\nSome political analysts mocked Trump's performance.\n\n\"This speech is like getting cornered by a guy at a party who is 11 beers deep and can't stop talking about how his career & marriage didn't go as well as he hoped,\" tweeted Tim Miller, a former GOP political strategist and author of \"Why We Did It: A Travelogue from the Republican Road to Hell.\"\n\nRepublican strategist Scott Jennings, a CNN commentator, said there was \"nothing new\" in Trump's event and \"there won’t be anything new. This is what it is and we’ll find out whether the Republicans want this or something evolved beyond what he represents\n\nTed Nugent opens Waco rally\n\nTrump supporters who attended the rally at the Waco airport seemed pleased.\n\nTed Nugent, the Texas-based rocker, kicked off the rally with a guitar rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner.

Jim Jordan of Ohio, on the Judiciary Committee, James Comer of Kentucky on the Oversight and Accountability Committee and Bryan Steil of Wisconsin on the Administration Committee – asked Bragg to answer questions about his inquiry, which they said appeared politically motivated.\n\nBragg’s general counsel, Leslie Dubeck, rejected the request by saying the lawmakers had no legitimate basis to ask about a pending criminal matter. The chairmen wrote again saying they were justified in asking how a local prosecutor could alter a president’s policies by threatening criminal charges.\n\n“Your second letter asserts that, by failing to provide it, the District Attorney somehow failed to dispute your baseless and inflammatory allegations that our investigation is politically motivated,” Dubeck wrote. “That conclusion is misleading and meritless.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nJailed Trump exec cuts ties with lawyers:Former Trump Organization exec Allen Weisselberg cuts ties with attorneys\n\nEric and Donald Trump Jr. outraged by indictment\n\nTrump's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr. expressed outrage that the Manhattan District Attorney’s office has obtained a grand jury indictment against their father, calling it a witch hunt and politically motivated prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. took to the former president’s Truth Social media platform to describe the indictment as “Big news in the weaponization of our Govt against their political enemies.”\n\nEric Trump said the indictment came in response to his father’s third attempt to win the Republican nomination for the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"This is third world prosecutorial misconduct.

He is reviewing Trump’s role in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021, and the discovery of classified documents at his estate Mar-a-Lago.\n\nPotential New York charges such as falsifying business records are relatively mundane compared to allegations Trump tried to overturn the 2020 election. But Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney and now a law professor at the University of Michigan, said the evidence for falsifying business records would be fairly straightforward based on documents and is a common charge in New York.\n\n“It certainly does not raise the level of overturning an election, but this case is comparable to other cases that get filed on a regular basis in New York against defendants for falsifying business records,” McQuade told USA TODAY. “Trump should not get a pass on this case in New York just because he also faces potential charges in Georgia and in federal court.\"\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nOther countries charge their leaders:Charges against Trump would be a first in US.

But on Thursday, the woman at the center of the investigative storm feels bad that he was charged, although it means the judicial system is working, according to her lawyer.\n\n“She was surprised, honestly, even though it was mostly expected,” her lawyer, Clark Brewster told USA TODAY. “But on behalf of Stormy and honestly myself, there's no joy in seeing the man indicted.”\n\nDaniels wasn’t immediately aware of the indictment because she was out riding her horse.\n\n“The fact is that she feels bad that the guy has been charged,” Brewster said. “But on the other hand, truly, she knew what the facts were and she wants him to deal with the truth as well.

Sign up\n\nTrump, the outgoing president at the time, “came under heightened scrutiny” after he called Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, and asked that he “find” a further 11,780 votes to secure his win in the “coveted swing state”, said Al Jazeera.\n\nThe indictments came after the state’s Supreme Court “swiftly” rejected an appeal submitted by Trump’s lawyers in an attempt to quash the criminal investigation and prevent the authorities from bringing charges against him, said The Hill. The nine judges delivered a unanimous decision, “dismissing his team’s legal argument at every turn”.\n\nWhat happens next: Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he conspired and engaged in racketeering activity to overturn the results of the Georgia count, according to a court filing submitted by his lawyer in superior court in Atlanta.\n\nTrump also waived formal arraignment, meaning he will not need to appear for the formal reading of the indictment next week. No trial date has yet been set for Trump, though the Fulton County district attorney, Fani Willis, has pressed for a 23 October start.\n\nAmid attempts by both sides to alter the date and venue of the final trial, Trump’s “overarching legal strategy has been to delay”, said The Guardian. If he were to win re-election, he could “theoretically have the case frozen while he assumes the presidency”.\n\nSignificance: “This is a huge case for a local prosecutor, even in a county as large as Fulton, to bring,” said The Atlantic’s David A. Graham. And Willis has a recording of the telephone call between Trump and Raffensperger; that piece of evidence is “close to a smoking gun”.\n\nThe Fulton County probe could “present more acute legal threats” than some of the other challenges Trump is facing, said Politico. Willis told The Washington Post last year that “the allegations are very serious” and “if convicted, people are facing prison sentences”.\n\n6 January\n\nThe case: A number of lawsuits have been filed against Trump in relation to the violent insurrection that took place at the Capitol building in Washington on 6 January 2021. Police officers and Democrats in the House of Representatives are seeking compensation for the physical and emotional injury they suffered during the riot.\n\nUS Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith to lead the Justice Department’s criminal investigations into Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, including the events of 6 January.\n\nAfter 18 months, the congressional select committee released its report into the insurrection on 22 December. It named Trump as the “central cause” of the violence that led to the riots, and referred the former president to the Department of Justice (DOJ) after accusing him of committing four federal crimes.\n\nSmith, the DOJ special counsel, has indicted Trump over his alleged efforts to overturn the election. The 6 January attack on the Capitol was “fuelled by lies”, said Smith. “Throughout the 45 detailed pages of this indictment that theme of dishonesty is repeated again and again,” said Sarah Smith, the BBC’s North America editor.\n\nWhat happens next: Jack Smith is “pressing for a speedy trial”, so it “could well be taking place right in the middle of the next presidential election”, said the broadcaster.\n\nThe deadline for Trump to signal whether he would testify before the grand jury passed without the former president reporting to authorities. But he did post a “menacing new video” to Truth Social, said The Independent, in which he promised to “do things that have never been done before” to people who “f*** around with us”.\n\nSignificance: Since the “unprecedented riot” in 2021, “an equally historic criminal investigation” has “played out less than a mile away from the Capitol grounds”, said CBS News. The allegation that Trump incited violence that led to the 6 January riots is “perhaps most grave of all” the former president’s current legal challenges, said Martha Kelner at Sky News.\n\nMore than 1,000 people have now been charged for their roles in the insurrection, including 107 defendants who face charges for using a dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily harm to an officer, said Axios.\n\nClassified documents\n\nThe case: Jack Smith is also overseeing the federal investigation into the classified documents that the FBI removed from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence in August last year. Dozens of agents removed 103 classified documents from the Florida estate, including 18 “top secret” and 54 “secret documents”.\n\nIn June, the Justice Department released an indictment that charged Trump with 37 criminal counts relating to his “hoarding” of government documents after he left the White House, said The New York Times. The document included images of boxes of files apparently being stored in his Mar-a-Lago estate’s ballroom and a bathroom.\n\nHe was arraigned in June, and pleaded not guilty to all the counts against him. His valet, Walt Nauta, has also been accused of trying to obstruct the FBI’s investigation by moving the boxes. He too has pleaded not guilty.\n\nWhat happens next: A federal judge has scheduled the trial to start on 20 May 2024. It will take place in Fort Pierce, Florida, ordered Judge Aileen Cannon. Trump’s campaign team welcomed the date, with a spokesperson saying “the extensive schedule allows President Trump and his legal team to continue fighting this empty hoax”.\n\nWhen the federal trial takes place is “crucial”, said NPR, because “it could coincide with the 2024 presidential election”. It is significant that the case has been assigned to Cannon as she was a Trump appointee who has “previously faced criticism after ruling in Trump’s favor in a separate legal dispute related to the classified records”, said CNBC.\n\nSignificance: The classified documents case is “not as serious as Trump’s attempts to overturn the election”, said The Atlantic’s Graham, “but it’s probably a solid bronze medal” on the list of the most serious challenges against the former president. And it may be “the most open-and-shut case”.\n\nHush money\n\nThe case: Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is investigating whether Trump broke campaign finance laws in connection to hush money that was allegedly paid to two women in 2016.\n\nOne of the women, former adult film star Stormy Daniels – whose real name is Stephanie Clifford – claims that Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, paid her $130,000 “in exchange for her silence” about an alleged sexual encounter with the former president in 2006, said the BBC. Trump has denied ever having had sex with Daniels.\n\nHe was indicted on 30 March, and pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nWhat happens next: A criminal trial is scheduled to start on 25 March 2024. “An atypically near silent” Trump was “visibly taken aback” when the date was announced in May, said Deadline.\n\nNew York Judge Juan Merchan also issued the “loose-lipped defendant” with a protective order, prohibiting him from sharing any material he or his lawyers see during the discovery stage on “any news or social media platforms” without approval from the court.\n\nIf he’s found guilty, Trump would face a maximum sentence of 136 years, four for each of the 34 charges. But “neither the indictment itself nor a conviction would prevent Trump from running for or winning the presidency in 2024”, said The Associated Press.\n\nSignificance: Whatever happens next, this case will go down in history as the first time that a former US president had criminal charges brought against them. But whether it’ll dampen his chances in another run for the presidency remains to be seen.\n\nIf anything, Trump’s indictment “galvanised” his support base, “which believes this is a politically-motivated pursuit”, said Kelner at Sky News.\n\nFraud allegations\n\nThe case: New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing 16 defendants, including Trump and his children Eric and Donald Jr, for allegedly overinflating the value of a number of the former president’s properties and assets, including the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and Trump Tower in New York.\n\nCourt filings by lawyers for James, made public in August, allege that in 2014 Trump inflated his net worth by as much as $2.2 billion. The document claimed that corrections to financial statements for the 10-year period in question would reduce Trump’s stated net worth by “17-39% in each year, or between $812 million to $2.2 billion, depending on the year”, reported CNN.\n\nTrump denies wrongdoing and has described the civil lawsuit as a “witch hunt”. An appeals court in June dismissed the claims that had been brought against his daughter Ivanka.\n\nWhat happens next: Trump’s request to delay the 2 October trial was rejected in March. He was deposed on 13 April, in a session that sources told The New York Times was “neither overly combative nor polite”.\n\nIf they are found guilty, the defendants could be required to pay back the estimated $250 million that they allegedly received in financial benefits from the fraudulent valuations. The Trumps could be prevented from serving as officers or directors of a New York corporation, and the former president could be blocked from purchasing any commercial property in New York state for a five-year period.\n\nSignificance: James’s civil fraud allegations against the Trumps “could destroy the family dynasty”, said indy100. She “is trying to banish Trump and his family from doing business in their longtime home state”, which the former president will “doubtless” be “unhappy” about, said The New Yorker’s John Cassidy. But “he’s probably more worried about his other legal challenges”.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "The Week Staff", "Richard Windsor", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/04/25"}]}

Revisit with us the most memorable moments of pop culture in 2022 – the good, the bad and the cringe-y.\n\nBad Bunny dominated\n\n“Un Verano Sin Ti” has charted since its May release and it’s full of both bangers and songs to play while you’re recovering from headbanging. Bad Bunny has been the world’s most-streamed artist on Spotify for three years in a row. Not to mention, Benito es que lindo.\n\nBeyoncé partied like it’s 1977\n\nThis year, Queen B …\n\n… broke the record of most Grammy nominations earned by a woman!\n\n… finally released a pure dance album with “Renaissance,” her best work in years!\n\n… cemented her status as a bonafide gay icon! Welcome!\n\nTaylor Swift broke records (and hearts)\n\nNow in her “Midnights” era, Swift’s new album of late-night musings was one of the best-selling albums of the year. Our sincere apologies to our Swiftie readers who couldn’t score tickets to her upcoming tour, but maybe you can join the brewing class-action lawsuit against Ticketmaster for making that process so difficult?\n\nJulia Fox ascended to infamy\n\nShe was Josh Safdie’s muse in “Uncuh Jahms.” Now she regularly makes news for wearing jeans as a crop top, doing her own dramatic black eyeshadow or posting very frank TikToks about her short-lived relationship with Kanye West. A celeb this candid only comes around once in a generation – let’s cherish her.\n\nTV had fantasy fever\n\nThe Targaryens returned to TV this fall with \"House of the Dragon,\" a prequel to HBO's hit series \"Game of Thrones.\" Ollie Upton/HBO\n\nWith new additions to the canons of “Game of Thrones,” “Star Wars,” “Lord of the Rings” and Anne Rice’s “Interview with the Vampire,” viewers went gaga for genre TV this year. There were hits. There were misses. There were projects so controversial among fans that the critical consensus is still unknown. But most of all, there were dragons, elves, vampires and jaded former Jedi.\n\n‘Don’t Worry Darling’ drama delighted\n\nThe cast of \"Don't Worry Darling,\" including Florence Pugh (second from left) and Harry Styles (second from right), turned heads at the Venice Film Festival. Stephane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty Images\n\nDidn’t see the movie; didn’t need to. The behind-the-scenes drama fed us for months – Olivia Wilde falling for Harry Styles onset and maybe falling out with one “Miss Flo,” Chris Pine dissociating at the Venice premiere, SPITGATE! – and eclipsed the film itself.\n\nAI art became ubiquitous\n\nAll-powerful AI tool Dall-E turned word salad into art, giving us the power to create such important images as “a bottle of ranch dressing testifying in court” or “emo sausage roll sat at a bus stop in the rain, waiting for a bus that might never arrive.” Meanwhile, Lensa gave us weirdly sexy celestial profile pics – which some digital artists said ripped off their work. Maybe we should leave art to the humans.\n\n‘Corn Kid’ popped\n\nAmerica has a new favorite kid: His name is Tariq, he’s 7 and he popped into our hearts earlier this year when he professed his effervescent love for corn on the digital series “Recess Therapy.” He loves corn so much that he was tapped by Green Giant to help hand out thousands of cans of his favorite food ahead of Thanksgiving. We can’t imagine a more beautiful thing!\n\nTwitter almost collapsed\n\nRemember that one night in November when we all thought Twitter was dying, and then it miraculously remained online anyway? The drawn-out demise of Twitter feels a bit like that one scene in “Titanic” – we’re all on the deck, furiously playing the violin as we go down with the ship. Some of us have used Twitter for over a decade – we’ve grown up with it! – and are not yet ready to abandon its memes.\n\n‘Funny Girl’ had a casting fiasco\n\nThe abrupt replacement of Beanie Feldstein with Lea Michele in Broadway’s “Funny Girl” revival turned us all into musical theater insiders. Everything about it was controversial – Feldstein didn’t have the voice for the iconic role of Fanny Brice, but Michele has been accused of abusive treatment toward her co-stars. The only true winner here is the OG Fanny herself, Barbra Streisand.\n\nElmo beefed with Rocco\n\nCan you believe our obsession with Elmo’s one-sided feud with Rocco the rock originated THIS YEAR? The hostility between a lovable toddler Muppet and an inanimate stone reached the adult masses at the beginning of the year and delighted us, maybe even more than it delighted “Sesame Street’s” child viewers.\n\nWordle had us addicted\n\nFirst this simple yet inventive word game was free. Then the New York Times bought it. It’s still free – for now. Enjoy while you can. At least the days of people sharing their scores daily are over.\n\n‘Abbott Elementary’ warmed our hearts\n\nWe got two seasons of this delightful ABC primetime hit in one year! How lucky are we? Quinta Brunson, star and creator of the school-set mockumentary, infuses every bit of her heart and wit into this network gem. Seeing Brunson and Sheryl Lee Ralph, who plays veteran teacher Barbara, accept Emmys for their work was sweet and much-deserved.\n\nThe Try Guys tried us\n\nPictured are the Try Guys, a group of YouTubers, when they were still a quartet. Noam Galai/Getty Images\n\nDid everyone seriously know who the Try Guys were before one of their members publicly committed adultery and the remaining Guys condemned him in a very heated video? This YouTube drama broke through in a major way – we covered it; “SNL” even parodied it. All this and we still haven’t seen the Try Guys try anything except our patience.\n\nKanye continues to alienate\n\nWe wish we could forget. Kanye West made several antisemitic comments this year, adding to inflammatory statements he has made in the past. He lost several massive deals because of his remarks (most notably, the Adidas-Yeezy partnership is no more), which have become the last straw for many fans.\n\nThe Oscars slap stunned\n\nWatching this live was BIZARRE. We thought it was scripted until it was very clearly not. The fact that it dominated the news for so long was depressing but maybe a sign that awards shows actually do matter!\n\nSteve Lacy soared\n\nAll it took was TikTok to launch our beloved Steve Lacy into the stratosphere. His hit “Bad Habit” took off on the app and propelled him to a Grammy nomination for record of the year. We’re rooting for you, Steve!\n\nBlockbuster films returned\n\n\"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" was a hit with audiences, even without the late Chadwick Boseman. Marvel Studios\n\nTake it from Nicole Kidman and her sparkly pantsuit in that AMC ad – we go to the movies for magic. This year saw some big blockbusters, from Tom Cruise’s military celebration “Top Gun: Maverick” to Austin Butler oveshadowing Tom Hanks in “Elvis.” Dinosaurs roamed the Earth, Black Panther prowled, Batman brooded, Minions … did their thing, too.\n\nMen played soccer\n\nMaybe you don’t care about soccer, er, fútbol. Or maybe you do! Either way, every four years when the World Cup rolls around, millions of us become bonafide experts – gathering to watch men with thighs the size of our heads run around and chase a little ball. We love it! Go team!\n\nKeke Palmer became a superstar\n\nKeke Palmer ended her whirlwind year with a heartwarming pregnancy reveal on \"SNL.\" Will Heath/NBC/Getty Images\n\nHollywood gods, thank you for Keke Palmer, who has been famous for LITERAL decades (“Akeelah and the Bee,” a classic) but has only recently reached the highest highs of Hollywood. There’s nothing she hasn’t done: talk show host, show lead, singer, meme. But with her role in “Nope,” one of the biggest movies of the year, she has firmly put the A-List crown atop her perfectly laid weave. And she’s ending her year with a jawdropping pregnancy reveal on “SNL.” She can’t lose!\n\nDrake disappointed\n\nOh, Drake. Your music once soundtracked our wildest nights and riskiest texts. But now, on your latest album with 21 Savage, you claim (unprovoked!) that our queen Megan Thee Stallion lied about getting shot? No more aux privileges for you.\n\nBeReal became a thing\n\nWith Instagram transitioning from social media app to virtual shopping mall, how else are we supposed to see what our friends are really up to? Enter BeReal, the new social media app that took over 2022. If you’re not on it, your friend’s friend of a friend probably is – regularly posting delightfully unflattering selfies with their dog. Get in while the getting’s good, before the Facebook Moms find it.\n\nLizzo played a centuries-old flute\n\nLizzo played a crystal flute owned by James Madison, a mashup we didn't know we needed. Shawn Miller/Library of Congress\n\nLeave it to Lizzo to get us interested in an old president’s flute. For a few sweet seconds at her DC show this year, the Library of Congress let her play a few fluttery notes on James Madison’s rare crystal flute. This year alone, Lizzo also won an Emmy, launched a size-inclusive shapewear brand and released a new album. May we all be as productive as her.\n\nYoung Thug and Gunna were indicted\n\nRappers Young Thug and Gunna were among 28 people indicted on gang-related charges in Atlanta, sparking both an internet-wide movement to #FreeYSL and a conversation about the use of rap lyrics as evidence by criminal prosecutors. Gunna entered a guilty plea in December and was released from prison while Young Thug awaits trial. We miss their occasionally unintelligible, always entertaining mumble trap.\n\nZendaya continued to slay\n\nShe won her SECOND Emmy for her role as teen addict Rue on “Euphoria.” She continues to be the best thing about that mess of a program. To be fair, the bar is low. But Zendaya, we love you.\n\nKendrick Lamar returned to rap royalty\n\nIf we won a Pulitzer (hello Pulitzer committee, wake up and smell the talent!!), we would retire to a luxury beach house and never work again. Kendrick had other ideas, dropping “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers,” his first album in five years. Though his song about trans relatives earned both praise and criticism, Kendrick knows all press is good press. We guess we’ll hear from him in another five years?\n\nTakeoff’s death rattled fans\n\nMayor of Atlanta Andre Dickens spoke onstage during Takeoff's Celebration of Life in Atlanta. Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nWhew. This one really hit us, folks. RIP to a real one, a legend, an icon, one-third of the beloved trio Migos. Takeoff was the glue that helped Atlanta’s favorite rap family together, the brainchild behind some of the most quotable lyrics of the decade and the least flashy but still deeply talented member of the group that changed the game. We miss you, Takeoff.\n\n‘The Bear’ stressed us out\n\nRemember when this show came out and everyone kept saying “Yes, chef” and “Thank you, chef”? And suddenly, we all found ourselves a little attracted to a very specific brand of restaurant cook – disheveled hair, tattoos, and definitely not good for us? We can’t lie, some nights, in the midst of cooking dinner, we imagine we’re in the middle of a busy shift, frantically taking orders in between bites of cola-braised short ribs. Mmmm.\n\nKate Bush became a Gen Z favorite\n\nSadie Sink's Max Mayfield needed Kate Bush to stay grounded -- and so did millions of viewers who fell for the British chanteuse. Courtesy of Netflix\n\n“Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)” featured heavily in the fourth season of “Stranger Things” as an anthem that kept Sadie Sink’s Max grounded (literally). The show introduced its millions of viewers to the ’80s indie chanteuse, and they fell hard. Ms. Bush graciously welcomed her legion of new fans, many of whom are decades younger than her hit song.\n\nThe eventful end of 2022\n\nThe last few weeks of the year were especially momentous: We were all glued to our televisions for the “White Lotus” finale, while discussing that death and nitpicking one Gen Z character’s style. We all argued about nepo babies to the point where even said nepo babies chimed in. The Netflix series “Wednesday,” a mystery centered on Wednesday Addams, broke viewing records and had TikTok users doing their own danse macabre to Lady Gaga’s “Bloody Mary.” And Tory Lanez, the Canadian rapper accused of shooting Megan Thee Stallion in the foot in 2020, was found guilty on all charges just days before Christmas.\n\n[“Don’t Worry Darling,” “The Batman” and “Elvis” were distributed by Warner Bros.

Before winning his Oscar for “King Richard,” Smith seemed upset about a joke that Chris Rock told about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, marching to the stage and appearing strike him across the face. Rock looked genuinely stunned, while Smith returned to his seat, shouting words that were bleeped out at Rock.\n\nWiping away tears, Smith during his acceptance speech referenced that the character he played, Richard Williams, protected his family, then said, without specifically mentioning Rock or what happened, “I want to apologize to the Academy. I want to apologize to all my fellow nominees.” He added, “Love will make you do crazy things.”\n\nThe best-picture suspense between two streaming nominees perceived as frontrunners lasted throughout the night. “CODA’s” Sian Heder won for best adapted screenplay, but “The Power of the Dog’s” Jane Campion, the first woman to be nominated twice as best director, later became the third woman ever to claim that prize. (Heder was overlooked in that balloting.)\n\nBased on results from other awards leading up to the Oscars, this was already viewed as a landmark year for streaming services, which, led by Netflix, have steadily chipped away at industry resistance to seeing them as full competitors with major studio releases.\n\nFor all its hard work, though, Netflix didn’t catch the bouquet, as voters went with Apple’s more uplifting story, about the hearing child of deaf parents. Including this year’s contenders “The Power of the Dog” and “Don’t Look Up,” seven Netflix movies have now been nominated for best picture, but thus far none have won.\n\nBest picture: \"CODA\" Apple TV+ Best actress: Jessica Chastain, \"The Eyes of Tammy Faye\" Searchlight Pictures Best actor: Will Smith, \"King Richard\" Chiabella James/Courtesy of Warner Bros.

Despite that decision, the telecast still ran more than 3 ½ hours.\n\n\"Dune\" won multiple Oscars on Sunday, including best cinematography Chia Bella James\n\nThe other big winner of the night was the science-fiction epic “Dune.” Dominating the technical categories, the Warner Bros. film claimed six Oscars for sound, film editing, production design, cinematography, visual effects and Hans Zimmer’s musical score. It was the prolific composer’s second win out of a dozen nominations, the first coming for “The Lion King” in 1995. (CNN and Warner Bros. are both part of WarnerMedia.)\n\nThe televised show underscored the emphasis on bringing more entertainment into the telecast, opening with Beyoncé performing the nominated song from “King Richard” outside the venue, before turning it over to hosts Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes, who gently roasted some of the nominees (“House of Gucci” was referred to as “House of Random Accents”) and taking aim at Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill, promising, “We’re gonna have a gay night.” Sykes later directed a joke at Texas over its voter-registration laws.\n\n\"Encanto\" won best animanted feature film. Disney\n\nDisney’s “Encanto” was honored as best animated movie. Although the film performed reasonably well in theaters, it (and its music) appeared to particularly catch on after making its debut on the studio’s streaming service, Disney+, symbolic of a year viewed as streaming’s awards coming-out party.\n\nSupporting actress and actor represented perhaps the night’s least-suspenseful selections, but were among the most emotional, with Ariana DeBose and Troy Kotsur winning for Steven Spielberg’s remake of “West Side Story” and “CODA,” respectively. Kotsur becomes only the second deaf actor to be honored, following his co-star Marlee Matlin, who was recognized for “Children of a Lesser God” in 1987.\n\nSteven Spielberg, from left, Rita Moreno and Ariana DeBose arriving at the Oscars.

Nevertheless, there was a heightened sense of urgency to streamline the presentation after the Oscars slumped to record-low ratings last year, as did many major award shows.\n\nThe switch only saved a bit of time, which was used on lavish musical numbers – including a colorful rendition of “Encanto’s” song “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” – comedy bits like dropping Schumer from the rafters dressed as Spider-Man, and showcasing “fan favorites” as unscientifically voted on via Twitter.\n\nThe broadcast also incorporated its share of nostalgia, including a 60th-anniversary James Bond movie tribute, cast reunions from “White Men Can’t Jump,” “Juno” and “Pulp Fiction,” and a 50th-anniversary celebration of “The Godfather,” bringing director Francis Ford Coppola, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro out for a standing ovation.\n\nThe latest Bond film, “No Time to Die,” garnered best song for Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell, one of the few awards handed out to a box-office blockbuster, as the industry increasingly splits between popular and prestige fare.", "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "publish_date": "2022/03/27"}]}

For the latest news and updates on the Maui fire and the ongoing evacuations, check out our live updates file for Thursday, Aug. 10.\n\nMAUI, Hawaii − Wind-whipped wildfires in Hawaii forced hundreds of evacuations Wednesday, overwhelmed hospitals and even sent some residents fleeing into the ocean to escape the flames as parts of the popular tourist destination turned into a raging inferno in a matter of hours.\n\nAt least 36 people have died in the Lahaina fire in Hawaii, Maui County wrote in a statement posted to the county website Wednesday evening. Officials said earlier that 271 structures were damaged or destroyed and dozens of people injured.\n\nEntire blocks of homes and businesses went up in smoke in historic Lahaina Town in Maui, where blazes fueled by wind from a passing hurricane were concentrated. In addition, three wildfires were burning on the Big Island, though two of them were at least 60% contained.\n\nActing Gov. Sylvia Luke said residents had been preparing for Hurricane Dora, which skirted south of the islands, and had no reason to expect the quickly developing blazes.\n\n“We expect rain, sometimes we expect floods,'' she said. \"We never anticipated in this date that a hurricane which did not make impact on our islands would cause these type of wildfires.''\n\nPresident Joe Biden said in a statement he has ordered “all available Federal assets” to help combat the wildfires, including Black Hawk helicopters provided by the Marines.\n\nCounty of Maui spokesperson Mahina Martin told USA TODAY the fires are affecting two areas of the island: Lahaina, a residential and tourist area with a commercial district in West Maui, and Kula, a residential area in the inland, mountainous upcountry region.\n\nOfficials said 2,000 travelers sheltered at Maui's Kahului Airport, and another 4,000 visitors wanted to leave the island. The Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu was being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 people displaced by the wildfires.\n\nLocals and visitors scrambled to get information and reach loved ones amid power blackouts and downed cellular and 911 service as well as phone lines in different parts of the islands.\n\nTiare Lawrence, who grew up in Lahaina, was trying to get in touch with her siblings while providing refuge at her home for 14 cousins and uncles who fled the heat, smoke and flames in Lahaina.\n\n“It was apocalyptic from what they explained,” she said.\n\nMaui county officials said multiple structures have burned and multiple evacuation orders are in place as emergency crews battle brush and structure fires. \"It's been an unprecedented incident striking large areas of our island, and it has been pretty much all hands on deck,\" Martin said.\n\nTourists turning around and leaving right after arriving\n\nThe sky over west Maui is hazy with smoke from the devastating wildfires still burning on the island, which continue to displace thousands.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, traffic was at a complete standstill on Honoapiilani Highway, the main road to access Lahaina, as it remains closed. Cars packed with people are parked along the side of the road waiting to return to their hotels or homes, but no time or date has been given yet.\n\nOn Tuesday night, more than 4,000 people − including residents and tourists from two hotels − evacuated to emergency shelters set up by the American Red Cross. On Wednesday, the organization said it was flying in additional volunteers and staff from the mainland to assist with the aftermath of the fires and get people safely to Oahu.Tourists arriving at Kahului Airport are turning around and trying to leave Maui. Alexis and Hector Palomar had their trip planned since May and landed on Wednesday morning.\n\n“We didn’t realize it was happening until we were on our way to the airport. We didn’t think it was that bad until we got here,” Hector Palomar said.\n\nThey immediately changed plans and booked a flight to Kauai, departing just three hours after they arrived on Maui.“Thankfully we’re able to get out,” he said. “I just don’t want to take resources from the locals since it’s an island.”\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\n'Everything is gone': Resident feels lucky, mournful after Lahaina escape\n\nLahaina resident Jordan Saribay knew how fortunate he and his family were to escape the flames around them alive, having merely lost items that could be replaced.\n\nSaribay had seen homes burst into flames “as tall as the buildings because they were engulfing them,’’ debris turn into dangerous projectiles as people whose cars had run out of gas trying to flee while carrying their prized possessions.\n\n“Everything is gone, every single one of our family homes,’’ Saribay said. “The entire Lahaina Town and the entire subdivision of Lahaina – gone.’’\n\nAnd much faster than anyone could have imagined. In a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated a town center that traced its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nGetting out of the danger zone made for a surreal journey of trying to find an unclogged escape route amid blistering heat that caused another car to explode, injuring a woman inside it.\n\n“While driving through the neighborhood, it looked like a war zone,’’ Saribay said. “Houses throughout that neighborhood were already on fire. I’m driving through the thickest black smoke, and I don’t know what’s on the other side or what’s in front of me.’’\n\nWhen he made it out, Saribay felt a pang of emotion seeing Lahaina on his rear-view mirror, wondering what would be left to go back to. “Just praying that a miracle happens,’’ he said.\n\n− Ashley Lewis\n\nGovernor has contacted White House, says 'loss of life is expected'\n\nGov. Josh Green said in a statement Wednesday that he expects to request a Presidential Disaster Declaration from the White House in the next 36 to 48 hours once officials have a better understanding of the scope of the damage.\n\nGreen was planning to be out of state for personal travel until next week but is expected to return Wednesday night to address the crisis. He said while the \"heroic efforts\" of first responders have prevented many causalities, \"some loss of life is expected.\"\n\n“Our state appreciates the incredible outpouring of concern and prayers from the mainland. We won’t forget the aloha you have already begun to share with us,” Green said.\n\nLifelong Maui resident had 'never seen anything like this'\n\nKyle Ellison, born and raised in Maui, returned to his Kula home Wednesday morning and started stomping out flames on the property.\n\nThe previous morning, he heard trees fall down into the gulch behind his house and, when a popping sound went off, he figured it was coming from an electrical transformer.\n\n\"A minute later, I ask my wife if the internet is out and if she can smell smoke.\" Ellison said. \"I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this. I have friends in Lahaina who have lost everything.\"\n\nEllison and his family made it out with one truck full of belongings. Their house is still standing but their neighbors' is not. His wife and children went to the houses of three different friends to stay the night but kept having to move as evacuations spread.\n\n\"I think there are going to be a lot of people hurting,'' he said. \"We already have a housing crisis out here and we lost so many more homes.''\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\nHawaii National Guard activated\n\nLuke and Bissen have issued emergency proclamations in response to the fire. The Hawaii National Guard has been activated and is assisting the Maui Police Department at traffic control points, according to the Hawaii adjutant general.\n\nThe National Weather Service said Hurricane Dora, which was passing 500 miles south of the island chain, and a very strong high pressure north of the state produced powerful, damaging winds through the overnight hours.\n\n\"Very dry fuels combined with strong and gusty easterly winds and low humidities will produce critical fire weather conditions through the afternoon hours,\" the weather service said in a red flag warning for leeward areas issued Wednesday.\n\n'Chaos' trying to find shelter as people left with few possessions\n\nPeople in Lahaina described frantically trying to get to relative safety in one of the nearby emergency shelters. But they weren’t told by anyone where to go – just that they had to leave.\n\nThroughout the night, people were driving aimlessly and following other cars, just trying to head north, as police and firefighters dealt with growing flames.\n\nThe War Memorial Gymnasium in Wailuku opened to evacuees this morning. There is no capacity limit to how many people can stay there. The community has set up cots and are giving away clothing, food and pillows to evacuees. A medical team is checking for burns and smoke inhalation, and to aid anyone with existing conditions without access to medication.\n\nMauro Farinelli and his wife Judit arrived at the shelter around noon. They have lived right on Front Street in Lahaina for four years and described their evacuation as “chaos.”\n\n“No one told us we had to leave, it was getting bad and we had to leave with the clothes on our back,” he said. The couple went to the boat ramp where they were told they could jump into the ocean “if things got bad.” Farinelli said he can’t return home until the electric wires are assessed in Lahaina.\n\n“Nobody thinks it can happen to them,” he said. “Where I lived, it was like there’s no way a fire can get here because I’m not close to vegetation but the wind was so strong, it was like a blow torch.\"\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\n'We just lost a large part of our heritage,' official says\n\nWhile it’s still difficult to assess the damage, state Sen. Gilbert Keith-Agaran cited various landmarks that have reportedly been lost – historic businesses and buildings, temples and cemeteries where royal figures were buried.\n\n“It’s a real loss. Hawaii and Maui have tried really hard to preserve and protect those places for many, many years … not for the sake of tourism but because it’s part of our cultural heritage,” said Keith-Agaran, whose district includes Kahului in central Maui. Lahaina, where the largest fires are concentrated, was once the capital of the Hawaiian kingdom.\n\n“We just lost a large part of our heritage,” he said.\n\nBrush and wildfires are not unheard of in Hawaii’s leeward regions during the dry season. In 2018, Maui suffered a massive brush fire on the same side of the island, primarily on the slopes. “This is so much worse,” Keith-Agaran said, pointing to the scope of the current blaze.\n\n“No matter how much you prepare, you’re not going to be ready for something that moves as quickly and as big as this,” he said. “I don’t think we had enough equipment or people to be fighting fires upcountry, small fires in central Maui and then this huge fire on the west side.”\n\n− Alia Wong\n\nBurn victims sent to other islands\n\nSix patients were flown from Maui to the island of Oahu on Tuesday night, said Speedy Bailey, regional director for the air-ambulance company Hawaii Life Flight. Three of them had critical burns and were taken to Straub Medical Center’s burn unit in Honolulu, he said. The others were taken to other Honolulu hospitals. At least 20 patients were taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center, said Bailey, who was not aware of any deaths.\n\nLuke told CNN Maui's hospitals are overwhelmed with burn patients and people suffering from smoke inhalation and it's been difficult to transport people needing care to other facilities.\n\n“We are already in communication with other hospital systems about relieving the burden – the reality is that we need to fly people out of Maui to give them burn support because Maui hospital cannot do extensive burn treatment,” Luke said. “In addition to dealing with disaster, we're dealing with major transportation issues as well.”\n\nResident of nearby island searching for family in Maui\n\nLeomana Turalde's mother called him on the phone crying Wednesday morning, saying she never went to sleep on Tuesday night in Maui amid the massive fires.\n\nTuralde said he has several “aunties” who live on Maui, two blocks away from Lahaina’s popular Front Street. Wednesday morning, one of the women went missing, he told USA TODAY. It is impossible to get in touch with some people because cellphone infrastructure on Maui burned down, he said.\n\n“Lahaina Town is now burnt down to ashes,'' said Turalde, 36, who runs a sunscreen company. \"Most of the families on Maui, if you never made contact with your family before sunset last night, you’re still trying to figure out where they are.”\n\nHe said he is boarding a plane on Wednesday to Maui from where he lives on the island of Hawaii to help family members search for missing relatives near their homestead property, which he said burned down.\n\n“I’m going to go to the first place that everybody would go to when they’re in trouble, and that’s the house, even though the house isn’t there,” he said. “Home is usually the first place you should start if people are missing.”\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nAll roads to historic Lahaina closed as Front Street burns\n\nAll roads into Lahaina, a town of roughly 13,000, and West Maui have been closed to public use, except for emergency services, county officials said Wednesday. Photos shared by the county overnight showed a line of flames blazing across an intersection in Lahaina and flames leaping above buildings in the town, whose historic district is on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\"Do NOT go to Lahaina town,\" officials warned.\n\nGreen said much of the area \"has been destroyed and hundreds of local families have been displaced.\"\n\nFront Street business owner Alan Dickar told CBS News buildings on both sides of the street in the popular tourist area were engulfed in flames. Dickar said it appeared the fire department was overwhelmed.\n\n\"Maui can't handle this,\" Dickar said. \"A lot of people just lost their jobs because a lot of businesses burned. A lot of people lost their homes. ... This is going to be devastating for Maui.\"\n\nLahaina’s historic Waiola Church and the neighboring Lahaina Hongwanji Mission temple were among the structures that caught fire Wednesday, the Maui News reported. The church was established in 1823, and its graveyard, believed to be the first Christian cemetery in Hawaii, is the final resting place for early members of the royal family of the Kingdom of Hawaii, according to its website.\n\nUncertainty for many residents\n\nBeatrice Hoopai drove for hours in the middle of the night trying to find shelter before ending up at the Warm Memorial Gymnasium. She, her husband, disabled son and two infants were living at Ka Hale A Ke Ola (KHAKO), which is low-income housing, in Lahaina waiting to be told to evacuate as the fires were approaching. A friend told Hoopai a nearby transformer caught on fire and to leave as soon as possible.\n\n“We packed up what we could and left,” she said. “KHAKO didn’t turn on their evacuation, we didn’t know we was going to be evacuated. Nobody told us nothing.”\n\nThe family got in Hoopai’s car and started driving but kept going around in circles as roads were closed. Branches were catching on fire and tin roofs blew past the car, she said. “You could see black smoke, the flames, everything was falling down,” she said. “If you looked back in the mirror, everything was burning.” The ocean was black and eerie.\n\nHoopai has lived on Maui for her entire life and just moved to Lahaina in May. “This is the first time I’ve ever seen anything like this.” Tourists, she said, can lose their luggage but still return back to their homes. But local residents lose their homes.\n\nShe’s worried about what’s next now that the shelter is gone but she’s thankful for her family’s safety.\n\n“You can lose everything but you cannot replace a life,\" she said.\n\n− Kathleen Wong\n\nMaui fires map\n\nTrack the latest wildfire and red flag warnings here with data that is updated based on input from several incident and intelligence sources.\n\nNearly 2,000 people stuck at Maui airport\n\nMartin said the Kahului Airport in Maui has more than 2,000 visitors who have either canceled flights or had nowhere to go. The Hawaii Department of Transportation said Wednesday that about 1,800 people sheltered in place overnight in the airport with many highways on the island's west site still closed.\n\n\"HDOT worked with airlines/TSA to shelter passengers for safety's sake as wildfires continue to burn in Lahaina and upcountry,\" officials said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nNearly 100 firefighters have been on duty, including 11 from state airport rescue personnel, county officials said.\n\nTen public schools in Maui were closed Wednesday, including one that is being used as an evacuation shelter, according to the Hawaii Department of Education.\n\nStudent boarders at Lahainaluna High School were moved Tuesday evening to Maui High School, which was being used as a shelter for evacuees to be picked up by family members or emergency contacts, officials said. The Lahainaluna campus remained closed Wednesday because of a lack of power, wind damage and brush fire evacuations.\n\nAs the brush fire spread to Kihei, officials announced Tuesday that four public schools in South Maui would be closed in addition to schools in West, Upcountry and Central Maui.\n\nHomes destroyed; residents evacuated\n\nThe Coast Guard has been responding to areas where residents are \"entering the ocean due to smoke and fire conditions,\" county officials said. A Coast Guard boat rescued 12 people from the waters off Lahaina, officials said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nLawrence told Hawaii News Now people were running for their lives. She said the homes of everyone she knows in Lahaina have been down.\n\n“It’s just so hard. I’m currently Upcountry and just knowing I can’t get a hold of any of my family members. I still don’t know where my little brother is. I don’t know where my stepdad is,” she said.\n\nIn Kula, at least two homes were destroyed in a fire that engulfed about 1,100 acres, Bissen told The Associated Press. About 80 people were evacuated from 40 homes, he said.\n\nThe Red Cross has opened several emergency shelters for residents. Martin said one evacuation center alone had more than 1,200 people.\n\n\"I am absolutely certain they are very anxious at our evacuation centers,\" she said.\n\nLocal resident could tell something was brewing\n\nAlice Carillo lives about five miles from the fire that erupted in Kula, in a hilly, bucolic region of Maui known as upcountry.\n\nThe 79-year-old woke up in the middle of the night Tuesday to the smell of something burning. She opened the door of her Makawao plantation home, where she’s lived for more than half a century, and “it was like fog out there, so covered with smoke.” She could see a fire above the Kula shopping center.\n\n10 schools closed, including one converted to evacuation shelter\n\nConditions had been especially windy in the days leading up to the blaze, in part because of Hurricane Dora moving south of the island. Carillo could sense something was brewing as the gusts picked up. Now, as she looks out at the mountain, the sky is clear.\n\n“You wouldn’t have even known there was a fire,” she said.\n\n− Alia Wong\n\nWildfire smoke map:See where fires are burning in Hawaii and across the US\n\nThousands without power; 911 service no longer available in West Maui\n\nMore than 14,000 customers in Maui County were without power, according to Poweroutage.us. County officials advised residents to stay at least 30 feet from downed power lines, which at one point restricted travel along parts of Honoapiilani Highway. Part of the highway was reopened Tuesday evening to allow access in and out of Lahaina, but motorists were told to expect traffic to move slowly through the bypass.\n\nIn West Maui, 911 service is no longer available. Martin said it's been \"very difficult\" to manage evacuation orders in Lahaina because the area does not have cell service and only landlines are functioning.\n\nThe island of Oahu, where Honolulu is located, also was dealing with power outages, downed power lines and traffic problems, said Adam Weintraub, communication director for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nStrong winds are fueling the flames\n\nIn Kula, winds were recorded at 80 mph, \"which greatly affected the speed and the movement of the fire,\" Martin said.\n\nBecause of the wind gusts, helicopters weren’t able to dump water on the fires from the sky – or gauge more precise fire sizes – and firefighters were encountering roads blocked by downed trees and power lines as they worked the inland fires, Martin previously told the Associated Press.\n\nA high wind warning and red flag warning for dangerous fire weather issued by the National Weather Service in Honolulu are expected to remain in effect through Wednesday.\n\nMaui fire officials warned that erratic wind, challenging terrain, steep slopes and dropping humidity combined with the direction and the location of the fire have made it difficult to predict its path and speed. The wind can also sends fire embers up and ignite sparks downwind, creating fires far from their source, officials said.\n\n“The fire can be a mile or more from your house, but in a minute or two, it can be at your house,” said Fire Assistant Chief Jeff Giesea. “Burning airborne materials can light fires a great distance away from the main body of fire.”\n\nFires also burning on the Big Island\n\nHawaii County officials said Tuesday that they were monitoring two brush fires burning in North and South Kohala. The fires prompted evacuations and power outages in the area.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency on Tuesday approved the state's request for a disaster declaration to provide assistance with \"the wind-whipped Kohala Ranch wildfire on the Big Island,\" according to a news release from the governor's office.\n\nThe fire, which began early Tuesday, threatened about 200 homes near the rural community of Kohala Ranch, a volunteer fire department, local electrical transmission lines and an AT&T cellular communications tower in the area, officials said The fire was uncontained and had burned more than 600 acres of land when the request for federal assistance was made.\n\nThe release said firefighters battling that fire and the two other uncontrolled fires on the Big Island and Maui \"have been hampered by the winds, which made it impossible to provide aircraft support for their efforts to contain the flames.\"\n\n“We’re trying to protect homes in the community,” Big Island Mayor Mitch Roth said of evacuating about 400 homes in four communities in the northern part of the island. As of Tuesday, the roof of one house caught on fire, he said.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/10/hawaii-maui-wildfires-live-updates/70564588007/", "title": "Hawaii fires updates: Could be state's deadliest disaster", "text": "MAUI, Hawaii − The number of fatalities from the catastrophic fires in Maui reached 55, officials confirmed Thursday. The toll will probably surpass 60 and make the disaster the deadliest since Hawaii became a state in 1959, Gov. Josh Green said.\n\nThe death count continues to climb and parts of coastal communities have been largely destroyed, including the historic town of Lahaina. He referenced the 1960 tsunami that hit the Big Island, killing 61 people, and said: \"This time it's very likely that our death totals will significantly exceed that, I'm afraid.''\n\nGreen also said \"maybe upwards of 1,700 buildings'' were destroyed by the fires, which now appear to be mostly under control. Roughly 1,000 people remain missing, according to Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier.\n\nBut some fires are still burning in Lahaina and surrounding areas. “Lahaina, with a few rare exceptions, has been burned down,” the governor said.\n\nAt an afternoon press briefing, Green said damage to the area is in the billions of dollars and that it will take years to bring about repair. “It’s a profound change of landscape,” Green said of the massive fire damage to the area. He said that footage from the fires will be released late Thursday.\n\nHe pleaded with local hotels and others to come forward and help with the unprecedented need for temporary housing for people in need. He said the state is initially seeking 2,000 rooms for people displaced in the fires.\n\n“If you have additional space in your home, if you have the capacity to take someone in from West Maui, please do,” Green said.\n\nMaui County reported the most damaging of the three blazes, the one in Lahaina on the western part of the island, was 80% contained by Thursday morning, and that another one in Pulehu in central Maui was at 70% containment. There was no assessment yet about the fire in the mountainous Upcountry.\n\nLater in the day, Maui County Fire Chief Brad Ventura said none of the fires are “100% contained right now,” and there are several small fires in between the large fires. There is still potential for “rapid fire behavior” with the weather and told people to remain out of the area.\n\nRescue crews searched for survivors Thursday amid the devastation left behind in Maui by the deadliest U.S. wildfire in five years, which injured dozens.\n\nEntire blocks of homes, businesses and a 200-year-old church were destroyed or damaged in Lahaina Town. In less than two days, neighborhoods from a community that dates to the 1700s turned into smoky rubble, with charred bodies inside burned-out cars and scorched boats in the harbor as the grim remnants.\n\nThe fires − fueled by wind from passing Hurricane Dora and exacerbated by overly dry vegetation from the ongoing drought − were so intense that the Coast Guard rescued 14 people who fled into the ocean to escape flames and smoke, including two children.\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode. Search and rescue is still a primary concern,” said Adam Weintraub, a spokesperson for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency. Officials said they will provide daily updates on all AM and FM radio channels at 9 a.m., noon, and 3 p.m. Hawaii time.\n\nNot since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 and wiped out the town of Paradise, had a U.S. community endured such a deadly wildfire. The Hawaii toll is expected to rise as rescuers get to parts of the island that have been been unreachable because of fires or obstructions.\n\nWildfires were also still burning on the Big Island, but no injuries or destroyed homes had been reported, Mayor Mitch Roth said.\n\nMaps, before-and-after images of the destruction in Hawaii caused by Maui fires\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode.

Before delivering a speech in Salt Lake City, Biden addressed the catastrophic fires and said: “We’ll get aid into the hands of people who desperately need the help. Anyone who’s lost a loved one or whose home has been damaged is going to get help immediately.’’\n\nFederal aid will be available to support state and local recovery efforts after Biden made the declaration.\n\n\"Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,\" according to a statement from the White House.\n\nBiden said he instructed FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, who is expected to arrive in the state Friday, to streamline help processes. He encouraged those who want to find out if they're eligible for federal help to get information at disasterassistance.gov.\n\nCrowdsourcing effort helps friends, relatives reconnect\n\nTwo days after rapidly spreading wildfires began tearing through areas of Maui, some families and friends still haven't heard from loved ones believed to be living or traveling there. They’ve taken to a crowdsourced online effort to locate hundreds of people as of Thursday morning because power outages and loss of cellphone signal have left them out of contact.\n\nA spreadsheet created by resident Ellie Erickson and shared widely on social media showed people from around the globe trying to reach those they know on the island, local station KHON2 reported.\n\n“I really hope that it can be kind of a place where if people are wondering about their friends, their loved ones, if they know somebody is safe they can come onto here and hopefully just give people peace of mind,” Erickson told the station.\n\nMany of the names on the list had been accounted for, scattered at emergency shelters, the airport or turning up with family members. But hundreds of people were still marked “not located” Thursday, and more were being added.\n\nAlexis Plume, a resident of Haiku – about 34 miles from Lahaina – was finally able to call her brother’s best friend in Lahaina Thursday morning. Plume said communication had not been possible with them because of disrupted cell phone service in the area.\n\n‘It’s a real big relief,” Plume said. “Everything is really hard to watch and we’re all just sort of trying to figure out what we can do.”\n\nNetblocks, a cybersecurity company, has been monitoring the network connectivity and found Lahaina still remains largely disconnected as of Thursday.\n\n“It's crucial to remain patient if you're trying to reach loved ones in the region,” Alp Toker, founder and director of the company, said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Connectivity challenges may make communication sporadic but rescue efforts are ongoing so don't lose hope.”\n\n− Jeanine Santucci & Itzel Luna\n\nFamilies with nowhere else to go; concerns for the homeless\n\nOn Thursday, Leomana Turalde was at Maui's Maalea Harbor, about 16 miles east of the worst damage at Lahaina, where he was headed to help find missing people. “In every parking lot on the island” it seemed there were families sleeping in their rental cars Thursday morning with nowhere else to go, he said.\n\nThere were still some small fires burning throughout Maui on Thursday, Turalde, 36, told USA TODAY. There was also heavy traffic around National Guard checkpoints and chain stores are shut down, he said.\n\nTuralde said he's most worried about friends and one cousin who are homeless.\n\n“They’re all devastated,” he said. “If I can help out those people, that’s kind of my main concern because nobody really cares about the homeless person with no ID.”\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nWhat travelers should know about the Maui wildfires\n\nHawaii's tourism arm is encouraging travelers with trips planned to areas impacted by the wildfires to reschedule if possible.\n\n“All nonessential travel to the Island of Maui is strongly discouraged,” acting Hawaii Gov. Sylvia Luke wrote in an emergency proclamation Wednesday, which extended the emergency period until Aug. 31.\n\nThe state of emergency is in effect for the entire state, though so far the fires have been limited to Maui and the northwest part of the Big Island of Hawaii.\n\nTravel to other parts of the Big Island is still welcome, as well as to Kauai, Oahu, Molokai and Lanai. Travelers can check with their specific hotels and airlines for special waiver policies amid the wildfires.\n\n− Eve Chen\n\nOfficials work to suppress fire, restore power\n\nEvacuation efforts have been complicated by power blackouts, a lack of cell service, the loss of 911 service and downed power lines in different parts of the islands. More than 11,000 customers remained without power Thursday according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, commander general of the Hawaii Army National Guard, said Wednesday night that officials were working to restore communication, distribute water and possibly add law enforcement personnel. He said National Guard helicopters had flown for 13 hours and dropped 150,000 gallons of water on the fires.\n\nCounty officials said three active fires on Maui remained unchanged at the end of the day Wednesday. Firefighters have been dealing with multiple flareups and have requested additional personnel from Honolulu.\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono said the priorities include fire suppression and restoring telephone access and electrical power as search and rescue efforts continue.\n\n“This is truly an all hands on deck situation,” Hirono said.\n\nTourists and residents fleeing to Maui airport\n\nAbout 11,000 visitors flew out of Maui on Wednesday, and at least another 1,500 expected to leave Thursday, according to Ed Sniffen, state transportation director. The Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu was being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 people displaced by the wildfires.\n\nLahaina resident Jordan Saribay saw homes burst into flames “as tall as the buildings because they were engulfing them.’’ Debris turned into dangerous projectiles as people whose cars had run out of gas tried to flee while carrying their prized possessions, he said.\n\n“While driving through the neighborhood, it looked like a war zone,’’ Saribay said. “Houses throughout that neighborhood were already on fire. I’m driving through the thickest black smoke, and I don’t know what’s on the other side or what’s in front of me.’’\n\nFirefighters could see some relief with winds letting up\n\nThe high winds fueling wildfires began to wane late Wednesday and will continue to ease during the day Thursday and into Friday, providing some much needed relief for firefighters battling the blazes, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr told USA TODAY.\n\nZehr said wind gusts Thursday could occasionally get to 30-35 mph; local peaks of 40 mph were possible. Later in the day and into Friday, that should ease further with gusts not getting over about 20 mph.\n\n“It should be better conditions now for today, easier for the firefighters to be able to do what they need to do and hopefully get some better control over these fires,” Zehr said.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nWhy devastated Lahaina Town is such a cherished place on Maui\n\nResidents and visitors are mourning the loss of cultural and religious sites in Lahaina Town that trace their roots back centuries.\n\nLahaina, which was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, has a population of around 13,000, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. Lahaina Town has also long claimed home to the largest banyan tree in the U.S., which was scorched by the fires.\n\nFor Francine Hollinger, a 66-year-old Native Hawaiian, losing Lahaina was \"like losing a family member.\"\n\nIn just a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated the town center, which traces its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n“Lahaina Town is now burned down to ashes, the whole entire town − hotels, buildings, the historic sites,'' said Leomana Turalde, who said his mother worked for years as a dancer at Old Lahaina Luau, considered a \"well-preserved epicenter of Hawaiian culture and storytelling,\" according to its website.\n\nHow drought helped fuel Hawaii wildfires\n\nMuch of the state is in varying levels of drought, and parts of Maui are affected by moderate and severe drought conditions, including some areas around Lahaina, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. An estimated 263,948 Hawaii residents are living in drought areas, the Drought Monitor said Thursday.\n\nThe duration and severity of droughts in Hawaii have increased over the last century, the National Integrated Drought Information System has warned.\n\nA drought dries out vegetation, adding power to a wildfire, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr told USA TODAY. That risk could continue, as there’s no rainfall expected soon for the part of Maui impacted by fire.\n\n“As long as you’re stuck in this pattern when you’re not getting a lot of rainfall, you’re going to continue to have these problems where it doesn’t take much to start a fire and it takes even less to make it spread,” Zehr said.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nAerial photos show damage in Lahaina, Banyan Court\n\nSatellite imagery and photos from the ground revealed the devastating damage wildfires have done to Maui landmarks including Lahaina's iconic banyan tree, Front Street and Waiola Church.\n\nThe banyan tree, planted in 1873 after being imported from India, was threatened by the fires and suffered damage to trunks and limbs but remains standing, the Honolulu Civil Beat reported.\n\nWhat caused the Maui fires?\n\nHigh winds and low humidity likely contributed to the fires, but officials know little else, Hara said at a briefing Wednesday. Hurricane Dora, a Category 4 storm in the Pacific Ocean, fueled the strong winds overnight in Maui, with gusts of 60 mph damaging homes and knocking out power.\n\nBut some experts said they suspect human development on the island is at least partly to blame for the destruction.\n\nWildfires have quadrupled in Hawaii in recent decades, and many scientists say the culprit is unmanaged, non-native grasslands planted by plantations and ranchers and others unfamiliar with the island's native ecosystems. The grass is dry and prone to fires.\n\n“There is no doubt that fire-prone grasses have invaded drier Hawaiian ecosystems and brought larger, more intense fires,” said Peter Vitousek, a professor of earth sciences at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nMaui death toll climbs\n\nAt least 36 people have died in the Lahaina fire in Hawaii, Maui County wrote in a statement posted to the county website Wednesday evening.\n\nSix patients were flown from Maui to the island of Oahu on Tuesday night, said Speedy Bailey, regional director for the air-ambulance company Hawaii Life Flight. Three of them had critical burns and were taken to Straub Medical Center’s burn unit in Honolulu, he said. The others were taken to other Honolulu hospitals. At least 20 patients were taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center, said Bailey.\n\nMaui fire map\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\n'Maui Strong': Here's how to help Hawaii fire victims\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, from the Hawaii State Department of Defense, asked those who want to donate supplies or volunteer to do so through the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency. James Kunane Tokioka, director of the department of business, economic development and tourism, said the governor has also asked people with vacant homes or vacation rentals to provide shelter for those in need.\n\nSeveral shelters are open to assist those on the islands and several local organizations are collecting donations. USA TODAY compiled resources for Americans to help people and animals in Hawaii here.\n\nBy Wednesday, the Hawaii Community Foundation said its Maui Strong Fund had raised more than $1 million to support residents affected by the wildfires. Funding will be used for \"evolving needs, including shelter, food, financial assistance and other services as identified by our partners doing critical work on Maui,\" the foundation said in a statement.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Ashley Lewis and Kayla Jimenez, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/11/maui-hawaii-fire-live-updates/70573053007/", "title": "Number of Maui wildfire deaths rises to 80: Live updates", "text": "Editor's note: This file is based on the news of the Hawaii wildfires on Friday, Aug. 11. For the latest news and updates on the Maui fire, check out our live updates file for Saturday, Aug. 12.\n\nThe number of deaths resulting from the fires on the island has risen to 80, according to a statement by Maui County on Friday.\n\nThe number of confirmed fatalities in the 9 p.m. announcement increased from the previous figure of 67.\n\nA fire that caused an evacuation in Kaanapali was completely extinguished by 8:30 p.m.\n\nThe fire occurred in an area where a county fueling station was set up to distribute about 3,000 gallons of gasoline and 500 gallons of diesel fuel for about 400 waiting vehicles. Fuel would not be distributed on Saturday, the county said in a statement.\n\nNew fire prompts Friday night evacuation on Maui\n\nPolice say a new fire burning on the Hawaii island of Maui has triggered the evacuation of a community to the northeast of the area that burned earlier this week.\n\nThe fire prompted the evacuation of people in Kaanapali in West Maui on Friday night, the Maui Police Department announced on social media. No details of the evacuation were immediately provided.\n\nTraffic was halted earlier after some people went over barricaded, closed-off areas of the disaster zone and \"entered restricted, dangerous, active investigation scenes,\" police said.\n\nIn an earlier post on Facebook Friday, police said many people were parking on the Lahaina Bypass and walking into nearby areas that were \"locked down due to hazardous conditions and biohazards.\" Police warned violators could face arrest.\n\n\"This area is an active police scene, and we need to preserve the dignity of lives lost and respect their surviving family,\" the post said.\n\nDeath toll in Maui fire disaster rises to 67 amid questions about warning system\n\nThe death toll from the Maui wildfire climbed to 67 Friday as Maui fire crews battled blazes still scorching parts of the island and rescue workers searched for about 1,000 people reported missing as questions began to swirl about Hawaii's emergency warning system.\n\nConfirmed deaths from the inferno that erupted Tuesday − fueled by winds from Hurricane Dora and exacerbated by overly dry vegetation from the ongoing drought − now officially make the Maui natural disaster the worst that Hawaii has seen since becoming a state in 1959.\n\nThere is still no end in sight. Cadaver-sniffing dogs were brought in Friday to assist the search for the dead, Maui County Mayor Richard Bissen Jr. said.\n\nThe death toll of 67 surpasses the state’s deadliest previous largest natural disaster, a 1960 tsunami that killed 61 people. An even deadlier tsunami in 1946, prior to Hawaii's statehood, killed more than 150 on the Big Island. The 1946 tsunami prompted the development of the territory-wide emergency system that includes sirens, which are sounded monthly to test their readiness.\n\nBut many fire survivors in this week's conflagration said in interviews that they didn’t hear any sirens or receive a warning that gave them enough time to prepare, realizing they were in danger only when they saw flames or heard explosions nearby.\n\n“There was no warning. There was absolutely none. Nobody came around. We didn’t see a fire truck or anybody,” said Lynn Robinson, who lost her home in the fire.\n\nThousands of people have been displaced, more than 1,700 structures have been destroyed, and the historic town of Lahaina was leveled.\n\n\"Without a doubt, it feels like a bomb was dropped on Lahaina,” Gov. Josh Green said after walking the ruins of the town with the mayor.\n\nGreen said the state is initially seeking 2,000 rooms for people and asked local hotels and others to help provide temporary housing for those in need.\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode. Search and rescue is still a primary concern,” said Adam Weintraub, a spokesperson for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nWidespread power and cellular outages have complicated evacuation efforts, and some residents who escaped the flames questioned why Hawaii's famous emergency warning systems didn't alert them as the blazes approached.\n\n\"We got warned, but the wind was faster,\" Leomana Turalde, a 36-year-old who runs a sunscreen company and has family who lived in Lahaina Town, told USA TODAY. \"I found out on social media. But there was no real warning.\"\n\nThomas Leonard, 74, told the Associated Press he didn't know about the fire until he smelled smoke. The retired mailman from Lahaina tried to flee in his Jeep but abandoned his vehicle when nearby cars started to explode. He took refuge behind a seawall for hours before being rescued by firefighters.\n\nHawaii AG announces 'comprehensive review' of wildfire decisions\n\nHawaii Attorney General Anne Lopez announced in a statement Friday that her office will conduct a “comprehensive review” of decisions and polices related to the wildfires this week.\n\n“The Department of the Attorney General shares the grief felt by all in Hawaiʻi, and our hearts go out to everyone affected by this tragedy,” Lopez said in the statement. “My Department is committed to understanding the decisions that were made before and during the wildfires and to sharing with the public the results of this review. As we continue to support all aspects of the ongoing relief effort, now is the time to begin this process of understanding.\"\n\nHawaii Gov. Josh Green told CNN earlier Friday that he had authorized a review of the state’s response, but power outages and phone network issues were disrupting the efforts.\n\nThe announcements come after some people in Maui said they didn’t hear alarms or warnings about the fire. There are also questions about whether the area had adequate resources to deal with the disaster.\n\nFriends and family still struggle to reach loved ones\n\nAnna Del Castello has been trying to learn more about the situation on the ground in West Maui, where she has a home and “quite a few” friends, but the San Francisco property manager told USA TODAY that Hawaii officials are not providing enough useful information, particularly for longtime residents on the ground who are “in a crisis right now.”\n\n“I’m finding out everything from Facebook and people’s comments, which is just crazy,” said Del Castello, 47, who visits West Maui every year. She has a family home two blocks away from Kapalua Airport that her father, a Pearl Harbor veteran, built in the 1980s.\n\nShe has not been able to get in touch with her tenant who lives there yet, she said. Del Castello believes the house is likely still standing because the fires stopped several miles south of it, according to the fire maps, she said. But cell service is still shoddy, she said, and residents near there have had to walk to nearby beaches just to text loved ones that they’re okay.\n\nDel Castello said emergency management officials need to get cellphone towers up and running more quickly and help devastated residents on the ground communicate with the outside world. “To me, it really feels like the priorities are not right,” she said.\n\nSome have taken to a crowdsourced online spreadsheet to locate hundreds of people created by resident Ellie Erickson and shared widely on social media. As of Friday, over 1,500 names on the list were still marked \"not located.\"\n\nLahaina residents return to devastated remains of town\n\nFor the first time since the raging wildfires, Lahaina residents were allowed back to their town on Friday – only to be met with a scene of ash-ridden devastation.\n\nNearly every building on Front Street, the economic center of the island and heart of the community, was leveled to debris, according to Associated Press journalists who saw the area. Burnt remains from dozens of cars that didn’t make it out of the fires stood still in a frozen traffic jam.\n\n“It hit so quick, it was incredible,” Lahaina resident Kyle Scharnhorst told the AP as he surveyed the damage to his apartment complex Friday. “It was like a war zone.”\n\nWest Maui remains without power and water, officials said, and search efforts continue in Lahaina for victims of the fire. Across the island, about 1,000 people remain missing, and parts of Lahaina are burned to the ground.\n\nThere will be a daily curfew from 10pm-6am Hawaii time in the historic Lahaina town and other areas affected by the fire, Maui County officials said in a statement. Access to Lahaina will be limited “until hazardous conditions improve.”\n\nResidents will be required to show identification to prove they live in West Maui, and visitors will be asked for proof of their hotel bookings. Access to Lahaina will be closed daily during curfew hours.\n\nWater in Lahaina, Upper Kula may be contaminated from fire damage, officials warn\n\nThe Maui County Water Department warned residents of Lahaina and Upper Kula that water may be contaminated from fire damage.\n\nStatements on Friday said people in Lahaina and Upper Kula should not use tap water for drinking, cooking, or brushing teeth. For showers, officials said to use lukewarm water, limit length and ventilate the area.\n\nThe warning comes after a swift blaze destroyed some structures in the water systems, officials said, and some areas lost water pressure, which can cause harmful contaminants to enter the system.\n\nPotable water tanks in Lahaina and Kula are available for residents to fill containers with a maximum capacity of five gallons.\n\nThe notice is in effect \"until test data is available,\" the statement said.\n\nCoast Guard rescues 17 people in search across water\n\nIn an hours-long search across more than 450 square nautical miles, the US Coast Guard said in a statement Friday that it has rescued 17 people after the blaze sent some people fleeing into the ocean to escape the fire.\n\nAnother 40 survivors were found and assisted to shore, the agency added. There are currently no confirmed missing people in the water.\n\nThe Coast Guard said it plans to “transition to other missions later this evening, unless additional information warrants continuing searches.”\n\nThe agency has been searching for people since initial emergency reports Tuesday evening. Coast Guard officials previously estimated up to 100 people had fled into the water, NBC News reported.\n\nAnyone with information about missing people in the water can contact Coast Guard Sector Honolulu Command Center at 808-842-2600.\n\nLahaina's wildfire risk prompted worry in previous study\n\nLahaina’s wildfire risk is well known. Maui County’s hazard mitigation plan, last updated in 2020, identified Lahaina and other West Maui communities as having frequent wildfires and a large number of buildings at risk of wildfire damage.\n\nThe report also noted that West Maui had the island’s second-highest rate of households without a vehicle and the highest rate of non-English speakers.\n\n“This may limit the population’s ability to receive, understand and take expedient action during hazard events,” the plan noted.\n\nMaui’s firefighting efforts may also have been hampered by a small staff, said Bobby Lee, president of the Hawaii Firefighters Association. There are a maximum of 65 firefighters working at any given time in the county, and they are responsible for three islands – Maui, Molokai and Lanai – he said.\n\nThe blaze is the deadliest U.S. wildfire since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 people and laid waste to the town of Paradise.\n\nPower could be out for weeks in some places\n\nWhile power was restored to some essential services by Friday, officials warned some areas of the island could face power outages for weeks.\n\nThe County of Maui said early Friday morning that power was restored to Upcountry water pumping stations, and that water would be restored in that area after the lines were flushed.\n\nBut Hawaiian Electric said West Maui residents should be prepared for the possibility of \"extended outages that could last several weeks in some areas.\"\n\nCrews would start damage assessments and repairs as soon as areas are safe to access, the electric company said Thursday afternoon. There were about 12,400 customers without power Thursday.\n\nWildfire expert: This was foreseeable\n\nThough officials have said the wildfires sparked and spread so quickly there was little time to warn people, one Hawaii wildfire expert said the tragedy was foreseeable.\n\nElizabeth Pickett, co-executive director of the nonprofit Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, told the Honolulu Civil Beat she co-authored a report nearly a decade ago that identified an increased wildfire risk to Maui, with Lahaina in an extreme risk area.\n\n“We keep hearing from certain elected officials and other people being quoted in the media, ‘we had no idea, this is unprecedented,’” Pickens told the outlet Thursday. “But actually, those of us in the wildfire community, meaning our fire agencies, our forestry natural resource management community, we have long been working to increase our risk reduction efforts.”\n\nPickett said many recommended actions from the report to prevent wildfires have been implemented since its release, but only partially, and much more could have been done.\n\n“It might not have been 100% preventable, but it could have been mitigated. It could have been lessened,\" she said.\n\nThousands flee as officials continue evacuating Maui\n\nAs crews continued to work to evacuate residents, thousands of tourists and visitors to the island left on flights by Thursday evening, officials said.\n\nNearly 15,000 visitors left Maui on airplanes as airlines added flights to their schedules. More than 1,200 people were evacuated from Kaʻanapali-area hotels to the airport.\n\nTravelers were urged to book flights directly with airlines to Honolulu, and to the mainland U.S. from there. The Hawaii Tourism Authority said visitors traveling for nonessential purposes should leave the island, and nobody should travel there unless necessary.\n\nMaui firefighters stretched thin, hampering efforts\n\nThe effort to keep the fires under control could have been hampered by the relatively small firefighting crew in Maui, said Hawaii Firefighters Association President Bobby Lee.\n\nThere are a maximum of 65 firefighters working at any given time, Lee said, out of a total of about 280 personnel. They are equipped with just over a dozen fire engines, with 14 fire stations in the county serving the islands of Maui, Molokai and Lanai, according to the county.\n\nCounty officials said in an update on Facebook early Friday morning that 21 firefighters, seven supervisory personnel and four vehicles from Honolulu were aiding crews in Maui, and an additional nine-member search-and-rescue team was also brought in to help.\n\nHawaii’s siren system didn’t sound during fires\n\nSurvivors of the fires and officials reported there was no activation of the state’s storied emergency warning system, which would have sounded blaring outdoor sirens.\n\nHawaii’s system, known as the All-hazard Statewide Outdoor Warning Siren System, is used to warn residents about emergencies including earthquakes, tsunamis, brush fires, flooding, lava, or terrorist events, according to the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.\n\nThere are over 400 sirens spread throughout the islands, including 80 in Maui County. The state says it’s the largest outdoor warning system in the country and the “largest single integrated Outdoor Siren Warning System for Public Safety in the world.”\n\nHawaii Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Adam Weintraub told The Associated Press that records don’t show the system in Maui being activated Tuesday when fire took over. Instead, alerts were sent out through Maui County residents’ phones, televisions and radios. It’s not clear whether that happened before or after the island was hit with widespread power and signal outages.\n\nMaui Fire Department Chief Brad Ventura said the fire moved so quickly from brush to neighborhoods that it was impossible to get messages to the emergency management agencies responsible for alerts.\n\n“What we experienced was such a fast-moving fire through the … initial neighborhood that caught fire they were basically self-evacuating with fairly little notice,” Ventura said.\n\nIn 2019, Oahu and Maui residents were sent into a brief panic when the outdoor siren system was mistakenly triggered during a training – after a 2018 incident when the text message alert system falsely told the whole state to take cover for an incoming ballistic missile that didn’t exist.\n\nNone of the fires are 100% contained\n\nMaui County Fire Chief Brad Ventura said none of the fires were “100% contained right now.\" Ventura said there are several small fires in between the large fires burning in Lahaina, Pulehu and Upcountry.\n\nMaui County reported the most damaging of the three blazes, the one in Lahaina on the western part of the island, was 80% contained by Thursday morning, and that another one in Pulehu in central Maui was at 70% containment. There was no assessment yet about the fire in the mountainous Upcountry.\n\nVentura said there is still potential for “rapid fire behavior” with the weather and told people to remain out of the area.\n\nWildfires were also still burning on the Big Island, but no injuries or destroyed homes had been reported, Mayor Mitch Roth said.\n\nMaui wildfires death toll will likely continue to climb\n\nMaui County reported at least 36 people had died in the Lahaina fire Wednesday evening. By Thursday, the total had reached 55, and it's expected to continue rising as emergency workers reach parts of the island previously cut off by the fires and other obstructions.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday declared a major disaster in Hawaii, making federal aid available to support state and local recovery efforts. Green estimated damage to the area will likely cost billions and take years to repair.\n\nGreen said the disaster will likely become the deadliest since Hawaii became a state in 1959. He referenced the 1960 tsunami that hit the Big Island, killing 61 people, and said: \"This time it's very likely that our death totals will significantly exceed that, I'm afraid.''\n\nThe Maui fire is also the deadliest in the U.S. in five years. Not since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 and wiped out the town of Paradise, has a U.S. community endured such a tragedy.\n\nCelebrities including Oprah urge support for Maui\n\nThe BBC filmed Oprah Winfrey handing out supplies at the war memorial stadium earlier this week. \"I came earlier, just to see what people needed, and then went shopping because often you make donations of clothes or whatever, and it's not really what people need,\" Winfrey said. \"So, I actually went to Walmart and Costco and got pillows, shampoo, diapers, sheets, pillowcases.\" People magazine noted Winfrey is a part-time Maui resident.\n\n\"Fast X\" star Jason Momoa, who is Native Hawaiian, and Connie Britton, who starred in the first season of \"The White Lotus\" – which was shot in Maui – have also voiced their concerns for the island.\n\nProfessional golfer Collin Morikawa, whose paternal grandparents are from Hawaii, pledged to donate $1,000 to support the rescue efforts in Maui for each of his birdies in the FedEx St. Jude Championship as the tournament got underway Thursday in Memphis.\n\nBefore and after photos show Hawaii wildfires damage\n\nSatellite imagery and photos from the ground revealed the devastating damage wildfires have done to Maui landmarks, including Lahaina's iconic banyan tree, Front Street and Waiola Church.\n\nMaui fires map\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\nHow to help Maui fire victims\n\nMaj.

For the latest news and updates on the Maui fire, please see our live updates file for Monday, Aug. 14.\n\nLAHAINA, Hawaii – The death toll from a historic fire that roared through this Maui community rose to 96 Sunday as teams with cadaver dogs picked through the devastation, marking the remnants of homes with a bright orange \"X\" to signify they had been searched − and \"HR\" to announce where human remains had been found.\n\nA police roadblock kept some residents out of Lahaina, largely destroyed by the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 1,800 homes and structures were leveled, and hundreds of people were still missing. Maui Police Chief John Pelletier warned the search for the dead was far from over and that the death toll probably would rise.\n\nMore than 1,600 people are being housed in shelters, and possibly thousands need someplace to stay, Gov. Josh Green said. State agencies were coordinating with Maui County, the Red Cross, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to move survivors into hotel rooms and vacation rentals, he said, adding: \"Help is pouring in both locally and around the world as our hearts are with the people of Maui.\"\n\nThe death toll surpassed the fatalities in Northern California's Camp Fire in 2018. That blaze killed 85 and destroyed the town of Paradise.\n\nAs of Sunday, the Upcountry/Kula fire that sprawled about 678 acres was 60% contained, Maui officials said in a statement. The Lahaina fire, estimated to stretch across 2,170 acres, is now 85% contained, according to officials.\n\n'IT'S HEARTBREAKING':Without sufficient food and fuel, Maui locals lean on neighbors to survive deadly fires\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎Hawaiian Electric said Sunday it \"brought back online\" more than 60% of customers who have been without electricity since Tuesday and they are working to restore power to about 5,000 affected customers in West Maui and Upcountry.\n\n∎The U.S. Department of State granted a fee waiver for people who lost their U.S. passport book or passport card as a result of the wildfires in Hawaii, FEMA said in a statement Sunday.\n\n∎At least two other fires also were burning on Maui. Damage to Lahaina and other towns in the path of fires that have swept across multiple Hawaiian islands was estimated at close to $6 billion, Green said.\n\n∎Green and the Hawaiʻi Housing Finance and Development Corporation are launching a program to connect property owners who would like to offer rooms, dwelling units, houses or other accommodations with Maui residents affected by the fire disaster. Application forms for the Hawaii Fire Relief Housing program will be available online Monday morning, the housing authority said in a statement.\n\n∎Hawaii has been dealing with wildfires for decades, but this time it will take \"an incredible amount of time\" to recover, Green added. He pledged not to let Lahaina get too expensive for locals after rebuilding.\n\nResidents attend first Sunday Mass since disaster; bishop urges for hope\n\nParishioners in Hawaii churches mourned the dead and prayed for the missing Sunday as communities began looking ahead to a long recovery from last week’s crushing wildfire that demolished a historic Maui town and killed more than 90 people.\n\nThe Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Honolulu celebrated Mass on Sunday at a church in Kapalua — just up the road from fire-ravaged Lahaina — and urged those reeling from the wildfire not to give up hope.\n\n\"How could this be a good, loving God allowing such things to happen?\" the Most Rev. Clarence \"Larry\" Silva asked the congregation, The Associated Press reported. “We need to wrestle with that. The worst thing we can do is to give God the silent treatment. If we are angry with God we should tell him so. He can take it. He will still love us.”\n\nSilva later read a message from Pope Francis that said he was praying for first responders and those who had lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods to the wildfires.\n\nAfter the service, Silva declared \"God loves us in tragedies and good times,\" the AP reported, and urged those present \"to share that faith with others who may lose it or don’t have it so that they can go on and they don’t give up hope.\"\n\nLawsuit filed against utility companies over wildfires\n\nMuch of the state was under a \"red flag\" fire warning when the fires started breaking out Tuesday. No official cause of the Lahaina fire has been determined, but several factors appear to have conspired to create the largest natural disaster in state history.\n\nIt's been a dry summer, and rainfall in Hawaii has declined significantly over the past 30 years. High winds from a passing Hurricane Dora fanned the flames. And climate change has been a recurring theme.\n\n\"This is the first time we’ve ever experienced a wildfire in the context of these dry conditions, global warming, and with the hurricane that is just passing us,\" Green said.\n\nA class-action lawsuit was filed Saturday against utility companies on behalf of victims and survivors. The lawsuit filed by LippSmith LLP, together with Foley Bezek Behle & Curtis, LLP and Robertson & Associates, LLP, alleges that downed power lines owned and operated by Maui Electric Company, Limited (MECO), Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (HECO), Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. (HELCO), and their parent company, Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) \"caused the fire.\"\n\nThe lawsuit, obtained by USA TODAY, also stated that the utility companies \"inexcusably kept their power lines energized during forecasted high fire danger conditions\" ultimately causing \"loss of life, serious injuries, destruction of hundreds of homes and businesses, displacement of thousands of people, and damage to many of Hawai‘i’s historic and cultural sites.\"\n\nHawaiian Electric spokesman Jim Kelly stressed in an email that no cause had been determined and that the company will cooperate with authorities investigating the blaze.\n\n\"Our immediate focus is on supporting emergency response efforts on Maui and restoring power for our customers and communities as quickly as possible,\" Kelly said.\n\nHOW DID THE WILDFIRES START:in Maui? A combination of factors fueled disaster\n\nHow many people are missing in Maui?\n\nOfficials said they do not have a final count of how many people are missing, but some estimates have put the figure at 1,000 people.\n\nTwo bodies recovered from the devastation have been identified using DNA, Maui Police Chief John Pelletier said. He encouraged relatives of people still unaccounted for to visit the family assistance center in Kahului to submit DNA samples, and he expressed frustration at the difficulty in identifying remains found amid the rubble.\n\n\"We pick up the remains and they fall apart,\" Pelletier said. \"When we find our family and our friends, the remains that we’re finding is through a fire that melted metal.”\n\nSen. Hirono: No excuses for tragedy\n\nU.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, speaking Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, addressed claims of residents who said they had little or no warning in the hours and minutes before the fires swept through their neighborhoods. Many locals said authorities were woefully unprepared for the disaster. The state attorney general's review of the disaster will include a look at when sirens were sounded and other actions were taken, the Democrat said.\n\n\"I am not going to make any excuses for this tragedy,\" Hirono said. \"But we are really focused, as far as I'm concerned, on the need for rescue and, well, location of, we know, sadly, more bodies.\"\n\nThe state, she said, is in a period of \"shock and loss.\" She said President Joe Biden called her to pledge his support − and was asked if Biden should declare a climate emergency.\n\n\"We very much need to acknowledge that climate change is upon us,\" she said, adding that \"there are whole states ... where you can't even use the words climate change because they still have a head-in-the-sand attitude.\"\n\nDamage to historic Lahaina 'deeply felt' by native Hawaiians\n\nLahaina dates back centuries and was the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii in the early 1800s. Lahaina was \"a major whaling port and fishing town in the 1800s due to its prime location on whale migration routes, calm ocean conditions and endless days of perfect sunshine,\" the town of about 13,000 people says on its website.\n\nLahaina was home to the sacred Moku‘ula palace, the center of the kingdom and the burial home to many \"ali‘i\" − chiefs.\n\n\"The loss of any ʻāina (land) is deeply felt by our community, but the destruction we’ve seen in Lahaina will be a scar felt for generations to come,\" the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement said in a statement.\n\n'STRENGTH LIES IN OUR PEOPLE':Minister vows to rebuild historic Waiola Church after Hawaii wildfires\n\nWhat do we know about the death count in Maui?\n\nOfficials were searching through the rubble to find answers this week. Residents were being kept away from much of the 5-square-mile area \"full of our loved ones,\" Pelletier said.\n\nHe said the primary objective was to ensure the proper handling and identification of the dead while maintaining the safety of the community and public safety personnel. Hazards remain, such as toxic particles from smoldering embers, he added.\n\nPelletier said residents will not be allowed to return until it has been declared safe by hazmat teams. Anyone entering the disaster area is subject to a misdemeanor crime punishable by up to one year in jail and a $2,000 fine, he warned.\n\n\"We are asking for the public's assistance to please be patient and not rush to return,\" Pelletier said. \"We understand that this is a trying time for everyone, and thank you for your cooperation and understanding as we work through this challenging period together.\"\n\nAgencies join forces to support Maui amid fire disaster\n\nMaui has received an influx of state and federal agency support to assist in disaster relief. As of Sunday, more than 250 people from FEMA were deployed to assist Hawaii, the agency said in a statement.\n\nAn additional 200 members of the Hawaii National Guard are expected to join those on the ground in Maui in the coming days, according to FEMA.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard has been tasked with identifying structural damage to the Lahaina harbor, according to FEMA. The agency is using sonar technology to conduct underwater surveys. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will also assist in clearing up roads and stabilizing electric service, and the Environmental Protection Agency was assigned to household hazardous waste removal.\n\nSince the fires began, the American Red Cross and its partners have provided nearly 2,900 overnight shelter stays, FEMA officials said. The organization and Maui County will run six shelters where people can gather essential resources like food, water, and hygiene kits.\n\nDonations needed after Maui fire\n\nLast week the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement helped start the Kako‘o Maui Match Donation Fund with a goal to match up to $100,000 in donations. The goal was quickly reached and was increased to $1.5 million, which also has been met.\n\nDonations are still being accepted and the council said 100% of proceeds will go to support relief efforts. Information on how to donate can be found here.\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, of the Hawaii State Department of Defense, asked those who want to donate supplies or volunteer to do so through the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency.

Eco-Business wrote that wildfires “drove tourists to flee their hotels” in Greece, while MailOnline said that “1,100 firefighters were tackling infernos plaguing the area of Odemira, Portugal”.\n\nIn northern Canada, more than 20,000 people in Yellowknife were evacuated as fire crews “battled to keep wildfires from reaching the city”, while fires have “charred millions of hectares” across both Canada and the US. As of 15 August, there were more than 1,000 active wildfires in Canada, with 669 deemed “out of control”, said Reuters.\n\nIs climate change fuelling the wildfires?\n\nThis summer has seen “record-breaking heat right across the globe”, reported Channel 4 News’ Fact Check, with China surpassing previous record temperatures and the US “fighting” a combination of flash flooding and heatwaves at opposite ends of the country.\n\nAlthough hot weather and heatwaves “have been around forever”, Channel 4 News added, new research has found the role of human-caused climate change in this year’s heat has been “overwhelming”. The team of scientists behind this research, known as the World Weather Attribution (WWA) initiative, said the heatwaves “would have been ‘virtually impossible’ without climate change”. China’s heatwave was made 50 times more likely due to climate change, for example, with the results “not surprising”, said the scientists.\n\nThe WWA research, however, “did not look specifically at the link” between climate change and the recent wildfires.\n\nClimate change “plays a role”, said MailOnline, because “it is the environment that facilitates the conditions for a wildfire to thrive” – and it’s climate change that is “bringing about more droughts” while creating drier and warmer conditions. But climate change alone “cannot spark a fire – a spark or lightning is still required”.\n\nWhile the global picture is “complex”, Channel 4 News added, there’s clear UN data showing “the amount of time they burn, the area they destroy and their severity are all increasing”. Climate change is indeed “creating conditions for fires to be much more destructive”.\n\nHow can we prevent wildfires from getting worse?\n\nWildfires will increase by up to 50% by 2100, according to research by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and they are expected to become “more commonplace and ferocious over the coming years”, said MailOnline. Extreme fire will happen at a “faster pace” should climate change pass the 2C threshold.\n\nAlthough at-risk countries have increased resources up to four-fold to “suppress wildfires”, said Eco-Business, they’ve had “limited success in containing damage”. Despite this, there are still a number of measures countries can take to combat the threat of wildfires.\n\n“Protecting and restoring degraded forests” is key, as is “limiting illegal and unsustainable land use”. This is in addition to scaling up monitoring and enforcement, as well as “better land-use planning and building rules”.\n\nUNEP has also “urged governments to radically shift their expenditure and invest more” in preventing wildfires. But, ultimately, there’s “no solution for bringing fire frequency back down to historical levels without drastically cutting greenhouse gas emissions”, according to Eco-Business.", "authors": ["Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "The Week Uk", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Richard Windsor", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Staff", "Rebekah Evans", "Julia O'Driscoll", "Fred Kelly"], "publish_date": "2023/08/21"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/962004/hawaii-maui-wildfire-holidaymakers-warned-off", "title": "Should tourists visit Hawaii after wildfires? | The Week", "text": "“Aquaman” star Jason Momoa has joined fellow Hawaiians in urging tourists to stay away from Maui as the island grapples with the aftermath of devastating wildfires.\n\nIn a video posted on Instagram, Honolulu-born Momoa said: “Maui is not the place to have your vacation right now. Do not travel. Do not convince yourself that your presence is needed on an island that is suffering this deeply.”\n\nAlmost 100 people are confirmed to have died in last week’s wildfires, with the death toll expected to rise, and thousands of residents have been displaced. A local forced to flee from Lahaina, which has been particularly hard-hit, told Reuters that the historic coastal town “is burnt to a crisp”, adding: “It’s like an apocalypse.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

And the Maui Economic Development Board has estimated that tourism directly or indirectly contributes to nearly 80% of all income generated on the island.\n\nHawaii’s tourism economy is “still recovering from its pandemic-induced visitor slump”, said The New York Times. Now, “the fires have halted that recovery in its tracks, at least for a while”, on Maui.\n\nAuthorities there have requested people on non-essential trips to leave, and asked others to cancel their plans to travel to the island. In a statement updated on Saturday, the Hawaii Tourism Authority said that travel to the other Hawaiian islands was “not affected at this time” by the wildfires. But visitors bound for West Maui in the coming weeks were urged “to consider rescheduling their travel plans for a later time”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Richard Windsor", "The Week Staff", "Keumars Afifi-Sabet", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2023/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2023/08/31/how-to-visit-maui-respectfully-wildfires/70719807007/", "title": "Tourism needed: How to visit Maui respectfully after the wildfires", "text": "Each morning, Jason and Sabrina Rosenbloom anticipate waking up to new cancellations for their Maui-based eco-friendly kayaking tour company, Gabriel’s Ohana.\n\nNamed after the couple’s youngest son, Gabriel, the small family-run business has lost more than 95% of its bookings since the devastating West Maui fires that started on Aug. 8 and left more than 100 people dead, thousands missing and the historic town of Lahaina in ashes.\n\nBefore the fires, the family would operate full tours of 20 guests at about eight to 10 bookings a day. As of Monday, the business has done only two tours.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the fires, tens of thousands of tourists evacuated the island. Social media messaging soon told tourists “to not travel to Maui” so resources could be used for residents who lost everything.\n\nPeople heeded the call. Images and videos on social media show Maui’s once-bustling – and arguably overcrowded – resorts and beaches nearly empty. To many, it’s reminiscent of the COVID-19 shutdown. The week after the fires, Maui hotel occupancy rates dropped 27.6%. Over the past week, daily passenger arrivals to Maui dropped 80%.\n\nLearn more: Best travel insurance\n\nIt’s all causing a strain for locals who depend on tourism.\n\n“With the unexpected and quick shutdown of the island, our whole household is now without an income,” Sabrina Rosenbloom said.\n\nNow, a few weeks later, many people – including Hawaii Gov. Josh Green – are pleading for visitors to come and support Maui's economy.\n\nThough West Maui, including Lahaina, Napili, Kaanapali and Kapalua, remain closed, the Hawaii Tourism Authority “encourages travelers” to visit other areas of Maui, like Hana and Kihei.\n\nSome tourists are ready to step up and help Maui’s local businesses in need, but it’s complicated to travel to a place where devastation and loss of human life recently occurred. Meanwhile, at stake are the livelihoods of many Maui locals because the island is so dependent on tourism.\n\n“Things are going to be dire soon if travelers don't return quickly,” she said. “What's worse, we have the ability and resources to employ numerous people who have lost jobs due to the fire, but now there is not enough work to help our own family, let alone our neighbors.”\n\nIf Gabriel’s Ohana continues to suffer, the family will default on the loans they took out for their business, won’t make their bills and could lose their home, Jason Rosenbloom said.\n\nMore:How many people died in Maui fires? Officials near end of search for wildfire victims\n\nIs it time for tourists to return to Maui?\n\nMany people are wondering if they should continue with their upcoming trips to Maui. Some have voiced concerns about feeling strange being at hotels alongside families who lost their homes. They worry they’ll be treated poorly in a place with a contentious history with overtourism. Others just canceled their trips altogether.\n\nSome locals and Hawaiians continue to criticize the idea of vacationing on Maui right now.\n\n“First and foremost, we need to acknowledge that what happened was tragic and we can’t pretend that that didn’t happen,” said Ilihia Gionson at the Public Affairs Office of the Hawaii Tourism Authority. The loss from the deadly inferno is difficult to measure and includes many lives, historical and cultural sites and families’ homes.\n\n“The two most important things to pack on a trip to Maui at this time are patience and grace, understanding that people have lost a lot,” Gionson said. “It’s a balance, right? If you just lost your house, we don’t want you to lose your job, too. And there are going to be some people who aren’t ready to return to work.”\n\nHTA is letting the Maui community take the lead on what it needs to heal. The agency has been hosting community gatherings in West Maui, asking its residents “to define what recovery looks like, rebuilding looks like, to the extent that tourism is involved,” Gionson said.\n\nTourists \"should respect the ask from the community to give them their space and give them some time,” he said.\n\nLisa Tam-Hoy Robbins, a Native Hawaiian entrepreneur whose grandfather is from Maui, says asking visitors to spend their dollars at local businesses goes beyond just tourism; it's everyone coming together to support Maui and its people.\n\n“This is how we should approach this matter: Kako'o a Kokua,” she said, referencing the Hawaiian words meaning to \"uplift and help selflessly.\"\n\nHow tourists can support Maui\n\nGionson said encouraging the return of tourism to Maui – with an emphasis on supporting local – is also driven by wanting to avoid “a widespread economic disaster like what we saw during COVID.”\n\nThe agency is working on a resource for people to see which businesses are open and asking for patrons.\n\nAbout 70% of every dollar generated in Maui comes from tourism, according to the Maui Economic Development Board. Visitor spending contributed $14 million to Maui's economy in 2019, millions more than Kauai and Hawaii Island and just slightly behind Oahu.\n\nEconomists called for Hawaii to diversify its economy after the pandemic revealed just how reliant the state is on tourism. There is currently no federal or state relief for Maui businesses affected by the fires, although Jason Rosenbloom is hoping the government would cover employee wages for job seekers and payouts to assist small businesses.\n\n‘We need responsible tourism and we need it yesterday’\n\nTina Toles has a special place in her heart for Maui – she has been there more than a dozen times. The Alabama hairdresser has a trip planned for January to stay in Kaanapali and felt “devastated” when she learned of the fires. Friends who live in Maui told her to still visit.\n\n“It’s kind of a Catch-22,” Toles said. “I feel so sorry for (the Maui community) because it’s a very hard situation. This time, when I go, it’ll be a whole lot different though.” She said she plans on volunteering and patronizing only local businesses when she’s there.\n\n“We’re not going to get a lot of souvenirs. We’re going to be double-tipping and looking for places to donate,” she said.\n\nRosenbloom said it’s a “butterfly effect” if people come to Maui, enjoy themselves and spread the word back home. “They need to learn about aloha, so they take it back to their world,” he said.\n\nGarrett Marrero said he has seen layoffs at Maui hotels and boat companies in the few weeks since the tragedy. As co-founder of Maui Brewing Company, which has three locations on Maui, Marrero said the company is also considering rightsizing. The brewery’s Kihei location has stayed open and recently had two of its slowest days since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nLike many other local businesses, Maui Brewing Company had its boots on the ground to help with urgent needs, like using its Kaanapali location as a community kitchen. Now, it’s shifting its focus back on reopening as “a place to get some good food and grab a beer, gather together and support each other.”\n\n“We need responsible tourism and we need it yesterday,” he said, urging people to volunteer while here or donate to local charities.“If you’re thinking about coming and you’re wondering if it's a good time, you’re already starting down the journey to being responsible.”\n\nKathleen Wong is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in Hawaii.

Kamau Bell” airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET. Watch this week’s episode for more on activist efforts to return Hawaii to Native Hawaiians.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Hawaii most tourists see is one of azure waters and towering resorts, of “aloha” and “ohana” and hula.\n\nBut as it exists now, the powerful tourism industry dictates the lives of Native Hawaiians, often for the worse, said Kyle Kajihiro, a lecturer at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa and activist for the rights of Native Hawaiians.\n\nThe tourism industry in Hawaii powers its state revenue, but that reliance on tourism has resulted in Native Hawaiians getting priced out of their homes, climate change wreaking havoc on the natural landscape, and a lack of respect for the 50th state that is also the ancestral land of more than half a million people.\n\n“I think that it is too easy for people to visit places like Hawaii,” Kajihiro said. “It conditions visitors to feel entitled.”\n\nThe industry must change to improve the futures of Native Hawaiians, Kajihiro told CNN. He’s one of several residents who have worked to educate visitors and return some elements of Hawaiian culture to the people from whom it originated. If visitors to Hawaii decenter themselves and instead take with them respect and a willingness to learn – or choose not to visit at all – then Hawaii may be preserved for the people who have called it home for centuries, activists say.\n\nFor many residents, living in Hawaii is no vacation\n\nTourism is Hawaii’s largest single source of private capital, per the Hawaii Tourism Authority. Even amid the Covid-19 pandemic, it remains incredibly lucrative: In April alone, visitors to Hawaii spent over $1 billion in the islands, according to a state report marking the recovery of tourism since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut what’s profitable for Hawaii’s economy can negatively impact the lives of Native Hawaiians and yearlong residents. To combat drought conditions, residents last year were asked to reduce their water consumption or face a fine while large resorts continued to use far more water. There are millions more annual visitors than there are permanent residents – in 2021, there were more than 6.7 million visitors compared to 1.4 million residents – which can cause carbon emissions to surge and overuse of its beaches, hiking trails and other natural wonders. Hawaii has even been called the “extinction capital of the world” for the number of species who’ve gone extinct or are at high risk of dying out.\n\nThe National Pearl Harbor Memorial is a stop on Kajihiro's DeTours, where visitors discuss the United States' rampant militarization of Hawaii in the 19th and 20th centuries. Daniel Slim/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt also has the highest cost of living in the nation, partly due to the state having to import around 90% of its goods. Its housing market is one of the most expensive in the country, ProPublica and the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported in 2020, and with a large demand for land and a limited amount of it, Native Hawaiians can spend decades waiting to reclaim ancestral land, leading some to move from the islands.\n\n“Tourism normalizes and conceals the current dystopian reality experienced by many Kānaka Maoli and the poor immigrant communities in Hawaii,” Kajihiro told CNN. (Kānaka Maoli is the Hawaiian-language term for Native Hawaiians.)\n\nTo empower Native Hawaiians and return some of their rights, the tourism industry needs to change, beginning with its ethos, Kajihiro said.\n\n‘DeTours’ show the real history of Hawaii beyond the beach\n\nIn an effort to reclaim the histories of Hawaii and educate residents and visitors about the impacts of colonization, militarization and tourism, Kajihiro created the Hawai’i DeTour Project. The program, which he runs with lifelong activist Terrilee Kekoʻolani, aims to “interject a more critical historical account of Hawaii” in hopes that it’ll start conversations about social responsibility and create solidarity with social justice and environmental activist efforts in Hawaii.\n\nKyle Kajihiro, left, and Terrilee Keko'olani offer alternative tours of Hawaiian landmarks to show how colonialism, tourism and militarization on the islands and residents. Marco Garcia/The New York Times/Redux\n\nKajihiro leads DeTours to locations like downtown Honolulu to discuss Hawaii’s former sovereignty; to ‘Iolani Palace, where the US supported a White settler-led coup against Queen Lili’uokalani; to military landmarks like the Pearl Harbor memorial to discuss American efforts to transform parts of Hawaii into military strongholds.\n\nThough Kajihiro doesn’t advertise his services, visitors are increasingly seeking them out. While he prioritizes educational and political groups that can help create change locally, he has seen both residents and visitors on his tours, some of whom go on to become involved in the causes he highlights.\n\n“I guess it could be seen as a good sign that people want to learn and be more responsible as travelers,” he said. “But there are also many people who simply want the novelty of a ‘reality’ tour or seek to assuage their guilt by doing a more ‘socially responsible’ tourism. I’m not interested in giving people permission to visit Hawaii guilt-free.”\n\nOne way to support Native Hawaiians is to not visit at all, some say\n\nTwo educators in Hawaii borrowed the name of Kajihiro’s operation for their book, which also shares his principles. “Detours: A Decolonial Guide to Hawai’i,” co-edited by Vernadette Gonzalez and Hōkūlani Aikau, is no ordinary guide book – it’s a call to action.\n\nThe book is designed to educate readers about Hawaii’s past and present and the negative impacts of colonization, militarization and tourism. Even if readers never make it to Hawaii, the stories transport them to some of the sites Kajihiro leads his groups to. In the introduction to the book, Gonzalez and Aikau write that not all readers will be “invited or allowed to go to all of the places that are described,” and some locales were left out entirely because they’re “not meant for outsiders.”\n\nMillions of tourists visit Hawaii every year, outnumbering its population of 1.4 million. But to secure a sustainable future for Hawaii and Native Hawaiians, tourism must change to emphasize respect and decenter the tourist, activists say. Darryl Leach/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nMany tourists’ relationship to Hawaii is an extractive one, Gonzalez and Aikau write, and that relationship must shift to one of support if the Hawaii tourists know and the Hawaii its residents live in are to continue to exist. Even better, they write, would be choosing not to vacation in Hawaii at all.\n\n“Sometimes the best way to support decolonization and Kanaka ‘Ōiwi (Native Hawaiian) resurgence is to not come as a tourist to our home,” the editors write.\n\nImproving tourism begins with respect for the islands and Native Hawaiians\n\nOf course, there will always be tourists in Hawaii as long as it remains the islands’ top industry – and as long as its beaches beckon to guests with deep pockets. The nonprofit Sustainable Tourism Association of Hawaii connect tourists with local attractions that emphasize cultural and environmental responsibility. The Coconut Traveler, a travel company created by Debbie Misajon, the granddaughter of Filipino immigrants who moved to Hawaii to work on sugarcane plantations, is aimed at wealthy guests and charges a responsible tourism fee, 100% of which goes to local organizations that work to sustain Hawaii’s natural beauty. Recentering the focus of a trip to Hawaii from the guest to the island and its residents might lighten the footprint a tourist leaves there, Misajon told CNN.\n\n“I’m all for coming and enjoying the islands, but (I) encourage people to find ways to be part of the solution,” Misajon said. “It might be trite, but spend your money locally.”\n\nMaking fundamental changes to the tourism industry should begin with returning rights to Native Hawaiians and letting them decide how they want their culture to be shared and consumed, if at all, Kajihiro said. There’s already a model of this in New Zealand, where the Māori people have control over how their culture is represented and experienced by tourists, he said, with an emphasis on mutual respect.\n\n“Let’s abolish the word ‘tourism,’” Kajihiro said. “The very term privileges the consumer, the act of consuming places, and the transactional relationship.”\n\nInstead, he said, visitors should “rethink travel as entering someone else’s home.” Someone who’s a guest at someone else’s home may bring a gift with them or express their gratitude to their host in other ways, he said.\n\n“As a visitor, you have the burden to learn, act responsibly, not be a burden and respect your hosts,” Kajihiro said.", "authors": ["Scottie Andrew"], "publish_date": "2022/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-weather/2023/08/18/hurricane-hilary-rain-storm-updates-arizona/70623192007/", "title": "Hurricane Hilary updates: Live coverage as storm hits AZ, CA", "text": "Arizona Republic\n\nHurricane Hilary is advancing toward California and Arizona, with the potential to bring storms and flooding.

The closure will remain in effect “at least through Monday,” a Park Service advisory said.\n\n“The park has already experienced multiple power and utility outages. Due to a storm event on Friday evening August 18, one marina experienced dock separation and access to the marina, vessels, and fuel is uncertain. This includes access to emergency response vessels and therefore emergency response will be extremely limited, if at all,” the advisory noted.\n\nThe Park Service added that the storm has prevented air support in Clark County, Nevada, making aerial search, rescue or evacuation missions impossible.\n\n“Multiple park areas rely on ‘one road in’ access which have low water crossings and likely will be washed out, disconnecting entire communities from service and rescue,” the Park Service warned.\n\n— Sean Holstege\n\nHilary has claimed its first life\n\nOne person drowned Saturday in the Mexican town of Santa Rosalia, on the peninsula’s eastern coast on the Gulf of California, when a vehicle was swept away in an overflowing stream. Rescue workers managed to save four other people, said Edith Aguilar Villavicencio, the mayor of Mulege township.\n\nWeather authorities in United States have warned about what they called catastrophic and life-threatening flooding in the Southwest. The Phoenix Fire Department sent a search-and-rescue team to Yuma as a precaution and in parts of California, notably in San Bernardino County, authorities have issued stay-home and evacuation orders as the storm bears down.\n\n— Sean Holstege and Associated Press\n\nHilary causing misery at Western airports, including Sky Harbor\n\nAirports throughout California and in the U.S. Southwest have been hard hit by storm-related disruptions.\n\nAccording to data at FlightAware, 165 flights in and out of Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas have been canceled, with another 44 delayed. In San Diego, 44% of flights were canceled, totaling 130 flights. Another 297 flights in and out of major California airports were canceled.\n\nPhoenix Sky Harbor International Airport reported 66 cancelations early Sunday afternoon.\n\n— Sean Holstege\n\nPhoenix Fire crews sent to Yuma to assist emergency response teams\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, the Phoenix Fire Department sent a team of 16 water rescue specialists to Yuma in preparation for intense flooding and increased emergency response due to Tropical Storm Hilary.\n\n\"We know that there's a storm coming so we're just trying to pre-plan and get our resources there to assist other fire departments with an overwhelming response,\" said Phoenix Fire spokesperson Kimberly Quick-Ragsdale.\n\nThe team is supplied with three motorized inflatable boats to prepare for a swift water response and two Jon boats to assist Yuma Fire teams with water rescues.\n\n\"Once they arrive in Yuma, they'll meet with other agencies, their local police, fire, EMS, and they will determine what is needed at that time,\" Quick-Ragsdale said. \"If they need to deploy more resources, we will surely do that.\"\n\n— Ellie Willard\n\nHilary makes landfall over Mexico's northern Baja California Peninsula\n\nThe National Hurricane Center declared that Tropical Storm Hilary made landfall over the northern Baja California Peninsula of Mexico, according to its 11 a.m. Pacific time advisory.\n\nThe advisory stated Hilary was moving northwest at 25 mph.\n\nWhile Hilary was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm, the National Weather Service cautioned that Hilary is still carrying so much rain that forecasters believe it could be “catastrophic and life-threatening.” Flooding is likely across a broad region of the southwestern U.S., according to the weather service.\n\n— Lillian Boyd\n\nCarnival Cruise route modified in Mexico due to Hilary\n\nA Carnival cruise, Panorama, has modified its schedule for the upcoming week due to Hilary's onset.\n\nThe seven-day cruise, which departed from Long Beach, will call on Cabo San Lucas, Mexico on Tuesday instead of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. The call to Mazatlán, Mexico on Wednesday has been canceled; instead, the ship will call on Puerto Vallarta.\n\n\"As the safety of our guests and crew is our priority, we are continuing to monitor the storm and factor in guidance from the National Hurricane Center, U.S. Coast Guard and the local port authorities to provide timely updates to our guests as more information becomes available,\" Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement.\n\n— Ellie Willard\n\nHilary, downgraded, is in California closing parks\n\nWeakened by landfall in Baja California, Hilary has been downgraded to a tropical storm and is now moving north through the California desert.\n\nThere, Joshua Tree National Park and the Mojave National Preserve are closed to visitors in response to Hurricane Hilary.\n\nA flash flood watch is in place for Joshua Tree National Park through Monday at 5 p.m. Park staff said Friday they would spend the next 36 hours initiating the closure ahead of when the storm's worst impacts are expected.\n\n\"Visitors are encouraged to seek shelter and have a safety plan,\" park officials warned in a news release. \"Reconsider outdoor activities for this weekend, be prepared to turn around if you experience moving water on roadways and be alert for lightning.\"\n\n— Sean Holstege and The Desert Sun\n\nWhere did Hilary come from?\n\nHurricane Hilary formed as a tropical storm on Wednesday off Mexico's southern Pacific coast of Manzanillo.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center elevated Hilary to a Category 4 hurricane on Friday morning and reduced it to Category 3 on Saturday morning. By Saturday afternoon, Hilary was reduced to Category 1.\n\nThe storm began moving west-northwest toward Baja California as it strengthened.\n\n— Lillian Boyd\n\nHilary made landfall in the middle of the night\n\nIt looks like Hurricane Hilary has made landfall in Baja California.\n\nSatellite imagery from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shows that the storm clipped the peninsula at Bahia Tortugas, about 350 miles south of Ensenada sometime in the dead of night, possibly around 2 a.m., Arizona time.\n\nIt reentered the Pacific Ocean and then made landfall again in the vicinity of San Quintin, about 200 miles farther north.\n\n— Sean Holstege\n\nWind warnings and storms, but milder conditions for central Arizona\n\nThe National Weather Service is calling for a breezy Sunday with a slight chance of showers in the metro Phoenix area, developing into showers and windy conditions in the afternoon and into the evening.\n\nThunderstorms are possible after 3 p.m. Gusts could reach 35 mph, and the expected high temperature could reach 103, according to the latest weather service forecast. There is a 70% chance of rain, but “new rainfall amounts of less than a tenth of an inch” are called for in the Valley.\n\nBy Sunday night, the low is expected to drop to 79 with winds of up to 20 mph before midnight.

Tropical storm-force winds were expected to reach the international border in Southern California shortly after 8 a.m.\n\n\"Catastrophic and life-threatening flooding likely over Baja California and portions of the southwestern U.S. through Monday.\n\nThe effects of the storm in Arizona will be most felt along the Colorado River and around Yuma in particular.\n\n\"In the Southwestern United States, the potentially historic amount of rainfall is expected to cause flash, urban and arroyo flooding, including landslides, mudslides and debris flows,\" the Hurricane Center warned.\n\nAs of 7 a.m. the weather forecast for Yuma called for thunderstorms, a 75% chance of rain, up to a quarter inch.\n\n— Sean Holstege\n\n'A potentially catastrophic situation': Southern California braces for storm impact\n\nHurricane Hilary roared toward Mexico’s Baja California peninsula late Saturday as a downgraded but still dangerous Category 1 storm, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Phoenix said light showers are tracking over southwest Arizona on Saturday evening. Heavier showers were expected to begin Sunday morning.\n\nIn San Diego, meteorologist Elizabeth Adams said as of 4 p.m. Saturday, Hurricane Hilary was off the coast of Baja California, some 600 miles south of the region. The weather service expects the storm to make landfall sometime Sunday, when heavy rainfall is expected.\n\n\"We have a very serious situation here, folks,\" said Adams, describing the increasing chances and rate of rain that will hit the Coachella Valley and the rest of Southern California's mountain and desert region.\n\nShe said rain in the valley, like in Palm Springs, had been delayed compared with what they were expecting on Saturday afternoon. But the chances are increasing into the evening, and she estimated a likely 3/4 inch of rain for the area Saturday night.\n\nSunday is when conditions are expected to worsen considerably. Sunrise to lunchtime, is when \"precipitation starts to get really heavy,\" she added. The chance of rain increases to 90% to 100% during this period, and about that time, she said the region can expect an inch to an inch and a half of rain in a six-hour period.\n\nDuring Sunday afternoon, Adams said the rate of rain could increase to 2 inches an hour, resulting in possible \"widespread, very life-threatening flash flooding\"\n\n\"This will become a potentially catastrophic situation developing in the deserts and eastern mountains tomorrow afternoon,” Adams said.\n\nShe urged people to pay close attention on Sunday to whether officials announce potential evacuations.\n\n― Desert Sun staff, Lillian Boyd and Associated Press\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom declares state of emergency\n\nSaturday night, as Hurricane Hilary approached the Mexican Pacific coast in Baja California, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California declared a state of emergency.\n\nThe proclamation, released on Saturday afternoon, comes as Hurricane Hilary was classified as a Category 2 storm, with catastrophic flooding being forecast on Sunday for much of the southwestern United States. Meteorologists warned that despite weakening, the storm remained treacherous, with the potential to bring flash floods, mudslides, isolated tornadoes, high winds and power outages.\n\nAccording to the Governor's Office, more than 7,500 personnel have been deployed in response to the proclamation. Hurricane Hilary is expected to make landfall between Saturday night and Sunday morning.\n\nThe forecast also prompted authorities to issue an evacuation advisory for Santa Catalina Island, urging residents and beachgoers to leave the tourist destination 23 miles off the coast.\n\nForecasters warned the storm could dump up to 10 inches — a year's worth of rain for some areas — in Southern California and southern Nevada.\n\n― Fernando Cervantes and Associated Press\n\nValley forecast:Phoenix, Tucson areas to see rain, thunderstorms this weekend\n\nFlooding potential increases for Sunday in Arizona, California\n\nPotential for flooding will increase Sunday for communities in Arizona and California impacted by Hurricane Hilary, according to the National Weather Service in Phoenix.\n\nMuch of Arizona, including most of the Valley, faces a “marginal,” or 5%, chance of excessive rainfall starting at 5 a.m. Sunday. Those areas are shaded green on the map provided by the National Weather Service. Portions of western and northwestern Arizona have a “slight,” or 15%, chance of excessive rainfall, represented in yellow.\n\n“Note, localized heavy rain can occur even in the green areas,” the National Weather Service in Phoenix wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nSouthern California will see a higher risk of excessive rainfall as Hurricane Hilary makes its way up the West Coast.\n\nWinds also were expected to increase Sunday, the National Weather Service said. Gusts of up to 65 miles per hour may be possible along and south of Interstate 8 in southwestern Arizona. Areas of western Maricopa County can expect to see gusts of up to 50 miles per hour, and wind gusts could top out at 40 miles per hour in the Valley.\n\n― Sasha Hupka\n\nHurricane Hilary downgraded to a Category 2 storm\n\nHurricane Hilary has weakened from a Category 3 to a Category 2 storm as it approaches the West Coast, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n“Hilary appears to be weakening quickly,” wrote John Cangialosi, a senior hurricane specialist with the center, in a memo. “The eye is filling and the cloud tops in the eyewall and rainbands have been warming during the past several hours.\"\n\nThe storm was moving north-northwest toward the Baja California peninsula on Saturday afternoon. It was producing winds of up to 110 miles per hour.\n\nWhile Hurricane Hilary is expected to continue weakening as it moves northward, Cangialosi wrote that it is still expected to cause “dangerous to locally catastrophic” flooding in the Southwest through early Monday.\n\n“Hilary is still expected to be a hurricane when it makes landfall or moves very near the central portion of the Baja California Peninsula,” he wrote. “There is high confidence that Hilary will move into southern California as a tropical storm.”\n\n― Sasha Hupka\n\nGov. Hobbs monitoring Hurricane Hilary, in touch with federal and tribal officials\n\nGov. Katie Hobbs is keeping tabs on Hurricane Hilary as it barrels toward landfall, according to the Governor’s Office.\n\n“The governor is actively monitoring the situation and is prepared to take action to address the situation,” said spokesperson Christian Slater.\n\nSlater confirmed that state officials are in touch with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to prepare for the storm. Arizona’s Department of Emergency and Military Affairs is coordinating with federal, local and tribal officials on the ground, Slater said.\n\n― Sasha Hupka\n\nHigh temperature in Phoenix below 100 for first time in 2 months\n\nFor the first time in more than two months, the Valley failed to reach triple-digit temperatures. On Saturday, the high temperature recorded by the National Weather Service at Phoenix Sky Harbor only reached 95 degrees.\n\nThe last time highs did not reach 100 degrees was on June 13.\n\n“We’ve been clouded over for most of the day, and we’ve also had convection out in the west so we’ve had some rain-cooled air that’s moved into the area,” said Alex Young, a meteorologist with the weather service.\n\nWith Hurricane Hilary moving through the Baja California peninsula over the weekend, the effects of the storm are expected to have an effect on Arizona on Sunday, according to Young.\n\nFEMA director urges residents to be prepared for 'dangerous storm'\n\nOfficials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Saturday that they are preparing for “heavy impacts from rain and flooding” to communities in Hurricane Hilary’s path.\n\n“As you heard from the president yesterday at Camp David, he is fully briefed and he has encouraged everyone to make sure that they are aware of what this dangerous storm is potentially going to bring, and to listen to their local officials on the steps they can take to make sure they are keeping safe,” said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell.\n\nCriswell said she has been in touch with California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Nevada Gov. John Lombardo about their preparations for the storm. As of midday Saturday, she said she had not reached out to Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs.\n\n“That’s certainly something I can do as I continue to get updates on what the significance and severity of this storm will be,” Criswell said. “I’ll look with my team and see if they have something scheduled for the day. The important part is, I always like to reach out to the governors to open up that line of communication.”\n\nThe agency also has staff embedded in local emergency management offices as the Southwest braces for the storm.\n\nCriswell urged residents to be prepared. She highlighted three immediate steps they should take to ensure they are hurricane ready:\n\nHave a plan to communicate with family and friends before, during and after the storm.\n\nSet up emergency weather alerts and ensure you can receive them on your mobile phone.\n\nFollow the direction of local officials. They are most familiar with immediate conditions in your area.\n\nSky Harbor sees flight delays and cancellations as Hurricane Hilary nears landfall\n\nNearly 20 flights had been canceled and about 70 were delayed from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport as of midday Saturday, according to the airport’s website.\n\nSaturday’s canceled flights included several to Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Los Cabos, Mexico. About 25 additional flight cancellations had already been announced for Sunday, with destinations ranging from Denver to St. Louis.\n\nThe travel interruptions came as Hurricane Hilary prompted even more delays and cancellations at other Southwestern hubs.\n\nLos Angeles International Airport and San Diego International Airport were experiencing flight delays averaging 45 minutes as of midday Saturday, per the Federal Aviation Administration. Delay times at both airports are expected to increase as Hurricane Hilary barrels toward Southern California.\n\nHilary's path in northern Arizona shifts westward\n\nMuch of northern and central Arizona could be spared the worst of Hurricane Hilary's impacts as radar suggests the storm is moving further west.\n\nScattered storms are expected today in Flagstaff and heading west with isolated storms elsewhere across northern and central Arizona, according to the National Weather Service in Flagstaff. But while the moisture looks to be moving further west, the agency warns that any of the weekend's storms still have the potential to produce heavy rainfall and subsequent flash flooding.\n\nRain is expected to pick up tonight through Sunday, mostly confined to far western Arizona including much of Mohave County.\n\nWith up to an inch of rain projected to fall in the area through the weekend, large swaths of the county including Kingman, Lake Havasu, Fort Mohave and Bullhead City are all under a flood watch until 5 p.m. Monday.\n\nFar western, southwest Arizona to face brunt of Hurricane Hilary\n\nThe greatest impact from Hurricane Hillary is expected in Southern California, far western and southwest Arizona, according to the National Weather Service. Currently a Category 3, the hurricane is expected to make landfall midday Sunday on the northwest Baja California coast, moving across southern California in the afternoon and night.\n\nThe weather service is also saying that Sunday will see strong and severe thunderstorms in southwest Arizona — generally along and southwest of Flagstaff, Phoenix and Tucson. There will be intense rainfall and flash flooding, along with damaging winds and isolated spin-up tornadoes.\n\nHurricane Hilary downgraded to Category 3 storm\n\nHurricane Hilary weakened from a Category 4 to Category 3 storm as it headed toward the West Coast, according to The National Hurricane Center.\n\nOn the morning of Aug. 19, Hurricane Hilary was about 235 miles southwest of the Baja California peninsula, moving north northwest and producing powerful winds of up to 125 mph.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center expected Hilary’s impact would produce “catastrophic and life-threatening flooding likely over Baja California and the southwestern U.S. through Monday.”\n\n— The Republic staff\n\nFlood watch in effect for southern Arizona\n\nA flood watch in Yuma and La Paz counties was in effect from Saturday morning until Monday 5 p.m., as flash flooding could be caused by excessive rainfall over the weekend.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Phoenix, Saturday through Sunday will see most of Hilary's impact for southwestern Arizona, describing the conditions as \"deteriorating\" for areas such as Yuma and La Paz counties.\n\nStrong storm activity in Yuma County was reported as early as Saturday at 6 a.m., according to the weather service.\n\n— Joanna Jacobo Rivera\n\nWhere to get sandbags in Pinal County\n\nPinal County asked residents to call ahead to pick up sandbags at various locations in preparation for monsoon weather that could hit Arizona. Here is where residents can get sandbags:\n\nApache Junction: 305 E. Superstition Boulevard, Apache Junction, AZ 85119\n\nArizona City: 7945 W. Battaglia Drive, Arizona City, AZ 85123\n\nCasa Grande: 22539 W. Peters Road, Casa Grande, AZ 85193\n\nHidden Valley: 43910 W. Meadowview Road, Maricopa, AZ 85138\n\nOracle: 1410 N. Justice Road, Oracle, AZ 85623\n\nRiverside: 54970 E. Florence-Kelvin Highway, Kearney, AZ 85137\n\nSan Tan: 3535 E. Hunt Way, San Tan Valley, AZ 85143\n\nWaste Tire: 12725 E. Adamsville Road, Florence, AZ 85132\n\n— The Republic staff\n\nHurricane Hilary creeps toward landfall\n\nLocated about 240 miles west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California on Saturday morning, Hilary was considered \"large and powerful\" by the National Hurricane Center with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph.\n\nHilary sped up and took a slight eastward shift in its track, the National Weather Service in San Diego said early Saturday, meaning its most significant impacts will be from Sunday morning through the evening.\n\n— Anthony Robledo and Jeanine Santucci\n\nBullhead City provides sandbags ahead of storm\n\nThe Bullhead City Police Department asked residents to prepare as Hurricane Hilary continued on its path toward California and Arizona on Friday evening.\n\nIn a post shared on X, formerly Twitter, the Police Department said heavy rainfall was expected over the weekend. The agency asked residents to:\n\nSecure items in yard.\n\nReconsider outdoor activities.\n\nAvoid unnecessary travel.\n\nThe city also said residents could obtain sandbags to help stay safe. Sand and sandbags will be available under the large ramada at Rotary Park by the intersection of Lakeside and Balboa drives from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday.\n\n— Joanna Jacobo Rivera\n\nHilary isn't Arizona's first massive storm\n\nHilary is not the first large hurricane to hit Arizona.\n\nIn the last 10 years, the remnants of three other hurricanes dumped record-breaking loads of rain on the state. None were still named storms, but they left widespread havoc, just the same.\n\nOne of them turned parts of Interstate 10 into a lake of floating cars. Do you remember?\n\n— Elena Santa Cruz\n\nSouthern Arizona counties prepare for possible deluge\n\nHurricane Hilary is expected to impact parts of Arizona this weekend, affecting mostly the southernmost areas of the state, including Yuma, La Paz and Pima counties.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, Saturday through Sunday will see most of the impact for southwestern Arizona, describing the conditions as \"deteriorating\" for areas such as Yuma and La Paz County.\n\nHere's how each county is preparing.\n\n— Kye Graves\n\nMohave County prepares for potential storms, flooding\n\nCities and towns across the western border of Arizona are preparing for the arrival of Hurricane Hilary with Kingman, Bullhead City and Lake Havasu City estimated to see 1 to 2.5 inches of rain between Friday afternoon and Monday, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“Please be safe out there,” Bullhead City Mayor Steve D’Amico told residents on Friday. “Please stay home if you can, don’t drive anywhere unless it’s necessary and don’t let the brief periods of calm weather between pockets of storm activity fool you into thinking it's safe to be outdoors.”\n\nIn anticipation of flash flooding, self-fill sandbag stations have been set up across Mohave County, in addition to the Bullhead City Fire Department giving away up to 20 sandbags per household throughout the day on Friday.\n\nMohave County residents can find sandbags at the following locations, while supplies last:\n\nLake Havasu City\n\nFire Station 1: 96 Acoma Blvd. S. (Around north side of the station by the generator)\n\nFire Station 2: 2065 Kiowa Blvd. N. (West side parking lot area near chain link fence)\n\nFire Station 3: 3620 Buena Vista Ave. (East side of the station by the trash bin)\n\nFire Station 4: 3270 Paloverde Blvd. S. (East side of the station by the trash bin)\n\nFire Station 5: 145 Lake Havasu Ave. N. (Southeast corner of the rear parking lot)\n\nBullhead City\n\nUp to 10 self-fill sandbags per household will be available at the large Rotary Park Ramada by the intersection of Lakeside and Balboa drives starting at 2 p.m. Friday and continuing from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday.\n\nKingman\n\nFire Station 22 on the corner of Harrison Street and Andy Devine Avenue.\n\n— Lacey Latch\n\nArizona rainfall amounts estimated\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Phoenix estimated rainfall amounts for southwestern Arizona as Hurricane Hilary moves closer.\n\nFlood watches are already in effect for southwestern Arizona and southeastern California from Saturday morning through Monday morning, the weather service tweeted Friday afternoon.\n\n\"Rain amounts of 1 to 5 inches with locally higher amounts in this area will potentially result in widespread significant and localized catastrophic flooding,\" the tweet stated.\n\nYuma and Blythe are forecast to see 2 to 3 inches under current models, while Gila Bend, Wickenburg, Sedona and Prescott could see up to an inch, according to the weather service. Phoenix and Casa Grande could receive up to a half-inch.\n\n— Michelle Cruz\n\nYuma opens sandbag station for residents\n\nYuma will provide a self-serve sandbag filling station in the Civic Center's east parking lot, at 1440 W. Desert Hills Drive, according to a city statement sent Thursday.\n\nPeople can fill sandbags from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. through Sunday. The city will evaluate, based on weather forecasts, whether the station should stay open into next week.\n\nThe station will be stocked with sand and empty bags for residents to self-fill sandbags while supplies last. A limited number of bags and sand may be available after 7 p.m.\n\nShovels may be available at the station as well, but the city recommends residents bring their own shovels when visiting the sandbag station. Residents are allowed five sandbags per vehicle.\n\n— Michelle Cruz\n\nWhat will Hilary bring to Arizona?\n\nThe historic storm's effects are already being felt. Rain chances are increasing, with the National Weather Service forecasting strong to severe thunderstorms with concerns of local damaging winds and flooding starting Friday. Increased moisture levels spurred showers around parts of the state on Thursday.\n\n\"Think of it as a more widespread monsoon event,\" said Tom Frieders, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service. \"We're expecting several rounds of storms, especially across northwest portions of the state.\"\n\nA flood watch for western Coconino County went into effect early Friday morning and will last until 6 a.m. Saturday. For other regions ― Mohave, La Paz, Yuma, Yavapai and parts of Pima and Santa Cruz counties ― flood watches will run till 5 p.m. Monday.\n\n― Kye Graves", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2021/12/04/nft-apple-metaverse-2022-predictions/8803081002/", "title": "From NFTs to Apple and the metaverse: What 2022 holds for the tech", "text": "Peter Csathy\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nJust when we thought it was safe to get back into the real world, new COVID variants emerge to brush us back – continuing to transform all aspects of our lives. While nothing is more powerful than real physical human connection, the digital virtual tech-driven world was the big story for media and entertainment in 2021.\n\nIn particular, 2021 marked the coming out party for the blockchain – a kind of transformational decentralized Web 3.0 world. In the world of media, the headline blockchain story took its form in so-called non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Will the blockchain’s adoption in media accelerate in 2022?\n\nMy Magic 8-Ball says “Signs point to ‘YES’.”\n\n►What's an NFT:A guide to what they are and why someone spent $69 million for one\n\nHere are 10 predictions for the coming year in which we hope that we finally get COVID under some kind of real long-term control.\n\n1. Blockchain blows up in 2022\n\nAfter early experimentation in 2021, 2022 will mark the year creators truly begin to embrace and leverage the power of the blockchain at scale. Just like iPhones ushered in a whole new mobile-first world of content 15 years ago, so-called Web 3.0 ushers in a whole new transformational world for originators of intellectual property, or IP, to directly reach and monetize their audiences. In the process, creators take back at least some of the power of mega tech platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Apple that built their trillion-dollar-plus valuations on their backs.\n\n2. NFTs a new venue for fans\n\nAnd 2022 will mark the year superfans will use their collective decentralized power to fuel creativity from their favorite artists via blockchain-related opportunities. Most in the entertainment world still focus on Beeple’s $69-million digital art NFT as being the blockchain’s poster child.\n\nBut instead they should be thinking of NFTs as new direct and directly monetizing channels of super-fandom – opening up membership into exclusive new clubs. If few in the world of media now know of CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and DAOs in general (decentralized autonomous organizations), that changes in 2022. The blockchain, NFTs and DAOs are no momentary fads. They are long-term game-changers. Like it or not, the Los Angeles-based Staples Center’s new “Crypto.com Arena” moniker is here to stay. Hey, brands out there, you better claim your \".eth\" web address now. (Here's why.)\n\n►Decoding the lingo:10 cryptocurrency terms people use every day\n\n►Crypto tithes:With fewer young parishioners carrying cash, more churches accept bitcoin as offering\n\n3. Big action to come against Big Tech\n\nThe new mega-media platforms of Facebook (or Meta, actually), Google, Apple, and Amazon face a more immediate threat than the blockchain and related new decentralized social platforms in 2022, as big government finally takes big action against big tech in advance of 2022’s mid-term elections. Facebook and Zuckerberg are first to feel the pinch, as the Feds force Facebook to shed Instagram (and perhaps set some real rules to limit unbridled ad and AI-driven algorithmic devastation, both on young people and society itself). These “unlockings” of tech conglomerates will unlock more content innovation across more competing tech platforms.\n\n►The Facebook Papers:Facebook fed posts with violence and nudity to people with low digital literacy\n\n4. Apple leads the way to the metaverse\n\nFaced with these threats, Facebook tries to run and hide with its new Meta moniker (the quintessential “lipstick on a pig”), but real metaverse innovation comes from others, including Apple. Yes, Apple’s AR glasses ultimately will drive some of that innovation. But Apple already sports the ultimate wearable – AirPods (now a $20-billion business by itself). AirPods will become the first major gateway into the metaverse – outside of the games industry – much like Apple drove mass consumer adoption in the mobile world with the iPhone. Expect micro-cameras to be incorporated into higher-end, extremely expensive versions of AirPods that will enable visual experiences. I can see you lining up at your local Apple store already.\n\n►What is the metaverse anyway? Everyone wants to own the metaverse including Facebook and Microsoft\n\n5. Games + crossovers = metaverse magic\n\nSpeaking of games, that industry will continue to lead all other categories of entertainment content by an order of magnitude and increasingly show the way for artists and creators to emerge and build audiences. Before the tragedy of Astroworld, Travis Scott broke out into the metaverse in 2020 via \"Fortnite\" to the tune of 50 million viewers who drove a No. 1 hit. Ariana Grande shattered those numbers this past year, and the marriage of games and music grows stronger in 2022 as music licensing for games becomes a massive new revenue stream.\n\n►From Facebook to Fortnite:The metaverse is calling. Are we ready?\n\n6. Get paid to play\n\nMedia and tech business models will continue to fundamentally evolve, particularly in light of the havoc wreaked by ad-driven business models from the two major culprits of Facebook and Google. We’ve already seen the shift from single transactions to subscription-based recurring revenue bundles (Amazon Prime, Apple One, Disney+). That will accelerate in 2022. And move over “free to play” business models in the world of games. Now, thanks to the blockchain, welcome to an entirely new “play to earn” model that literally pays players to play (and gives them fractional ownership in the games they play). Why work when you can play? Other parts of the entertainment industry will continue to look to the world of games for inspiration and innovation, because that’s where it’s happening.\n\n7. In battle for screen dominance, Disney beats Netflix\n\nDisney+ will grow more rapidly than Netflix – and begin to close the gap in terms of global paid members – as the Mouse House begins to unlock significantly more dollars to produce originals. And don’t forget Disney’s “special sauce” that Netflix can’t touch – Disney’s priceless crown jewels of content – i.e., the Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, Avengers, and Disney Princess franchises. Just imagine the NFTs Disney can (and will) create with those timeless characters (which, in turn, will drive more Disney+ subscriptions/memberships). Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple will also quietly raise their own originals ante as they too accelerate their media ambitions – but for decidedly different ends. Amazon and Apple use content as marketing and to drive customer loyalty – to draw us in and create an ongoing customer relationship so we spend more time (and cash) in their walled gardens. And in the thirst for new content, expect more media production company acquisitions in 2022. The big buy in 2021 was Reese Witherspoon’s Hello Sunshine. Indie idol A24 will be the big prize for 2022.\n\n8. Musicians to harness the power of NFTs\n\nMusic will continue its double-digit growth – fueled by accelerating streaming via broader global broadband connectivity, entirely new royalty-paying platforms (Facebook, TikTok, Peloton), the growing ubiquity of smart speakers and, yes, transformational blockchain-fueled opportunities like NFTs. Perhaps most notably – and most notably absent in the minds of most executives still today – superfans will directly drive significantly more dollars into the pockets of their favorite artists. Billions have been left on the table in the past. Not any longer.\n\n►Making music and history:In her return, singer Shontelle deploys NFTs in song of empowerment\n\n9.You could help finance the next big Hollywood entertainment project\n\nExpect the retail market – that's you and me, the superfans – to directly finance and even buy fractional pieces of content from our favorite artists. In a world of content increasingly being “king,” private equity has pumped billions of dollars into the world of music acquisitions for the likes of Stevie Nicks and Bob Dylan. But that kind of content ownership will not be just for the “big boys” in 2022. NFTs will help fuel the way. And superfan-fueled crowd-funding and IP ownership aren’t just for the world of music. The retail market will open up an entirely new world of financing for producers of film and television. Hey, Hollywood, check out “The Chosen.” If you don’t know about it, you should.\n\n10. Live entertainment is back, but forever changed\n\nMusic festivals and other mega-live entertainment experiences will continue to open up in 2022 due to pent up demand for real, physical interaction and lasting shared experiences in our increasingly heads-down digital, virtual world. But these large-scale live events are forever changed as a result of the twin tragedies of COVID and Astroworld. Crowd control, mitigation and broader safety and security efforts and focus will transform overall planning and execution – not to mention the overall “festival experience” for those who attend.\n\nThere you have it – 10 predictions for our increasingly tech-driven world of media and entertainment in 2022.\n\nPeter Csathy is the chairman of CREATV Media & Deep Cuts Media, a media, entertainment & tech-focused business development, M&A and advisory firm.

The agreement also includes staging games in South American countries Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, which had earlier promoted a rival co-hosting bid.\n\nThose three countries will each host one match to start the tournament, which allows FIFA to stage the opening game in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo, where the Centenario Stadium hosted the inaugural 1930 World Cup final.\n\nThe bid had started out as a joint venture between Spain and Portugal before expanding to include Morocco, in northern Africa, earlier this year.\n\nAll six host nations will get automatic entry to the 48-team tournament, FIFA said. It is the first time the World Cup will be played on more than one continent.\n\n“The centennial World Cup could not be far from South America, where everything began,” said Alejandro Dominguez, the president of South American soccer body CONMEBOL. “The 2030 World Cup will be played in three continents.”\n\nThe consensus reached by the continental soccer bodies also allowed FIFA to open bidding for the 2034 World Cup, with only member federations from Asia and Oceania eligible to bid for the hosting rights.\n\nSaudi Arabia immediately entered that contest and Australia is also interested after successfully co-hosting the Women’s World Cup this year with New Zealand. Either way, the 2034 tournament will almost certainly be played in November and December — like last year's World Cup in Qatar, in the heart of the European club soccer season.\n\nAccelerating the choice of a 2034 host to the end of next year will be widely seen as a victory for Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has built close ties to FIFA president Gianni Infantino in the past six years.\n\n\"We want to celebrate our football culture and share our country with the world,” Yasser Al Misehal, the president of the Saudi soccer federation and a member of the FIFA Council, said in a government statement announcing its intention to bid.\n\nThe FIFA Council’s acceptance of a unified 2030 candidacy still needs formal approval next year at a meeting of the 211 member federations. That should be just a formality. The 2034 pick will be made at a separate congress, FIFA said.\n\n“In 2030, we will have a unique global footprint, three continents — Africa, Europe and South America — six countries — Argentina, Morocco, Paraguay, Portugal, Spain and Uruguay — welcoming and uniting the world while celebrating together the beautiful game, the centenary and the FIFA World Cup,” Infantino said in a statement.\n\nThe 48-team tournament scheduled for June-July 2030 is set to start in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay — which FIFA branded as “Centenary Celebration Matches” — before the action moves to the core host nations Spain, Portugal and Morocco.\n\nThe plan involves an unprecedented amount of travel across distances and time zones, including 13-hour flights from Buenos Aires to Madrid.\n\nIt was not popular with Football Supporters Europe, the fan group officially recognized by European soccer body UEFA.\n\n“FIFA continues its cycle of destruction against the greatest tournament on earth,” FSE said in a statement. “Horrendous for supporters, disregards the environment and rolls the red carpet out to a host for 2034 with an appalling human rights record.”\n\nSaudi Arabia and Australia both are members of the Asian Football Confederation yet the organization's president, Bahraini royal Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa, stated a clear preference Wednesday.\n\n“The entire Asian football family will stand united in support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s momentous initiative,” Sheikh Salman said in an AFC statement, adding it was committed to working for its win. Australia was a losing candidate when Qatar won its hosting vote in 2010.\n\nThe South American co-host bid has been promoted since the 2018 World Cup in Russia and had included Chile, which was not mentioned Wednesday.\n\nUkraine was also dropped after it was added to the European bid a year ago at a news conference at UEFA headquarters in Switzerland. However, Ukraine had not been mentioned in official comments about the UEFA-backed bid this year.\n\nThe first 48-team men's World Cup will be hosted in 2026 by the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe 2030 decision marks a victory for Morocco, which has invested heavily in infrastructure in its largest cities and was last week chosen to host the 2025 African Cup of Nations. The men's national team helped push its case by reaching the World Cup semifinals in Qatar, eliminating Spain and Portugal in the previous rounds. It will be the second African nation to host the tournament after South Africa in 2010.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Moroccan King Mohammed VI’s Royal Cabinet said the selection “recognized Morocco’s choice place in the ranks of great nations.”\n\nThe 2030 deal was clinched six weeks after the former president of Spain’s soccer federation became an international embarrassment for his behavior at the Women’s World Cup final.\n\nLuis Rubiales was was suspended by FIFA and eventually forced to resign after kissing a player on the lips during the awards ceremony in Sydney, Australia on Aug. 20, which drew attention away from the greatest achievement of Spain’s women’s soccer team. He is now under criminal investigation.\n\nSpain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez had expressed public concern that Rubiales could derail the bid to host the men's World Cup if he remained in office.\n\nSánchez said in Spanish on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter: “We will show the strength of our country as champions of the men’s and women’s world titles, and we will defend the values of equality, solidarity and fair play that should always be present in sports.”\n\nSpain previously hosted the 1982 World Cup, Argentina was the 1978 host and Uruguay had the inaugural 1930 tournament. Portugal, Morocco and Paraguay will be first-time hosts.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mauricio Savarese in Sao Paulo, Brazil; Sam Metz in Rabat, Morocco; and Joseph Wilson in Barcelona, Spain contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/worldcup/2023/07/21/uswnt-vs-vietnam-world-cup-live-updates/70424158007/", "title": "USA vs Vietnam highlights: Sophia Smith scores 2 in Women's ...", "text": "AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Sophia Smith’s World Cup debut was one to remember.\n\nThe USWNT’s rising star scored two goals in the first half and the Americans opened their quest to become the first team, men’s or women’s, to win three consecutive World Cup titles with a 3-0 win over Vietnam on Saturday (Friday night in the U.S.) in front of an announced crowd of 41,107 at Eden Park. Smith added an assist on Lindsey Horan’s goal late in the second half.\n\nThe USWNT next plays the Netherlands on Wednesday in a match that will go a long way toward deciding the winner of Group E. That’s no small thing, given the group winner is likely to avoid England, Germany, France or Canada until the final.\n\nThat the USWNT beat Vietnam was hardly a surprise. They are four-time World Cup champions and have been ranked No. 1 for all but 10 months over the last 15 years. Vietnam, ranked 32nd, is playing in its first-ever World Cup, and its coach likened the USWNT to a “mountain” on Thursday.\n\nBut this is a young and inexperienced U.S. squad. This is the first major international tournament for 12 of the 23 players, and six of the USWNT’s starters were making their World Cup debuts – including Savannah DeMelo, who got her first cap just 13 days ago.\n\nAs much as a win, this was an opportunity to get the youngsters experience and confidence for the rest of the tournament.\n\nAnd, indeed, the USWNT dominated the game, both to the eye and on the stat sheet. They easily could have had a half-dozen goals in the first half – Alex Morgan missed a penalty kick and Vietnam keeper Tran Thi Kim Thanh made three other saves – and had already had two good chances before Smith got the Americans on the board in the 14th minute.\n\nHighlights from USWNT 3-0 win over Vietnam\n\nFirst-time World Cup player Sophia Smith stole the show in the USWNT's opening game, scoring two goals before halftime.\n\nHoran, wearing the captain’s armband for the first time at a World Cup, floated a nice pass that Morgan moved forward with a backheel flick. It fell to Smith just inside the box, and she put it beneath the goalkeeper’s legs and into the net for her first World Cup goal.\n\nSmith’s second goal came in stoppage time. Naomi Girma lobbed a short corner into the box that Tran punched back into traffic. Smith jumped on it and her shot had just enough power to get into the net. Initially ruled offside, it was confirmed as a goal after a review by video-assistant referee.\n\nHoran added to the USWNT cushion in the 77th minute. Julie Ertz had lofted a pass from deep in USWNT territory that Smith brought down and played back to Horan, her fellow Colorado native, in the middle. Horan took a touch, freezing the keeper, and then left fly from about 15 yards out.\n\nWhen is the next USWNT game?\n\nAfter a 3-0 win over Vietnam, the USWNT is next scheduled to take on the Netherlands in group play. That game will take place Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET in the United States, which is 1 p.m. Thursday in Auckland, New Zealand. (We know the time difference can be super confusing. Your best bet is to add Auckland to the world clock tab on your smart phone.)\n\nThe Netherlands game will be a rematch of the 2019 World Cup final, which the U.S. won 2-0. This year's matchup is likely to be the Americans' toughest game of group play. The Netherlands plays its first 2023 World Cup game vs. Portugal Sunday evening in Auckland.\n\nAs a reminder, the Americans are scheduled to play three group games before moving on to the knockout round.\n\nFriday, July 21: USWNT vs. Vietnam, 9 p.m. ET -- a 3-0 U.S. win.\n\nUSWNT vs. Vietnam, 9 p.m. ET -- a 3-0 U.S. win. Wednesday, July 26: USWNT vs. Netherlands, 9 p.m. ET\n\nUSWNT vs. Netherlands, 9 p.m. ET Tuesday, Aug. 1: USWNT vs. Portugal, 3 a.m. ET\n\nLindsey Horan scores, USWNT goes up 3-0\n\nFor Lindsey Horan, the third time was a charm.\n\nIn the 77th minute, Julie Ertz lofted a pass that Sophia Smith picked up and played back toward the center to Lindsey Horan, who had already taken, and missed, two shots. Horan settled herself and let fly from about 15 yards. It is her third World Cup goal all time. The score gave the U.S. a 3-0 lead over Vietnam.\n\nAlyssa Thompson, Sofia Huerta make World Cup debuts for USWNT\n\nPlenty of USWNT players got time in the Americans’ first World Cup game against Vietnam.\n\nAlyssa Thompson, the teenager who was the No. 1 draft pick in the 2023 NWSL draft, subbed on in the 75th minute for the USWNT. She was the seventh player to make her World Cup debut Friday.\n\nThompson, who is just 18 and missed her high school graduation ceremony to train for the World Cup, made her first USWNT appearance Oct. 7, 2022. She has yet to score a goal for the Americans, though her speed makes her an instant threat.\n\nIn the 84th minute, Kelley O’Hara came in for Crystal Dunn, and Sofia Huerta subbed in for Emily Fox. It is also Huerta's debut.\n\nSophia Smith gives USWNT 2-0 lead at half\n\nSophia Smith’s tear continues, as she gave the USWNT a 2-0 lead in the 7th minute of first-half stoppage time.\n\nAfter a long ball from defender Naomi Girma resulted in a scrum in front of the goal, the ball got recirculated to Smith, whose off-balance shot settled into the far corner of the net.\n\nIt was initially called offside, and replays seemed to show Alex Morgan just slightly in front of the Vietnamese defender. But VAR ruled the USWNT was onside, giving Smith a brace before the half.\n\nFor the half, the USWNT had 16 shots on goal, while Vietnam had 0.\n\nMegan Rapinoe subs in for 200th cap with USWNT\n\nSuper subs Megan Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle entered the game for the USWNT in the 63rd minute, replacing Alex Morgan and Savannah DeMelo, respectively.\n\nIt is Rapinoe’s 200th appearance for the USWNT. She said before the team left for New Zealand that this World Cup will be her last, and she will retire at the end of this season. Her legacy will endure on and off the field.\n\nRose Lavelle back on track after injury\n\nLavelle being on the field was a welcome sight for many USWNT fans. The 28-year-old midfield, who scored three goals and won the Bronze Ball at the 2019 World Cup, has not played for club (OL Reign) or country since injuring her knee in a friendly against Ireland April 8. Some were worried she might be left off the U.S. roster all together.\n\nLavelle's play was key in the 2019 World Cup, as her goal in the 69th minute sealed the USWNT's win over the Netherlands in the final.\n\nYellow card for USWNT's Lindsey Horan\n\nUSWNT captain Lindsey Horan was issued a yellow card in the 56th minute, pretty much the only thing that’s gone wrong for the Americans in their opening World Cup game against Vietnam.\n\nThe U.S. leads 2-0 behind two goals from next-generation superstar Sophia Smith, as the Americans seek their third consecutive World Cup title and fifth overall.\n\nJulie Ertz is back 10 months after having baby\n\nWhen Julie Ertz took the soccer field with boys on the Phoenix Rising U-19 Academy Team — none of whom knew they’d be sharing the pitch that day with a two-time World Cup winner — Paul Taylor just smiled to himself.\n\n“A few of the boys recognized her and they were saying, ‘What’s going on here?’\" Taylor, who’s known and coached Ertz since her high school days, told USA TODAY Sports. \"Well, within a few minutes they knew what was going on because it was, ‘Gimme the ball. Go there. Do it this way. Let’s go again!’\n\n\"For those few months, she was one of the guys and she earned their respect immediately.”\n\nOn the surface, it might have seemed like an odd match. Ertz — 31 and just a few months removed from giving birth to her first child, a son named Madden — versus a roster full of speedy, strong MLS hopefuls who only know how to play one way: fast and hard.\n\nBut, Ertz fit right in. And training with the academy team to get back into competitive form was more enjoyable than she could have imagined.\n\nRead Lindsay Schnell’s full story here.\n\nWho is No. 11 USWNT?\n\nWhen 14-year-old Sophia Smith told her family she was giving up basketball to concentrate fully on soccer, her dad, who played college hoops at Wyoming, took the news hard.\n\n“Man, Soph, you could really be something in basketball,” Kenny Smith told his youngest daughter.\n\nSophia’s matter-of-fact response: “I’m going to be special in soccer.”\n\nTalk about prescient.\n\nNow 22, Smith is set to make her World Cup debut this summer with the U.S. women’s national team and show international audiences what a growing domestic fan base has known for a while: She’s about to take over.\n\n“Her ability to turn and go 1-on-1 is next level,” said USWNT teammate Naomi Girma, who plays for the NWSL’s San Diego Wave and was Smith’s teammate at Stanford. “To a defender, she’s annoying.”\n\nRead Lindsay Schnell’s full piece here.\n\nAlex Morgan misses penalty kick\n\nThe penalty kick conundrum continues at the World Cup, as USWNT forward Alex Morgan missed a PK in the 44th minute that would have given the U.S. a 2-0 lead. The PK was awarded after Trinity Rodman was tripped in the box by a Vietnam player. It was an unusual miss for Morgan, one of the best scorers in the history of U.S. soccer.\n\nMorgan missed the penalty and an open look off the rebound then collided with a Vietnam player on the second shot and was momentarily sidelined.\n\nSophia Smith scores, gives USWNT early 1-0 lead\n\nIt only took Sophia Smith 14 minutes to leave her mark on the 2023 World Cup.\n\nIn the 14th minute of the USWNT’s opener against Vietnam, Lindsey Horan passed to Alex Morgan who passed to Smith, whose left-footed strike gave the Americans a 1-0 lead. The Vietnam goal keeper had no chance to save Smith’s shot.\n\nSmith, who is making her World Cup debut, is expected to be one of the USWNT’s next superstars, a future she predicted when she was just 14.\n\nUSWNT subs, including Megan Rapinoe, already warming up\n\nThe USWNT subs, including forward Megan Rapinoe, midfielder Rose Lavelle and goalkeeper Casey Murphy are already warming up, about 30 minutes into the Americans’ opening game.\n\nU.S. coach Vlatko Andonovski had said he would probably get the No. 2 keeper some playing time in the group stage so the team didn't have another debacle like they did at the Tokyo Olympics, where starter Alyssa Naeher got hurt and backup A.D. Franch had to go in cold.\n\nTrinity Rodman hurt less than one minute into World Cup opener\n\nLess than a minute into their World Cup opener, the U.S. women’s national team, already hampered by injuries, is having issues.\n\nForward Trinity Rodman landed hard, and awkwardly, on her back just 30 seconds into the game when she was taken out by a Vietnam player. In obvious pain, Rodman stood up and walked off the field on her own power right after a stretcher came out on to the field. She stood on the sideline for a minute to catch her breath before going back in.\n\nUSWNT starting lineup vs. Vietnam : Rodman at forward, Ertz at centerback\n\nThe starting lineup for the USWNT’s first World Cup game, against Vietnam, is out.\n\nThe biggest notes: Midfielders Julie Ertz and Savannah DeMelo are in, while midfielder Rose Lavelle will start on the bench. Trinity Rodman, who came off the bench to score two goals in the Americans’ 2-0 win over Wales in the USWNT’s send-off game, will also start, alongside fellow forwards Alex Morgan and Sophia Smith. Megan Rapinoe, the hero of the 2019 World Cup, is also available off the bench.\n\nHere’s the USWNT's full lineup:\n\nAlyssa NaeherCrystal DunnJulie ErtzNaomi Girma Emily Fox Lindsey Horan (C)Savannah DeMeloAndi SullivanTrinity RodmanSophia SmithAlex Morgan\n\nWhen does the USWNT play?\n\nThe Americans play their first Group stage game Friday at 9 p.m. ET. They face Vietnam.\n\nHow to watch USWNT in World Cup\n\nLooking for what channel to watch the 2023 World Cup on? Fox will broadcast the tournament in the U.S. on both its main channel and FS1. It’s also available to stream on FoxSports.com and the Fox Sports app. Spanish-language coverage will be on Telemundo.\n\nSee the TV listing for every game and add them to your calendar of choice here!\n\nIs Megan Rapinoe playing in the 2023 Women's World Cup?\n\nYes, the unquestioned star of the 2019 World Cup, Rapinoe is back for the 2023 World Cup. It will be her last.\n\nPresident Biden cheering on USWNT\n\nPreside Joe Biden will be watching Friday night, and probably cheering extra loud for Rapinoe. Last July, Biden awarded Rapinoe the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor.\n\nUSWNT schedule World Cup\n\nThe Americans are scheduled to play three group games.\n\nFriday, July 21: USWNT vs. Vietnam, 9 p.m. ET\n\nUSWNT vs. Vietnam, 9 p.m. ET Wednesday, July 26: USWNT vs. Netherlands, 9 p.m. ET\n\nUSWNT vs. Netherlands, 9 p.m. ET Tuesday, Aug. 1: USWNT vs. Portugal, 3 a.m. ET\n\nWhere is the 2023 World Cup being played?\n\nFor the first time in women’s World Cup history, the tournament will be hosted by two countries, Australia and New Zealand. (The 2022 men’s World Cup was hosted by Japan and South Korea and in 2026, it will be hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.)\n\nMany people associate Australia and New Zealand with surfing, sandy beaches and stunning swimming spots, all happening in sunny weather. But it’s winter in the southern hemisphere, which means temperatures will be anything but scorching.\n\nWhat will the weather be like at the 2023 World Cup in New Zealand and Australia?\n\nHere’s a look at the typical weather in Australia and New Zealand in July and August. Thirty minutes before kickoff Friday, the temperature was 57 degrees and partially cloudy.\n\nWhat time is it in New Zealand?\n\nAuckland is 16 hours ahead of the East Coast of the United States.\n\nSecond Gentleman Doug Emhoff in New Zealand to watch USWNT\n\nSecond Gentleman Doug Emhoff, better known as the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, is in New Zealand to cheer on the USWNT, according to his wife.\n\nEmhoff visited practice earlier this week and before making the trek all the way to Auckland, he FaceTimed with USWNT captains Alex Morgan and Lindsey Horan, asking about the wide age range of this year’s roster. He assured Morgan and Horan they’d be able to hear him cheering during the Americans’ first game.\n\nPenalty kicks dominate early World Cup games\n\nPenalty kicks have ruled the first five games of the World Cup … sort of.\n\nEach of the games played so far in Australia and New Zealand have featured a penalty kick, though only one team has managed to capitalized. Australia defender Steph Catley scored in the 51st minute against Ireland Thursday, giving the Matildas a 1-0 win to open group play. It was an especially big win for the host country considering it will be without star forward Sam Kerr for at least a couple games due to a calf injury.\n\nBut probably the most noteworthy penalty kick came courtesy of Canada’s Christine Sinclair, who on Friday was trying to become the firs player in history to score in six different World Cups. In the 49th minute of Canada’s opening game against Nigeria, Sinclair, who has scored more international goals than any player, man or woman, had her chance to etch her name in the record books — but she missed, due in part to a brilliant save by Nigeria keeper Chiamaka Nnadozie.\n\nThe game ended in a 0-0 draw, a shocking result for Canada, which won gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nWhat are the World Cup betting odds?\n\nUnderstanding the different World Cup betting odds and wager types is paramount to learning how to bet on sports in general. Not only can bettors predict the winner of the event — BetRivers lists the Americans as +250 favorites — but there is also plenty of action around which player will take home awards such as the Golden Boot, which goes to the World Cup's top goal-scorer.\n\nIn addition to shopping around for the best odds, the type of wagering you plan on doing will likely determine which online sportsbook is right for you. For example, sports betting apps such as FanDuel allow you to bet on the outcome of each individual game, while DraftKings offers a wide array of prop bets throughout the tournament — such as how many total goals will be scored in the game between the United States and Vietnam.\n\nHow many World Cups have USA women won?\n\nThe USWNT has won four World Cups overall and are going for their third straight.\n\nWho’s won the other women’s World Cup titles?\n\nThe 2023 World Cup marks just the ninth time the event has taken place. (The men's World Cup, meanwhile, has been played since 1930.) The U.S. is seeking to become the first team, men’s or women’s, to win three consecutive titles. Germany, which won in 2003 and 2007, had a chance to do that in 2011 but couldn’t pull it off. The U.S. has won more women's World Cup titles than any other country. Here’s a list of every women’s World Cup winner.\n\n1991: United States\n\n1995: Norway\n\n1999: United States\n\n2003: Germany\n\n2007: Germany\n\n2011: Japan\n\n2015: United States\n\n2019: United States\n\nHow many groups are in the 2023 FIFA World Cup?\n\nThere are eight groups, four teams per group, with the top two seeds from each group advancing to the knockout round.

There are eight groups, four teams per group, with the top two seeds from each group advancing to the knockout round. In Group play, each team plays three games. There are four rounds in the knockouts: round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals and the final.\n\nWorld Cup bracket\n\nHere’s how the 2023 World Cup bracket is set up.\n\nHow many women's teams qualify for the World Cup?\n\nThere are 32 teams in the World Cup.\n\nWho is favored to win Women's World Cup 2023?\n\nThe Americans are the overwhelming favorite to win the World Cup, which would be their third consecutive title.

They appeared disorganized and tentative, showing none of the cohesion they had to start the game.\n\nBut a hard tackle by van de Donk early in the second half changed everything.\n\nHoran crumbled to the field and was down for several minutes. She was clearly angry when she finally got up. She had words with her Lyon teammate, and the two were pushing and shoving in the box after the USWNT was awarded a corner kick. Even the referee’s attempt to get the two to make nice didn’t calm Horan, who was still muttering when Rose Lavelle lined up in the corner.\n\nHoran got the last word.\n\n— Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports columnist\n\nWhen does the USWNT play next?\n\nThe USWNT concludes group play next week vs. Portugal. The game will kickoff Tuesday at 3 a.m. ET in the U.S., which is 7 p.m. in Auckland, New Zealand. Bookmark our World Cup schedule hub so you don’t miss a game.\n\nUnited States vs. Portugal\n\nEven after getting only 1 point for a tie against Netherlands, the USWNT has an edge to win Group E because of goal differential. The U.S. won its opener against Vietnam 3-0, while the Dutch only beat Portugal 1-0.\n\nThat means Netherlands can only win the group by beating Vietnam in its next match and scoring three more goals than the USWNT scores against Portugal.\n\nThere can be no letting off the gas for the Americans.\n\nLindsey Horan World Cup goal vs. Netherlands\n\nMaybe the U.S. women should try to make Lindsey Horan mad before every game. That fight from Horan, and the resilience the young Americans had to show, could end up being a positive for the defending champions. A potentially defining moment, too.\n\n“I don’t think you ever want to get me mad, because I don’t react in a good way. Usually I just go and I want something more. I want to do more for my team and win these games,” Horan said. “We’re going to see more and more of this in the World Cup,” she added. “It’s great for us to have this in the group stage, to feel that kind of pressure and feel such a great opponent. So now we move forward. We learned a few lessons from this game and now we focus on Portugal.”\n\nThe USWNT is going to get pushed in the knockout rounds and is going to have to respond, and that isn’t something that can be taught in a video session or replicated in practice. It’s something that has to be experienced, so this game against the Netherlands was actually kind of perfect for the Americans.\n\nThe next challenge is for the USWNT to show this kind of grit from the opening whistle. And not need Horan to get in a cage match to spark it.\n\nUSWNT vs. Netherlands highlights: Alex Morgan almost scores game-winner\n\nThe goals were few and far between. The Dutch scored early and the Americans evened the game in the 62nd minute. It looked, briefly, like Alex Morgan scored a game-winner for the U.S., but the goal was called back for offside.\n\n(Still confused about what offside is? Let us explain.)\n\nUSWNT World Cup scenarios, Group E standings after draw vs Netherlands\n\nBecause of the USWNT’s awful first half against the Netherlands on Thursday, they have to win or draw with Portugal to ensure a spot in the knockout rounds. Lose, and the Americans could be going home after the group stage for the first time ever at the World Cup or Olympics.\n\nThere is a scenario where the Americans could lose and still advance if Vietnam beats the Netherlands and scores at least three goals. Given Vietnam has been outscored 5-0 in its first two games and was eliminated with its loss to Portugal, however, the chances of that are not good.\n\nWhich means the Americans need to win. Preferably by a large enough margin they maintain their advantage in goal differential – currently at plus-2 – over the Netherlands so they win the group and avoid the possibility of seeing England, Germany and France before the final.\n\nThe World Cup began in 1991, the Olympic tournament five years later, and not once has the USWNT failed to make it out of the group stage. In fact, with the exception of the 2016 Olympics, the U.S. women have gotten to the semifinals or better at every major tournament.\n\nWhy did Daniëlle van de Donk wear a swim cap at end of USA-Netherlands game?\n\nNetherlands player Daniëlle van de Donk went viral late in the 1-1 tie after a collision with USWNT midfielder Rose Lavelle left van de Donk with a gash on the side of her head.\n\nWhen the cut couldn’t stop bleeding, van de Donk reached for an interesting bandage: a swim camp. Videos and photos of her in the cap quickly circulated the internet and social media, leaving many to wonder what the heck was happening.\n\n“It just opened up and it's bleeding too much so I couldn't continue the game without it,” van de Donk said afterward.\n\n“Plus,\" she added with a laugh, \"it’s fashionable.\"\n\nWho was the USA vs. Netherlands referee?\n\nYoshimi Yamashita, a Japan official, was the referee during the USWNT’s 1-1 draw vs. Netherlands.\n\nThis is Yamashita’s second World Cup in as many years — last summer, she was one of six female referees to work the men’s World Cup in Qatar. The 37-year-old also regularly officiates games in Japan’s J League, the country’s top men’s league. Of course, she’s also one of the women’s games top officials. (This is her second women’s World Cup.)\n\nIn the U.S. vs. Netherlands’s game, Yamashita had to break up a heated argument and shoving match between U.S. midfielder Lindsey Horan and Netherlands’ midfielder Daniëlle van de Donk, after a hard tackle from van de Donk sent Horan to the ground in pain. Yamashita called the Lyon teammates together before she allowed the USWNT to take a corner kick.\n\n\"(Horan) came over, we just had a little talk,\" van de Donk said. \"The referee came in between us. It wasn’t very necessary. We just played football again after that.\"\n\nHoran had the last word, scoring on a header on the corner to tie the game.\n\nBut if anyone is thinking of putting Yamashita up for the Nobel Peace Prize, don't expect Horan to write the nomination.\n\n\"I don't know what (Yamashita) said,” the USWNT captain told reporters, rolling her eyes. “It was too long.\"\n\n2023 World Cup: USWNT stats\n\nLindsey Horan has arguably been the most reliable player for the USWNT through two World Cup games, scoring a goal against both Vietnam and Netherlands. Sophia Smith has tallied two goals also, though both of hers came against Vietnam in the Americans’ first win of group play.\n\nAdditionally, through two games Smith has notched one assist, as have Alex Morgan and super sub Rose Lavelle.\n\nAgainst Netherlands, the Dutch finished with just three shots on goal, which impressed USWNT coach Vlatko Andonovski.\n\n\"That’s a good defense,\" Andonovski said. \"Anyone that can keep the Netherlands on three shots for 90 minutes is pretty good.\"\n\nUSWNT ties Netherlands 1-1 on header from Lindsey Horan\n\nA header from Lindsey Horan in the 62nd minute gave the UWSNT a goal it desperately needed, tying Netherlands 1-1.\n\nHoran had taken a hard foul from Danielle Van de Donk, and was still complaining to the referee about it when Rose Lavalle lined up to take a corner kick. Horan tracked it the whole way and outmuscled several Dutch defenders before burying it with a thunderous header.\n\nThe Americans had several other chances over the last 30 minutes, including a goal by Alex Morgan that was waved off for being offside. There was also a screamer by Trinity Rodman that went just wide and a shot by Sophia Smith that was cleared off the line.\n\nRose Lavelle subs in for USWNT, gets yellow card\n\nRose Lavelle, the 28-year-old midfielder who had a spectacular 2019 World Cup and scored the winning goal in the USWNT’s 2-0 win over Netherlands in the final, started the second half in place of Savannah DeMelo. The Americans trail 1-0 in the second game of group play.\n\nLavelle, who also came in as a sub vs. Vietnam, has been sidelined the last couple months with a knee injury. The Americans are hoping that like 2019, she provides a spark on the field.\n\nMinutes into the second half, Lavelle was issued a yellow card for a hard tackle on a Dutch player.\n\nWhat happens if US loses to Netherlands, are they out of World Cup?\n\nNo need to panic just yet. The US-Netherlands game is just the second of group play for the Americans. They’ve got Portugal next week. The top two teams from each group will advance to the knockout round — but the second place spot from Group E is a much tougher path to the World Cup final.\n\nIf Netherlands hangs on for a win tonight vs. the USWNT, that makes the game against Portugal a must win.\n\nUSWNT trailing Netherlands 1-0 at halftime\n\nThe USWNT couldn't equal Netherlands in the first half of play, trailing 1-0 as teams went to the locker room. The Americans look all out of sorts, and the stats aren't encouraging: The U.S. possessed the ball just 33% of the time, compared to 52% for the Dutch.\n\nThe Americans have just two shots on goal, while Netherlands is 1-for-1 in that category.\n\nExpect to see multiple U.S. subs in the second half.\n\nInstant analysis from Wellington: USWNT loses composure after early score\n\nThe USWNT was playing as well as it has in a long time early in the game. It was finding spaces, connecting passes and probing the Dutch defense, and it was working, with a couple of chances. But the Americans seemed to completely lose their composure after the Netherlands' goal. They looked tentative and disorganized, and they were out of sync when they did have chances.\n\nThat said, Sophia Smith was very active in the closing minutes of the half. The Dutch were manhandling her, but if she can shake them in the second half, a goal will come.\n\n— Nancy Armour, USA TODAY Sports columnist\n\nCarli Lloyd questions USWNT's 'heart' vs. Netherlands\n\nCarli Lloyd did not hold back on the team she once played for. Nor did she forget from where she came from.\n\n\"I'm going to bring my Jersey bluntness,\" Lloyd said on the FOX halftime set in Sydney, Australia at the 2023 World Cup.\n\nAnalyzing the U.S. women's national team's first-half performance against the Netherlands, which left the Americans in a 1-0 deficit, Lloyd did that and then some: \"They look flat,\" said Lloyd, a member of the last two World Cup winning teams. \"I'm questioning their heart.\" — Chris Bumbaca\n\nJill Roord goal gives Netherlands early 1-0 lead on USWNT\n\nThe Netherlands took a 1-0 lead on the USWNT in the 17th minute after a whole lot of miscues by the Americans. A hard shot from Jill Roord found the corner of the net, just past Alyssa Naeher's hands. It was the Netherlands' first shot of the day.\n\nThe USWNT trails in a Women's World Cup match for the first time since the July 10, 2011 Quarterfinal match vs Brazil, according to ESPN.\n\nWhat time is it in New Zealand?\n\nWellington, where the USWNT is taking on the Netherlands, is 16 hours ahead of the East Coast of the United States.\n\nWorld Cup standings\n\nIt can be hard to keep up with 2023 World Cup results given the time difference from the U.S., not to mention the different time zones across Australia and New Zealand. But we've got you covered, and you can check the standings right here.\n\nUSWNT starting lineup today\n\nWe've got the starting lineup for the USWNT's second group game of the 2023 World Cup, vs. the Netherlands, and it's the same as the other night vs. Vietnam.\n\nHere's the full lineup:\n\nGoalkeeper: Alyssa Naeher\n\nDefenders: Crystal Dunn, Naomi Girma, Julie Ertz, Emily Fox\n\nMidfielders: Lindsey Horan, Andi Sullivan, Savannah DeMelo\n\nForwards: Sophia Smith, Alex Morgan, Trinity Rodman\n\nUSWNT game tonight\n\nThe United States play their second Group stage game Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET. They face Netherlands.\n\nUSA vs. Netherlands predictions\n\nNancy Armour, columnist: It will be another tight and physical game, as they always are when the USWNT and the Netherlands play. But the USWNT tends to respond when people claim they've lost their edge on the rest of the world, and I expect no different in this game. USWNT 3-0.\n\nLindsay Schnell, reporter: It’s time for Alex Morgan to join the scoring party, and you can expect the veteran forward to do just that. This game will be a mix of old and new, with both Morgan and Sophia Smith scoring — and I think both will come on assists from Trinity Rodman. USWNT 2-1.\n\nIs Alex Morgan playing tonight?\n\nYes, the forward is in the USWNT’s starting lineup, and looking to add to her 121-goal total. Morgan missed a penalty kick in the Americans' opener vs. Vietnam, but she's not stressed about it.\n\nUSWNT suits\n\nThe Americans wore their custom menswear-inspired “business” suits again for Game 2, arriving in style to Wellington Regional Stadium.\n\nWomen’s World Cup winners\n\nThe 2023 World Cup marks just the ninth time the event has taken place. (The men's World Cup, meanwhile, has been played since 1930.) The U.S. is seeking to become the first team, men’s or women’s, to win three consecutive titles. Germany, which won in 2003 and 2007, had a chance to do that in 2011 but couldn’t pull it off. The U.S. has won more women's World Cup titles than any other country. Here’s a list of every women’s World Cup winner.\n\n1991: United States\n\n1995: Norway\n\n1999: United States\n\n2003: Germany\n\n2007: Germany\n\n2011: Japan\n\n2015: United States\n\n2019: United States\n\nUSWNT missed opportunities vs. Vietnam: Why you shouldn’t be concerned\n\nWhen Sophia Smith has two goals and an assist in her first World Cup game, Lindsey Horan has a highlight reel’s worth of sick passes, and a roster full of newcomers get a much-needed dose of confidence, it’s hard to question the result.\n\nAnd yet, this is the United States women’s national team. Leave goals out on the field, as the USWNT did several times over in their 3-0 win against Vietnam on Saturday (Friday night in the U.S.), and those watching are going to be picky.\n\nThe good thing is, the USWNT isn’t satisfied, either.\n\nNetherlands starting lineup vs. USWNT\n\nThe Netherlands will be without two key pieces vs. the USWNT: Forwards Lineth Beerensteyn (ankle) and Vivianne Miedema (ACL) both started for the Dutch in the 2019 World Cup final, which the U.S. won 2-0. Many are looking at the 2023 meeting tonight as a rematch of sorts.\n\nBeerensteyn was injured in the Netherlands' opening game vs. Portugal, a 1-0 win for the Dutch. Miedema, 26, is one of the best players in the world. She tore her ACL in December.\n\nUSWNT jerseys and merch\n\nLooking for official the World Cup kits worn by Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe and others?

Alex Morgan has been a staple of the USWNT since her debut on a snowy day in 2010.\n\nShe scored her first goal that fall and since then, she's scored 121 times for the Stars and Stripes and won back-to-back World Cups. The Southern California native was named a captain for this year's tournament where the team will attempt to make history with their third straight title. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nHow Alex Morgan grew from USWNT rising star to powerful advocate and disruptor\n\nMost of America knows Alex Morgan as the USWNT’s active leading goal scorer, No. 5 on the all-time list. Or as one of its most marketable stars: Attractive and wholesome-looking, appealing to both soccer diehards and those who don’t know the first thing about the sport.\n\nBut Morgan is also a disruptor. Keenly aware of the advantages her stardom has afforded her, she actively uses them to advocate for others.\n\n“She deserves a ton more credit than she gets in this regard,” said Becca Roux, executive director of the USWNT Players Association. “A lot of people talk,” Roux added. “She does a lot of work that people never see.”\n\nRead Nancy Armour’s full feature here.\n\nHow Naomi Girma, Sophia Smith keep friend, late Stanford teammate Katie Meyer in hearts\n\nKatie Meyer’s parents joke that their daughter would have taken a plane, a ferry, even \"a trained dolphin\" to be in the stands at this World Cup, cheering on the Stanford teammates who were so close they were more like sisters than friends.\n\nGina and Steve Meyer are certain their daughter is still riding with the U.S. women, thanks to Sophia Smith, Naomi Girma and other players using the biggest moment of their careers to make sure Katie isn’t forgotten and no one else has to feel a similar loss.\n\n\"It is so heartwarming. And heartbreaking,\" Gina Meyer told USA TODAY Sports. \"We’re just so proud of them. They didn’t have to do anything but to remember their friend, but they really want to talk about this subject, which is usually brushed under the rug.\n\n\"It’s such a beautiful thing that this whole team jumped on board and said, 'We want to be a part of this.'\"\n\nRead Nancy Armour’s full feature here.\n\nUSWNT: Why the Americans embrace the pressure of this World Cup\n\nIt doesn't matter whether the U.S. women are in sweats, training gear or those sharp-looking Nike x Martine Rose suits they're rocking at this World Cup.\n\nThey always wear a target on their backs. They're well aware of this. And they embrace it.\n\n“This is not team that does any sort of resting on its laurels,\" Megan Rapinoe said last month. \"That's what has been the fuel for this team always: To strive to be the very best. To try to win every single game, whether it’s in practice or actually on the field.\n\n“For us, it’s just about continuing to put our best foot forward and continuing to try to be dominant and be the best team in the world.”\n\nRead Nancy Armour’s full column here.\n\nWellington weather forecast: Windy\n\nUSA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour is on the ground in Wellington, New Zealand and reports that it’s very, very windy at the stadium. The temperature might read low 50s, but it feels like the 40s. (Remember, it's winter in New Zealand.)

He also knows an early setback can be overcome in international soccer.\n\nWith that in mind, the France coach was not unduly concerned by his team's 0-0 with Jamaica on Sunday, which was one of the biggest surprises so far at the Women’s World Cup.\n\nRenard led Saudi Arabia to a famous win against Argentina at the men's World Cup in Qatar last year, before Lionel Messi's team rebounded and went on to lift the trophy for their country.\n\n“I’ve already won competitions after drawing my first two games,” said the two-time Africa Cup of Nations-winning coach. \"Let’s talk about the World Cup 2022. I don’t think that we should be getting ahead of ourselves.\n\n“There are lots of people, lots of teams that start with the fanfare and are not there come the final and others are maybe slow to get out of the starting blocks.”\n\nWhile there is no need for France to panic, this was still an unexpected result for the fifth-ranked team in the world and one of the tournament favorites.\n\nBy contrast Jamaica is ranked 43rd and entered the tournament co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand having lost all of its games at its World Cup debut in 2019 with a goal difference of -11.\n\n“We always tell our players just don’t worry about the rankings,” said Jamaica coach Lorne Donaldson, who declared his country's first point ever in the competition as its greatest achievement in soccer.\n\n“I think it is the No. 1 result I have seen men or women,” he said. “I would put it there. If you go by the rankings you would say that result on this stage has to be No. 1.”\n\nJamaica's players ran onto the field after the final whistle as if they'd been crowned world champions. It would have been a very different story had Kadidiatou Diani's 90th-minute header not struck the bar.\n\nIn a game of few chances, Diani had France's best opportunities to score a winner, but could not find a breakthrough at the Sydney Football Stadium.\n\nShe forced a save from Jamaica goalkeeper Rebecca Spencer in the first half and saw another effort deflected wide.\n\nAnother header in the second half also went wide of the target before her late effort came back off the bar.\n\nThe French were expected to be too strong for Jamaica, but favorites have not had everything their own way so far in the tournament. The 2019 quarterfinalists were the latest to struggle against an underdog.\n\nAustralia needed a penalty to get a 1-0 win against Ireland, while European champion England also needed a spot kick to overcome Haiti 1-0. Nigeria held Olympic champion Canada 0-0.\n\n“The French are used to having the upper hand during the opening games, but this is something that is going to change because things are getting a lot closer,\" Renard said. “We need to keep our heads up high and we need to keep our confidence high.”\n\nJamaica did well to disrupt a France team that struggled to put together fluid moves.\n\nIn one of France’s few moments of quality in the first half, Diani saw a low effort bundled around the post by Spencer. From the resulting corner, Wendie Renard headed over from close range.\n\nKadidiatou was fractions away from giving France a halftime lead when firing from the edge of the area. Chantelle Swaby managed to get something in the way of the shot, which deflected narrowly wide with the keeper beaten.\n\nAfter seeing another header go wide after the break, Kadidiatou almost came up with the decisive moment when hitting the bar.\n\nOn an otherwise joyous night for Jamaica, it may come to regret the red card for star forward Khadija Shaw, who will be suspended for the next game.\n\nWHAT’S NEXT\n\nFrance plays Brazil in Brisbane on Saturday.

Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/16/football/host-cities-2026-fifa-world-cup/index.html", "title": "2026 FIFA World Cup sites revealed for 16 cities in Canada, Mexico ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMatches for the 2026 World Cup will be held in 11 US cities as well as three host sites in Mexico and two in Canada, soccer’s world governing body, FIFA, announced Thursday.\n\nThe 16 host cities will be: Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, Guadalajara, Houston, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Miami, Monterrey, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nFIFA officials will decide at a later date which of the 16 cities will host group play and which will host elimination round matches.\n\n“We congratulate the 16 FIFA World Cup Host Cities on their outstanding commitment and passion,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a news release. “Today is a historic day – for everyone in those cities and states, for FIFA, for Canada, the USA and Mexico who will put on the greatest show on Earth.

New Zealand keeper Victoria Esson bobbled and fumbled it as it crossed the goal line.\n\nBolden pumped her fist as she sprinted to the sideline to celebrate with her teammates after scoring the first-ever goal at the Women’s World Cup for the Philippines, one that also made her team the first of 2023 edition's eight newcomers to claim a win. It was 1-0, but that's all the Filipinas needed to beat the Football Ferns.\n\n“I’ll remember this moment forever, for the rest of my life,” Bolden said after the match. “I’m so happy to be a part of it,”\n\nThe 27-year-old forward didn’t have a straightforward path to representing the Philippines. Born in Santa Clara, California, Bolden spent her early sporting years playing for American academies.\n\nBolden joined the Philippines national team in 2018 while she was playing for Loyola Marymount. She would go on to sign her first professional club contract in 2019 with Sandvikens IF in Sweden. After departing Sweden, she spent time playing for teams in Taiwan, the United States, Japan and now Australia with the Western Sydney Wanderers.\n\n“Just getting to experience all those kinds of different styles, I think it’s made me into the soccer player that I am today,” Bolden said.\n\nThe reaction to Bolden’s goal was instant. The large contingent of Filipino fans standing behind their team’s bench erupted as the New Zealand fans around the stadium let out cries of shock.\n\nAfter the match, the Filipinas walked the length of the touchline behind the technical area in Sky Stadium, where thousands of fans celebrated the win as the players took a bow in front of them.\n\n“I’ve just been learning that Filipinos are literally everywhere,” Bolden said. “I think we’re a great representation of what Filipinos are and we’re far and wide, But to culminate everyone together and to get everyone on the same page is amazing.”\n\nSince she committed to the Philippines, Bolden has played in 37 international matches and scored 22 goals.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Bolden has been her country’s star, either. In her senior international debut for the Philippines, Bolden scored the game winner in a 2-1 victory over Jordan in the 2018 AFC Women’s Asian Cup. In the 2022 AFC Women’s Asian Cup, she scored the last kick in a penalty shootout against Taiwan that earned the Philippines a spot in the 2023 Women’s World Cup.\n\n___\n\nJoe Lister is a student in the John Curley Center for Sports Journalism at Penn State.\n\n___\n\nAP Women’s World Cup coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/fifa-womens-world-cup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2019/07/07/rapinoe-fuses-politics-pay-and-tech-with-world-cup-win/39662071/", "title": "Rapinoe fuses politics, pay and tech with World Cup win", "text": "AP\n\nLYON, France (AP) — A Women's World Cup stirred by heated debates on politics, pay and technology saw the narratives fused in Sunday's final by the undisputed and outspoken star of the tournament: Megan Rapinoe.\n\nBy opening the scoring with a penalty awarded after a video review, Rapinoe claimed a sixth goal and — thanks to three assists and playing fewer minutes — finished as the Golden Boot winner of the most-watched FIFA women's tournament.\n\nWinning the top player prize provided the pink-haired captain renowned for her individuality and activism with a platform for both after the Americans completed their title defense with a 2-0 victory over the Netherlands.\n\nThe forward got to collect her scoring trophy before the main prize was handed out in Lyon, and revel in the adulation.\n\nBut only after the introduction of French President Emmanuel Macron and FIFA counterpart Gianni Infantino for the on-field trophy presentation was followed by boos and chants of \"equal pay\" — thousands taking up Rapinoe's campaign for more equitable prize money from the World Cup organizers and compensation from the U.S. federation.\n\n\"A little public shame never hurt anyone,\" Rapinoe said with a winners' medal around her neck. \"So I am down with it.\"\n\nNot down with a visit to the White House, though, with Rapinoe's rejection of a post-tournament visit delivered publicly in a video that emerged during the World Cup.\n\n\"Megan should WIN first before she TALKS!\" President Donald Trump responded in tweet that lit up the tournament. \"Finish the job!\"\n\nWhen the job was finished Sunday, thanks to Rose Lavelle also scoring, only congratulations came from Trump — for the entire team.\n\n\"Great and exciting play,\" he tweeted. \"America is proud of you all!\"\n\nIn the hours before the Americans won a record fourth World Cup, Rapinoe found an advocate for the pursuit of greater pay equality in the French president.\n\n\"We need to go progressively toward that,\" Macron said. \"We should progressively converge.\"\n\nThat is undermined by the prize money for the men's World Cup in 2022 jumping to $440 million when the women's teams will only split $60 million in 2023.\n\nThis time, it is only half that.\n\nVictory gave the Americans $4 million — double the amount earned four years ago — as part of a $30 million prize pot but lagging the $38 million earned by France for lifting the men's trophy last July in Moscow.\n\nOn the eve of the final, sitting in the same news conference position occupied by Infantino a day earlier, Rapinoe rebuked the head of soccer's governing body for disrespecting women as the prize-money gulf widens with the winners of the men's World Cups.\n\nRapinoe chose not to confront Infantino on the field.\n\n\"There was a wry smile, for sure,\" she said. \"He knows. He did say we'll have a conversation or something. I said, 'I'd love to.'\"\n\nRapinoe has something to be thankful to Infantino for: the introduction of VAR, which has had a disruptive debut in women's soccer as referees and players have adjusted to the new technology. Replays confirmed Dutch defender Stefanie van der Gragt's high challenge on striker Alex Morgan and Rapinoe took on penalty duties for her 50th international goal.\n\n\"VAR wouldn't miss the final, she had to show up somewhere,\" Rapinoe said. \"It has gotten a lot of stick in the tournament.

Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nAmerican sports fans, if you don’t love soccer now (and yes, you can call it that — this whole “football versus soccer” thing is just stupid and unbecoming to global society), there might be no hope for you.\n\nArgentina’s shootout victory over defending champion France in the men’s World Cup final on Sunday at Lusail Stadium in Qatar was a showdown between two of the most powerful soccer cultures in the world. And it didn’t just deliver: It created possibly the greatest championship game in the history of sport.\n\nAmy Bass Rodney Bedsole\n\nThe World Cup is coming to North America in 2026, so even if you missed Sunday’s clash of the soccer titans, you have four years to get up to speed on why this epic match serves as an exemplar of soccer’s greatness and its power to galvanize a truly global conversation about sport as a vehicle to inspire and transform.\n\nEven before the first touch, the most obvious narratives of this final had already been written. It had been reduced by many as Lionel Messi versus Kylian Mbappé, positioning the teammates at Paris St-Germain (owned by Qatar Sports Investments) as the GOAT and the heir apparent — with Messi likely in his last dance, while Mbappé, already a champion four years ago when he was just 19, has so much more ahead.\n\nFor most of the match, it looked like Messi would grab the one thing missing from his illustrious career, almost casually scoring on a penalty kick just 20 minutes in. As France looked to have almost no control over play, a second goal for Argentina soon followed, a Messi touch on transition building a beautiful sequence — deemed by bestselling writer and soccer nut John Green “one of the greatest works of art our species has ever created” — that allowed Ángel Di María to get the ball inside the net.\n\nBut France, or at least Mbappé, was not done — he became the first men’s player since England’s Geoff Hurst in 1966 to score a hat trick in a World Cup final — three goals by one player in a single game — even if France came up short.\n\nAnd yet as thrilling as this final was, it is not the only story of this World Cup, a tournament that was as much about what comes next as it was about Messi. In the minutes before the start of the final, all of the juxtapositions, contradictions and incongruities that surrounded this tournament should have been exhausted but rather took one last spin, with the recorded voice of LGBTQ icon Freddie Mercury (who died of complications from AIDS in 1991) riling up the pregame crowd in a country known to squash LGBTQ campaigns.\n\nIndeed, it bears repeating that there has been a lot to this World Cup that has not been beautiful, including the thousands of migrant workers who are reported by The Guardian to have died while transforming a country with little soccer culture into a land of air-conditioned stadiums. (Qatar’s World Cup chief in a British TV interview admitted to much lower but still sobering 400 to 500 deaths of migrants who readied the Gulf nation for the event.)\n\nMore tragic losses followed — the deaths of soccer writer extraordinaire Grant Wahl — a towering figure in the field as well as a really nice guy — and Qatari photojournalist Khalid al-Misslam.\n\nYet there was beauty to be found in this controversial and grief-diminished World Cup, particularly the story of Morocco. The run of the Atlas Lions, whose trip to the semifinals against France made it a first and only on many levels as they marched through what felt like a master class in post-colonial history — Belgium, Spain, Portugal — to inspire an enduring Pan-Arab spirit.\n\nJust as Croatia announced itself to the world four years ago, Morocco, too, is just getting started, the nation’s investment in soccer bearing fruit lush and deep. While Morocco fell to Croatia in Saturday’s match for third place, in a multitude of ways this was its tournament, its fans flocking to Qatar in such numbers that Qatar Airways canceled flights the morning of its semifinal match, hoping to curb the overwhelming surge.\n\nYet if Morocco was the team of the tournament, Messi was its towering figure, his merch becoming more scarce than Taylor Swift tickets, crashing Adidas stores worldwide. His global superstardom helped soccer stay center stage amid all the chaos that has surrounded this Qatar World Cup for the last 12 years.\n\nNot quite ready to be in the sport’s rearview mirror, he solidified foundations for what a generational international soccer star can look, play and be like, including his impending retirement. “Through it all, Lionel Messi has defied the machismo in Argentine football in his own gentle way,” historian Brenda Elsey recently observed in The New York Times. “Football stadiums are part of a sexist ecosystem where displays of misogyny and homophobia are commonplace; organized fans called ‘barras bravas’ have created terrifying conditions during matches. Messi has rejected this violence. …”\n\nSuch positioning of Messi comes just in time for next year when the World Cup heads down under to New Zealand and Australia for the women’s championship, with early tickets sales already making headlines.\n\nWhile the US men’s team performed admirably in Qatar, making it to the knockout round after failing to qualify four years ago and bringing home the first World Cup paycheck under US Soccer’s new collective bargaining agreement centered on equal pay, the American women will be looking to defend a title, having defeated the Dutch in 2019 for their fourth World Cup crown.\n\nBut increasing global interest in the women’s game means it will not be easy for the American women to stay on top, as their dynasty faces worthy challengers from a range of squads, including former champions Japan, Germany and Norway as well as Sweden, Brazil and China.\n\nTheir success is key in continuing to shift America’s notorious apathy toward the beautiful game. Despite soccer consistently building television ratings, merchandise and ticket sales, American disdain for it remains a real thing, keeping the sport outside the realm of the “big three” — football, baseball, basketball — despite the thousands of children who hit the pitch every weekend, spring and fall, the growing Major League Soccer and National Women’s Soccer League crowds, and the devout fan base of “Ted Lasso.”\n\nAccusations that soccer is tedious, the behavior of “flopping” players is ludicrous, the timekeeping is bewildering, and that the offside rule makes no sense create a divide between those who think soccer has finally arrived in the United States and those who claim it has not and never will.\n\nThat it is the relative low score of soccer games that seems to be the chief complaint of many (especially those who ignore the math that goes into an American football game) demonstrates a gap of understanding of soccer that remains in the United States. The scores are low because, well, soccer is hard — a fluid game played across an enormous expanse of green space whose players maneuver a small ball with grace, patience and power while running and moving nearly constantly for miles.\n\nIt is critical for Americans to wrap their collective heads around this, not just to cheer on the US women next year, but also because, again, in just four years’ time, the men’s World Cup is coming to 16 cities across North America. The United States will host most of the matches, with cities in Canada and Mexico also playing host.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter.

After the 2022 World Cup, it is clearer now than perhaps ever before that the world — the whole world — is the home of its most popular game. So, Americans — whether watching the women next year or the men in 2026 — better get ready. They don’t have to like it. But they should understand it. And it won’t be easy.

PETERSON\n\nAP\n\nCanada Soccer and the women's national team have agreed on an interim funding agreement that is retroactive to last year after players threatened to boycott team activities at last month's SheBelieves Cup tournament.\n\nThe two sides issued a joint statement Thursday which said the terms of the agreement include “per-game incentives and results-based compensation” similar to an agreement with the men's team. The federation is still negotiating a collective bargaining agreement with both.\n\n“This is about respect, this is about dignity, and this is about equalising the competitive environment in a world that is fundamentally unequal,” Canada Soccer general secretary Earl Cochrane said in a statement. “We have been consistent and public about the need to have fairness and equal pay be pillars of any new agreements with our players, and we are delivering on that today.\"\n\nWith an agreement in place, details of the federation's funding are being finalized by legal counsel from both sides, the announcement said.\n\nThe women's team said last month that players in February. Canada was among four teams participating in the round-robin tournament that visited three cities.\n\nThe Canadian women, who are seeking equal pay to their male counterparts, claimed they were not compensated for 2022. They said they've had to cut training camp days and full camp windows, as well as trim the number of players and staff invited into camps. They were told there would be no home games scheduled before the Women's World Cup this summer.\n\nAfter the players' action, Canada Soccer said that such a move amounted to an illegal strike, and the players acquiesced. But team captain Christine Sinclair said the team was playing in the SheBeleieves under protest.\n\nDuring the anthems before each match, . The purple was a symbol for equity. American and Japanese players also wore purple armbands in solidarity.\n\nThe labor dispute between the national teams and Canada Soccer stretches back to last June when the men’s team — at the time preparing for its first World Cup appearance in 36 years — boycotted a match against Panama in Vancouver to draw attention to the issue.\n\nBoth national teams have raised questions about Canada Soccer and its relationship to Canadian Soccer Business. The CSB represents the federation in media and sponsorship deals and in turn it pays the federation a guaranteed sum per year. The CSB has not replied to emails from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nThe women want the same backing ahead of this summer’s World Cup in Australia and New Zealand as the men received at their World Cup in Qatar last year. The two teams also want an explanation for why their programs are being cut this year.\n\n, acknowledging change is needed to achieve labor peace with the men’s and women’s teams.\n\nOn Thursday, before the funding agreement with the women was announced,\n\n“However, Canada Soccer must also respond to the players associations' requests for proper, transparent and comprehensive access to its financial record, particularly in light of recent budget cuts to the very programs that have generated unprecedented sponsor interest in supporting the national teams,” the statement said. “It needs to address the unauthorized use still being made of national team player images. It needs to take immediate action to address the untenable financial constraints imposed by its agreement with Canadian Soccer Business, once an for all.”\n\nThe two teams called on the federation to work with them on the best path forward before a successor is named.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/Soccer and", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/02"}]}

And one such moment happens today, as King Charles III makes his way to Westminster Abbey to have that solid gold, gemstone-laden St. Edward’s Crown set upon his 74-year-old head.\n\nNo question the royal family is navigating rough waters. Many of its current and former subjects both question the institution’s relevance and demand an accounting for centuries of colonial rule. Others still are caught up in the unending personal scandals swirling around the divorced, multi-racial and sprawling clan.\n\nBut for one moment, that all can perhaps be set aside in order to take in an exquisite and decorous pageant inimitably crafted by one of the planet’s oldest monarchies.\n\nHere are all of Charles' moving moments from the historic day.\n\nMore:Everything that happened at King Charles III's coronation\n\nKing and queen return to Buckingham Palace for balcony appearance\n\nFollowing the official crowning at Westminster Abbey, King Charles and Queen Camilla rode in a gold carriage back to Buckingham Palace, where they were greeted with a royal salute.\n\nCharles and Camilla appeared on the palace's balcony to greet their subjects. They were joined by some family members, including Prince William, Duchess Kate and their three children. Prince Harry, who stepped down as a senior member of the royal family in 2020 and now lives in Los Angeles with his wife, Duchess Meghan, was not among them. Neither was Prince Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after controversy over allegations of sexual assault and involvement with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nCharles smiled and waved to cheering crowds standing in the rain before he headed back inside the palace with his family − though Charles and Camilla briefly returned to the balcony alone to wave again to the crowd, then stood around for a moment while waiting for the page boys to carry their trains back inside. They'll next convene for formal portraits and a private family lunch.\n\n'God Save The King': Attendees sing as Charles' procession exits Westminster Abbey\n\nCharles made his way slowly out of Westminster Abbey, flanked by the Bishop of Bath and Wales and the Bishop of Durham, as well as several pages carrying his robes, including grandson and second in line to the throne, Prince George. He wore the Imperial Crown along with the purple velvet Robes of Estate. Those in the abbey stood to sing the National Anthem, \"God Save The King.\"\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla formally crowned\n\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury placed the St. Edward's crown atop the king's head, pausing to ensure it was placed correctly.\n\nKing Charles will wear two crowns during the ceremony: St. Edward's crown and the Imperial State Crown. The former crown will only be used for ceremony purposes before being switched out for the Imperial Crown, or Tudor Crown, for the procession back to Buckingham Palace.\n\nQueen Camilla was next to be crowned. The archbishop placed Queen Mary's Crown atop her head. Camilla chose to be adorned with the headpiece, marking the first time a queen consort will be crowned with an already existing crown. Queen Mary's crown was created in 1911 for Queen Mary's coronation but was customized for Camilla with new diamonds that belonged to Queen Elizabeth.\n\nScreens cover King Charles during anointing\n\nCharles re-wore historical coronation robes in an effort to practice sustainability: He arrived to the abbey in robes first made for King George IV in the 1800s, and atop that, the same robes his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, wore for her coronation in 1953.\n\nDuring the ceremony, he removed the heavy robes he wore upon arrival and donned a white tunic made for his grandfather George VI’s coronation in 1937. He stepped behind a three-sided screen held up by pages while he was anointed with holy oil, a private and sacred part of the coronation process.\n\nHe then donned the Imperial Mantle, a glittering embroidered robe, atop the Superturnica, a gold coat made for George V in 1911.\n\nMore:King Charles III's coronation oil has special connection to late mother Queen Elizabeth II\n\nKing Charles makes coronation oaths\n\nInside Westminster Abbey, the king knelt as he placed his hands on the Coronation Bible and agreed to a series of oaths, vowing to uphold the law and the Church of England.\n\n\"The things which I have herebefore promised I will perform and keep, so help me God,\" he said, kissing the Bible.\n\nReturning to his seat, Charles signed the coronation oaths. He then moved again to kneel to deliver the King's prayer. \"Grant that I may be a blessing to all thy children of every belief and faith,\" Charles read.\n\nKing Charles, Queen Camilla arrive at Westminster Abbey\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla arrived via carriage to Westminster Abbey five minutes ahead of schedule and waited in the carriage for a short time. Camilla exited the carriage first and had several pages carry the long train of her robes to keep them out of the rainy street. Charles followed, flanked by several pages including Prince George.\n\nWhat to expect from coronation day, and beyond\n\nCoronation day began early for those watching in the U.S., around 4 a.m. EST, or 9 a.m. local time, when live TV coverage began, focusing on those lining London’s procession route and guests filing into the fabled abbey.\n\nJust after 5 a.m. EST (10 a.m. local time), King Charles and Queen Consort Camilla made their way from Buckingham Palace in the Diamond Jubilee Carriage to Westminster, where the coronation ceremony began at 6 a.m. EST (11 a.m. local time). By noon local time, Charles wore that 444-jewel-packed crown.\n\nWhat followed next was an assortment of pomp and circumstance, from a longer carriage ride back to the palace to a military jet fly by. The festivities then spill into Sunday, when Britons are being encouraged to host their own “Big Lunches” with friends and neighbors, while the royal crew caps their partying day with a private concert at Windsor Castle featuring Lionel Richie and Katy Perry.\n\nContributing: Marco della Cava, Elise Brisco\n\nRead all our King Charles coronation coverage:\n\nBiggest moments: Charles and Camilla crowned, royal family appears on balcony\n\nThe balcony:See who greeted the crowd with Charles and Camilla (not Harry)\n\nKing Charles III formally crowned: A recap of the monarch's coronation day\n\nQueen Camilla looks regal: She is also crowned at King Charles III coronation\n\nPrince Harry: Royal attends but misses balcony palace moment\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis: See the royal grandchildren on coronation day\n\nPrince Harry and Prince William: Look back their complicated relationship\n\nCoronation photos: See all the best photos from the ceremony and procession", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/08/camilla-queen-consort-meaning-explained/8028017001/", "title": "Why is Camilla queen? The royal title of King Charles' wife, explained", "text": "King Charles III now presides over the British monarchy. And by his side: Queen Camilla.\n\nWait a second. When Queen Elizabeth II, who died Sept. 8, 2022, reigned for her 70 years, her better half wasn't King Philip but rather HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. As with many things royal, it's complicated.\n\nCamilla's new title was set in motion in February 2022, when Elizabeth decreed during festivities marking her seven decades on the throne that the Duchess of Cornwall should be known as Queen Consort, as opposed to Princess Consort, when Charles ascended to the throne.\n\n\"Queen Consort\" is the fancy name for the wife of a reigning king, which the United Kingdom has not had since 1952, when King George VI died and his widow, Queen Elizabeth, became the Queen Mother.\n\nConfused? You're not alone. We shall endeavor to explain.\n\nWhat is a queen consort?\n\nAll previous wives of British or English kings were queen consorts (that includes all six of Henry VIII's wives, at least while they were married to him). In the 20th century, there were two: Queen Mary, wife of King George V, and Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII (Queen Elizabeth II's grandmother and great-grandmother, respectively).\n\nHandy hint: Here's how you can tell the difference between the two Elizabeths: Queen Elizabeth II had a Roman numeral after her name, signifying her as the second sovereign of that name, not a consort.\n\nAlso for the record, there have been only six British or English reigning queens among the 41 monarchs since 1066 – Mary I, Elizabeth I, Mary II, Anne, Victoria, Elizabeth II – so it's easier to tell them apart.\n\nWhat does a Queen Consort do?\n\nAs with the first lady of the United States, there's no job description, no official duties and no salary. But there's high visibility, high pressure and high expectations from the public whose taxes pay for the monarchy.\n\nIn general, a queen consort's job is to support the king in any way she can. Job No. 1 is to birth heirs, but that isn't an issue for Charles, 74, and Camilla, 75, who each have children from their previous marriages. The royal succession is set for three more generations: After Charles comes his elder son, Prince William, 40, and after that William's elder son, Prince George, 9.\n\nAs the wife of Charles for the past 17 years, Camilla has already been doing what a queen consort would do: She is a royal patron to scores of charities and good causes, accompanies her husband on royal tours, meets thousands of people every year, and is gracious and charming with everyone.\n\nOne no-no: getting involved in political matters.\n\nWho could be a model for Queen Camilla?\n\nQueen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, who became queen consort after her brother-in-law King Edward VIII abdicated in 1936, helped save the British monarchy by steeling her husband, who was nearly undone by the pressures of being an unexpected king, especially during World War II.\n\nShe went with him everywhere, visiting bombed-out Londoners in the East End and spreading her brand of royal magic that people remembered fondly many decades later. When Buckingham Palace was bombed in 1940 and the king and queen narrowly escaped harm, she said she was glad because it \"makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.\"\n\nWhen she died in 2002 at age 101, an estimated 200,000 people filed past her casket at the Palace of Westminster over three days. The line stretched more than a mile along the River Thames.\n\nDo we have to call her Queen Consort Camilla?\n\nNo, Queen Camilla will do. It's nicely alliterative and the \"consort\" part is understood.\n\nThe official palace press operation will always refer to her as \"Her Majesty\" in any news release, but American media rarely use HM or HRH, for \"Her Royal Highness,\" in referring to Camilla now.\n\nHowever, Buckingham Palace officially identified her as Queen Camilla for the first time in April when revealing its invitation design for King Charles' coronation. Camilla will be crowned alongside her husband at the ceremony on May 6.\n\nThe title was notable because it marks a step in the remarkable transformation of a woman once derided as a homewrecker because of her role in the breakdown of Charles’ marriage to the late Princess Diana.\n\nWhy isn't Camilla the Princess of Wales?\n\nBecause of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, who long blamed Camilla for the breakup of her marriage to Charles (even though that wasn't all Camilla's doing) and because public fury at Camilla remained when she and Charles were married in 2005, eight years after Diana's death in a car crash in Paris.\n\nAt the time, it was decided that Camilla would take one of Charles' lesser titles, Duchess of Cornwall, to help soothe public feelings.\n\nThe title Princess of Wales is now held by Prince William's wife, the former Kate Middleton. Following Queen Elizabeth's death, King Charles named William and Kate the Prince and Princess of Wales, making Kate the first to hold the title since Diana's death in 1997. In fact, she is one of only three princesses to be known as Princess of Wales since 1901.\n\nHow come men married to sovereign queens aren't called 'King'?\n\nBecause by sexist definition, a king outranks a queen, and if she is the heir – the elder daughter of a king – and she has no brother, as in the case of Elizabeth II, then she is the sovereign and not her husband. He has to walk a few paces behind her for the rest of their married life.\n\nThat's especially true if he's foreign-born, as was the case for Prince Philip.\n\nWill Queen Camilla be crowned?\n\nYes. The most important head at any coronation is that of the sovereign, but the queen consort is crowned, too.\n\nAnd according to The Mail on Sunday, Camilla will be crowned with the Queen Mother’s platinum and diamond tiara, created for George VI’s coronation in 1937. The crown features thousands of diamonds, including the infamous 105-carat Koh-i-Noor diamond from India, which came into British hands and the British Crown Jewels by murky means in the colonial era. It was last seen in public resting on the Queen Mother's casket at her funeral.\n\nBy contrast, when Elizabeth II was crowned in Westminster Abbey in June 1953, she was alone on the throne above the Stone of Scone, and she alone received St. Edward's Crown from the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nIf King Charles dies, will Camilla be queen?\n\nWhile we call her Queen Camilla, she will never be the reigning queen. Only members of the royal family who are born in the direct line of succession can become the monarch.\n\nWith Prince William and his son Prince George the next two in line for the throne after King Charles, a reigning queen is unlikely to come anytime soon.

But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when Elizabeth was crowned.\n\nThe queen died Thursday at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, at age 96 after 70 years on the throne.

But there's little puzzlement in the royal palaces, in Parliament or the British government, and almost certainly none in Charles' mind.\n\nWhat happens next has been carefully planned out decades in advance, based on combining ancient funeral and coronation traditions with practical measures to cope with such modern realities as instant communication, traffic control, social media and the vestiges of a killer pandemic.\n\nWhat kind of sovereign will Charles be? That's a different question. But we can make some guesses based on what he's said and done at least since his investiture as Prince of Wales in an elaborate (and largely modern-invention ceremony) in July 1969 at Caernarfon Castle in Wales, when he was 20.\n\nLegally, he became king from the moment of the queen's death, meaning he is head of state for the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and a dozen other countries. He's also the titular head of the Church of England, head of the military and the judiciary, and a host of other royal titles and duties.\n\nCharles, like his mother, will likely take the religious significance of his coronation very seriously, as a man long interested in philosophy and religious thought.\n\n\"He won’t really be king (in his mind) until he's consecrated with the holy oil, makes the sacred oath and has the crown on his head,\" says his American biographer Sally Bedell Smith. \"That moment when he is a 'transcendent being,' in a way, is really, really crucial.\"\n\nWhat happens now that Queen Elizabeth II has died?From funeral plans to processions\n\n► Stay up to date with the latest on King Charles III and the royal succession with our newsletter Keep Calm and Carry On. Sign up here.\n\nWhat is Charles' legacy as Prince of Wales?\n\nJust as the queen was the longest-serving monarch in British history, Prince Charles has been the longest-serving Prince of Wales in history – but not just that, says Bedell Smith.\n\n\"His record as Prince of Wales, in its breadth and depth, will be his real legacy,\" Bedell Smith says. \"He was the most innovative prince of Wales ever – he was an activist in a way no other heir to the throne ever has been.\"\n\nPart of the impetus for doing all he did, including his philanthropy, his entrepreneurial initiatives, the institutions and traditions he helped to preserve, demonstrate \"his wish to prove himself worthy of being king,\" Bedell Smith says.\n\n\"As prince of Wales, he had the freedom to do all these things, and he sometimes crossed the line of constitutional propriety, but as prince of Wales he was not bounded by it as the queen was.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth II dies at 96:King Charles III takes the throne\n\nCamilla and the shadow of Princess Diana\n\nThe first potential problem of Charles' reign – what to call his wife – has been mostly resolved by his mother: On the eve of her Accession Day, Feb. 6, 2022, she declared publicly in a message to her people that it was her \"sincere wish\" that Charles' second wife Camilla, 75, then the Duchess of Cornwall (instead of Princess of Wales), should be known as Queen Consort when her son succeeds.\n\nIt was what Charles had wanted from the day he married the former Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005 when it was announced that she would be known as Princess Consort when he became king. It was a gesture to the many still-angry partisans of the late Princess Diana, who blamed Camilla for breaking up her marriage to Charles.\n\nBy law and custom, Camilla would be Queen Consort anyway, and legislation would be required to go against Charles' wishes as king. But his mother provided for a smooth transition and reduced public carping by making clear her wishes in advance.\n\nThe late queen's endorsement of Camilla was crystal clear by January 2022 when she \"graciously\" appointed Camilla a Royal Lady of the Order of the Garter. Founded by Edward III in 1348, the prestigious Order of the Garter is the oldest and most senior British order of chivalry; the appointment was an unmistakable sign of the top royal's approval.\n\n\"It paves the way for the duchess to become not only queen by right when Prince Charles succeeds to the throne, but queen by name,\" wrote royal biographer Hugo Vickers in The Daily Mail at the time. \"There is no greater honor or better indication of the respect in which she is held by the queen.\"\n\nIt also means that Camilla will be crowned alongside Charles at his coronation.\n\nBut will Charles' low popularity ratings, still influenced in some quarters by his contentious 1996 divorce from Diana, the so-called \"War of the Waleses,\" hobble him? Unflattering pop-culture portrayals such as \"The Crown\" and \"Spencer\" don't help, says Bedell Smith.\n\n\"There will be a lot of people in media and on social media who want to undermine him,\" she says. \"The shadow of Diana, shockingly, hasn’t diminished in all these years. It will plague him for the rest of his life; it's baggage he's carrying unfairly but it’s there. The only thing he can do is sail on and do his job and try not to let it get to him.\"\n\nWhat happens to the other royals?King Charles III promises a new slimmed-down monarchy\n\nWhat are Charles' plans?\n\nCharles has made no secret of his desire to \"slim down\" the monarchy – reduce the number of working senior royals supported by taxpayers – and reduce the overall multimillion-pound annual cost of the royal show. There has been talk that he will perhaps open Buckingham Palace to paying tourists year-round (it's only open during the summer now) or by turning private royal residences, such as Balmoral Castle in Scotland, into museums.\n\nHis many causes (organic farming, architecture and urban planning, fighting climate change, to name a few) will not be abandoned but at least initially he will be too busy with routine matters, such as weekly meetings with the prime minister and going through the multiple red boxes of government documents he must read daily, Bedell Smith predicts.\n\nKing Charles III succeeds Queen Elizabeth:What to know about British royal line\n\n\"He will be more voluble in those meetings than his mother, he will offer more opinions which, fortunately, (ministers) don’t have to do anything about,\" Bedell Smith says. \"He will be less reserved in his meetings than his mother was but he won’t try in any way to directly influence government policy because the (unwritten British) constitution prohibits that.\"\n\nOf course, there is incremental change and then there is big, honking, alarm-bell change, and the difference is in the eye of the beholder.\n\nCharles, whose interest in religions other than the Church of England, once mused about altering his role as \"Defender of the Faith\" to \"Defender of Faith,\" to acknowledge the diversity of religions in modern Britain.\n\nBut that would require legislation in Parliament and would likely send the British establishment up the wall. After all, since 1701 it's been illegal for a British sovereign or spouse to be a Roman Catholic.\n\nInstead, Charles might choose a less controversial gesture, such as a more inclusive and ecumenical coronation featuring a more visible presence of other faiths, suggests Bedell Smith, who describes Charles as a \"spiritual questor\" since his school days in Scotland.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nCan Charles toe the line as a 'constitutional' king?\n\nMost of the speculation about the new king has focused on whether Charles would violate those prohibitions by being outspoken about political and other matters of public debate in a way his mother carefully avoided.\n\nAs prince of Wales, Charles was not always as scrupulous as his mother was, says Clive Irving, a longtime British journalist (former managing editor of the Sunday Times in London) and author of \"The Last Queen,\" a biography of Charles' mother that questions whether the monarchy can survive after her.\n\n\"She has always been neutral and apolitical, no one has caught her out on her political views and that is the difference between her and Charles – he can't help himself,\" says Irving. \"We know nothing about her views, we know an incredible amount about Charles' views. It's incredibly difficult to step into the shoes of (the queen's) kind of monarch.\"\n\nStill, says British journalist and royals commentator Anna Pasternak, Charles has learned important values from his mother, including deep loyalty to the monarchy and an \"unshakeable sense of duty.\" But she was no-nonsense and unemotional; he's more passionate, Pasternak says.\n\n\"One thing I’ve observed is that the more impassioned members of the royal family don’t tend to fare well,\" Pasternak says. \"If you have the stoicism that the queen (had), you do better, you’re able to put the role before your own character and your personal needs. Charles hasn’t been able to do that.\"\n\nWhat's the critical take on Charles?\n\nA frank critic of Charles, Irving describes him as a \"self-centered and narcissistic,\" having lived a coddled, entitled and privileged existence, an \"archaic-looking figure\" out of step with the times, and unused to being challenged.\n\n\"How can that kind of psychology possibly adapt to a completely different responsibility as head of state?\" Irving says. \"The magic of monarchy means something different to him, he interprets it through his own psychology.\"\n\nIrving predicts that the first year of Charles' reign will see the monarchy head \"over a cliff very fast\" amid disillusionment with the new king. \"She was brilliant at projecting classlessness – how can he possibly share the realities of our lives if he's never lived those realities?\"\n\nHowever privileged his upbringing, Charles has gone out of his way to demonstrate he cares about the less fortunate, especially through his charities, such as the Prince's Trust, which he founded in 1976 to help disadvantaged youths. The trust claims to have provided support to more than 1 million youths over the years.\n\nLast month, Charles served as editor of a special edition of the British African-Caribbean newspaper The Voice, the only national Black British newspaper operating in the U.K., which is marking its 40th anniversary this year. According to the palace, his edit celebrated the achievements of the Black community and reiterated Charles' collaborations with Black leaders and the work of his charities in those communities. (Charles' charities, his vast Duchy of Cornwall, and a host of other prince of Wales duties and activities will be taken over by his heir, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and other members of the family.)\n\nCharles also has attempted to push back against the criticism that he is too much a meddler to be a constitutional king. In an interview with the BBC for a documentary when he turned 70 in 2018, Charles made it clear he knows the rules and will follow them as king.\n\n\"I'm not that stupid,\" he snapped in the interview. \"I do realize that it is a separate exercise being sovereign, so of course, I understand entirely how that should operate.\" He should: He's been in training for this job since he was 4.\n\nCharles faces rare challenges\n\nCharles faces a challenge few other succeeding monarchs in British history have ever faced, a challenge not alleviated by his lower popularity ratings compared to his mother's, says Carolyn Harris, a historian and teacher at the University of Toronto and author of \"Raising Royalty: 1000 Years of Royal Parenting.\"\n\n\"When there is a long reign, the monarchy and the person as the monarch come to be seen as the same,\" Harris says. \"For many people, the queen is the only monarch they've ever known, so they closely associate the monarchy with her. The challenge is to step into that role when there's been a successful monarch in that role for decades.\"\n\nIrving says this transition could have been ameliorated had the queen abdicated or stepped aside before her death, allowing Charles to serve as prince regent for a period. But the queen promised she would never abdicate and she kept her promise.\n\n\"It would have been an entirely different piece of chemistry there, the country would have had the chance to get used to him, it would be easier than a sudden switch,\" Irving says.\n\nLong may he reign?\n\nCold life-expectancy calculations suggest Charles's reign will not come close to matching his mother's in years. He's more likely to echo the experience of one of his ancestors, Edward VII, who waited almost 60 years to succeed his mother Queen Victoria in 1901, and then reigned for only nine years.\n\nChristopher Andersen, author of multiple royal biographies (including his latest, \"Brothers and Wives: Inside the Private Lives of William, Kate, Harry and Meghan\"), thinks Charles could still enjoy a longish reign given his parents' longevity. (His father, Philip, died just short of his 100th birthday.)\n\n\"He has been waiting his entire life to do the job he was born to do, and will rush to make his mark on the monarchy,\" Andersen predicts. \"Given his mother's immense popularity and his lackluster standing in the polls, Charles would be wise to go slow, but he won't.\n\n\"Charles is not by nature a patient man; he is used to getting his way,\" Andersen says. \"Now that he no longer has Mama to answer to, that's not likely to change.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/uk/king-charles-iii-england-profile-intl/index.html", "title": "What can the world expect from King Charles III? | CNN", "text": "London CNN —\n\nFollowing the death of his mother, Elizabeth II, Charles has ascended to the British throne after more than 70 years as the heir apparent.\n\nIn a statement released shortly after the official announcement of her passing, Charles described the death of his “beloved” mother as “a moment of the greatest sadness for me and all members of my family.” The days since the Queen’s death have been a time during which Charles has both assumed his new duties and mourned a great personal loss.\n\nAfter a lifetime in the public eye, he is a familiar figure to many in Britain and around the globe. But no one yet knows what kind of monarch King Charles III – the title he has taken, ending years of speculation – will become.\n\nAs CNN’s royal correspondent, I’ve reported on Britain’s new King for many years and traveled around the world with him.\n\nOne of the best insights I had was when I was invited with a group of other journalists to Dumfries House, his stately home near Glasgow in Scotland, in 2018 ahead of his 70th birthday. I spent two days there and was given unusual access to Charles and many of those closest to him. I was treated to tours of the estate, high tea, dinners and a spectacular bagpiping performance beside a roaring open fire.\n\nThis is the place that brings it all together for the new King, all his greatest passions and causes – from music to rare breeds protection, apprenticeships for disadvantaged youth and organic farming. The whole estate is buzzing with activity, and I could see what a thrill it gave him to walk around and ask questions of his staff.\n\nEvery Friday night, wherever he is in the world, Charles is sent a hefty report updating him on the estate’s work and he has it back to them first thing Saturday morning with notes. His wife Camilla will tell you he’s up late every night reading, writing and responding to requests for support and advice.\n\nWhere many of his predecessors saw his former role of Prince of Wales as a ticket to a playboy lifestyle and a guaranteed income, Charles professionalized it and made it his own. He wanted a legacy, but he didn’t want to wait until he was King. In my experience, he’s impatient and driven, and gets incredibly frustrated if one of his projects isn’t working or bearing fruit.\n\n“The signs were there from young adulthood,” Kenneth Dunsmuir told me during the visit to Dumfries House. Dunsmuir runs The Prince’s Foundation, an educational charity set up by Charles to help teach traditional arts and skills. “His concerns about social issues in the community and ecological issues were all there and all that’s happened is that he has got more and more involved and has had the time to do that.”\n\nDumfries House is Charles' stately home near Glasgow in Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nDunsmuir’s comment points to the other reason Charles achieved so much during his tenure: he was the longest-serving Prince of Wales ever due to the longevity of his mother’s reign. Dunsmuir thinks of Dumfries House, he said, as a “fantastic physical legacy to that work that will always be here and always remain.”\n\nCharles has often struggled to contain his passion for his work, expressing his hopes and fears during speeches over the years and often sounding more like a campaigner than a constitutional monarch-in-waiting. That prompted accusations that he was threatening the independence and impartiality of the monarchy. Take climate change, on which he has been speaking out since 1968. It’s since become a mainstream issue and, for some, a political one. Charles was a prominent backer of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord and discussed the subject with Donald Trump over tea in December 2019, as the then-president prepared to pull the United States out of the pact.\n\nCharles, the Prince of Wales, poses for an official portrait in November 2008.

Whitby/Getty Images In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nThe following month, at the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Charles gave a powerful speech, asking: “Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing to bring the world back from the brink in time to restore the balance when we could have done? I don’t want to.”\n\nI sat down with Charles for an interview that day and he insisted the Paris Accord was still achievable. “We can’t go on like this, with every month another record in temperatures being broken. If we leave it too long, and we have done, just growing things is going to become difficult,” he said.\n\nDespite criticism – and at times ridicule – over his fight to be the royals’ ecowarrior, Charles has continued to be a pioneer in green issues in recent years.\n\nCharles was in his element at the COP26 Summit in Glasgow in November 2021, where he implored countries to work with industries to create solutions to climate change.\n\nCharles has spent his whole life preparing to be sovereign and has proved beyond doubt that he isn't work-shy. Victoria Jones/Pool/Getty Images\n\n“We know this will take trillions, not billions, of dollars,” he said at the time. Climate change and loss of biodiversity pose a great threat and the world must go on a “war-like footing” to combat them, he added.\n\nUS President Joe Biden commented on Charles’ decades-long efforts at the event, paying him the ultimate compliment by saying he’d got “the whole thing going” and “that’s how it all started.”\n\nCharles has been outspoken on a whole range of sensitive issues from genetically modified crops to homeopathic medicines and architecture. It’s made him a more divisive figure than his mother, who barely cracked an expression during her reign, let alone expressed an opinion. Elizabeth’s legendary ability not to offend and alienate was more strategic than many realize, but Charles has always insisted he intends to follow her lead and stop meddling when he takes the throne.\n\nCharles, pictured with Camilla, professionalized the role of Prince of Wales and made it his own. Hugo Burnand/Getty Images\n\nCharles walks in Cambridge in 1967 when he began his term at Trinity College. Peter Dunne/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, Charles said to the BBC: “The idea, somehow, that I’m going to go on in exactly the same way, if I have to succeed, is complete nonsense because the two – the two situations – are completely different.” When specifically asked if his campaigning would continue, he said: “No, it won’t. I’m not that stupid.”\n\nIn all the conversations I have had with members of the family and their aides, there has never been talk of the more popular Prince William leapfrogging his father to the throne either.\n\nCharles has spent his whole life preparing to be sovereign and has proved beyond doubt that he isn’t work-shy. William has never been in a rush to take the crown meanwhile, preferring to build his royal portfolio steadily whilst focusing on his young family and developing his own set of interests and causes.\n\nCharles and William came together personally and professionally when Prince Harry dispensed with his royal duties in 2020, leaving the remaining senior royals a much more compact group. The relationship between the new King and his heir will now be key to the future stability of the monarchy, as will the dynamic between the new King and his wife.\n\nI’ve seen what a tower of support Camilla has always been to Charles. I’ve seen how fractious and frustrated he can become when he faces an obstacle in his work, and she has a unique talent for dissipating any tension with a sense of humor and charisma that doesn’t come across on camera.\n\nCharles and William, pictured with Prince Harry in 1997, came together personally and professionally when Harry stepped back from his royal duties in 2020. Tim Graham Photo Library/Getty Images\n\nIn 2015 I sat down with Charles at another of his residences in Scotland – Birkhall, in the Highlands. It was to mark the couple’s 10th wedding anniversary ahead of a US tour.\n\nHe told me, “It’s always marvelous to have somebody who, you know, you feel understands and wants to encourage. Although she certainly pokes fun if I get too serious about things. And all that helps.”\n\nAfter the interview, I went with him to a drawing room where we were joined by Camilla as we waited for the cameras to get ready for some set-up shots. Camilla was asking how it went and joking about our outfits, and he was immediately more relaxed in her company. Her ability to steady a room has now become a national asset, as the wife of the country’s head of state – and symbol of stability.\n\nWith Camilla standing firmly by his side, Charles will now set his stamp on the monarchy. After decades in waiting, he is not only head of state for the United Kingdom but also for 14 other nations including Canada and Australia. The eyes of the world are on him as he assumes the mantle of King.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/world/royal-family-line-of-succession/index.html", "title": "The British royal family line of succession explained | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nCharles has become Britain’s new King following the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at the age of 96.\n\nThe Queen became the sixth female to ascend to the British throne in February 1952, after the death of her father, King George VI.

Benoit Tessier/Reuters In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nThe moment Elizabeth II died, her eldest child, Charles, automatically became monarch. As sovereign, he has chosen to take the name King Charles III.\n\nAll rights and responsibilities of the Crown now rest with King Charles III.\n\nHe becomes head of state not just in the UK but in 14 other Commonwealth realms including Australia and Canada. He will become head of the 56-member Commonwealth, although that is not a hereditary position, after his succession to the role was agreed by Commonwealth leaders at a meeting in London in 2018.\n\nHe has become head of the British Armed Forces, the judiciary and the civil service, and he is the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. He is the Fount of Honour, which means all honors, such as knighthoods, will now be given in his name.\n\nThe United Kingdom does not have a codified constitution, so the role of monarchy is defined by convention rather than law. He has a duty to remain politically impartial, which means he will come under greater scrutiny if he continues to express the views he is known for.\n\nHe has championed alternative medicines and organic farming techniques. In 1984, he hit out at the “glass stumps and concrete towers” of modern architecture. He has spent decades warning of the dangers of climate change. In the so-called “black spider” memos, he raised the issues he was concerned about directly with ministers.\n\nIn a BBC documentary to mark his 70th birthday, Charles acknowledged having ruffled feathers with his past interventions. But he promised not to meddle in controversial affairs once sovereign, saying he would operate within “the constitutional parameters.”\n\nElizabeth stayed “above politics” and never expressed herself in any way on any issue and as a result she rarely divided opinion. She managed to retain popular support and cross-party support in parliament, which was the one body with the power to dethrone her.\n\nWe will never know what she discussed in her regular audiences with her prime ministers, beginning with Churchill, but Charles is a more outspoken character. Will he go quiet on policy matters in public but continue to lobby in private? Will the prime minister act on it?\n\nThe prime ministerial audiences are one of several constitutional duties to which King Charles III will be expected to step up and they will bring him in regular contact with policymakers. He appoints the prime minister, opens parliamentary sessions, approves legislation and official appointments, receives the credentials of foreign ambassadors and hosts world leaders on state visits.\n\nCharles has also adopted the symbolic position as Head of Nation, meaning he becomes the symbol of national identity, unity, and pride. He represents continuity and celebrates excellence on behalf of the country. That’s why we see the monarch opening national events and leading commemorations.\n\nPeople would look to Elizabeth in times of crisis, but will they rally around King Charles III in the same way? He is more divisive not just because of his honest views but also because of the bad taste still left from his acrimonious divorce from his immensely popular first wife, Diana.\n\nAll the official royal residences including Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle will now be under his control. There are also other residences such as Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk which the Queen owned privately – and the nation will have to see to whom she leaves them in her will.\n\nEither way, Charles’ wealth has ballooned. By far the biggest slice of the family’s fortune, the £16.5 billion ($19 billion) Crown Estate, now belongs to him as reigning monarch. But under an arrangement dating back to 1760, the monarch hands over all profits from the estate to the government in return for a slice, called the Sovereign Grant.\n\nThe estate includes vast swathes of central London property and the seabed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It has the status of a corporation and is managed by a chief executive and commissioners — or non-executive directors — appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\nThe grant, which covers the cost of his official duties and amounted to £86.3 million ($99.2 million) for the 2021/2022 financial year. He will take charge of the Royal Collection, which includes one of the most valuable art collections in the world. He also picks up the Duchy of Lancaster, a private estate dating back to 1265, which was valued at about £653 million ($764 million) according to its most recent accounts. Income from its investments cover official costs not met by the Sovereign Grant, and helps support other Royal family members.\n\nKing Charles III has become one of the richest men in England overnight.\n\nCamilla\n\nCharles and Camilla attend the Order of the Garter Service at St George's Chapel on June 13, 2022 in Windsor, England. Toby Melville/Getty Images\n\nFor years, the big question around Charles’ wife surrounded her title. At the time their wedding was announced in February 2005, the official statement said: “It is intended that Mrs Parker Bowles should use the title HRH The Princess Consort when The Prince of Wales accedes to The Throne.” That was a very clear signal that Camilla would not use the title of Queen. Her office at Clarence House distanced itself from that statement in the intervening years, however, saying it was a matter for the reigning monarch.\n\nThen, in February 2022, the Queen expressed her desire for her daughter-in-law to be known as Queen Consort when Charles became King in a message marking the start of her platinum jubilee year – a statement that appeared to resolve the issue for good.\n\nThe Queen’s wishes were welcomed by the couple themselves. That same weekend, a statement released by a spokesperson said they had been “touched and honoured by Her Majesty’s words.”\n\nWhere will the couple live? Well, traditionally the new monarch would move into Buckingham Palace but in 2011, the BBC reported that Charles was considering moving his entire court to Windsor and turning Buckingham Palace into an events center. That would be a dramatic and controversial shift but might also assert King Charles III as the new boss.\n\nWilliam and Catherine\n\nWilliam and Catherine are pictured with their children, George, Charlotte and Louis, and the Queen, Charles and Camilla at Buckingham Palace during platinum jubilee celebrations on June 5, 2022. Toby Hancock/CNN\n\nUp until now, Charles has been responsible for covering the costs of his heir, Prince William.\n\nWilliam has now inherited his father’s titles of The Duke of Cornwall, which comes with an estate which last year delivered an income of £23 million ($26 million). That money now goes straight to William and he becomes independently wealthy.\n\nHis new title is HRH The Duke of Cornwall and Cambridge and tradition dictates that, as first in line to the throne, he also becomes Prince of Wales. And Catherine becomes Her Royal Highness, The Princess of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge.\n\nWilliam and Catherine will be able to solidify their own independent court, which is currently based at Kensington Palace in west London, in an apartment that was refurbished shortly after their marriage. It seems unlikely that William would want to move, so the King’s former residences, including Clarence House and Birkhall in the Scottish Highlands, will likely remain vacant until Charles offers them to other members of the family, or finds an alternative use. The family resides at Adelaide Cottage in Windsor during school term time.\n\nPrince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis will follow their parents’ titling. They are now Their Royal Highnesses Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis of Cornwall and Cambridge. Colloquially they are likely to be known as George, Charlotte and Louis Wales.\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry react as they attend the annual One Young World Summit in Manchester, north-west England on September 5, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt’s unlikely that Charles’ second son, Harry, will be offered a royal office unless he and wife Meghan return to their royal duties, and the King would also need to confirm that they can continue to use Frogmore Cottage on the Windsor estate, which is part of the royal estate. They currently live with son Archie and daughter Lilibet in California but were allowed to continue using Frogmore as their official residence during the Queen’s reign.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan announced in early 2020 that they were stepping back from royal duties, they said they would “work to become financially independent.” The terms of the split stipulated that while the pair would always remain part of the family, they would no longer use their HRH titles.\n\nAs grandchildren of the monarch, Archie now automatically becomes Prince Archie of Sussex while Lilibet will be Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Whether they use those titles will only become known the first time their parents refer to them publicly.\n\nPrince Andrew and other family members\n\nKing Charles III also becomes responsible for distributing roles, responsibilities and resources to other members of the royal family.\n\nCharles has never been close to his brother Andrew, who stepped back from royal duties over his links to the late disgraced financier, Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022 he was stripped of his HRH title, as well as others associated with the military and charity roles. That raises the question of whether the new King continues to allow Andrew to use his Buckingham Palace apartment and offers financial support.\n\nThen there are his other siblings, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, and more distant relatives such as the Gloucesters and Kents who retain royal residences at Kensington.\n\nPrincess Anne attends a service at St Giles' Cathedral on June 30, 2022 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images\n\nCharles will need to decide how much family support he needs to carry out his duties and who he wants to offer it. Then he can reveal what support he offers in return. Many of these decisions would already have been taken and the first telling signs of where his loyalties lie will be seen in who gets to keep which residences and especially who gets an upgrade.\n\nAnne and Edward, and his wife Sophie, The Countess of Wessex, are expected to continue with their public duties following decades of dedicated service but the new King needs to balance that against pressure for a slimmed down monarchy in austere times.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Max Foster"], "publish_date": "2022/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/08/uk/what-happens-after-queen-dies-intl/index.html", "title": "What happens after the Queen dies: The funeral and other ...", "text": "London CNN —\n\nWith the death of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, every detail of the next fortnight has been planned and rehearsed to the finest detail – and was even signed off by the monarch herself.\n\nThere have been regular meetings for decades between the many agencies involved, from central and local government departments to military and religious authorities and representatives of the other 14 countries where she was also head of state.\n\nThe Union Flag will be lowered on public buildings across the United Kingdom.

Whitby/Getty Images In pictures: Britain's King Charles III Prev Next\n\nGun salutes and title changes\n\nOne of the first formalities to take place will be a meeting of the Accession Council in an ancient ceremony at the 500-year-old St James’s Palace in London. It comes in two parts. In the first part, the sovereign’s death is formally announced, and the new sovereign is proclaimed. This is a closed meeting but attended by hundreds of dignitaries and members of the Privy Council, which is a panel of royal advisors.\n\nThe Garter King of Arms will read the Proclamation from the palace balcony and gun salutes will echo across the capital. There will be follow-up proclamations at the Royal Exchange in the financial district and in the capitals of the nations – Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. Flags will return to full staff whilst the proclamations are made.\n\nThe second part of the Accession Council is attended by the King and other senior royals. For the first time in history, we will get to see this centuries-old ritual because it will be broadcast live.\n\nPrince William is now first in line to the throne and has inherited the title of Duke of Cornwall from his father and the income that comes from it. He’s now independently wealthy and his wife, Kate, has taken the title of Duchess of Cornwall, replacing Camilla who technically becomes Queen. The world will then watch as King Charles III takes a series of oaths and swears allegiance to the Church of Scotland.\n\nBooks of condolence will then open at St James’s Palace and at other venues. Following the Accession Council, he will return to Buckingham Palace for meetings with senior politicians and church leaders before retiring.\n\nIn the 24 hours after the Queen’s death is announced, there will be gun salutes across London – one round for every year of Elizabeth’s life – and a broadcast by the new King will be played out. A service will be held at St Paul’s Cathedral in the coming days, which won’t be attended by the royal family. It’s a moment for the public to remember their Queen. Expect local services to pop up across the country. The Queen was Supreme Governor of the Church of England.\n\nOver the coming days, the bells of Westminster Abbey, St Pauls and Windsor Castle will toll.\n\nFuneral arrangements\n\nAs monarch, Queen Elizabeth is automatically granted a publicly funded state funeral, and details will be released in the coming days. The Queen died at Balmoral Castle, her residence in Scotland, so over the coming days arrangements will be made for her to be transported back to England.\n\nElizabeth may have approved her own funeral plans, but they can only be signed off by the sitting monarch. King Charles III will perform that duty in a meeting with the Earl Marshal who overseas ceremonial events. We can assume he will give his go-ahead as he has already seen the plans and may have made adjustments as part of the planning process.\n\nThe last order of business on the day of death was expected to be a meeting of the Lord Chamberlain’s Committee, which is responsible for the running of the Royal Household, to make sure everything is in place for the next two weeks, including the state funeral in Westminster and interment in Windsor.\n\nPast monarchs have lain in state in Westminster Hall, the oldest part of the Palace of Westminster, which houses the UK parliament. Their coffin resting on a raised platform in the middle of the hall and guarded around the clock by units from the Sovereign’s Bodyguard, Foot Guards or the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment.\n\nBritish royal family members who hold high military rank, the consort of the sovereign, and the heir to the throne are normally granted ceremonial royal funerals instead.\n\nPrince Philip, the Queen’s husband of more than 70 years and the longest-serving British consort in history, was given a royal ceremonial funeral at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, west of London, in April 2021. Coronavirus pandemic restrictions meant the congregation was limited to 30 close family members and friends.\n\nPhilip was also intimately involved in planning his own funeral service, making sure the ceremony reflected his military affiliations and personal interests. Millions of people watched the televised funeral procession and service from home but crowds were discouraged from gathering at Windsor or other royal residences.\n\nAll other members of the royal family, their children and their spouses are usually granted a private royal ceremony.", "authors": ["Max Foster Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "Max Foster", "Lauren Said-Moorhouse"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2022/09/19/queen-elizabeth-funeral-live-updates/10419491002/", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II funeral updates: Queen laid to rest alongside ...", "text": "The U.K. and much of the world spent Monday mourning Queen Elizabeth II, who was celebrated at a funeral at Westminster Abbey and brought to her final place of rest, St. George's Chapel.\n\nWith the funeral concluded, and a private burial service held at 7:30 p.m. local time, a period of Royal Mourning is set to last for the next seven days, according to the wishes of the new king.\n\nWhile the mourning period continues for the royal family, the transition of power has already occurred. The queen's eldest son, Charles Philip Arthur George Windsor, 73, is now King Charles III of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But the date for the formal coronation ceremony for the new king has not yet been announced.\n\nShortly after the queen was laid to rest, the royal family's official Twitter account shared a new photo of Queen Elizabeth II climbing a hill with a walking stick in one hand and a coat draped over the other. She looks off in the distance, wearing sunglasses and a head scarf, as lush greenery fills the landscape behind her.\n\nAlong with the photo, the account shared a quote from William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\": \"May flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest.\"\n\nQueen laid to rest alongside husband, Prince Philip\n\nThe queen was laid to rest in an intimate ceremony away from cameras in Windsor, where she was reunited with her husband and her parents.\n\nCharles and senior royal family members gathered late Monday for the private interment ceremony at St. George’s Chapel, a gothic church on the grounds of Windsor Castle that has hosted royal weddings, christenings and burials since the 15th century.\n\nIn contrast to the pomp and pageantry of her grand state funeral, royal officials said the queen's internment was a “deeply personal family occasion.” They said the queen was interred together with Prince Philip’s remains at the King George VI memorial chapel, an annex within St. George’s.\n\nWhen Philip, the queen's husband of 73 years, died last year, his coffin had been placed in a different part of St. George’s Chapel, ready to be moved to the memorial chapel to join the queen when she died.\n\nElizabeth II’s parents, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, were also interred there along with the ashes of Princess Margaret, the late monarch’s younger sister who died in 2002.\n\nSt. George's is the resting place of 10 former British monarchs, including Henry VIII and the beheaded Charles I. It is also the home of the Order of the Garter, an ancient order of chivalry founded by King Edward III in 1348.\n\nWestminster Abbey: See Queen Elizabeth at the iconic church where she was married, crowned, laid to rest\n\nSpeaking ill of the dead?:We can't ignore Queen Elizabeth's complicated legacy\n\nWhen will King Charles' coronation take place?\n\nCharles will be crowned probably within the year; the ancient ritual of the coronation requires advance planning, although a lot of that has already been done. But there hasn't been a coronation since June 1953 when Elizabeth was crowned, following the death of her father King George VI. Queen Elizabeth II was 25 when she took the throne.\n\nMost people in the U.K. have never lived through such a momentous event. But there's little puzzlement in the royal palaces, in Parliament or the British government, and almost certainly none in Charles' mind.\n\nOpinion:King Charles III must do better than his mother on colonialism and reparations. Will he?\n\nWhat happens next has been carefully planned out for decades, based on combining ancient funeral and coronation traditions with practical measures to cope with such modern realities as instant communication, traffic control, social media and the vestiges of a pandemic.\n\nThe queen's funeral was expected to draw millions of viewers\n\nThe state funeral, expected to be the biggest gathering of world leaders in years, drew millions of people to the streets of London and likely billions more to their TVs and computer screens. The funeral and events surrounding it were designed to help unite the royal family and divided subjects while helping ensure the monarchy survives another century.\n\nLondon’s mayor’s office said up to two million people were expected to line the streets as members of the royal family and hundreds of foreign dignitaries and heads of state descended on Westminster Abbey. More than 10,000 police officers were on patrol in London with reinforcements supplied from all of Britain’s 43 police forces, authorities said.\n\nThe royal family:A look at the British royal family tree, spanning four generations\n\nRead more about what to expect from the reign of King Charles III: What kind of sovereign will he be? Not like his mother\n\nCelebrities pay their respects to the queen\n\nSome celebrities posted on social media to pay their respects to the late queen, while others attended Monday’s events to do the same.\n\nDavid Beckham, who waited in the queue like thousands of others to visit the queen’s coffin as it laid in state last week, posted a photo on Instagram.\n\n“Our Queen is home.. Today we said a final farewell to Her Majesty The Queen,” he wrote in the caption.\n\nSandra Oh attended the funeral at Westminster Abbey, posting several photos on Instagram, featuring the actress wearing mourning colors.\n\nAnd Elton John posted photos, too, remembering some moments he shared with the queen and noting she will be \"sorely missed.\"\n\n“My own memories of her are filled with joy and admiration,\" he wrote. The Queen honoured me with a CBE, a knighthood and the Companion of Honour. I was lucky enough to perform at three of her Jubilees. They were always joyous and humbling experiences. But it was the moments out of the public eye that I will most fondly remember her for.\"\n\nWhat is the committal service at Windsor Castle?\n\nThe queen headed to her final resting place in Windsor Castle where a committal service took place before she was lowered into the Royal Vault.\n\nThe committal service was conducted by the dean of Windsor, David Connor. Events include prayer and a choir performance at St George's chapel. Nearly 800 people were expected to attend, including royal family members, and the hymn, \"All My Hope on God is Founded,\" was performed.\n\nWhile the procession took place, the Imperial State Crown sat atop the queen’s coffin along with her scepter and orb.\n\nDuring the committal service, the crown, scepter and orb were removed from the top of the coffin. The items were placed on an altar at St. George’s Chapel, and marked the final separation of the late queen from her crown.\n\nThe “Wand of Office” was broken by the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Andrew Parker. The breaking of the wand is a tradition in a sovereign’s funeral, according to The Independent, and hasn’t been seen since King George VI died in 1952.\n\nThe new king stood by quietly during the moments of farewell and appeared somber and a bit teary-eyed before his mother’s coffin was lowered into the vault.\n\nPast tears:Did Queen Elizabeth cry at Prince Philip's funeral? How she manages to stay stoic\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss arrives at St George's chapel\n\nBritish Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary attended the queen's state funeral. They were also among early arrivals to St George's chapel for the committal service.\n\nAt the state funeral, Truss read a prayer from Bible’s John 14: 1-9.\n\nPrincess Kate, daughter Princess Charlotte honor the queen with poignant accessories\n\nMother and daughter duo Princess Kate and Princess Charlotte, who attended the state funeral, both wore simple black dresses topped with black overcoats, paired with black tights and black shoes. But their jewelry choices paid tribute to a beloved matriarch.\n\nPrincess Charlotte wore a dainty brooch on her coat in the shape of a horseshoe, a tribute to the queen, her great-grandmother, who had a lifelong passion for horses. The queen often attended races and was also a successful owner and breeder.\n\nPrincess Kate, the wife of Prince William, wore two pieces of jewelry that once belonged to her grandmother-in-law. She wore Bahrain Pearl Drop Earrings and a four-strand pearl choker necklace, both from the queen's collection, People reported.\n\nFuneral attire:Princess Kate, daughter Charlotte honor Queen Elizabeth with sweet details\n\nRoyals escort the queen's casket to Wellington Arch, Windsor Castle\n\nFollowing the funeral, the coffin – accompanied by units of the armed forces in dress uniforms and members of her family – was carried through the capital’s streets.\n\nAt Wellington Arch near Hyde Park, it was placed in a hearse and driven to Windsor Castle – where Elizabeth spent much of her time – for another procession before a committal service in St George’s Chapel. She will be laid to rest with her late husband, Prince Philip, at a private family service.\n\nWhat is the hearse the queen is in?\n\nThe queen’s coffin was moved from the gun carriage to the royal hearse at Wellington Arch as it was taken to Windsor. The hearse drove 25 miles west of London to Windsor Castle and St George's Chapel, a mini-cathedral that seats 800 and is often used for royal weddings. It's where Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan were married in 2018.\n\nAt Windsor, the state hearse traveled in procession to St George’s Chapel via the Long Walk. Once inside, a committal service began at 4 p.m. local time, 11 a.m. EDT.\n\nThe glass-walled hearse allows the queen’s coffin to be viewed – and it is lit up when it is dark out.\n\nFuneral program: What happened at queen's funeral\n\nThe funeral concluded just after noon, local time. The pall bearers escorted the queen's coffin onto the gun carriage.\n\nThe queen will be buried in a special chapel beneath the floor of St George's with her parents, sister Princess Margaret, and husband, Philip.\n\nThe program also included:\n\nPatricia Scotland Commonwealth Secretary-General read a lesson from Corinthians 15 as a tribute to the queen’s life of dedication to service and the nation.\n\nA sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury\n\nChoirs sang the Anthem, taken from \"Songs of Farewell\" by Hubert Parry, a favorite of King Charles'.\n\nA short anthem, composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams for the queen’s coronation in 1953, presenting a reflective moment in the service.\n\nThe third hymn, \"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\" is a Welsh tune, and was sung at the wedding of The Prince and Princess of Wales at Westminster Abbey in 2011. The arrangement is by James O’Donnell, a former organist at the Abbey.\n\nThe Archbishop gave the commendation over the queen’s coffin. The commendation will include the familiar line, \"Go Forth, O Christian Soul, From This World,\" which is often heard during funerals.\n\nThe choirs sang a new anthem, composed for the service by Sir James McMillan. The words are taken from Romans 8, which leads with the hopeful, confident line, \"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?\"\n\nThe dean pronounced the blessing from the altar, and the congregation will remain standing for the last post, which will be sounded by the state trumpeters of the household cavalry.\n\nThis was followed by two minutes’ silence, to be observed across the United Kingdom.\n\nThe trumpeters then sounded the reveille, before the national anthem was sung.\n\nThe sovereign’s piper played the traditional lament, ‘Sleep, dearie, sleep.’\n\nAt the conclusion of the lament, at noon local time (7 a.m. ET), the pall bearers entered and moved the queen’s coffin to the state gun carriage.\n\nCharles writes note to the queen tucked in funeral wreath atop coffin\n\nThe funeral wreath on the queen's coffin was anything but funereal – it was a massive assembling of color and symbolism topped with a note from Charles. \"In loving and devoted memory. Charles R,\" it read.\n\n\"Charles R\" is the monarch’s official signature, with R being Latin for \"Rex\" or king. (Elizabeth’s signature was Elizabeth R for \"Regina,\" Latin for queen.)\n\nThe sight of that note immediately evoked memories of the note that sat on Princess Diana’s coffin during her funeral procession to Westminster Abbey in 1997. It was from her sons and signed \"Mummy.\"\n\nAccording to Buckingham Palace’s notes on the funeral, the queen’s wreath included, at the king’s request, flowers and foliage cut from the gardens of Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and the king’s private home Highgrove House.\n\nThe foliage was chosen for its symbolism: Rosemary for remembrance. Myrtle for the ancient symbol of a happy marriage, and cut from a plant grown from a sprig of myrtle in the queen’s 1947 wedding bouquet. English oak symbolizes the strength of love.\n\nAlso included are scented pelargoniums, garden roses, autumnal hydrangea, sedum, dahlias, and scabious, in shades of gold, pink and deep burgundy, with touches of white to reflect the Royal Standard on which it sits.\n\nAnd at the request of the king, a longtime environmentalist, the wreath is made in a sustainable way, formed in a nest of English moss and oak branches and without the use of floral foam.\n\nWho attended the queen’s funeral?\n\nThe guest list for the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II amounted to hundreds of people, a mix of members of the British royal family, foreign royals (many of them relatives of the queen), domestic and foreign government leaders, including President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, British religious and military leaders, members of the royal households, and scores of ordinary people, from the National Health Service, for instance, who were invited to mark their service to the nation.\n\nThe top British royals:\n\nKing Charles III\n\nCamilla, Queen Consort\n\nPrincess Anne Princess Royal, Vice Adm. Sir Tim Laurence\n\nPrince Andrew Duke of York\n\nPrince Edward Earl of Wessex, Sophie Countess of Wessex\n\nPrince William, Prince of Wales, Catherine, Princess of Wales\n\nPrince George of Wales\n\nPrince Charlotte of Wales\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex\n\nEarl of Snowdon\n\nPeter Phillips\n\nAlso there are some two dozen other members of the queen’s family, including descendants of her mother’s Scottish family. All eight of her grandchildren are there and some of the older 12 great-grandchildren, including the new second and third in line in the succession, Prince George of Wales, 9, and Princess Charlotte of Wales, 7.\n\nMany of the foreign royals who attended also are related to the British royal family through descent from Queen Victoria, sometimes known as the \"grandmother\" of Europe in the 19th century. The monarchs of Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain are there. Also, Japan’s Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, making their first overseas trip since assuming the throne of Japan in 2019.\n\nThe Bidens top the foreign leaders list, which also includes France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Germany’s President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Ireland’s President Michael Higgins. Also there: Ursula von der Leyen, representing the European Union that Britain quit amid many recriminations in 2016. Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also are there, representing three of the major Commonwealth nations over which the queen also reigned.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral:See King Charles III, Prince Harry, all royals who attended\n\nIs Prince Harry at the funeral? Harry wore military medals, but not his uniform\n\nPrince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, were visiting the U.K. from their home in California to promote several causes they are involved with when the queen died.\n\nAt Monday's funeral, Harry wore his military medals but not his uniform. He wore the uniform during a vigil on Saturday with Queen Elizabeth's grandchildren.\n\nRoyal experts have explained that only working members of the royal family will wear the military uniform for the five events during the late monarch's period of mourning and state funeral.\n\nHarry walked in to Westminster Abbey alongside his brother, Prince William. But during the service, Harry and Meghan sat in the second row behind his father, while William, Princess Kate and their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte sat across the aisle in the first row.\n\nIs Sarah 'Fergie' Ferguson at the funeral?\n\nSarah Ferguson, affectionately known as Fergie, attended the state funeral for the queen Monday. The Duchess of York, 62, has remained close with the royals despite her divorce from Prince Andrew in 1996. The former pair share daughters Princess Beatrice, 34, and Princess Eugenie, 32, who were also in attendance.\n\nFollowing the queen's death, Ferguson wrote in a tribute on Twitter that \"she was was the most incredible mother-in-law and friend.\"\n\n\"I will always be grateful to her for the generosity she showed me in remaining close to me even after my divorce,\" the Duchess of York added. \"I will miss her more than words can express.\"\n\nState funeral at Westminster Abbey\n\nThe queen's casket entered Westminster Abbey around 11 a.m. local time Monday. The choir of St. George's Chapel sang The Sentences as the queen's coffin procession, including King Charles, Prince William, Princess Kate, Prince Harry, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, Prince George, Prince Charlotte, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, followed the coffin into the abbey.\n\nDavid Hoyle, Dean of Westminster, opened the service before attendees joined together to sing The Hymn, \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nDuring the funeral, speakers included Most Rev. Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury; Rev. Mark Birch, Minor Canon and Precentor; Patricia Scotland, Commonwealth secretary-general; Shermara Fletcher, principal officer for Pentecostal and Charismatic Relations, Churches Together in England; and Rt. Rev. Dame Sarah Mullally. As the funeral concluded, the choir sang \"God Save the King.\"\n\nFuneral music: Hymns sung at queen's funeral\n\nThe music during the funeral will be sung by the choir of the Westminster Abbey and included The Sentences, written by William Croft, whose Sentences have been used since the mid 1500s, and at every State Funeral since the early 18th century.\n\nThe choir of St George's Chapel sang The Sentences during the procession as the casket entered. The choir of Westminster Abbey began the funeral service in song, later joining with the choir of the Chapel Royal for a rendition of \"Like as the Heart.\" The funeral's attendees sang \"The Day Thou Gavest, Lord, is Ended.\"\n\nThe choir also sang \"The Lord’s My Shepherd,\" which also was heard at the Wedding of The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh in 1947. The choir sang \"God Save the King,\" featuring different lyrics from what many have known for decades as \"God Save the Queen,\" as the funeral concluded.\n\nDetails about Queen Elizabeth's coffin\n\nThe oak coffin was made more than 30 years ago, funeral directors previously confirmed to USA TODAY. Leverton & Sons, which has served as funeral directors to the royal household said it inherited the coffin made for the queen by another firm, Kenyons.\n\nAndrew Leverton, a funeral director at Leverton & Sons, previously told British outlet the Times \"It is made from English oak, which is very difficult to get hold of.\n\n“Oak coffins are now made from American oak. I don’t think we could use English oak for a coffin now. It would be too expensive,” he told the outlet.\n\nThe coffin is also lined with lead, Leverton & Sons said. The lead lining makes the coffin so heavy that eight military bearers carried it Monday.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's casket:Queen to be buried in decades-old coffin lined with lead that takes 8 people to carry\n\nImperial State Crown: Details about crown atop casket\n\nThe majestic Imperial State Crown sits atop the queen’s flag-draped coffin as the queen was moved to Westminster Abbey, along with her scepter and orb.\n\nThe crown, the same one the young Queen Elizabeth II wore for her coronation in 1953, is adorned with stones including the 317-carat Cullinan II diamond, one of several stones cut from the more than 3,000-carat Cullinan Diamond, mined in South Africa in 1905, when the nation was a British colony. The main stone – the 530.2-carat Cullinan I diamond, also called the Star of Africa – rests at the top of the monarch’s scepter.\n\nAs the royal jewels are in the news, so are repeated calls to return the diamonds to their country of origin. The queen's death at 96 on Sept. 8 has also renewed the conversation of the royal family's ties to colonialism and the queen's lack of apology or atonement.\n\nCalls for reparation from former colonial powers are not new, but they have resurged in recent years. Barbados in November 2021 removed the queen as its head of state, becoming the region’s newest republic. Six other Caribbean countries have signaled their intent to follow suit.\n\nThe monarchy:Imperial State Crown and royal scepter glimmer, but some say on back of colonialism\n\nWhat is the gun carriage used to carry the queen?\n\nWhen the coffin emerged from Westminster Hall, the pallbearers placed it on the green gun carriage that was used for the funerals of the queen’s father, grandfather and great-grandfather, all kings.\n\nKing Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward flanked the procession, followed by several other members of the royal family including Prince William and Prince Harry.\n\nKing Charles, more royals arrive at funeral\n\nKing Charles was met with applause by crowds as his motorcade arrived at Westminster Hall for the queen's coffin procession to Westminster Abbey. Prince William and Prince Harry joined him.\n\nOne car contained Queen Consort Camilla and Catherine, Princess of Wales, with her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Another featured Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex.\n\nMore members of the royal family, including Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, arrived shortly after.\n\nThe funeral’s order of service showed that George and Charlotte will walk together behind their parents. They will be followed by Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and other royal family members.\n\nThe royal children’s 4-year-old brother, Prince Louis, is not expected to be present at the funeral, which will be attended by some 2,000 people.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, Prime Minister Liz Truss, more world leaders arrive\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, accompanied by first lady Jill Biden, is among the top world leaders who arrived at Westminster Abbey ahead of the funeral.\n\nBiden arrived at Westminster Abbey for the queen’s funeral in his armored limousine, The Beast. He was among the few international diplomats who, for security reasons, did not ride on a fleet of chartered luxury buses provided for other world leaders. Biden stepped out of the The Beast a few minutes after 10 a.m. local time. He did not say anything or address the press.\n\nMany other leaders arrived Monday morning via bus; the Bidens arrived separately. British Prime Minister Liz Truss and husband Hugh O'Leary, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and wife Sophie Trudeau, French President Emmanuel Macron and wife Brigitte Macron, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and wife Michelle Bolsonaro and Israeli President Isaac Herzog and wife Michal Herzog were also spotted arriving.\n\nThe president signed the official condolence book and attended a reception Sunday at Buckingham Palace hosted by King Charles III.\n\nBiden is among many world leaders who traveled to the United Kingdom to honor Queen Elizabeth’s long reign. During his visit, Biden told media the queen \"was the same in person as her image: decent, honorable and all about service.\"\n\n\"Our hearts go out to the royal family, King Charles and all of the family. It’s a loss that leaves a giant hole and sometimes you think you’ll never overcome it,\" the president said, adding that he told Charles the queen will be with him \"every step of the way, every moment.\"\n\nThe day before the funeral:Biden arrives in London for funeral; Queen's grandchildren stand vigil by coffin\n\nTom Parker Bowles, more royals' family members arrive\n\nLess than an hour and a half before the funeral is set to begin, notable arrivals connected to the royal family began to trickle in. Queen Consort Camilla's family was also photographed arriving at Westminster Abbey, including Laura Lopes, Camilla's 44-year-old daughter, and Tom Parker Bowles, her 47-year-old son. Princess Kate's parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, were also photographed upon arrival.\n\nCamilla's new title, explained:What's the difference between queen and 'Queen Consort'?\n\nWhere will Queen Elizabeth II be buried?\n\nThe queen will be buried at St George Chapel at Windsor Castle, where many of her ancestors are buried, including her parents, King George VI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother.\n\nFollowing the funeral at Westminster Abbey, the coffin procession will begin, joined by King Charles, other members of the royal family, past and present members of the queen's household, governors general and prime ministers of the realms.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's funeral details:When is it? Will it be on TV? Your questions, answered\n\nKing Charles thanks the public for 'messages of condolence' ahead of queen's funeral\n\nAhead of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, King Charles III issued a statement Sunday evening thanking people in Britain and across the world for \"the many messages of condolence.\"\n\n\"Over the last ten days, my wife and I have been so deeply touched,\" the king said. \"In London, Edinburgh, Hillsborough and Cardiff we were moved beyond measure by everyone who took the trouble to come and pay their respects to the lifelong service of my dear mother.\"\n\n\"As we all prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those countless people who have been such a support and comfort to my family and myself in this time of grief,\" Charles concluded his statement.\n\nAhead of the queen's funeral Monday, a new photograph was released Sunday.\n\nAccording to the royal family on Facebook, the photo was taken to mark the queen's Platinum Jubilee earlier this year. She was the first British monarch to reach this milestone.\n\n\"Tomorrow, millions will come together to commemorate her remarkable life,\" the post read.\n\nPrince Charles is now King Charles III. Here's what to know about UK's new monarch.\n\nHow old is Westminster Abbey, site of Queen Elizabeth funeral?\n\nWestminster Abbey, where Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral will be held Monday, has a centuries-long association with the royal family, hosting generations of coronations, royal weddings and funerals.\n\nThe church, which was consecrated in 1065 and “has been the setting for every coronation since 1066” and 16 royal weddings, a statement on the abbey’s website says.\n\n“Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's connection with Westminster Abbey ran like a thread through her early life and her long reign,” the site says. “As an 11-year-old girl, she watched as her father was crowned here. As a young adult, she married here and was crowned here.”\n\nFourteen English monarchs were buried there between 1066 and 1760, including Queen Elizabeth I, the daughter of King Henry VIII, who was interred in the abbey in 1603. The Unknown Warrior, whose body was brought from France in 1920, is buried in the abbey’s nave. Author Charles Dickens is among those buried in Poets' Corner of the abbey.\n\nThe funeral of Princess Diana was held at the abbey in 1997 and the Queen Mother’s funeral took place there in 2002. More recently, Prince William and Duchess Kate, now the Prince and Princess of Wales, were married there in 2011.\n\nVisual guide to the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey\n\nQueen's funeral more than ceremony, designed to show monarchy's stability\n\nThe queen, who died Sept. 8 in Scotland at age 96 after 70 years on the throne, was widely considered the glue holding the U.K. together. She was also the most canny of her Windsor ancestors about using ceremony and splendor to bond the monarchy and the people who pay for it.\n\nNot since 1965, for former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, has Britain mounted a state funeral, which is usually reserved for monarchs, with exceptions for distinguished figures such as Churchill, the queen's first prime minister of her reign.\n\nRoyal funerals are planned decades in advance by governments and the crown, and the plans are updated regularly. The monarch plays a crucial role in deciding details. The choice of flowers in the wreath on her coffin, the music and prayer selections, even the bespoke design of the Royal Hearse (lots of glass and inside light so the casket can be seen even at night), were all decisions made by the queen.\n\nSurvival of the monarchy:Why Queen Elizabeth II's funeral is more than just ceremony\n\nMourners line the streets during queen's funeral\n\nAt 6 a.m. local time, snipers were on rooftops, sniffer dogs were on the streets, drains were being searched and surveillance drones have been banned from all of central London. Around 20 miles of barriers have been erected to control crowds as the queen’s coffin travels the short distance from Westminster Hall, where it is lying-in-state, to Westminster Abbey, and then onward to Windsor Castle after the funeral for burial.\n\nA full five hours before the funeral gets underway, London’s transportation network was already busy on a public holiday, with the subway system seeing members of the public rushing to secure viewing spots in and around Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Westminster. Many carried small fold-up chairs, and Londoners almost entirely wore black in the quiet of the city. Volunteers in purple vests every few yards provided help with directions and other needs.\n\nHyde Park, one of London's central parks, is a designated screening spot for Queen Elizabeth II's state funeral on Monday. The 11 a.m.-ceremony will be broadcast live on large screens for attendees to see for free at the park, and the Hyde Park site will show the procession through London following the funeral, the procession through Windsor and the Committal Service at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nSigns and staff are present across the city to direct people to either the park or other \"viewing areas\" where they may catch a real glimpse of the state funeral route. The park and viewing areas include dedicated spots for anyone who has an accessibility need, including British Sign Language interpreters and a dedicated location for wheelchair users.\n\nPeople watched the funeral and procession from almost everywhere – lining the streets 10-deep to sitting on blankets in parks.\n\nLucy Hartnell, 26, from Hertfordshire, organized a picnic at Hyde Park of what she and friends assumed were “queen favorites” including strawberries, cucumber finger sandwiches, Prosecco, cupcakes and chips. They took the tube into London and were \"shocked\" how easy it was for them to get to Hyde Park to view the funeral.\n\nThey said they attended to not miss a big event and aren’t really pro-royal or anti-royal, which has been a large debate among young people.\n\n\"We’re not super against the royals or for them, we just wanted to be part of them moment,\" Hartnell said.\n\nThey said the transition to a king likely won’t affect them, but they said the area where they grew up is very pro-monarchy. \"Our grandparents care a lot. We don’t care that much either way. People our age are like 'we should get rid of the monarchy.' But no one cares enough to actually do anything about it … we just like having them,\" she said.\n\nContributing: Nicole Fallert, Kim Hjelmgaard, Jane Onyanga-Omara, Maria Puente, Laura Trujillo, Amy Haneline and Morgan Hines, USA TODAY; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/16/uk/royal-news-newsletter-09-16-22-scli-gbr-cmd-intl/index.html", "title": "Inside Westminster Hall, where the Queen is lying in state | CNN", "text": "A version of this story appeared in a special September 16 edition of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.\n\nLondon CNN —\n\nThe tapping of a sword echoes through Westminster Hall. Here, in the oldest part of the Houses of Parliament, it reverberates instantly around the space, stopping people in their tracks and capturing their attention.\n\nMoments later, footfalls on ancient steps resound as soldiers from units serving the Royal Household march into the room to relieve the guard around the Queen’s coffin.\n\nMembers of the public watch as the new guard makes its way in perfect synchronicity to the central platform, mesmerized by the jingling of medals as the soldiers move.\n\nWith another tap, the old guard troops out and its replacement takes up position, standing perfectly still beneath the 11th-century hall’s medieval roof.\n\nThe crowd reanimates once more and the lines streaming past the catafalque resume. Here, beneath these ancient timber beams, ancient traditions are playing out in present day.\n\nThe Queen has been lying in state since Wednesday, when her coffin was conveyed to Westminster Hall in a somber procession that saw King Charles III, Princes William and Harry and other senior royals follow behind on foot. It will remain here until the morning of the Queen’s state funeral on Monday.\n\nThe Queen’s mother and father both lay in state here before her: King George VI in 1952, and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother in 2002. So did her grandfather George V in 1936 and her great-grandfather Edward VII in 1910 – the first royal to lie in state.\n\nTo maintain a continuous vigil, each watch lasts for 20 minutes. Lauren Said-Moorhouse/CNN\n\nState funerals are only reserved for monarchs, however, there has been one exception: Elizabeth II’s first prime minister, Winston Churchill. He also lay in state in the hall after his death in 1965.\n\nAs candlelight glistens on the symbols of state atop the coffin – the Imperial State Crown and the Sovereign’s Orb and Sceptre – mourners pay their respects to the late monarch. Some young, some old, families with children in school uniforms, those of faith and those of none – all are here to say farewell and thank the Queen for her lifelong service.\n\nThe walk from one end of the hall doesn’t take long – a few minutes at most. After waiting for hours in The Queue, sometimes overnight, the fleeting moment they’ve all been waiting for finally arrives.\n\nMen pause briefly to bow to the coffin while several women perform a deep, respectful curtsey. Some simply smile or nod their head. Others take a moment to blow a kiss toward the catafalque. Then there are the older military veterans, with medals proudly displayed, who stand to attention and perform one last salute to their former commander-in-chief.\n\nMembers of the public view the Queen's coffin, which is draped with the Royal Standard, on which lie the Instruments of State -- the Imperial State Crown and the Orb and Sceptre. Lauren Said-Moorhouse/CNN\n\nMany in the queue have waited for hours and hours to get to this point. But as each person finds their own way to acknowledge the Queen, some stopping the flow of movement for the briefest of seconds, no one complains. Those in line wait patiently for the person ahead of them to do what they need to do before they move forward, and on toward the exit.\n\nAs the mourners reach the far side of the hall, almost every single person – including us – stops and turns back for one final look and to say a silent goodbye to the only monarch most have ever known.\n\n(CNN’s James Frater contributed to this story.)\n\nDID YOU KNOW?\n\nThe King walks with his family behind the Queen's coffin on Wednesday.

The state funeral in central London gets underway from 11 a.m. and then a committal service at St. George’s Chapel will take place from 4 p.m.\n\nHere’s all you need to know about how the day will unfold.\n\nFEATURED PHOTOS\n\nOnly a minority will remember firsthand what life was like the last time the UK buried a monarch. Images taken in 1952 following the death of the Queen’s father, King George VI, reveal just how much the country – and the world – has changed.\n\nJust like today, crowds poured into central London in February of that year, hoping to catch a glimpse of George VI’s funeral procession. But while the time-honored ceremonies remain much the same, the people watching them look quite different.\n\nCheck out our photo gallery of what Britain looked like when the last monarch died:\n\nKing George VI's coffin is carried through the streets of London before being transported to Windsor Castle for his funeral on February 15, 1952.

Multiple official agencies were brought together. Meticulous plans were secretly drawn up. Intricate logistical technicalities were ironed out. A route was carefully mapped out. And no country’s population could have been better prepared for it.\n\nWe are talking, of course, about the line that Britons must join in order to pay their respects to the Queen. This is not an ordinary line. It has taken on symbolic meaning, a ritual to be undertaken, an embodiment of the national mood. It is, in short, not a queue but The Queue.\n\nIt snakes from Westminster Hall, where the late monarch’s body is lying in state, for miles along the south bank of the Thames river. It stretches past landmarks such as the London Eye, the Globe theater and London Bridge. On Friday morning, the line was closed, having reached capacity for “at least six hours,” according to the UK government’s live tracker.

At the stables of Balmoral, where she tended to her ponies in Wellington boots and a Barbour jacket, a patterned scarf was always tied under her chin. But most often, it was a hat.\n\n“You almost can’t see it in isolation.

She would continue to wear them through adolescence and young adulthood, often coordinating with younger sister Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother. From the outset, her tastes were bold and provocative.

At 16, she was made an honorary colonel of the Grenadier Guards, a British army infantry regiment.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth is pictured in 1945 standing by an Auxiliary Territorial Service first aid truck wearing an officer's uniform. Keystone/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images\n\nWartime offered her certain freedoms beyond the traditional constraints of royal life.\n\nIn 1945 she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service and spent four weeks getting her hands covered in oil and grease as she learned to drive and maintain military vehicles.\n\nWhen victory was declared in Europe, a uniformed Elizabeth mingled with jubilant crowds outside Buckingham Palace.\n\nPeacetime brought the return of Lieutenant Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, a handsome young naval officer who had, by all accounts, won her heart when she was just 13. The pair married in Westminster Abbey in 1947. Their first son, Charles, was born just over a year later.\n\nA youthful monarch\n\nWith her father’s health in rapid decline, Elizabeth began accepting more official duties, taking his place at the annual “Trooping the Colour” military parade in 1949.\n\nIn 1952, while Elizabeth and Philip were on an official trip to Kenya, news came of her father’s death.\n\nShe was now Queen.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh wave at the crowds from the balcony at Buckingham Palace after her coronation, on June 2, 1953. Keystone/Hulton Royals Collection/Getty Images\n\nThe next decade saw the young monarch settle into her role. After her coronation in 1953, she embarked on numerous official overseas trips, oversaw state openings of parliament, welcomed visiting leaders such as Dwight Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, and toured a coal mine.\n\nThese international forays came even as the disintegration of Britain’s empire hastened. India had gained independence from its colonial power in 1947, before Elizabeth became Queen. Dozens more were to follow suit over the following decades, across Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. By the time of her death, Elizabeth was head of state in 14 countries besides the UK.\n\nThe Queen meanwhile embraced her role as Head of the Commonwealth, visiting almost all of its member states – starting with a lengthy Commonwealth tour in 1953 and 1954.\n\nIn 1964, the Queen became a mother for the fourth time as new son Edward joined Charles and fellow siblings Anne and Andrew. There was, however, barely any let-up in her busy schedule.\n\nBy the arrival of her third decade on the throne, she was in her element. Prince Charles was embarking on a military career, Princess Anne, an acclaimed horsewoman, was married – drawing huge crowds of well-wishers.\n\nWhile indulging in her own equestrian pursuits, she continued to throw herself into public life, clocking up dozens of overseas tours and official visits around the UK – one of which, in 1976, saw her become one of the first people to send an email.\n\nThere were family problems when her sister’s marriage collapsed, and constitutional issues as debate grew among Commonwealth countries about the role of the monarch, but these failed to dampen celebrations to mark the silver jubilee of her reign in 1977.\n\nAnother royal wedding followed in 1981 when Prince Charles married Lady Diana Spencer at London’s St Paul’s Cathedral. Millions of people around the world watched the ceremony on television, happily unaware it would usher in the most turbulent period yet of the Queen’s life.\n\nDivorce, fire and Diana’s death\n\nThe Queen’s 40th year on the throne, 1992, marked her lowest moment as three royal marriages fell apart. Princess Anne and Mark Philips divorced, Charles and Diana separated after claims of infidelities while Sarah Ferguson, Prince Andrew’s wife, was photographed topless with an American financial manager.\n\nTo cap it all, a huge fire ripped through Windsor Castle, causing major structural damage. In the wake of the blaze, a furor broke out when it was suggested that public money be used to fund the restoration.\n\nThis year was not one “on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure,” the Queen said in a speech later. “In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an annus horribilis.”\n\nThese problems overshadowed the Queen as she made an historic visit to meet South African President Nelson Mandela in 1995, but criticism reached new heights in the wake of Diana’s tragic death in 1997, when the royals were accused of being aloof and out of touch amid widespread public outpourings of grief.\n\nThis marked a turning point.\n\nAfter days of silence, the Queen returned to London, talked to mourners and admitted there were lessons to be learned from Diana’s life. The gestures struck a chord with the public and criticism ebbed away.\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip view the floral tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales, at London's Buckingham Palace, on September 5, 1997. Pool/AP\n\nAfter Diana, the Queen’s popularity rebounded as she presided over what appeared to be a softer, more accessible and thoroughly modern royal family.\n\nThis was evident in 2005 when, to public approval, she assented to the previously unthinkable marriage of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles. It was capped eight years later when Britain’s parliament ended the principle of men taking precedence over women in the line of succession to the throne.\n\nShe witnessed two of her grandsons, Princes William and Harry, graduate as military officers in 2006 and five years later oversaw the marriage of William and Catherine, the woman who – as the wife of the now heir to the throne – will one day succeed her as Britain’s Queen. She also attended the wedding of Harry to Meghan Markle at St George’s Chapel, Windsor in May 2018.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry watch a flypast on the balcony of Buckingham Palace as part of events to mark the centenary of the RAF on July 10, 2018 in London. Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nIn 2012, the Queen’s diamond jubilee was celebrated around the Commonwealth, culminating in a glittering river pageant on the Thames in London, and a concert showcasing some of the best music from her six decades on the throne.\n\nThree years later, she surpassed Queen Victoria’s 63-year-rule to become the longest-reigning British monarch and, in 2016, she marked her 90th birthday with a series of festivities and goodwill messages from around the world.\n\nIn February 2022, she marked the start of her platinum jubilee year, as she became the first British monarch to reign for 70 years.\n\nFamily upheaval\n\nThe Queen’s final years were punctuated by challenges as well as celebrations, however.\n\nAs the novel coronavirus swept through Britain in 2020, she gave two televised addresses in quick succession, one calling for unity in the face of the pandemic and the other, still amid a national lockdown, to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day.\n\nBut while rallying the nation’s spirits, the Queen was facing upheaval within her own family. Less than two years after their spectacular Windsor Castle wedding, Harry and Meghan announced that they were stepping back from their roles as senior royals and leaving Britain.\n\nThey subsequently set up home with son Archie in California and, in a March 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, accused “the firm” of leaving Meghan unprotected against racist abuse and unfair media coverage, as well as having neglected her mental health concerns. The couple – whose daughter Lilibet, named in honor of the Queen, was born in June 2021 – also made a damaging allegation of racism by an unnamed member of the royal family, although Winfrey later said they had clarified that this was neither the Queen nor Prince Philip.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Andrew, often referred to as the Queen’s “favorite son,” had been forced to step back from public duties after a disastrous 2019 interview with the BBC over his association with prominent sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. In January 2022, the Queen sought to distance the royal institution from a civil sex abuse lawsuit brought against Andrew in the United States by stripping him of his HRH status and royal patronages permanently. He subsequently settled the case out of court for an undisclosed figure and continues to reject the allegations against him.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II takes her seat during the funeral of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on April 17, 2021 in Windsor, England.

Pandemic restrictions meant she cut a lonely figure at his funeral, scaled back in terms of guests but still marked with military pomp.\n\nElizabeth returned to her royal duties within days, now a widow but still dedicated to a lifetime of service. She even continued with light duties after testing positive for Covid-19 in February 2022.\n\nBut as the year wore on, the monarch was forced to significantly slim down her diary due to mobility issues. On Tuesday, she met with outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his successor, Liz Truss, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, rather than traveling to Buckingham Palace to do so.\n\nThe nation had come together to mark her platinum jubilee in June 2022 – a crowning achievement in a long and storied life.\n\nBy the time of her death in September, she had reigned for a little over 70 years – a constant, if regally distant, presence in the lives of several generations of Britons.\n\nTo get updates on the British Royal Family sent to your inbox, sign up for CNN’s Royal News newsletter.", "authors": ["Barry Neild"], "publish_date": "2022/09/08"}]}

At one point, they left him hanging vertically on a gurney before state officials made the decision to call off the execution. Attorneys for 57-year-old Alan Eugene Miller wrote about his experience during Alabama’s Sept. 22 execution attempt in a court filing made last week. Miller’s attorneys are trying to block the state from attempting a second lethal injection. Two men in scrubs used needles to repeatedly probe Miller’s arms, legs, feet and hands, at one point using a cellphone flashlight to help their search for a vein, according to the Oct. 6 court filing. The attorneys called Miller the “only living execution survivor in the United States” and said Alabama subjected Miller “to precisely the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain that the Eighth Amendment was intended to prohibit.” Alabama has asked the state Supreme Court to set a new execution date for Miller, saying the execution was canceled only because of a time issue as the state faced a midnight deadline to get the lethal injection underway. “What then, in Defendants’ view, is a constitutional amount of time to spend stabbing someone with needles in an attempt to kill them?” his attorneys wrote.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: State officials have canceled the fall Bristol Bay red king crab harvest and, for the first time, have also scrapped the winter harvest of smaller snow crab. The move is a double whammy to a fleet from Alaska, Washington and Oregon chasing Bering Sea crab in harvests that in 2016 grossed $280 million, The Seattle Times reports. The closures reflect conservation concerns about both crab species following bleak summer populations surveys. The decisions to shut down the snow crab and fall king crab harvests came after days of discussions by Alaska Department of Fish and Game biologists and senior agency officials who faced crabbers’ pleas for at least small fisheries. “I am struggling for words. This is so unbelievable that this is happening,” said Jamie Goen, executive director of the Alaska Bering Sea Crabbers, adding that some crabbers will go out of business. “Management of Bering Sea snow crab must now focus on conservation and rebuilding given the conditions of the stock,” the department said in a statement. Snow crab populations declined after a 2019 Bering Sea warming that scrambled the broader marine ecosystem. Last year’s snow crab harvest was the smallest in over 40 years. The causes of the population collapse are still being researched but likely include increased predation and stresses from warmer water.\n\nArizona\n\nWilliams: ’Tis the season for permits for cutting down potential Christmas trees in Arizona. The Kaibab National Forest will make Christmas tree permits available online starting Thursday. The permits for ranger districts in north-central Arizona will only be obtainable via Recreation.gov. No permits will be given in person. The actual chopping down of trees will not be allowed until Nov. 1. Each permit holder can cut a maximum of five trees at $15 per tree. The permits apply to specific tree species no more than 10 feet tall. The permits expire Dec. 31. More specific instructions on which types of trees and a map of where people can cut down trees are available on the website.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: A free Riverfront Amphitheater weekly series of concerts featuring regional and local musicians will return for three more years thanks to the work of a nonprofit group promoting music and dancing. Fort Smith’s 64.6 Downtown has landed a grant to carry on the shows through 2025, said executive director Talicia Richardson. The Mortimer & Mimi Levitt Foundation that supports nonprofits nationwide with music in public spaces announced this week that 64.6 Downtown has been awarded a multiyear Levitt AMP Grant Award of $90,000 in matching funds to present a free outdoor music series at the Riverfront Amphitheater in 2023, 2024 and 2025. “I’m very excited to make this even bigger and better with even more community engagement,” Richardson said. The Levitt AMP summer 2022 series ran from May 12 to July 14 and brought live music weekly to the downtown entertainment district. The indie rock band Dawson Hollow drew a crowd of about 300 people June 9 to the Riverfront Amphitheater, Richardson said. In 2021 the shows included ran between May 13 and July 15. The series features live music every Thursday for ten weeks.“We actually noticed that people were coming out when we were still in pandemic protocol,” Richardson said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Art Laboe, the pioneering radio DJ who read heartfelt song dedications to generations of loyal listeners and was credited with helping end segregation in Southern California during an eight-decade broadcast career, has died. He was 97. Laboe died Friday night at home in Palm Springs after catching pneumonia, said Joanna Morones, a spokesperson for Laboe’s production company, Dart Entertainment. His final show was produced last week and broadcast Sunday night. Laboe is credited with helping end segregation in Southern California by organizing live DJ shows at drive-in eateries that attracted white, Black and Latino listeners who danced to rock ’n’ roll – and shocked an older generation still listening to Frank Sinatra and Big Band music. The DJ is also credited with coining the phrase “oldies but goodies.” In 1957, he started Original Sound Record Inc., and in 1958 he released the compilation album “Oldies But Goodies: Vol. 1,” which stayed on the Billboard’s Top 100 chart for 183 weeks. He later developed a strong following among Mexican Americans for hosting the syndicated “The Art Laboe Connection Show.” His radio shows gave the families of incarcerated loved ones, in particular, a platform to speak to their relatives by dedicating songs and sending messages and updates. California and Arizona inmates would send in their own dedications and ask Laboe for updates from family.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A former National Security Agency employee accused of trying to sell classified information to Russia will remain behind bars while he is prosecuted, a magistrate judge ruled Tuesday. Jareh Sebastian Dalke, 30, is facing a possible life sentence for allegedly giving the information to an undercover FBI agent whom prosecutors say he believed was a person working for the Russian Federation. He pleaded not guilty through his lawyer during a hearing in Denver federal court before a hearing to determine if he should be released from jail. Dalke was arrested Sept. 28 after authorities say he arrived at Denver’s downtown train station with a laptop and used a secure connection set up by investigators to transfer some classified documents. Magistrate Judge S. Kato Crews said the stiff penalty Dalke could face makes him a flight risk along with the sympathies he has allegedly expressed for Russia. Crews also said he was not sure that Dalke, accused of sharing the documents after promising not to disclose information he obtained while working at the NSA, would honor any conditions he could impose that would allow Dalke to live with his wife and grandmother in Colorado Springs while the case proceeds. He was also concerned about authentic-looking but counterfeit badges for government agencies, including the NSA, allegedly found during a search of Dalke’s home.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: The conspiracy theorist Alex Jones should pay $965 million to people who suffered from his false claim that the Sandy Hook School shooting was a hoax, a jury decided Wednesday. The verdict is the second big judgment against the Infowars host over his relentless promotion of the lie that the 2012 elementary school massacre never happened and that the grieving families seen in news coverage were actors hired as part of a plot to take away people’s guns. It came in a lawsuit filed by the relatives of five children and three educators killed in the mass shooting, plus an FBI agent who was among the first responders to the scene. A Texas jury in August awarded nearly $50 million to the parents of another slain child. Robbie Parker, who lost his 6-year-old daughter, Emilie, said outside the Connecticut court that he was proud that “what we were able to accomplish was just to simply tell the truth.” “And it shouldn’t be this hard, and it shouldn’t be this scary,” he said, his voice breaking. Jones wasn’t at court but reacted on his Infowars show. As courtroom video showed the plaintiffs’ names being read out along with the jury awards to each, Jones said that he himself had never mentioned their names. “All made up. Hilarious,” he said. “So this is what a show trial looks like. I mean, this is the left completely out of control.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Nonprofits operating in the predominantly Black city have racial gaps in leadership, especially when it comes to reflecting the communities they serve. The finding is one of many from the Delaware Alliance for Nonprofit Advancement’s 2022 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, which aimed to explore racial disparities in the makeup of Delaware nonprofit boards. The study, which was released last week and included responses from more than 100 nonprofit leaders, analyzes the diversity characteristics in senior leadership at Delaware nonprofits, such as age, gender and even whether board members live in the communities in which their organization operates. The survey, conducted at the beginning of 2022, asked respondents if they believe their boards are “reflective” of their communities; how Delaware’s leadership diversity compares with national data; and what diversity, equity and inclusion steps nonprofits can take to improve diversity efforts. In a statement, DANA President and CEO Sheila Bravo said her nonprofit “often” receives requests on how to address board diversity. In a city with 55% of residents who are Black, only 37% of this city’s nonprofits have board directors who are Black and 26% of executive directors who identify as Black.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The district’s attorney general is calling for a complete overhaul of the D.C. Housing Authority amid serious allegations of collusion and corruption, WUSA-TV reports. A scathing federal audit by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development revealed systemic failures in the local agency after a WUSA-TV investigation exposed filthy and unsafe conditions months ago. Much of the district’s public housing sits on very desirable properties for developers in gentrified areas of the city. Greenleaf, for example, is slated for redevelopment following DCHA’s new build-in-place model. Attorney General Karl Racine said the housing agency is far more concerned about redevelopment than maintaining clean and safe public housing. “They are the city’s largest slumlord,” Racine said. His officer sued the agency twice, in one case alleging disabled residents have been waiting years to be moved to accessible units. “The failures are inhumane and require immediate action,” Racine said. The federal audit found an agency so mismanaged tenant files were not updated, waiting lists were locked, and some sat untouched for a decade. And those living inside public housing are left to raise families in apartments overrun by bugs, mice, mold and rats.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Gopher tortoises – burrowers whose extensive homes shelter many other animals – are generally doing well and need federal protection only in the small area where they were declared threatened 35 years ago, the government said Tuesday. Thanks to extensive conservation work and recently discovered populations, the reptile is no longer a candidate for protection in the bulk of its range: Florida, south Georgia, most of coastal Alabama and a sliver of South Carolina, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said. An environmental group that sued for protection across the entire range called the decision indefensible. “It ignores devastating urban sprawl that’s decimated the tortoise’s habitat and will continue to drive the species ever closer to extinction,” said Elise Bennett, Florida director and an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. The National Alliance of Forest Owners, on the other hand, called the agency’s action a great decision that recognizes the success of voluntary conservation programs. Bennett said Tuesday that the decision was made even though the federal agency expects populations to decline range-wide over the next 80 years. “State programs, particularly in Florida – the heart of their range – are just not working,” she said Friday, as the deadline approached. “Florida is largely just moving them out of areas under development and into smaller and smaller habitat. And fragmentation is a problem already.” The federal statement said Florida has 50 long-term relocation sites covering more than 120 square miles of gopher tortoise habitat.\n\nGeorgia\n\nVienna: A mayor helped a mother and three children escape from a sport utility vehicle that was stalled on railroad tracks with a train fast approaching. Vienna Mayor Eddie Daniels was on his way to work Saturday morning when he saw the SUV in the dangerous position. “I couldn’t let those babies sit there and get slaughtered by a train,” Daniels told WALB-TV. He helped the mom out first, then saw three children in the back seat: a 6-year-old, a 3-year-old and a 1-year old. He said he got the two younger children out and was helping the 6-year-old when the train hit the vehicle. Daniels said he remembers being caught between the train and the SUV but still managed to get the last child out. The smashed vehicle landed a few feet from where it was hit. Daniels has a broken ankle and eight stitches on his head. He said he’s thankful the family is alive. The second-term mayor also said he would have never imagined this happening in the south central Georgia city of 4,000 residents. “I’m out here just doing God’s work. That’s what we’re supposed to do,” Daniels said. “And they told me I was a hero. I said I don’t feel like a hero, just feel like I’m doing what I’m supposed to do, what the people elected me to do.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKula: State officials are soliciting public input on a planned Maui forest reserve, HawaiiNewsNow reports. The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources acquired more than 3,000 acres near the dormant Haleakala volcano just over two years ago that is a nesting site for endangered seabirds. The land is commonly known as Kamehamenui.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Nearly 50 longtime Idaho Republicans, including a former governor and dozens of other past and current officeholders, on Tuesday endorsed the Democratic candidate for attorney general in November’s election. Republicans attended a news conference at the Statehouse with Boise attorney Tom Arkoosh, who has said he has no political ambitions other than to run the office fairly. “Tom Arkoosh is the first candidate on the Democratic ticket I have supported in my 66 years of work with the Republican Party,” said Republican state Sen. Patti Anne Lodge, the powerful chairwoman of the Senate’s State Affairs Committee who is retiring this year. The three other current officeholders endorsing Arkoosh are also leaving office this year, either through retirement or primary losses. But the list of supporters includes many well-known Republicans. Arkoosh said he would like the endorsements to start a wider conversation about what voters want in the deeply conservative state that hasn’t sent a Democrat to the attorney general’s office since 1991. “When that conversation happens, we will move away from extremism,” he said. “We will become Idahoans altogether again.” Arkoosh announced his candidacy in July after former U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador defeated five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the GOP primary in May. Arkoosh and the Republicans supporting him say Labrador will turn the office into a partisan base to further his own political ambitions.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Police have a suspect in custody after officers discovered human remains inside a freezer at a boarding house while investigating a report of a missing person, police said Tuesday. The home’s owner, a 55-year-old woman, is believed to be the victim, said Brendan Deenihan, the Chicago Police Department’s chief of detectives. Her remains were found Monday. Deenihan told reporters that a suspect who lived in the boarding house on Chicago’s Northwest Side was taken into custody Monday. He said the suspect, whose name was not released, has declined to speak to detectives about the slaying, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. A resident of the boarding house who had filed a missing-person report for the building’s owner told officers Monday that another building tenant had recently called a tow truck and carried a heavy bag out to the vehicle when it arrived, Deenihan said. “We learned that this individual dumped a large plastic bag in a garbage can at Foster Beach,” Deenihan said, adding that detectives found bloody towels in that garbage can along the lakefront. Detectives returned to the boarding house and discovered human remains in a freezer about 7 p.m., then obtained a search warrant so they could recover the evidence.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Voters were allowed to begin casting early, in-person ballots Wednesday for the Nov. 8 election in which Democrats are looking for a backlash against the Republican-backed state abortion ban approved over the summer. Republicans in the tightest races are largely avoiding the abortion issue while emphasizing economic topics as they seek to extend their dominance over statewide offices and the General Assembly. Republican U.S. Sen. Todd Young is seeking reelection by following a front-runner strategy of mostly ignoring Democratic challenger Thomas McDermott ahead of their only televised debate scheduled for Sunday. Democrats, meanwhile, are targeting the Indiana secretary of state’s race, in which former Mike Pence aide Diego Morales won the Republican nomination despite twice leaving jobs in that office after being written up for poor job performance. Indiana Democrats are trying to pick up enough legislative seats to break the Republican supermajorities that have left Democrats largely powerless against conservative proposals such as the abortion ban that’s been blocked by a court order. Democrats need to gain five seats in the 100-member House needed to break the two-thirds supermajority that allows Republicans to act even if no Democrats are present.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A former Iowa official now running for state auditor was wrongly fired in retaliation for reporting illegal conduct at the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division, a Polk County jury found Friday. Todd Halbur began working as comptroller for the division in 2015 and sued after he was terminated in July 2018, alleging whistleblower retaliation on the part of the beverages division and its director, Stephen Larson. The case went to trial in October, and on Friday, his attorneys said, the jury ruled in Halbur’s favor and awarded him $487,500 for lost wages and $512,500 for emotional distress – a total of $1 million. Halbur, a small-business owner and licensed Realtor, is running as a Republican to unseat Auditor Rob Sand, the Democratic incumbent. The auditor acts as the taxpayers’ watchdog by auditing the financial operations of Iowa’s state and local governments. Attorney Stuart Higgins, representing Halbur, said the decision vindicated his client’s belief that he’d been punished for doing the right thing. “We are pleased that jurors recognized what Todd Halbur knew all along: that he stood up to make sure the law was followed and was fired by Administrator Larson in retaliation,” Higgins said. “All the credit goes to Todd for his tenacity and courage in pursuing this case.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s Republican attorney general told a racial justice commission two years ago that racial bias “obviously” exists in law enforcement, but he said Tuesday that he wasn’t saying systemic racism exists and stood by campaign attacks on the state’s Democratic governor for using that phrase. Attorney General Derek Schmidt and fellow Republicans are portraying Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly as anti-police as Schmidt tries to unseat Kelly in the Nov. 8 election. George Floyd’s death in 2020 led Kelly to form a Commission on Racial Justice and Equity to examine policing, declaring as she did so that “systemic racism within law enforcement must end.” Schmidt has argued that saying systemic racism exists is calling law enforcement officers racist. His own comments that racial bias “obviously” exists in policing came during a Zoom meeting of the governor’s commission in October 2020. He told reporters Tuesday that when “a rare bad apple” commits misconduct, “there are mechanisms in place to deal with those individual problems.” “They are two different things,” Schmidt said. “I certainly don’t argue that there is systemic racism in law enforcement, and I think the governor’s decision to appoint an entire separate commission to focus on that problem was ill-advised.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A former police officer blamed for instigating a conflict that led to the fatal shooting of a Black barbecue restaurant owner during the Breonna Taylor protests has pleaded guilty to using excessive force. Katie R. Crews, 29, pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday to a misdemeanor. She was indicted in March on a felony excessive force charge that carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Crews, who is white, was fired by Louisville police earlier this year for escalating a conflict the night of restaurateur David McAtee’s death and for a separate incident in which she taunted protesters on social media. McAtee’s death furthered the anger of protesters who had began massing in Louisville’s downtown streets in 2020 over the death of Taylor, a Black EMT killed by police who knocked down her door while executing a drug search warrant. Under the terms of the agreement, Crews, of Jeffersonville, Indiana, can no longer work in law enforcement. She will be sentenced in federal court in January. The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison. Steve Romines, a lawyer for McAtee’s family, said they are “glad that there has been an acknowledgment of the gross misconduct of (Louisville police) the night of David’s death.” Crews wasn’t “a lone wolf who decided to go rogue,” Romines said in an email Wednesday, arguing that authorities were sent to Louisville’s west end by commanding officers to “violate policies and harass people.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Two anglers whose boat sank over the weekend in the Gulf of Mexico say they clung to an improvised float and fought off sharks with their bare hands while the third swam what felt like miles to search for help. The swimmer, Phong Le, managed to find a cellphone signal and sent a Google map of his location just before his battery died, he told ABC News on Tuesday. The three men had been in the water since about 10 a.m. Saturday – the sharks showed up Sunday morning, Luan Nguyen said. One bit the front of his life vest. “And I think that’s where I caught … these injuries on my hand,” he told the broadcaster, which identified the third boater as Son Nguyen. “I took my two thumbs and jabbed him in the eyes, and he took off,” Luan Nguyen said. Even as the two men were pulled from the water, they were being circled and harassed by four blacktip sharks measuring about 4 to 6 feet long, said Andrew Stone, a seaman in the Coast Guard boat crew that rescued the exhausted pair. “They were too tired to even be panicking,” he told the Associated Press in an interview alongside other Coast Guard members and officials. All three boaters were back home Tuesday, the Coast Guard said. “These peoples’ will to survive and their lifejackets is what saved their lives,” said Lt. Katy Caraway, a helicopter co-pilot.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The owner of a former chemical plant that dumped mercury into the Penobscot River must pay at least $187 million to remove the contamination in a resolution to a decades­long legal battle. A federal judge on Tuesday approved the settlement calling for Mallinckrodt U.S. LLC to pay for remediation of mercury released by the now-defunct HoltraChem plant in Orrington. The plant discharged 6 to 12 metric tons of mercury from 1967 until the early 1970s, according to a previous court-ordered study. Environmental groups have long pushed for the remediation of the river. “It’s long past time for Mallinckrodt to make it right, and this ruling will go a long way toward restoring the Penobscot, so people can go back to fishing, eating lobster, and enjoying this river,” Jesse Graham, co-director of Maine People’s Alliance, said in a statement. The plant operated until 2000 and was located about 135 miles north of Portland, just south of Bangor. Maine People’s Alliance and Natural Resources Defense Council also filed a complaint about the mercury pollution in 2000. The company’s financial obligations under the settlement will not exceed $267 million, court papers said.\n\nMaryland\n\nUpper Marlboro: A transgender teacher who said she was harassed by students, parents and colleagues has settled a lawsuit with a school district with an agreement that includes policy changes and training. Attorneys for Jennifer Eller said the settlement reached late last month with the Prince George’s County Board of Education also included monetary compensation. The lawsuit was filed in 2018 in U.S. District Court. “I’m relieved to see this case finally come to a resolution and satisfied to see that our case led to the adoption of these policy changes and training protocols to improve the school environment for everyone, including LGBTQ+ students and teachers,” Eller said in a statement. “This settlement vindicates my pleas for help and sensitivity training on LGBTQ+ issues for students and staff. Every student and every teacher should feel safe, welcomed, and respected in a school environment.” Eller said she was told to present as male and be referred to by male pronouns, and she was also threatened, according to a news release. After Eller filed formal complaints, she said administrators took away her Advanced Placement English class, and she was brought to a disciplinary hearing that resulted in no discipline.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A 91-year-old civil rights activist and education advocate was stabbed multiple times while walking her dog in a local park, authorities said. Jean McGuire, the first Black woman to serve on the Boston School Committee, was stabbed in Franklin Park about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday, Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden said Wednesday after visiting McGuire at the hospital. McGuire’s stabbing, as well as the recent fatal shooting of a 14-year-old boy in the city, is unacceptable, said Hayden, whose family has been close to McGuire’s for years. “I’m certainly outraged, and I think we have to be at the point where we have an entire community that is equally as outraged and will not stand for this sort of random violence any further,” he said. The good news is that McGuire is “as spunky and as vibrant as ever and is going to be just fine, praise the Lord,” he said. McGuire’s sister, Jeriline Brady McGinnis, told multiple news outlets that her sister has been walking dogs in the park for decades. “What did he want? Dog walkers don’t carry money. We carry poop bags and ID. That’s all he’s going to get,” she told WFXT-TV. McGuire was unconscious when officers found her. She was taken to a hospital with injuries that aren’t considered life-threatening, police said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Over 150,000 Michigan voters have cast absentee ballots a month before the Nov. 8 election that will decide the state’s governor, secretary of state, attorney general and whether access to abortion will be a constitutional right. A total of 1.6 million people have requested absentee ballots so far, surpassing the 1.16 million who chose the option in the 2018 midterm election. The numbers indicate that 2022 could be the most votes ever cast in the state for a gubernatorial election, secretary of state spokesman Jake Rollow said Tuesday. A record-breaking 3.3 million people in Michigan voted absentee in the 2020 presidential election at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Rollow said he expects the state “would end up with about 2.25 million absentee ballots submitted if things were to play out along similar trend lines” to the 2020 election. The secretary of state will continue to release absentee numbers weekly in the lead-up to the election. A 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment that allowed for no-excuse absentee voting, along with the pandemic, has led voters in the state to increasingly vote absentee rather than at the polls on Election Day.\n\nMinnesota\n\nWaite Park: A woman is accused of a threatening to kill a Somali family while invading their St. Cloud-area home on two occasions, court documents say. Alyssa Holmberg, 33, of Ogilvie, is charged with bias-motivated assault and three other counts in connection with the Saturday disturbance at a Waite Park apartment building. Holmberg yelled racist remarks about Somali people, including those on the police force, according to the criminal complaint. A girl in the family who called 911 said Holmberg said she hated Somalis and screamed that was going to kill her and her family. Holmberg threw an object at the girl and left briefly before returning. Authorities said police arrived to see Holmberg chasing a man. The man told police he was walking on the sidewalk near the apartment building when Holmberg shouted, “Somali, move!” She allegedly threw a bottle of salsa and hit him in the back. Officers eventually caught Holmberg and started to handcuff her. She said she was irate about Somalis being on the police force and kicked one officer and called her vulgar names. Holmberg is charged with assaulting an officer. Holmberg made her first court appearance Tuesday morning. Her bail was set at $50,000 without conditions or $5,000 with conditions. It was not clear if she had an attorney.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre says he is being treated unfairly in news coverage of a Mississippi welfare scandal, including about payments he received to help fund a pet project of his – a volleyball arena at the university he attended and where his daughter was playing the sport. “I have been unjustly smeared in the media,” Favre said in a statement to Fox News Digital, which was published Tuesday. “I have done nothing wrong, and it is past time to set the record straight. No one ever told me, and I did not know, that funds designated for welfare recipients were going to the University or me,” Favre wrote. “I tried to help my alma mater USM, a public Mississippi state university, raise funds for a wellness center. My goal was and always will be to improve the athletic facilities at my university.” It is one of the few public statements Favre has made about Mississippi’s largest-ever public corruption case involving the misspending of tens of millions of dollars in welfare money that was intended to help some of the poorest people in one of the poorest states in the U.S. Favre is not facing criminal charges. He is among more than three dozen people or companies being sued by the Mississippi Department of Human Services.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Although the creature was absent, a group of 75 enthusiasts attended the first Ozark Mountain Bigfoot Conference at the Christian County Elks Lodge on Saturday. Event coordinator Mary Ann Ziebell said she was going to be happy if 50 people showed up, so her hopes were exceeded. She’s already planning for next year’s conference, slated for October 2023. When she realized there may not have been a sasquatch conference previously in Missouri, Ziebell jumped at the chance to set one up. She contacted members from the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization, Ozark Mountain Sasquatch, a cryptolinguist and others to speak at the all-day conference Oct. 8. “It falls one of two places: People either believe, or they think we’ve lost our freaking minds – there’s really no in between,” Ziebell said in an interview minutes before the conference began. “Now, with some people, it wouldn’t matter if you dragged a body in here; they’re not gonna believe it.” Ziebell said she first encountered sasquatches only recently. She was on an expedition with her husband in 2019 when she saw one illuminated by the full moon. Southwest Missouri is a “hotbed” for sightings, she said. “You can go 30 minutes outside of Springfield and find all kinds of things,” Ziebell said.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: An environmental group filed a lawsuit Tuesday against U.S. Forest Service officials that alleges they polluted waterways during their campaigns against wildfires by inadvertently dropping large volumes of chemical flame retardant into streams. Government data released earlier this year found aircraft operated or contracted by the Forest Service dropped more than 760,000 gallons of fire retardant directly onto streams and other waterways between 2012 and 2019. The main ingredients in fire retardant are inorganic fertilizers and salts that can be harmful to some fish, frogs, crustaceans and other aquatic species. The lawsuit alleges the continued use of retardant from aircraft violates the Clean Water Act. It requests a judge to declare the pollution illegal and was filed in U.S. District Court in Montana by Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics. “It’s simply too toxic at the levels used fighting fires,” said Andy Stahl, the Eugene, Oregon-based group’s executive director. Forest Service officials in recent years have sought to avoid polluting streams during their fights against wildfires by imposing buffer zones around waterways where drops are restricted. Under a 2011 government decision, fire retardant may only be applied in designated “avoidance areas” where human life or public safety is threatened.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: An incarcerated woman’s death from cervical cancer is the fault of the state prison system, an inspector general’s report has found. According to the Omaha World-Herald, inmate Niccole Wetherell died at age 40, a year and a half after a Pap smear revealed the cancer. The Nebraska Department of Correctional Services’ lack of attention to preventive care flies in the face of a 2015 law that required electronic tracking of inmate health records.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A defense lawyer raised mental health questions Tuesday about a man accused of killing two people and wounding six in a stabbing rampage last week on a Las Vegas Strip sidewalk. The suspect, Yoni Christian Barrios, stood in shackles during his brief arraignment and spoke only to say he understood he was being charged with two counts of murder and six counts of attempted murder. He was not immediately asked to enter a plea. Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Harmony Letizia set a Jan. 12 hearing to determine if Barrios will face trial in state court on charges that could have him confronting a possible death penalty, and she ordered him to remain jailed without bail. A grand jury could indict Barrios before that time. “We’re doing an evaluation regarding competency based on the nature of everything we know so far,” deputy public defender Scott Coffee said outside court after the hearing. “Obviously there are mental health concerns.” Authorities say Barrios, 32, asked sidewalk showgirls to pose with him for a photo before wielding a large chef’s knife to fatally stab Maris DiGiovanni, 30, and Brent Allan Hallett, 46, on Oct. 6 outside the Wynn Las Vegas resort.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKingston: With home heating costs on the rise, dozens of local artists have teamed up to auction off some of their original artwork to raise money to help veterans in need this winter. A “Fuel for Vets” benefit auction will be held Sunday at the Kingston Community Library. A brunch is planned from 10:30 a.m. to 12 p.m., followed by a live art auction from noon to 2 p.m. Nearly 40 pieces of artwork donated by artists from the Seacoast and beyond will be up for grabs. “There are going to be people making choices between food and heat this winter, and it certainly shouldn’t be veterans,” said Hampstead artist Dannielle Genovese, who came up with the idea for the auction while going through some of her own artwork that was taking up space in her home. Genovese wanted to find a way to donate her pieces and have them auctioned off. She reached out to other local artists and found a lot of support for the idea, including from members of the Seacoast Artist Association. The Kingston Community Library quickly joined the effort and agreed to help organize and host the event. “The money is going to local people in need,” library Director Melissa Mannon said. “This is the role a library can play in the community. We value books, but we also value art and creativity.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOceanport: Streaming giant Netflix says it is the top bid in the race for Fort Monmouth’s Mega Parcel, the largest property ever put up for sale at the former U.S. Army base, though details remain unclear. Spokespeople for the company said Wednesday that its bid was the “preferred choice” for the 293-acre parcel out of four possible bidders. Officials at Fort Monmouth Economic Revitalization Authority, the state agency in charge of the fort’s redevelopment, did not immediately confirm Netflix was chosen, but its executive director said the highest bidder had been contacted. Kara Kopach, FMERA’s executive director, said the process may take several months, and “no recommendation has been made to date.” A spokesperson for Netflix said the company’s proposal is for a “state-of-the-art production complex” at Fort Monmouth, which once served as fort for the Signal Corps, before being closed by the Army in 2011, a casualty of base realignment. “If our plans are approved, we hope to build a facility that will create significant economic impact and job growth for New Jersey, a state loaded with creative talent and technical expertise,” Netflix’s spokespeople said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: A New Mexico State University study has found that teacher vacancies in the state have dropped significantly over the past year. NMSU released a report Monday from its Southwest Outreach Academic Research Evaluation & Policy Center showing that the numbers of empty positions are closer to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Researchers looked at the number of job openings in every school district in New Mexico and data provided by colleges and universities. They found 690 teacher vacancies compared to 1,048 last year, a 34% decline. Rachel Boren, the center’s director, said the findings don’t diminish the fact that there is still an urgent need for teachers and other support staff. The void is especially felt with teaching special education and elementary education. By subject, the biggest needs are in math, science and English language arts. The study also counted 1,886 students enrolled in an education preparation program during the 2021-22 academic year. That is an increase compared to 1,596 students enrolled the year prior. The report found 1,027 students finished a program this year. Officials at NMSU’s own teacher education program say having secure, collaborative partnerships helps with ensuring prospective teachers obtain their license.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: One of the state’s most popular attractions has reopened to the public. The National Park Service began allowing visitors to go up into the Statue of Liberty’s crown Tuesday, more than 21/ 2 years after it closed during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Other parts of the statue including the observation deck had reopened previously. Due to the popularity of the crown, visitors are required to make reservations in advance, and a limited number of tickets are available each day. As of Tuesday evening, the first available tickets were for early November. Situated in New York Harbor overlooking New York and New Jersey, the statue routinely drew more than 4 million visitors in the several years leading up to the pandemic. About 1.5 million visited in 2021, according to the Department of the Interior. The park service warns visitors with physical limitations that the climb to the crown is 162 steps up a double-helix spiral staircase and can be strenuous.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBurlington: A severed finger left behind at the scene of an attempted home invasion last week led investigators to a suspect in the case, police said. Burlington officers responded to a report of an attempted home invasion Thursday morning after a resident who had started a vehicle in the driveway encountered an armed man who tried to force his way into the house, police said in a news release. Police said the two struggled, and the man’s gun went off, grazing the resident’s chest, before the resident was able to shut the door on his hand. The resident was not seriously injured. Crime scene investigators found a finger, believed to have been severed when the resident forced the door shut, inside the suspect’s glove, which fell off during the struggle, police said. Investigators used fingerprints to identify a suspect, Burlington police spokesperson Emily-Lynn Adkins said. The city lies about 50 miles northwest of Raleigh. Vernon Wilson, 67, of Hillsborough, was arrested Monday on charges that include first-degree burglary, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, inflicting serious injury and possession of a firearm by a prohibited felon. Wilson was held on a $250,000 secure bond, police said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The state Supreme Court has ordered a lower court judge to reconsider his decision to prevent the state’s abortion ban from taking effect pending the outcome of a clinic’s legal challenge. The North Dakota Supreme Court late Tuesday ordered Judge Bruce Romanick to weigh the clinic’s chances of succeeding in reconsidering whether his decision to temporarily halt enforcement of the ban was correct. The Red River Women’s Clinic, the state’s only abortion clinic, argues that the state’s constitution grants the right to abortion. Romanick last month denied a request to lift his stay of a law banning abortion while the clinic’s challenge is pending. The judge wrote that he was not ruling on the probability of the clinic winning the lawsuit but rather that more time was needed to make a proper judgment. It was the second time the judge blocked the so-called trigger law, which had been set to take effect at the end of August. North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley certified a July 28 closing date a few days after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. But Romanick rejected that date based on a technical issue involving the timing of the ban, after which Wrigley argued that the judge hadn’t sufficiently considered whether the clinic’s lawsuit would succeed.\n\nOhio\n\nAkron: The eight police officers who fired dozens of rounds at Jayland Walker, a 25-year-old Black man, following a car and foot chase have returned to duty. Akron Police Chief Steve Mylett said the officers were back at work Monday to alleviate a staffing shortage he described as a “crisis” to WEWS-TV on Tuesday. The officers had been on paid administrative leave following the June 27 fatal shooting. The officers will not be in uniform or work patrol duties, Mylett said. They have been reassigned to administrative duties, he said. “We recognize that this decision will cause concern for the Walker family and the community, and we are sensitive to those concerns,” Mylett said. The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is currently investigating the circumstances surrounding Walker’s death. A preliminary autopsy showed Walker was shot at least 40 times. Two officers initially tried to stop Walker’s car for minor equipment violations. Walker refused to stop, and seconds into the pursuit, a shot was fired from his car, police said. The officers chased the car onto a freeway and back onto city streets. A short time later, Walker stopped and bailed from the car. Ignoring officers’ commands, he ran into an adjacent parking lot, where he was killed in a hail of police gunfire, police bodycam video shows.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Pardon and Parole Board on Wednesday rejected a request to recommend clemency for a death row inmate who killed his girlfriend’s 3-year-old son in 1993. The board turned down the request to recommend to Gov. Kevin Stitt that Richard Stephen Fairchild be spared for the beating death of Adam Broomhall in Del City. Fairchild, 62, is set to be executed Nov. 17. Defense attorney Emma Rolls argued that Fairchild was abused as a child, suffers from mental illness and is remorseful for his actions. “As Richard Fairchild’s brain has deteriorated, he has descended into psychosis,” Rolls said in a statement. “Mr. Fairchild is now suffering from the effects of major mental illness, namely schizoaffective disorder, leaving him tortured with continued delusions,” Rolls said. “Yet despite having lost touch with reality, Richard remains remorseful for his crime and continues to have an unblemished prison record.” Oklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor said in a statement that the board made the correct decision. “Fairchild, brutally tortured (the child) to death on Nov. 13, 1995, for wetting the bed,” O’Connor said. “Fairchild … beat, burned, and threw Adam into the side of a table, silencing his cries forever.”\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: The University of Oregon has announced a new initiative to support Indigenous students that will cover all tuition costs and offer them additional resources. The Home Flight Scholars Program is available immediately to currently enrolled eligible undergraduate students, an estimated 150 to 175 self-identified American Indian and Alaska Native Oregon residents. The program also will establish a new academic adviser position and offer professional development aimed at Indigenous students. Native American students have the highest college dropout rate of any other race or ethnicity due to financial hardships, academic difficulties and the lack of cultural connectedness, according to Kirby Brown, associate professor and director of the new Native American and Indigenous Studies Program. Brown said the majority of Native students who leave drop out their first year, and 90% of those drop out in the first term. The Home Flight Scholars Program is focused on changing this trend. “We’re very, very cognizant of who is on campus and why we are supporting them through their education because it makes the difference in the future,” said Jason Younker, assistant vice president and adviser to the president on sovereignty and government to government relations. Younker is also chief of the Coquille Indian Tribe. “They are our future stewards, they will come back to the tribes, and they will be UO allies; they will be our future leaders,” he said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A federal jury has awarded a former Allegheny County jailer close to $1 million in his lawsuit alleging he was fired in retaliation for reporting racist comments and texts from a supervisor. The decision came Friday, about five years after Jeffrey Kengerski filed the lawsuit against the county and the jail warden in 2017. He was fired in 2015 for what his attorneys said were false allegations of misconduct by subordinates. An attorney for the county maintained Tuesday that Kengerski was fired for proper cause and said the county will likely appeal. Kengerski said he was telling co-workers that he and his wife planned to take their grand-niece into their care full time when his supervisor referred to the biracial girl as a “little monkey” after asking if she was Black. Kengerski said the supervisor also then sent him multiple texts that included stereotyped images of Black and Asian people that often included captions comparing them to Black and Asian jail employees. The supervisor left the jail in 2015, according to the lawsuit. But before she left, Kengerski alleged that she reassigned him to the night shift as retaliation after he filed a complaint. Kengerski alleged other jail employees harassed him by making racist calls to his work number, physically threatened him and falsely accused him of misconduct.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBurrillville: The so-called Conjuring House will host a “Halloween Spooktacular” Oct.28 to 31, featuring two watch parties showing the 2013 movie “The Conjuring,” with guest Andrea Perron, one of the five sisters in the family who inspired the movie. The weekend will also include six-hour ghost hunts, from 10 p.m. Friday, Saturday and Sunday to 4 a.m. the following days. Also, tours will be offered: the house’s regular hourlong daytime tours and special “spooky” after-dark tours lasting an hour and a half. The ghost hunts are $130 per person Friday and Saturday and $150 Sunday, which will have a smaller limit of 10 people to offer a “more intimate” experience, according to owner Jacqueline Nuñez.The movie screenings with Perron are $125 a person and run from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Tours start at $20 for children 7 to 12 and $25 for those 13 and older. For information or to reserve a spot, visit theconjuringhouse.com.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg: The president of a historically Black university has accused law enforcement officers of racially profiling a busload of students from her school by stopping the vehicle for a minor traffic violation and using drug-sniffing dogs to search their luggage. Noting that nothing illegal was found in the search, Shaw University President Paulette Dillard said she was outraged by the treatment, which also included questioning that she likened to an interrogation. The traffic stop was carried out by deputies and law enforcement officers in Spartanburg County on Oct. 5 as 18 students from her Raleigh, North Carolina, school were traveling to a conference in Atlanta, Dillard said. She wrote in a statement Monday that she has asked the school’s general counsel to consider options for legal recourse. Dillard called the situation “reminiscent of the 1950s and 1960s – armed police, interrogating innocent Black students, conducting searches without probable cause, and blood-thirsty dogs” and the deputies’ actions “unfair and unjust.” The officers told the people aboard the bus that they stopped it because the vehicle was swerving and issued the driver a warning ticket for improper lane use, according to Dillard’s statement. Spartanburg County Sheriff’s Lt. Kevin Bobo, an agency spokesperson, said deputies need more information from the school to fully investigate the school’s complaint.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Wednesday that she would not call a special legislative session to have lawmakers consider repealing the state’s tax on groceries ahead of the November election, despite calls to do so from a handful of Republican lawmakers as well as her Democratic challenger. The governor, speaking at a news event at a Sioux Falls grocery store, acknowledged her campaign proposal does not currently have the votes necessary for passage in the state Senate. She will have to win over lawmakers when they are scheduled to reconvene in January. Repeal of the state tax on groceries, which would cost the state about $100 million in annual revenue, has become a central issue in her reelection bid against her Democratic opponent, state Rep. Jamie Smith. Noem publicly opposed the repeal in March this year but changed course last month to promise that she would convince the Legislature to cut the tax if reelected. Smith supported the repeal several times during his six years in the state House. “I don’t want to put us in a situation where this bill fails,” Noem said. The governor said she would work to convince senators that she has expanded South Dakota’s economy to a point that state government would not miss the $100 million in revenue.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Grammy-winning singer and composer Anita Kerr, whose vocal group the Anita Kerr Singers provided the lush backdrop to the Nashville Sound, has died. She was 94. Her daughter, Kelley Kerr, confirmed to The New York Times that her mother died in Geneva on Monday. Kerr worked alongside hit producers Chet Atkins and Owen Bradley to create the popular countrypolitan sound of country music in the 1950s and ’60s that relied on strings and choral singers for an orchestral sound. She and her singers provided backup to songs by Patsy Cline, Brenda Lee, Ernest Tubb, Jim Reeves, Red Foley, Roy Orbison and many more. Alongside the Jordanaires, the Anita Kerr Singers were prolific in recording sessions and provided the essential sound to so many hit recordings. “Anita Kerr helped Nashville achieve world-class stature as a music center through her roles as a gifted arranger, producer and leader of the lush vocal quartet the Anita Kerr Singers,” Kyle Young, CEO of the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, said in a statement. “Her voice and her creativity expanded the artistic and commercial possibilities for country music.” Born in Memphis, Kerr moved to Nashville with her husband, a DJ, and started a vocal quartet that was featured on WSM radio.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A now-former police officer was charged Tuesday with two counts of aggravated assault by a peace officer for shooting and gravely wounding a teen eating a hamburger in his car in a McDonald’s parking lot. The teen had begun driving away when the officer opened fire. James Brennand, 25, was charged in the Oct. 2 shooting of Erik Cantu, 17, according to a police statement. He turned himself in to police Tuesday night and remained in custody, said Police Chief William McManus. Cantu is still unconscious and on life support, his family said Tuesday. “There is no improvement in his condition,” the family said in a statement delivered by their lawyer, Brian Powers. “The last two days have been difficult, and we expect more difficulty ahead, but we remain hopeful.” Brennand, a rookie officer, reported the vehicle Cantu was sitting in had evaded him the night before during an attempted traffic stop. Brennand said he suspected the vehicle was stolen. In body camera footage released by police, Brennand opens the car door and tells Cantu to get out. The car drives backward with the door open, and the officer fires multiple times into the vehicle. He continues to shoot as the car drives away. Investigators quickly determined that the use of deadly force was unwarranted, and Brennand was fired.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Three children who were sexually abused by their father are accusing a state legislator and a prominent Salt Lake City law firm of conspiring with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to cover up the abuse, allowing it to go on for years. In a court filing in Cochise County, Arizona, made public Wednesday, the children of the late Paul Adams asked a judge for permission to add Republican Utah Rep. Merrill F. Nelson and law firm Kirton McConkie as defendants in their lawsuit against the church, widely known as the Mormon church. The suit accuses the church of failing to notify police or child welfare officials that Adams was abusing his older daughter. In 2010, Adams confessed to his bishop, John Herrod, that he had sexually abused his daughter, according to legal records. Herrod reported the abuse to a church “abuse help line” and was advised not to report it to police or child welfare officials. The abuse was kept secret, and Adams continued raping his older daughter and her younger sister for several years. Adams was later charged by federal officials with posting videos of the abuse on the internet. Herrod’s decision not to report came after speaking with Nelson, according to church records included as evidence in the case. Nelson was a shareholder at Kirton McConkie, which has more than 160 attorneys, according to its website. Nelson was one of several lawyers at the firm who routinely fielded calls made by bishops to the help line.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: A fired deputy sheriff who is the only candidate on the November ballot to become sheriff is continuing to insist he did nothing wrong when he was recorded on surveillance video kicking a handcuffed and shackled prisoner. John Grismore won the nomination of both Franklin County’s Republican and Democratic parties to have his name on the November ballot, but after the video became public in August, he was suspended and then fired. Now his bid to become sheriff has lost the support of both parties, which have thrown their support to a write-in candidate. Grismore said the kicks were needed to protect himself and two other deputies from the prisoner who had been spitting at them. “We were horrified by the video of John Grismore brutalizing a handcuffed detainee,” Franklin County Democratic chair Zach Sheffler said in an email. “Grismore has since been fired, condemned by both parties, and remains under criminal investigation. He cannot continue to credibly campaign for this office.” A state police criminal investigation continues and once completed will be referred to the county prosecutor for possible charges. Meanwhile, the current sheriff, who called the case “egregious,” referred the case to the Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council, which could revoke Grismore’s certification as a law enforcement officer.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democratic U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria and GOP challenger Jen Kiggans tangled over federal spending, the economy and abortion restrictions during a combative debate Wednesday, as the two Navy veterans sought to present themselves as the best equipped to represent Virginia’s military-heavy 2nd Congressional District. Kiggans, a state senator, nurse practitioner and former Navy helicopter pilot, is trying to block Luria, a retired naval commander, from a third term representing the highly competitive district that could help determine party control of the U.S. House in next month’s midterm elections. In sometimes-fiery exchanges, the candidates offered vastly different perspectives on the state of America’s economy and the other’s record during the approximately hour-and-a-half debate hosted by the Hampton Roads Chamber at an oceanfront hotel. Luria called Kiggans “an election denier” who is “not fit to serve” because she has repeatedly refused to say plainly that President Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election. Kiggans has answered questions on the topic – including during an interview with the Associated Press – by simply acknowledging Biden resides in the White House; she declined to answer questions about the 2020 election in a brief exchange with reporters after the debate.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The city will end its COVID-19 emergency proclamation at the end of October. Mayor Bruce Harrell said in a statement Tuesday that Seattle will lift its remaining COVID-19 emergency order to align with Gov. Jay Inslee’s decision to end the statewide state of emergency on Oct. 31. Inslee issued the state of emergency Feb. 29, 2020, after cases started increasing, and a death in Washington state was the first reported COVID-19 death in the nation. “While the impacts of the pandemic continue to be felt by our neighbors and communities, it is thanks to our city’s strong response – including our high vaccination rate and strong health care system – that we can continue moving toward recovery and revitalization,” Harrell said in the statement. “We will continue to follow the recommendations of public health experts and science leaders to support the safety and well-being of our communities.” Policies linked to the emergency order including premium pay for food delivery and network gig workers will end Nov. 1. Harrel lifted mask and other COVID-19 precautions in city buildings earlier this year. The City’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for employees and others will remain in effect.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nFayetteville: Thrill-seekers from around the world are heading to southern West Virginia for a bridge-jumping event that was called off the past two years due to the coronavirus pandemic. Saturday’s Bridge Day festival in Fayetteville is the one day each year that it’s legal to jump off the 876-foot-high New River Gorge Bridge. Hundreds of BASE jumpers make the leap by parachuting off the bridge. BASE stands for the places from which jumpers usually leap: buildings, antennae, spans and earth. As many as 100,000 people are expected to walk across the bridge. Rappellers also will make their way down on a fixed rope from a catwalk under the bridge. Also available is a 700-foot-long zipline from the catwalk to a road below. The 3,030-foot-long bridge opened to traffic in October 1977. The festival is held on the third Saturday of October every year. Last year’s festival was canceled after a group representing parachutists said they wouldn’t jump off the nation’s third-highest bridge due to worries about sufficient emergency health care amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The event also was canceled in 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: An appeals court on Monday put on hold a lower court’s ruling from last week prohibiting voters from canceling their original absentee ballot and casting a new one, blocking at least temporarily the order sought by a conservative group founded by prominent Republicans. The appeals court granted the Wisconsin Elections Commission’s request for a temporary stay while the court decided whether to hear the appeal on the practice known as ballot spoiling. The appeals court gave both sides until noon Wednesday to submit arguments. The legal fight comes as Wisconsin voters are returning absentee ballots for the Nov. 8 election. To date, just short of 110,000 absentee ballots have been returned, just over a quarter of the nearly 401,000 that were requested, according to the elections commission. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson are both on the ballot in tight races. The order from the appeals court came as the elections commission was in closed session of an emergency meeting Monday called in part to react to the court ruling. The order from Waukesha County Circuit Judge Brad Schimel, a former Republican attorney general, required the elections commission to inform municipal clerks and local election officials by 7 p.m. Monday that its guidance on ballot spoiling issued Aug. 1 had been withdrawn.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state’s top elections official is asking county clerks to remove drop boxes for absentee ballots in next month’s election, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Karl Allred, Wyoming’s interim secretary of state, sent a letter Friday – three weeks after he stepped into the role – asking the clerks to consider the move in the future if not for the Nov. 8 vote. Allred cited “concern” with the ballot boxes. “I’m mindful of the fact that there have been no issues reported with the use of the drop boxes in Wyoming, but that does not alleviate the potential for abuse or destruction of ballots through use of fire or other means,” he wrote, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/01/back-school-bash-right-whale-protections-shark-sightings-news-around-states/50550055/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state’s prison system said Friday the execution of Joe Nathan James Jr. on Thursday night was delayed 3 hours because of the time it took to establish an intravenous line to the inmate. The state offered more information on Friday about the hourslong delay that observers said was troubling and unusual. A statement from the Alabama Department of Corrections did not elaborate on how long it took to establish the intravenous line or how many attempts were made. But a prison system spokeswoman confirmed the delay happened because of the time required to establish the IV connection. James was put to death for the 1994 murder of his ex-girlfriend Faith Hall, 26, more than 3 hours after the procedure originally was supposed to begin. The execution was set for 6 p.m. and the U.S. Supreme Court denied James’ request for a stay at 5:24 p.m. Reporters were taken to the grounds of Holman prison by van at about 6:30 p.m. to witness the execution, which did not get underway until about 9:04 p.m. The inmate was pronounced dead at 9:27 p.m. A delay of that length is unusual compared to executions conducted in Alabama in recent years.\n\nAlaska\n\nHaines: More than a year and half later, local and out-of-state organizations are still helping to repair damage from the dozens of landslides that occurred around the borough. The recovery work has evolved over time, said members of the Haines Long Term Recovery Group and other organizations involved in recovery efforts. The landslides, driven by unusually heavy rain, killed two, but were scarcely limited to that, said Sylvia Heinz, coordinator for the LTRG. Smaller landslides across Haines, which has a population of about 2,500, cut off roads, washed through houses and destroyed buildings. Heinz said there’s roughly 50 cases the LTRG is still dealing with, with issues ranging from damaged foundations to broken doors and windows, washed out culverts, driveways rendered impassable or physical or water damage from sliding debris. During the initial response, the borough focused its response on infrastructure projects that would be paid for or reimbursed by Federal Emergency Management Agency, while other organizations focused on individual homeowners, said Harriet Brouillette, tribal administrator for the Chilkoot Indian Association. Organizations had to scramble to help out individual homeowners while the borough government focused on different projects.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Michael Sullivan, a law enforcement official overseeing police reform in Baltimore, has been tapped to lead the Phoenix Police Department, which has been the subject of a wide-ranging civil rights investigation. Sullivan, the deputy commissioner of compliance in Baltimore, will join the Phoenix agency in September as interim chief. He’s expected to serve up to two years while the city – the fifth-largest in the U.S. – searches for a permanent chief. The U.S. Department of Justice is looking into whether officers in Phoenix have used excessive force, abused people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness, engaged in discriminatory policing practices and retaliated against people exercising free speech, which is protected under the First Amendment. The investigation began last August. Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams announced in May that she’s retiring after a 33-year career in law enforcement, including six as chief. She’s expected to help Sullivan transition into the job.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Supporters of a recreational marijuana initiative have turned in the required number of valid signatures, moving the measure closer to appearing on Arkansas’ ballot this fall, election officials said. A spokesman for the secretary of state’s office said supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment had reached the 89,151 valid signatures from registered voters needed to qualify for the November ballot. The proposal’s name and ballot title still must be approved by the state Board of Election Commissioners to qualify for the ballot. The board is expected to review the measure Wednesday. More than 192,000 signatures were submitted July 8 for the proposal to allow people age 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of cannabis. Arkansas voters in 2016 voted to legalize medical marijuana in the state. The secretary of state’s office did not have a final count on the number of valid signatures verified yet.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Bay Area Rapid Transit system is again requiring masks for travelers and employees. BART’s board of directors voted to immediately reinstate the mask mandate on all trains and in stations beyond ticket gates. It runs through Oct. 1 unless it’s extended again. The previous mask mandate started in April and ended on July 18. For 10 days, masking was optional but highly encouraged. BART serves commuters in San Francisco, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties. The board’s vote came hours after Los Angeles County public health officials dropped a plan to impose a universal indoor mask mandate last week as COVID-19 infections and rates of hospitalizations have stabilized. San Francisco and Los Angeles counties are at the “high” level of community transmission set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nColorado\n\nKeystone: The U.S. Forest Service has stopped construction of a ski resort expansion after contractors mistakenly demolished protected alpine tundra for a temporary road. Officials raised their concern after seeing crews carving the new path into the protected land, beyond the area that the Forest Service and resort had initially agreed upon, The Colorado Sun reported. “We were surprised and disappointed to see this for sure,” said Scott Fitzwilliams, the supervisor of the White River National Forest for the U.S. Forest Service, adding the mistake “is not a catastrophic ecological event.” The federal agency issued a cease-and-desist letter in early July, suspending development of Keystone resort’s 555-acre expansion until the environmental impacts of the unauthorized road are measured. That could delay the opening of the the resort’s 16-trail expansion this winter, one of the largest capital investment plans in the resort industry. The company has since hired a restoration firm to help mitigate and repair the damage.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state plans to install equipment designed to help prevent drivers from going the wrong way down the state’s highways after nearly a dozen wrong-way crashes led to 20 deaths this year. The effort came as transportation officials nationwide struggle to curtail a surge in fatalities on U.S. roads that began during the coronavirus pandemic. Connecticut’s $20 million planned program would install cameras on wrong-way signs across the state that will trigger flashing lights when a wrong-way driver is detected. There have been 11 fatal wrong-way accidents this year in the state, resulting in 20 deaths, according to statistics from the the Connecticut Transportation Institute at the University of Connecticut. That’s up from three fatal wrong-way crashes in 2020 and four in 2021, according to the Institute. The latest fatal crash occurred Sunday in Bridgeport. A van traveling the wrong way on Route 8 struck a car carrying a mother and her two children, police said. The mother was killed along with a passenger in the van. Officials said about 80% of the accidents involved drivers impaired by alcohol or other substances.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Former mortgage lender Trident Mortgage Company, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, must provide mortgage subsidies of up to $10,000 to homeowners in minority neighborhoods after claims of redlining, the Delaware Department of Justice said. The company continues to deny any wrongdoing amid the $20 million multistate settlement. Redlining, the practice of denying services to residents in minority neighborhoods, is prohibited by the Delaware Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act. “Redlining is one of the modern era’s most damaging and insidious forms of racism,” Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said in a written statement. “Few practices have done more to enforce de facto segregation in our communities.” Jennings worked with officials in New Jersey and Pennsylvania to reach Wednesday’s settlement. Although Trident was based in Devon, Pennsylvania, until its closure in December 2020, its services reached into nearby counties and states, including New Castle County. Its affiliate company Fox & Roach Realtors – which the Delaware DOJ said shared many customers with Trident – still operates in Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A mother on unemployment benefits said she has been left without weekly payments for four weeks after a breach in her D.C. Department of Employment Services account, WUSA-TV reported. Christina Paul said she first noticed something was wrong when she was unable to access her account June 8. After contacting the agency, she was informed her payment method had been changed from a debit card to a direct deposit, and her email had been changed. Since then, Paul said her account has been changed at least five times with new bank accounts and emails she does recognize. She has reported the incident to DC Police, but for the past month she has not received any payments leaving her out $1,6000. Paul said representatives from the agency told her the agency;s system had been breached. She said she was also told by the agency that her funds could not be distributed until the office recuperated the money. D.C.’s Department of Employment Services denied the security issue is from a potential hacking. The agency said it continues to aggressively work to minimize opportunities for cybercriminals to be successful and to mitigate risks. It is asking anyone who believes their funds have been improperly issued in their name to contact their office at (877)- 372-8360.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Miami-Dade School Board rescinded a decision made last week that rejected new sex education textbooks for middle and high school students. The debate over the sex education materials in Miami took place as school districts and boards navigate a new landscape in Florida classrooms over what officials deem appropriate content. Miami-Dade County has the nation’s fourth-largest public school system, with 334,000 students. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed new laws this year that prevent teachers from talking about gender identity and sexual orientation to third graders and younger and limiting how race can be discussed. The board approved the textbooks after Chair Perla Tabares Hantman changed her mind last week, citing the district needs to follow state standards and curriculum requirements. Hantman added the books are online and content that is not age appropriate is not accessible. She clarified parents are also allowed to opt their children out from lessons on sex education, tasking school officials with making a strong effort to let parents know.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMcDonough: Gov. Brian Kemp is using federal COVID-19 relief money to give teachers another $125 to buy school supplies, months after issuing a similar stipend. Kemp, a Republican running for reelection, made the announcement Friday at Ola High School in Henry County before teachers preparing for school to start this week. He said he learned firsthand how much teachers can spend buying supplies, learning aids and decorations for their classroom when his daughter started teaching first grade last year in Oconee County. Although January’s $125 supplement went only to teachers and paraprofessional teacher aides, state education officials said the new supplement will include others who provide instructional support on a daily basis, including counselors, librarians, school nurses and speech language pathologists. The last supplement cost about $15.9 million, said Kemp spokesperson Katie Byrd. She said the total cost for this round of spending has yet to be completed. Teachers and others will get allocations in an online platform that they can use to order supplies. The money comes from federal COVID-19 aid that Kemp can give to schools. Georgia got two rounds of funding for public schools totaling $173 million that has been spent, plus $79 million in money for emergency aid to private schools. Kemp spokesperson Katie Byrd said that because of federal requirements for spending the money, Georgia has $59.7 million left over in the nonpublic school account. She said federal education officials are letting states spend that money on public schools at Kemp’s discretion. The school supply grants are the first spending announced from those funds.\n\nHawaii\n\nMaui: Fire crews and helicopters were fighting a wildfire Saturday night on Maui near Paia Bay. The Maui County Emergency Management Agency said roads have been closed and have advised residents and travelers to avoid the area. It is unknown how many acres have burned. A red-flag warning was in effect Sunday.\n\nIdaho\n\nSalmon: The Moose Fire in the Salmon-Challis National Forest has burned on more than 75 square miles in timbered land near the town of Salmon. It was 21% contained by Sunday morning. Pila Malolo, planning operations section chief on the fire, said in a Facebook video update that hot, dry conditions were expected to persist Sunday. Officials said they expected fire growth in steep, rugged country on the fire’s south side.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Google is moving into the Thompson Center, the iconic state building in downtown Chicago, officials said. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state is selling the building to a developer for $30 million in cash and also getting another downtown building valued at $75 million. Google, which has more than 1,800 employees in Chicago, said it will control the building after a major renovation and occupy it by 2026. The Thompson Center, a hulking all-glass building designed by Helmut Jahn, opened in 1985 as the State of Illinois Center. It was renamed in 1993 for James “Big Jim” Thompson, who served as governor from 1977-91. JRTC Holdings LLC will renovate the Thompson Center to meet Google’s needs. The state, meanwhile, will move nearly 1,800 employees from the Thompson Center and other downtown office space to the newly acquired building on South LaSalle Street.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State senators narrowly passed a near-total abortion ban Saturday during a rare weekend session, sending the bill to the House after a contentious week of arguments over whether to allow exceptions for rape and incest. The Republican-controlled Senate voted 26-20 after about 3 hours of debate, passing the bill with the minimum 26 votes needed to send it to the House, which Republicans also control. The bill would prohibit abortions from the time a fertilized egg implants in a uterus. Exceptions would be allowed in cases of rape and incest, but a patient seeking an abortion for either reason would have to sign a notarized affidavit attesting to the attack. Indiana is one of the first Republican-controlled states to debate tighter abortion laws since the U.S. Supreme Court last month overturned Roe v. Wade. But the GOP splintered after the rape and incest exceptions remained in the bill Thursday, when an amendment failed that would have stripped out those exceptions. Ten Republican senators voted against the legislation Saturday, including a handful who support abortion rights. House Speaker Todd Huston on Friday declined to discuss specifics of the Senate bill. But he said he supports the rape and incest exceptions.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: Dubuque County Conservation has been making steady progress in developing its canoeing and kayaking infrastructure, with the intended destination of a countywide water trail in the coming years. The development of kayaking opportunities was identified as a top priority through public input gathered during the department’s long-term strategic planning process in 2020. In response, Dubuque County funded a recently completed project at Bowstring Wildlife Area to create better water access for paddlers and further the county’s water quality improvement goals. The conservation department recently finished a streambank stabilization project in the wildlife area along Lytle Creek, a project that included seeding the banks with prairie grasses. Workers installed a crossing on the creek so conservation staff can maintain the prairie, but it also will serve as a kayak launch point. Dubuque County will be the second area county to finish a water trail plan. Delaware County officials previously developed one for the Maquoketa River, which helped lead to the development of Manchester Whitewater Park.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A law allowing deadly force against an attacker doesn’t protect people from prosecution if a bystander is injured, the state’s highest court ruled. The Kansas Supreme Court ruled in the case of a Wichita police officer whose shots at a charging dog wounded a 9-year-old girl. The justices ordered a trial in Sedgwick County District Court for former Officer Dexter Betts on a charge of felony reckless aggravated battery. The December 2017 shooting happened after Betts and other officers responded to a call about domestic violence and a suicide threat at a Wichita home. Once inside, the dog charged at Betts, and he fired twice. His shots missed and hit the floor, and bullet fragments hit the girl above an eye and on a toe, according to the court’s decision. Betts argued he acted in self defense. A judge dismissed the case before trial, and the Kansas Court of Appeals upheld that decision. But Supreme Court Justice Dan Biles, writing for a unanimous state Supreme Court, said Kansas law grants immunity from prosecution for force used specifically against an attacker and doesn’t mention bystanders. Jess Hoeme, Betts’ attorney, said he believes Betts will be acquitted at trial, but expressed concern that the ruling could hinder law enforcement and endanger officers. Hoeme said the ruling is “unfortunate” because Betts didn’t intend to hurt any person while shooting and the bullets fragmented. But prosecutors have argued that Betts acted recklessly in shooting at the dog with the girl nearby. A conviction on a reckless aggravated battery charge for a first-time offender carries a presumed sentence of 18 months’ probation.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Jefferson County Public Schools offered to continue providing adult education services until June 30, 2023, a spokesperson for Kentucky’s Education and Workforce Development Cabinet said. “At that time, JCPS will review the success of their adult education services against federal performance indicators and state achievement goals to determine if they will seek renewal for the remaining two years of the original contract,” spokesperson Rosalind Harvey said. Kentucky’s largest school district previously told state officials it would be cutting a three-year contract to provide adult education in Louisville short, ending the program in December and shifting the responsibility of the program to another entity. The move blindsided those working in the adult education program, many of whom began contacting school board members and reporters to protest the change. Although district officials signaled the decision was final, school board chairwoman Diane Porter said the decision to end district control of the program rests with the board.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBelle Chasse: The state has completed one of its largest coastal restoration projects yet, and is at work on even larger ones. The dredge used to suck up sediment from the Gulf of Mexico to add 1,000 acres of habitat to sites in the Terrebonne Basin is now at work in the Mississippi River, doing the same for a 1,600-acre project that’s further east and named for a historic Plaquemines Parish outlet called Spanish Pass, officials said last week. “These are key examples of our front-line defense” against hurricanes, said Bren Haase, executive director of the state Coastal Preservation and Restoration Authority. They had been eaten away by erosion and subsidence – and by sea level rise. On Tuesday, the authority announced completion of another project – the addition of about 256 acres of beach and dune and 143 acres of marsh on West Grand Terre Island. Barrier islands and marshes slow storm surge, so the work protects people and buildings on shore while providing a habitat for plants and animals. The Spanish Pass project starts just outside the Plaquemines Parish town of Venice. The fragility of the wetlands fringing Louisiana’s coast was illustrated less than a minute by seaplane from the project’s west end. In that spot, trees grow in parallel lines on relatively high ground in open water. They mark the banks of canals dredged through marshes that no longer exist.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Vessels off the East Coast must slow more often to help save North Atlantic right whales from extinction, the federal government said. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made the announcement via new proposed rules designed to prevent ships colliding with the whales. Vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear are the largest threats to the giant mammals, which number less than 340 and are falling in population. Efforts to save the whales have long focused on fishing gear, especially that used by East Coast lobster fishermen. The proposed vessel speed rules signal the government wants the shipping industry to take more responsibility. The new rules would expand seasonal slow zones off the East Coast that require mariners to slow to 10 knots. They would also require more vessels to comply with the rules by expanding the size classes that must slow. The rules also stated the NOAA would create a framework to implement mandatory speed restrictions when whales are known to be present outside the seasonal slow zones.\n\nMaryland\n\nEmmitsburg: A 26-foot statue of the Virgin Mary is back in place at a Catholic university in Maryland. The Frederick News-Post reported the statue has been put back in place atop a 78-foot pedestal at the National Shrine Grotto on the campus of Mount St. Mary’s University in Emmitsburg after a year of restoration work. That work continues even as the statue is back in place, surrounded by scaffolding. Workers are now in the process of layering gold leaf to statue’s exterior. The university has raised $400,000 to support the restoration; about $450,000 more is needed. The statue is expected to be completed next month, with a formal ceremony planned for October. The grotto draws about 300,000 visitors a year; it is a replica of the grotto in Lourdes, France, that draws pilgrims to a site where believers said the Virgin Mary appeared in the 19th century.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker sent back to lawmakers on Friday a bill mandating some of the steps the state needs to take to meet a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In a letter to lawmakers, the Republican governor said he agreed with much in the bill but suggested some changes. Although the bill encourages the development of offshore wind, which Baker supports, he said the state needs to look to other sources of what he described as clean energy to meet its emissions goals. To do that, Baker said he is again asking lawmakers to put $750 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds into a clean energy investment fund. Baker also said the legislation needs to do more to ensue improvements to energy transmission systems. The state House approved the bill on a 143-9 vote. The Senate then voted 38-2 in favor of the bill before sending it to Baker last week.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Detroit Health Department is offering vaccines to residents who have been exposed to the monkeypox virus or suspect they have been exposed. The department said it is offering the Jynneos vaccine at its office from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and at the Wayne HIV/STI Clinic from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and on the first and third Saturdays of the month from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The vaccines will be provided to prevent development of the virus in people who have been exposed to it and to people with risk behaviors in places, events or venues with known transmission of the virus over the previous two weeks, the department said. Ten of Michigan’s known 37 cases of the virus have been seen in Detroit, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen said he supports abortions for victims of rape and incest, altering his stance from previous comments he described as clumsy. Jensen told Minnesota Public Radio in May he didn’t support exceptions for rape and incest unless the life of the mother was in danger. He said in a video released Friday that if he had been unclear previously, he wanted to set the record straight. “I never thought it necessary to try and identify what those exceptions might be in regards to legal abortion or not because I always thought when I uphold the pregnant woman’s life, and if her mental and physical health is in danger or jeopardized, that’s all that needs to be said,” Jensen said. Minnesota Democratic Party Chairman Ken Martin said Jensen is trying to walk back previous comments and believed if elected, the Watertown family physician would attempt to pass an abortion law without rape and incest exceptions, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has seized control of a Mississippi jail after citing “severely deficient” conditions at the facility. In a Friday ruling, U.S. Southern District of Mississippi Judge Carlton Reeves placed Hinds County’s Raymond Detention Center into receivership. The judge will soon appoint an expert, known as a “receiver,” to temporarily manage the facility in hopes of improving its conditions. “After ample time and opportunity, regretfully, it is clear that the county is incapable, or unwilling, to handle its affairs,” the judge wrote. “Additional intervention is required. It is time to appoint a receiver.” Reeves said deficiencies in supervision and staffing lead to “a stunning array of assaults, as well as deaths.” Seven individuals died last year while detained at the jail, he said. County officials said they’re still digesting the order and are determining whether they will appeal, WLBT-TV reported. Reeves’ decision came months after he agreed to scale back the county’s jail 2016 consent decree with the federal government to address “unconstitutional conditions” at Raymond and two other facilities that comprise the Hinds County jail system.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:Families started lining up outside the Springfield Expo Center an hour before the Back To School Bash was scheduled to open Saturday. The event offered free backpacks, hygiene kits, immunizations, and physicals plus fun activities, including bounce houses, esports, games and robotics. At the event, the first of its kind for the district, Convoy of Hope passed out bags of groceries to families to celebrate having served more than 200 million people since it was founded in 1994. To get parents and children out of the rain faster, Springfield Public Schools opened doors 30 minutes early. “This is the first time we have planned a back-to-school event on this scale,” said Springfield Public Schools Superintendent Grenita Lathan. “We want families to come, enjoy themselves and have the opportunity to access resources that will help them be ready for the first day of school.” The new school year starts Aug. 22.\n\nMontana\n\nElmo: A blaze sparked in grasslands in northwest Montana, grew to more than 11 square miles after advancing into forest. A portion of Highway 28 between Hot Springs and Elmo was closed because of the thick smoke, according to the Montana Department of Transportation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific will spend more than $1 billion to upgrade 600 of its old diesel locomotives over the next three years and make them more efficient, but regulators still want it to do more to cut pollution from its engines. The move will accelerate the pace of upgrades the company planned to make and help the Omaha-based railroad cut roughly 210,000 tons of carbon emissions each year – the equivalent of taking 45,000 cars off the road. The railroad will go from modernizing 120 locomotives this year to modernizing 200 a year in each of the next three years. “It’s really taking the older locomotive fleet and applying the latest and greatest to get one of the most fuel efficient locomotives we can have,” said Grace Olsen, who oversees locomotive engineering for Union Pacific. The railroad estimated this program will improve the fuel efficiency of long-haul locomotives by up to 18% and help them produce peak power more reliably. To accomplish that, locomotive manufacturer Wabtec will strip down the locomotives, and spend eight weeks overhauling their engines and installing new software and electronic controls. The improved power will let Union Pacific pull the same amount of freight with fewer locomotives.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Intense thunderstorms drenched parts of the city, causing water to cascade from casino ceilings and pool on the carpet of a stadium-sized sports betting area. Although only three-tenths of an inch of rain was registered at Las Vegas’ airport late Thursday, more than an inch fell just a mile away at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Nearby wind gusts peaked at 71 mph and toppled trees. Pea-sized hail fell from lightning-streaked skies in suburban Henderson, where almost an inch of rain fell in some areas. Police, county and city officials and the National Weather Service said no injuries or widespread damage was reported. Casino patrons posted videos of water pouring from ceilings at Caesars Palace and Planet Hollywood resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and from behind a huge video display at the downtown Circa hotel-casino sports book. One video showed a man continuing to gamble at a casino slot machine while water fell around him.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Members of a rescue group carried the body of a hiker nearly a mile in freezing temperatures and high winds after the man died on the Northeast’s highest mountain, authorities said. A group of hikers found the man unconscious and not breathing on Mount Washington’s Jewell Trail on Saturday afternoon, the New Hampshire Department of Fish and Game said. They called 911 and started performing CPR. Members of one rescue group drove to the summit of the nearly 6,300-foot mountain and hiked down to the man, while another group rode up the mountain’s famous Cog Railway and hiked in. With no sign of life after 40 minutes, resuscitation efforts ceased, and rescue group members carried the body nearly a mile to the train. A dog the man was hiking with was taken to an animal shelter until it can be reunited with the man’s family.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gas prices posted another double-digit drop in New Jersey amid low demand. AAA Mid-Atlantic said the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $4.41, down 10 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.18 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $4.25, down 16 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.16 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nShiprock: Samuel Sandoval, one of the last remaining Navajo Code Talkers who transmitted messages in World War II using a code based on their native language, has died. Sandoval died late Friday at a hospital in Shiprock, his wife, Malula, told The Associated Press on Saturday. He was 98. Hundreds of Navajos were recruited from the vast Navajo Nation to serve as Code Talkers with the U.S. Marine Corps. Only three are still alive today: Peter MacDonald, John Kinsel Sr. and Thomas H. Begay. The Code Talkers took part in every assault the Marines conducted in the Pacific, sending thousands of messages without error on Japanese troop movements, battlefield tactics and other communications crucial to the war’s outcome. The code, based on the then-unwritten Navajo language, confounded Japanese military cryptologists and is credited with helping the U.S. win the war. Sandoval was on Okinawa when he got word from another Navajo Code Talker the Japanese had surrendered and relayed the message to higher-ups. The Navajo men are celebrated annually on Aug. 14. Samuel Sandoval was looking forward to that date and seeing a museum built near the Navajo Nation capital of Window Rock, Arizona, to honor the Code Talkers, his wife said.\n\nNew York\n\nBabylon: Shark sightings have become more common along Long Island’s shores this summer – and not just the mostly harmless, abundant dogfish. Since June, there have been at least five verified encounters where sharks bit swimmers and surfers. Although there were no fatalities, sightings prompted officials to temporarily close some beaches to swimming, from New York City’s Rockaway Beach to Long Island’s Smith Point County Park, where a surfer beat a shark on its snout after it bit his calf. George Gorman, regional director for the state park system on Long Island, referred to the recent shark interactions as “extraordinarily unusual.” Sharks aren’t new to New York’s waters. Sand tiger, sandbar and dusky sharks are some of the more common species found near shore. But in the last century or so, New York state had documented only 13 shark attacks. Experts said sharks aren’t setting out to dine on people, but instead are chasing bunker fish near beaches. Recent shark bites are likely mistakes, Gorman said. Swimmers might also be interacting with sharks while they are feeding.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court has agreed to accelerate arguments on further challenges to the boundaries for the state’s legislative seats and congressional districts. By a 4-3 ruling, the justices granted a request by Common Cause to accelerate the redistricting proceedings before them. The group is fighting the state House and Senate maps approved by the General Assembly in February. Oral arguments will be held in early or mid-October, according to Thursday’s order signed by Senior Associate Justice Robin Hudson. The order said specifically the court didn’t address a recent request by Republican legislators to end its appeal of the congressional district boundaries, which a state trial court drew and adopted for use this year only. But the order said expediting all redistricting appeals was based on “the great public interest in the subject matter of this case, the importance of the issues to the constitutional jurisprudence of this state, and the need to reach a final resolution on the merits at the earliest possible opportunity.” It’s too late for any decision after those oral arguments to alter the district lines for this year’s elections, which are happening under the challenged maps. Any ruling could clarify further how partisan bias is avoided in map making and force the Legislature to redraw new General Assembly maps that would be used for the remainder of the decade. A new congressional map for the 2024 elections already will be needed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: International Music Camp founder Merton Utgaard will receive North Dakota’s highest honor, Gov. Doug Burgum said. Utgaard, who died in 1998 at age 84, is the 47th recipient of the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A ceremony will be scheduled at a later date. Utgaard, a native of Maddock, founded the music camp in 1956 at the International Peace Garden that sits astride the North Dakota and Canadian border, north of Dunseith. He served as director for 28 years. At the time of his death, more than 90,000 students from more than 60 countries had attended the summer camp. Utgaard was a teacher and director of bands at the University of Minnesota, the University of South Dakota, Ball State University, Northern Illinois University and the University of Manitoba-Brandon before he began to work full time on the International Music Camp in the mid-1960s. Utgaard’s portrait will hang in the North Dakota Capitol with those of the other 46 people who have received the award, established by Gov. William Guy in 1961.\n\nOhio\n\nAthens:Ohio University is reinstating its indoor mask mandate starting Monday. The mask mandate is going into effect because Athens County is listed as having a high level of transmission on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest COVID-19 data tracker, according to the university’s website. Ohio University is the first public university in the state to reinstate a mask mandate after colleges and universities shed their mandates in the spring. OU’s classes begin Aug. 22. The university’s mask mandate will drop when the level of COVID-19 transmission in Athens County goes down to medium. Masks will be recommended during scheduled class and class-related activities when the level of transmission is medium. Masks will be optional when the level of COVID-19 transmission is low in Athens County. Ohio State University is not requiring masks, university spokesman Ben Johnson said in an email.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Contraband including weapons, cellphones, drones and grappling hooks believed to be headed to state prisons was seized at a warehouse in Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections said Friday. The department’s Office of Inspector General learned of the contraband and raided the warehouse on July 15, with Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics agents, according to a news release from Corrections Department spokesperson Josh Ward. Justin Brown, another spokesperson for the department, said few other details could be released because it involves an ongoing investigation into contraband being smuggled into prisons. Seized items included 31 cellphones, which have been used to run drug rings from prisons and to coordinate inmate violence, such as fights in 2019 at several state prisons that left one inmate dead and dozens injured. Ammunition, drugs, tobacco and $8,500 in counterfeit $100 bills were also seized. The grappling hooks were intended to retrieve the contraband, the Oklahoma Corrections Department said. Drones have been used to deliver contraband into prisons nationwide, including federal prisons, leading to charges this month in Beaumont, Texas. No arrests were announced, but Inspector General Ted Woodhead said charges are expected against “numerous individuals” at the end of what he said is an ongoing investigation into the contraband.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: New state rules require access to water, shade and breaks on hot days, but workers said they’re still laboring in unsafe conditions. Skyler Fischer, a forklift driver at a Fred Meyer distribution center in the town of Clackamas, has been working there for 12 years and works at least four days a week, 10 to 12 hours each day. Fischer said he gets two 15-minute breaks each shift. In May, the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division adopted permanent rules to protect workers laboring in excessive heat or wildfire smoke. They are some of the nation’s strongest protections for employees working outdoors or in workplaces without air conditioning. But last week, with daily highs consistently hitting triple-digits, Oregon OSHA’s recently implemented heat rules were put to the test. Some Oregonians have said they’re still laboring in unsafe conditions despite the new heat rules. The rules went into effect last month and apply when temperatures in a work environment reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit. They require employers to provide access to shaded areas, cool drinking water, and additional rest breaks to cool down and acclimate to the heat. The rule also requires employers to provide heat illness prevention training. Aaron Corvin, Oregon OSHA’s public information officer, said the agency has opened an inspection related to the Fred Meyer facility. A statement from Fred Meyer said the company has installed a mechanical cooling station at its 1-million-square-foot warehouse in Clackamas. On days with high temperatures, the company provides employees with access to water bottles on ice, water fountains, frozen treats and cooling towels. A distribution team also takes daily temperatures throughout the facility and said this week temperatures have not exceeded 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the statement said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A fast-moving fire damaged Jim’s Steaks on South Street, one of Philadelphia’s best-known cheesesteak shops, early Friday, but authorities said no injuries were reported. Dozens of firefighters and other emergency responders went to Jim’s Steaks when the fire was reported about 9:30 a.m. Smoke could be seen pouring from the building, but officials said all the employees were able to safely evacuate the structure. It wasn’t immediately known how many people were in the building when the fire broke out. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Jim’s Steaks opened its original location in Philadelphia in 1939. The South Street location opened in 1976.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: Law enforcement handed out more than a dozen citations for boating violations Saturday during an annual party on the water that has become known as “Aquapalooza.” Two boats sank. At least two boat operators were cited for “boating under the influence.” Two other revelers were taken away for emergency medical treatment, including one with a leg injury from a moving propeller. Harbormaster Bruce Celico said this year’s event was the largest yet, drawing more than 1,000 boats and Jet Skis.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Three horses have tested positive for equine infectious anemia, a blood-borne, potentially deadly illness, the Clemson University Public Service and Agriculture unit reported Friday. The first case was in a quarter horse in Berkeley County. The other two quarter-horse cases are in Barnwell County, state Veterinarian Michael Neault said in a news release. These are the first cases of the illness in South Carolina since 2014, when a donkey tested positive in Aiken County, Neault said. The virus that causes EIA is often transmitted by bloodsucking insects such as biting flies but also can be introduced by infected needles or other medical, dental or tattoo equipment. The illness does not affect humans but is potentially deadly to horses and other equine species, Neault said. The infected horse in Berkeley County has been euthanized. Clemson University’s Livestock Poultry Health regulatory agency, which Neault also directs, is discussing options with the owners of the two affected horses in Barnwell County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Oglala Sioux Tribe is suing the federal government for failing to provide adequate law enforcement on the Pine Ridge Reservation. The lawsuit filed last week against the Bureau of Indian Affairs and some high-level officials in the Interior Department alleged the inadequacy has created a “public safety crisis” on the reservation. Tribal officials said Pine Ridge, with its 3 million acres of land, has just 33 police officers and eight criminal investigators who handled more than 133,700 emergency calls last year. And, that there were six to eight officers on any given shift. The complaint uses Rapid City as a comparison with its 176 police officers who handled nearly 115,000 emergency calls in 2021, the Argus Leader reported. The tribe said the Bureau of Indian Affairs is out of compliance with its standards of having 2.8 officers per 1,000 people. For Pine Ridge, that would require at least 140 tribal officers. Court documents said officers are working an average of 80 hours of overtime on top of their 160 scheduled hours and do not have adequate backup when needed for emergency calls.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Six people have applied to replace Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery, who won’t be seeking another term. The Tennessee Supreme Court announced Don Cochran, Jerome Cochran, Michael Dunavant, R. Culver Schmid, Jonathan Skrmetti and Bill Young submitted applications for the opening by Friday’s deadline. Tennessee is the only state in which the attorney general is appointed by the Supreme Court. The position runs in eight-year terms. The new term begins Sept. 1. The court’s justices selected Slatery in 2014 after he previously served as former Republican Gov. Bill Haslam’s chief legal counsel. Interviews will be held on Aug. 8 and 9 at the Tennessee Supreme Court building in Nashville. They will also be livestreamed at www.youtube.com/user/TNCourts/featured.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Sunlight magnified by glass bottles in an open garbage can ignited paper trash, starting a 500-acre wildfire in north Texas that destroyed five homes, fire officials said. The July 18 fire on Possum Kingdom Lake’s western shore, about 70 miles west of Fort Worth, took eight days to fully contain. Chief Bonnie Watkins of the Possum Kingdom West Side Volunteer Fire Department found a trash can packed with party trash that included paper goods, food and numerous glass bottles, according to a department statement. Watkins concluded a wind gust opened the can lid, allowing sunlight magnified by the glass bottles to ignite the paper. The fire built rapidly until the fire spilled from the can and spread to nearby cedar trees, the statement said. Rich Johnson, a spokesman for the Insurance Council of Texas, a nonprofit insurance industry association, said he had never heard of such a freakish cause for a wildfire.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Three people, including a juvenile, have been arrested over an alleged vandalism spree at church buildings across the city owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Police found reports of broken windows at 14 churches across Washington County spanning multiple dates, according to arresting documents filed in 5th District Court. The first incident was reported to police on July 18. All of the damage was done at churches owned by the Latter-day Saints, which make up Utah's predominant religious denomination. The estimated cost of the damage done was $5,000. Two of the three individuals, one adult and one juvenile, reportedly admitted to their involvement, according to police. The adult is Nathan Monroy, 18, who was arrested and placed in the Purgatory Correctional Facility on a second-degree felony charge of criminal mischief. The juvenile was also arrested and placed in the Dixie Area Detention. Another adult, Zachary Steele, 18, was arrested later by Washington City officers and faces the same charge.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy on Friday was discharged from a rehabilitation center following his second surgery to help repair a broken hip, his office said. Leahy, 82, fell and broke his hip last month in his Virginia home. He underwent hip-replacement surgery June 30 at a Washington-area hospital. He was then moved to a rehabilitation center. An additional operation was done July 20. He and his wife, Marcelle, returned to the home Friday. Leahy plans to return to the Senate this week. On his way home, he went to the Capitol to sign a newly passed bill that would boost the semiconductor industry and scientific research. As President Pro Tempore of the Senate, his signature is required, along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s, before the bill can be sent to President Joe Biden. Leahy, the longest serving member of the U.S. Senate, is not seeking reelection in November. When Leahy’s current term expires in January 2023, he will have served for 48 years in the Senate.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Colette McEachin said she won’t file criminal charges against police officers who deployed tear gas on demonstrators gathered at the city’s Robert E. Lee statue in 2020 to protest police violence. McEachin said confused police radio communications led officers to use tear gas on a peaceful group of protestors who gathered at the statue on June 1, 2020, in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. She said her review showed that police commanders authorized tear gas to be used at the nearby J.E.B. Stuart monument, where a smaller group of protesters was trying to topple the statue. She said radio transmissions simply referred to “the monument,” and officers at the Lee monument wrongly believed the use of tear gas had been authorized there. Richmond Police quickly apologized for the use of tear gas at the Lee statue and said it was unwarranted. A few days later, the city’s police chief resigned.\n\nWashington\n\nSedro-Wolley: A woman was arrested after she allegedly left her family’s dog on a balcony without water or shade during dangerous high temperatures, resulting in the dog’s death. A police animal control officer responded to calls from concerned neighbors and found the 5-year-old dog named Enzo in “severe distress.” He displayed symptoms including seizing and foaming at the mouth. The officer took life-saving measures, moving the dog inside and trying to cool him down, but Enzo died, KING5 reported. His body was taken to an emergency medical facility where its internal temperature was at least 107 degrees – the maximum temperature the vet’s thermometer could detect, according to court documents. The dog’s water bowl was empty and there were signs he had pawed at the sliding door. In addition, neighbors and nearby workers reportedly heard a dog in distress. Temperatures in Sedro-Wolley reached nearly 90 degrees on Tuesday and officers measured one surface of the balcony at 131 degrees with an infrared heat camera, according to court documents. The woman told police she had been preparing for her son’s birthday and did not check the water bowl or consider the temperature on the deck, though she told police she was aware of the forecast for the day, court documents said. The woman was charged with first-degree animal cruelty and released on her own recognizance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Wheeling attorney Elgine McArdle was elected chair of the West Virginia Republican Party. McArdle was chosen during a meeting of the state GOP executive committee in Charleston. McArdle has been a member of the committee since 2005. She succeeds Mark Harris, who chose not to seek a full four-year term after he was picked in March 2021 to serve the remainder of former chair Melody Potter’s term. McArdle also spent five years as an assistant federal prosecutor for the state’s northern district.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Investigators said two Dane County deputies investigating a case of road rage were injured when an alleged drunken driver crashed into their squad cars late Friday. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, the Dane County Sheriff’s Office said. The incident happened in the town of Springfield, where authorities said a person was shot and injured in a dispute near the intersection of two highways. The suspect in that incident fled the scene and was later arrested. The person who was shot is expected to survive. The deputies who responded to the scene were standing outside of their cars when the drunken-driving suspect crashed into their vehicles. They were taken to a local hospital for treatment. The driver was arrested for operating while intoxicated causing injury.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming Secretary of State Ed Buchanan has been named by Gov. Mark Gordon a judge for the 8th Judicial District, serving Goshen County, his home county, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported. The newspaper reported Buchanan said he would not seek a second term after Judge Patrick W. Korrell announced his retirement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/31/tuskegee-monument-sugar-water-potato-problems-news-around-states/118486586/", "title": "Tuskegee monument, sugar water: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Alabama Shakespeare Festival, which began in a high school auditorium in 1972, is undergoing a $1.6million renovation in advance of its 50th season. Located in east Montgomery, the theater is upgrading an entrance lobby and enclosing an outdoor area. It also is adding restrooms, constructing a new gift shop and making other additions. While the theater received $1.18 million in federal pandemic aid as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, spokeswoman Layne Holley said the renovations will not use that money, and officials have yet to decide how to use the funding. Indoor shows are scheduled to resume Nov. 27 with a production of “Cinderella.” Executive director Todd Schmidt said the theater has survived the pandemic and made plans for a return in part because of strong community backing. “We had to reduce our staff and our overhead,” Schmidt said. “It’s been a tough time, but luckily we’ve had great support.” Initially staged at Anniston High School, the company relocated to Montgomery and is housed in a theater constructed in 1985.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Alaska Federation of Natives has postponed its annual convention because of a rise in COVID-19 cases in the state, officials said in a statement. The convention has traditionally been the largest gathering of Alaska Natives in the state. It had been scheduled for Oct. 21-23 but is now delayed until mid-December in Anchorage, the organization said in a statement. Organizers said they will continue planning for an in-person convention at the Dena’ina Convention Center in downtown Anchorage with a virtual option. However, the statement said the board will make a decision by mid-October on whether to maintain the in-person part. Organizers encouraged Alaskans to get vaccinated and wear masks so the convention can be held. One notable celebration this year will be the observation of the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The act was the largest land settlement in the nation’s history when President Richard Nixon signed it into law Dec. 18, 1971, and settled Indigenous land claims in Alaska. “Postponing until December provides us an opportunity to gather in person on the 50th anniversary of ANCSA, but it all hinges on everyone’s willingness and ability to get vaccinated,” said Sealaska chairman and Alaska Federation of Natives co-chair Joe Nelson.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A tribe that didn’t sign a revised gambling compact with the state earlier this year has filed a lawsuit alleging that a new law is unconstitutional and left some rural tribes in the cold by excluding them from negotiations hamming out the legislation. The suit filed by the Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe on Thursday asks the court to prevent the Department of Gaming from issuing sportsbook licenses and allowing sports betting. The lawsuit said the state presented the tribe with an amended compact “as a non-negotiable, ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ proposition.” The lawmaker who sponsored the gambling legislation defended it as fair and equitable. The legislation signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey last spring expands the types of gambling allowed at tribal casinos, lets tribes and pro sports teams take bets on sport evenings, and licenses six operators to sign up players for betting on fantasy virtual games. A judge scheduled an emergency hearing for next Friday on the suit.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge has scheduled the retrial of a former state senator on bribery and fraud charges for the first week of October. Court records, first reported by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, show U.S. District Judge Judge Price Marshall on Friday scheduled the trial for Gilbert Baker, a Republican former senator and one-time state GOP chairman, to begin Oct. 4. A federal jury earlier this month acquitted Baker of conspiracy in the case in which he allegedly conspired to bribe an ex-judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The jury, however, deadlocked on charges of bribery and wire fraud against Baker, and prosecutors on Thursday filed notice of their intent to retry those counts. Baker was accused of conspiring with former state Judge Michael Maggio, who admitted to accepting campaign donations from a nursing home operator, then reducing a judgment against that company by $4.2 million. Michael Morton, the nursing home operator, has not been charged with any crimes and has denied wrongdoing. Maggio was sentenced in 2015 to 10 years in prison.\n\nCalifornia\n\nBlythe: California farmers near the Arizona border with the oldest rights to Colorado River water will reap $38million over three years to not plant some of their fields and leave extra water in the rapidly declining Lake Mead reservoir. Located roughly halfway between Los Angeles and Phoenix, growers near the city of Blythe in Riverside County have first priority to the river water. They hold rights that stretch back to 1877, superseding 40 million customers in eight states who also depend on it. But with continued drought and overuse, a first-ever shortage in the river system was declared in recent weeks by federal authorities, triggering cuts to Arizona, Nevada and Mexico’s supplies next year. In response, farmers who control the Palo Verde Irrigation District voted unanimously this month to agree to cancel planting some of their crops for three years. They will be paid about $925 per acre this year via federal drought response funds and water ratepayers in Arizona, Nevada and Southern California, with 2% increases each year after that. Bart Fisher, a PVID trustee whose family owns the 11,500-acre Fisher Ranch, said he and others were acting not because they want the money but because they want to help others and try to guarantee continued water supply for all.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Colorado’s secretary of state filed a lawsuit Monday to remove a rural county’s election clerk who is accused of allowing a security breach of the county’s voting equipment that is currently being investigated by the FBI. The lawsuit filed in Mesa County district court by Secretary of State Jena Griswold seeks to formally remove Mesa County Clerk and Recorder Tina Peters as the designated election official. The suit also calls for the appointment of former Secretary of State Wayne Williams to replace Peters and Sheila Reiner, former Mesa county clerk and recorder, to serve as the elections supervisor for the county’s upcoming November elections. The Board of County Commissioners praised the changes in a statement Monday, saying Mesa County will have “arguably the most secure and transparent election system in the United States.” Peters has claimed that the investigation led by Griswold – who is a Democrat – is an attempt to take over one of the few remaining conservative counties in Colorado. Griswold said initial investigation findings show images of election management software used by the county’s elections equipment were obtained by conspiracy theorists and posted on far-right blogs. Griswold’s office also said it believes one of the images was taken from a secure room.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Schools around the state looking to upgrade aging ventilation systems to improve air quality and help fight the airborne spread of the coronavirus may find themselves short on funds, even with federal pandemic aid. The Connecticut Mirror reports a state policy restricts aid for heating, air conditioning and air quality control projects. The policy could be reviewed again by legislators, but likely not before the 2022 General Assembly session in February. “There are some districts that haven’t touched their schools in 40 years,” said Kostantinos Diamantis, the state’s budget director who also has overseen the state’s school construction program for the past six years. “The local level needs to belly up to the bar. The cities have an obligation to maintain those buildings.” Connecticut reimburses communities for between 10% and 71% of new construction and large renovation projects designed to last 20 years or longer, the Mirror reports. But the cost of smaller projects such as replacing or upgrading a heating and ventilation system must be absorbed by the town. For the town of Coventry, which wants to replace ventilators in its middle and high schools and make roof repairs, that would mean a bill of more than $2 million even after unused federal pandemic aid is applied.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: Preliminary necropsy results show that a young fin whale that beached itself and died at Cape Henlopen State Park last week was riddled with parasites. “There was a lot going on,” said Marine Education, Research and Rehabilitation Institute Executive Director Suzanne Thurman. Measured by MERR to be 57 feet long, the whale first showed up in Lewes on Thursday, stuck on a sandbar in the Harbor of Refuge. It was able to free itself when the tide came in, but a short time later it beached itself again on the oceanside of The Point. Around noon Aug. 27, after many onlookers had come to catch a glimpse of its tail flapping in the surf, and just moments after Virginia Aquarium representatives had arrived to provide palliative care and possible euthanasia, the whale stopped breathing, according to a MERR Facebook post. The whale had to be cut into several pieces to move it out of the water for necropsy.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Dozens of people marched to the White House on Sunday calling for support of Afghan women. Organized by the nonprofit Vital Voices Global Partnership, the group is calling on President Joe Biden and other U.S. leaders to prioritize the evacuation of women out of Afghanistan and to help permanently protect women’s rights inside the country following the crisis inside the country and the Taliban takeover, WUSA-TV reports. Protesters wore shirts and held signs emblazoned with “I stand with Afghan women” as they marched from the Vital Voices headquarters on 16th Street through Black Lives Matter Plaza and to Lafayette Square, eventually gathering in front of the White House. The deadline to evacuate U.S. citizens from Afghanistan is Tuesday. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said Sunday that for those U.S. citizens seeking immediately to leave Afghanistan by the looming deadline, “we have the capacity to have 300 Americans, which is roughly the number we think are remaining, come to the airport and get on planes in the time that is remaining.”\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Sugar growers are suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over proposed reservoir water levels they say will be far too low. The federal lawsuits filed last week by Florida Crystals’ Okeelanta Corp., U.S. Sugar and the Sugar Cane Growers Cooperative say the current Corps plan won’t supply enough water for their fields. “Farmers need a secure supply of water, and all farmers need certainty as we plan and manage our planting schedules and crop rotation,” said Jaime Vega, vice president of agriculture at Florida Crystals. Jacksonville Commander Col. Andrew Kelly defended the Corps’ work, saying the agency will balance water supply for both the environment and farmers. The project in question is the Everglades Agricultural Area reservoir intended to cleanse tainted water so more can flow south as crucially needed toward Everglades National Park and Florida Bay. In the lawsuits, Sugar Growers say the still-under-construction reservoir should be kept at higher water levels than what is currently envisioned in a Corps of Engineers plan. Everglades restoration advocates say the growers are simply putting their priorities ahead of others.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Atlanta Black Pride organizers say the annual celebration will happen Labor Day weekend as planned with some precautions to protect against the spread of COVID-19. The larger Atlanta Pride festival and parade planned for October were canceled Wednesday because of concerns about the pandemic. But leaders of Atlanta Black Pride, which celebrates the African American LGBTQ community, say they plan to go forward, with fewer indoor gatherings, while encouraging people to wear masks and maintain social distance. Amber Moore, COO and vice president of Atlanta Black Pride, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that COVID-19 vaccines and coronavirus testing will be offered. The celebration, marking its 25th anniversary this year, is to feature events around the city. In addition to parties, that includes a fashion show, a session on empowering women, an awards ceremony for the transgender community, a virtual film festival and a health expo. Vaughn Alvarez, who is helping to promote some of the events at Piedmont Park, told the newspaper that Atlanta rapper and radio host Da Brat and fiancee Jesseca “Judy” Dupart, CEO of Kaleidoscope Hair Products, will be honored for “bravery and courage with their love story.” The two star in “Brat loves Judy” on WE-TV.\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: A county affordable housing committee has voted to recommend approval of a rental project on Lanai, where no new affordable homes have been built in 30 years. The Hokuao 201H Housing Project, proposed by billionaire Larry Ellison’s company Pulama Lanai, includes the development of 150 two-bedroom rental homes on former pineapple fields. About half of the units will be market-rate priced. The project will be developed under the state’s fast-track approval process for affordable housing. The Maui County Council’s Affordable Housing Committee voted 8-0 to recommend giving the project the green light after multiple meetings packed with public testimony and hours of discussion over concern about the project’s number of market-rate homes, The Maui News reports. Council Chairwoman Alice Lee said the project is “desperately needed.” Pulama Lanai had sought an exemption for sidewalks in the future subdivision, saying including them would cost about $2 million. Sharon Thom, senior vice president of development and construction for Pulama Lanai, said the sidewalks would change the “look and feel” of Lanai City. But Committee Chairman Gabe Johnson argued to include sidewalks, saying the county needs to advocate for pedestrian safety and accessibility.\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: The hot, dry, smoky growing season has left some potato farmers bracing for a poor crop. Randy Hardy, of Oakley, told the Idaho State Journal that his harvest will likely be the worst of his career. Statewide, spud farmers conducting test digs or early harvests are uprooting plants supporting no tubers. Where there are potatoes, there are fewer than normal, and most of the tubers are undersized and misshapen. “I’ve never had this happen before, and I’ve got an agronomist who works with me on potatoes, and he’s been doing it for over 20 years, and he said he’s never seen a worse crop than this,” said Hardy, who raises spuds for the fresh market and is chairman of the board of Sun Valley Potatoes. Hardy isn’t scheduled to harvest until Sept. 20, and he’s hoping the extra time will allow his tubers to add a bit more bulk. United Potato Growers of Idaho asked growers to submit results from Aug. 1 test digs and will gather follow-up data in person during harvest. Hardy said the average number of tubers in the test digs was down 30% from last year. Weight was also down substantially, he said. Many fields lacked deep soil moisture when the potatoes were planted. Then the state was hit with record-high heat in June, contributing to fewer potatoes growing beneath each plant, and smoke-filled air from Western wildfires.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: From a waterpark resort to a public school, seven finalists have been named in a design competition to repurpose a much-maligned state government building downtown. State officials are trying to sell the James R. Thompson Center, which was designed by famed architect Helmet Jahn. They say the 17-story curved-glass structure that opened in 1985 is inefficient and requires hundreds of millions of dollars worth of repairs and updates to keep it running. The building houses offices for the governor and employees of state agencies, who are scheduled to move next year to another building on the city’s Near West Side. Illinois officials are seeking bids for a developer and have not committed to any preservation ideas. Officials have said they want to sell the building by February 2022. Architecture buffs have pushed for preservation, an effort that’s been renewed in the wake of Jahn’s death in May. The finalists were named last week. A group of design and preservation experts picked the finalists from 59 entries. A winner will be chosen Sept. 14.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A coalition of voting rights groups is sponsoring a contest for Hoosiers to draw new maps for congressional and legislative election districts. The group All IN for Democracy said the contest is aimed at finding “fair” proposed election maps to present to legislators before they vote in late September on the once-a-decade redistricting based on population shifts from the U.S. census. Voting rights activists have complained that the GOP-dominated Legislature isn’t involving the public enough in the redistricting work and that partisan gerrymandering has helped Indiana Republicans gain outsized power in state government. The organization is providing an online site where residents can compile maps based on the 2020 census data. Proposals submitted by Sept. 13 will be judged, with the winning map for Indiana’s nine congressional districts getting $1,000, with $2,000 for the best districts for the 50 Indiana Senate seats and $3,000 for the fairest map of the 100 Indiana House districts. The group said its judging will be based on how well the maps keep communities of interest together, maintain whole cities and counties in the same district, and maximize the number of politically competitive districts.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Black applicants are 2.6 times more likely to be denied a conventional home loan than similarly qualified white applicants in the Des Moines/West Des Moines metro, according to an analysis of 2019 data by The Markup, a nonprofit newsroom. Des Moines has the fifth-greatest likelihood of denial for Black applicants out of 71 U.S. metro areas that The Markup found had statistically significant disparities in home loan approvals. The newsroom found that nationally, mortgage lenders are 80% more likely to reject Black applicants; 70% more likely to deny Native American applicants; 50% more likely to turn down Asian/Pacific Islander applicants; and 40% more likely to reject Latino applicants. For its analysis, The Markup examined more than 2 million conventional mortgage applications, accounting for 17 independent variables, including debt-to-income ratio and combined loan-to-value ratio. It did not take into account credit scores, which are not publicly available through Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data. John Sorensen, president and CEO of the Iowa Bankers Association, said in a statement that while the organization “firmly believes that discrimination has no place in the mortgage market,” the data used by The Markup doesn’t give a full picture as to why these disparities exist.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of the biggest gun dealers in south-central Kansas is the city of Wichita, but it actually received less than half the proceeds from the sales because it works with several online companies to auction off the firearms. Since a new state law allowing the gun sales was passed in 2015, Wichita has sold 2,082 guns that were seized during crimes for which the criminal cases were complete. The city generated $196,000 on the gun sales that went into a fund that pays for miscellaneous police equipment. But The Wichita Eagle learned the city received less than half of the $425,000 in total sales generated because the companies that handle the sales take a significant chunk of the proceeds. The city contracts with Propertyroom.com, which sells the guns through a partnership with a major gun retailer that operates an online auction site. The city finance director said officials last took proposals for the gun contract two years ago and got no better offer. Sedgwick County Commissioner Jim Howell, who wrote the law, said it’s no different from police departments selling off other seized property, and any gun purchases require background checks. Former Rep. Jim Ward, who also used to work as a city prosecutor, said he knows it’s impossible to keep all the guns off the street, but he never wanted the government in the gun business.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: An instructional assistant at an eastern Kentucky elementary school died from COVID-19 as the fast-spreading delta variant has sparked coronavirus outbreaks in several school districts. Heather Antle, an aide at Lee County Elementary, died Sunday. Antle was an involved member of the school community who “brought great joy to the students and staff that she worked with,” Lee County Superintendent Sarah Wasson said in a statement posted to social media. The Lee County district canceled in-person classes until Sept. 7 in response to coronavirus cases among students and teachers. Virus outbreaks have caused disruptions since the school year began. Several other districts have shut down classes for multiple days due to outbreaks. Gov. Andy Beshear, while expressing condolences to Antle’s family, urged Kentuckians to get vaccinated and wear masks to prevent the virus’s spread in schools. “There was a time when some argued COVID did not spread in schools,” the governor said on social media. “That time should be over. ... We must do everything in our power to prevent the spread of this virus in our schools, and vaccinations and masks are our greatest tools. Let’s do what’s right for our teachers.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A couple who met in a gross anatomy class as Tulane University undergraduates have given Tulane Medical School $5 million for an endowed professorship. Drs. Philip and Cheryl Leone, of Naples, Florida, are now retired pathologists and current members of the School of Medicine Board of Governors, a university news release said Wednesday. Their endowment will support a medical school professor who will also hold a joint appointment in another school or unit and will focus on areas such as public health, immunology, parasitology or anthropology, the university said. The Leones have worked in both academia and private practice. “Tulane University has played a major role in our lives and the lives of our family members,” Phil Leone said. “Our son graduated from Tulane, and Cheryl’s siblings earned undergraduate and graduate degrees from the university.” “Endowing a Presidential Chair with an emphasis on interdisciplinary academic study allows us to contribute to the university in these challenging times,” Cheryl Leone said. “We hope our gift will strengthen the medical school and help train future physicians who can significantly advance the field of medicine.”\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: More than 125 boats participated in a weekend protest against plans for an aquaculture operation in waters near Acadia National Park. Commercial and recreational vessels comprised the “Save the Bay” flotilla that motored around Frenchman Bay on Sunday. Some people on land also participated by holding signs stating their opposition. American Aquafarms has proposed raising 66 million pounds of Atlantic salmon annually at a pair of 15-pen sites off the coast of Gouldsboro in Frenchman Bay. The company didn’t immediately return a telephone message. Ted O’Meara of Frenchman’s Bay United likened the scope of the project to ”some huge hog farm from the Midwest and plucking it right in the middle of one of the most beautiful parts of Maine.” He said that “our first goal is to stop this project, and our second goal is to look at changing some of the rules that allow people like this to think they can just come here and plug something like this down in our waters.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The first new Catholic school built in the city in roughly 60 years opened its doors Monday to hundreds of youngsters, who entered the gleaming new building with a mix of enthusiasm and first-day-back jitters. The state-of-the-art Mother Mary Lange Catholic School was built on the site where a notoriously rough public housing high-rise once stood. In a U.S. city steeped in Catholicism like few others, the new 65,000-square-foot building near downtown Baltimore is somewhat of an anomaly in the national education landscape as the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the shuttering of many Catholic schools. It’s named after Mother Mary Elizabeth Lange, a Haitian American who started a Catholic school for Black children in 1828 – the first U.S. Catholic school for African American youth. She co-founded the Oblate Sisters of Providence in Baltimore in 1829. The Vatican is reviewing Lange for possible canonization. Archbishop of Baltimore William E. Lori said the new school, which goes from preschool to eighth grade, is not only a benefit to the students and their families but also an asset to the surrounding neighborhood. The school’s playing fields and gym will be accessible, as appropriate, to the city community. “They say a rising tide lifts all boats. And I think the opening of this school has put a spring in the step of all of our Catholic educators,” Lori said in a phone interview.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A public marker to remember the enslaved Africans forced to journey across the ocean to toil in the Americas was formally dedicated Sunday on the downtown waterfront. The Middle Passage Port Marker was installed last October at the end of Long Wharf looking out onto Boston Harbor. It is meant to acknowledge Boston’s history of slavery and honor the Africans who were forced into the the trans-Atlantic voyage known as the Middle Passage. The Sunday ceremony included remarks from Michael Creasey, superintendent of the National Parks of Boston, and officials from the downtown Museum of African American History. Names of enslaved members of Boston’s oldest churches were read aloud, and there was a traditional balafon performance by Balla Kouyate as well as a land acknowledgement statement delivered by Elizabeth Solomon, a member of the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag. Millions of Africans were sold in the Caribbean and in American cities such as Boston and Newport, Rhode Island, from 1619 to 1865, according to event organizers. Native Americans from local tribes, including the Massachusett, Wampanoag and Nipmuc, were also enslaved after being taken as prisoners of war, the organizations said.\n\nMichigan\n\nPort Huron: A monument dedicated to Tuskegee Airmen who died in Michigan during World War II training was unveiled Saturday near the international Blue Water Bridge. Michigan served as an advanced training ground for many graduates of the Tuskegee University pilot training program in Alabama. Surviving Tuskegee airmen and their descendants attended the event in Port Huron, part of a three-day celebration that recognized the accomplishments of America’s first Black military pilots. Fifteen Tuskegee airmen were killed while training in Michigan, including five pilots lost in Lake Huron and one in the St. Clair River, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Wreckages from two planes have been found in the river and the lake. In 2014, the remains of a P-39 aircraft were found in Lake Huron, 70 years after it crashed. The body of 2nd Lt. Frank Moody washed ashore a few months after the April 1944 crash. A dive team spent a week in Lake Huron in 2015 surveying the wreckage. The plane’s wing, landing gear, engine block, tail, propeller, cockpit door, instrument panel, .50-caliber machine guns and ammunition are being restored and will become an exhibit sponsored by the National Tuskegee Airmen Museum in Detroit.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A write-in campaign for a prehistoric giant beaver that weighed more than 200 pounds has secured it a spot on a list of possible candidates for state fossil. The write-in campaign has been so successful that the beaver, or Castoroides ohioensis, is now in the lead among possible state-fossil candidates proposed by the Science Museum of Minnesota. The fossil, found in St. Paul, dates back to the Pleistocene epoch and is estimated to be anywhere from 2.58 million years to 10,150 years old, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. Minnesota is one of just seven states without a state fossil, said Alex Hastings, the Phillip W. Fitzpatrick Chair of Paleontology at the Science Museum of Minnesota, who is leading an effort to designate one. Hastings put together a list of eight candidates – representing different creatures, different parts of the state and different geologic times – for consideration. As of last Tuesday, more than 2,100 people had voted, he said. The entry for Castoroides ohioensis notes that it had “buck teeth and aquatic lifestyle” and “was the size of a small bear,” according to officials with the St. Paul museum. It almost became Minnesota’s state fossil back in 1988, but the measure failed in the Legislature. Voting ends Oct. 1, after which legislators will get involved.\n\nMississippi\n\nYazoo City: A white father and son have each been sentenced to four years in prison for convictions related to chasing and shooting at two Black teenagers who were riding all-terrain vehicles on a country road. Some of the charges were prosecuted as hate crimes, which strengthened the punishment. Wade Oscar Twiner, 49, of Yazoo City, and his son, Lane Irvine Twiner, 23, of Jackson, were sentenced Friday in Yazoo County. Jurors on Wednesday convicted each man of two counts of simple assault and one count of malicious mischief. The district attorney’s office said the penalty for each simple assault conviction was increased because the men’s actions were deemed hate crimes under Mississippi law, which allows stronger penalties for crimes motivated by the victim’s actual or perceived race, color, ancestry, ethnicity, religion, national origin or gender. The men were arrested after the Sept. 27 chase in rural Yazoo County. The two teenagers were not injured, but they told investigators they were frightened for their lives. The teenagers were riding ATVs on a country road close to Wade Twiner’s home, said Chief Deputy Joseph Head of the Yazoo County Sheriff’s Office. The father and son got in a pickup and chased the teens, firing several shots and bumping into one of the ATVs with the truck.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Officials face a tall order to get all the state’s nursing home workers vaccinated because fewer than half of them have received the shots. By that metric, Missouri’s 48% ranks third-lowest in the nation, trailed only by Florida and Louisiana, both at 47%. Yet some 82% of Missouri’s nursing home residents have been vaccinated, which is just behind the national average of 83%. That worries residents like Michael Williams, who has diabetes and is on kidney dialysis at the Crestwood Health Care Center in St. Louis. “It’s fine if they (staff) don’t want to take it, but then don’t work around us. We all have underlying conditions here,” Williams told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “They are out in the casino, and they are rolling the dice, but the sad thing about it is it’s other people’s lives they are playing with.” Some workers have already quit rather than face a mandate. Earlier this month, the Biden administration said it would require nursing home staff be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition for those facilities to continue receiving Medicare and Medicaid payments – revenue on which nearly all skilled nursing facilities depend. But details of that plan still haven’t been released. Data analyzed by the Post-Dispatch shows 20 facilities statewide had staff vaccination rates of 20% or less as of Aug. 15.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University has announced a $101 million donation to its College of Nursing, believed to be the largest donation ever given to a college of nursing in the United States, school officials said. The donation, announced Monday, comes from Mark and Robyn Jones, founders of Goosehead Insurance, based in Westlake, Texas. “It is hard to put into words how moved and excited all of us are at Montana State University by the generosity of the Joneses, who are helping to address some of the most critical health care disparity issues in Montana, particularly in the state’s rural areas,” MSU President Waded Cruzado said in a statement. The money will be used to fund new facilities and state-of-the-art simulation labs at MSU College of Nursing campuses in Bozeman, Billings, Great Falls, Kalispell and Missoula. The donation will also create five faculty professorships, helping MSU attract top faculty talent as the nation faces a nursing faculty shortage. MSU’s College of Nursing will also create an endowed scholarship fund and a nurse midwifery program for doctoral-level nurses to provide maternal health in rural and remote communities.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The bones of the city’s next outdoor performance space have risen in the Gene Leahy Mall downtown. Metal arches that will one day form a performance pavilion have gone up in the mall in recent weeks, part of a $400 million public-private renovation of the mall, Heartland of America Park and Lewis & Clark Landing. When the pavilion is finished – likely sometime next spring – three white arches cascading in size will cover a stage. The Omaha World-Herald reports the space will be used for all manner of performances, from concerts, symphony performances and music festivals to movie nights and dance competitions. “It’s exciting seeing it start to come out of the ground,” said Katie Bassett, vice president of parks for the Metropolitan Entertainment & Convention Authority, which is managing the park renovations for the city. Stretching out from the pavilion to the west will be a 42,000-square-foot green lawn that will be able to host thousands of people for shows and offer a recreation space the rest of the time. Officials say the venue will be reminiscent of the iconic Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, which has a similar arch-shaped covering over the stage. At night, the pavilion will be lit from underneath to create a glow effect, which Bassett said will offer “an iconic” addition to Omaha’s downtown.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The nation’s fifth-largest school system has begun using ultraviolet light as a classroom germ-killer in a bid to stop the spread of COVID-19. “This doesn’t have any chemicals. It’s just light,” said Grant Morgan, chief executive and co-founder of Utah biosafety startup R-Zero, during a demonstration of the disinfection system at an elementary school in suburban Henderson. The blue-light-emitting tower can disinfect a 1,000-square-foot indoor space in seven minutes, destroying more than 99.99% of surface and airborne pathogens, Morgan told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. It is designed to be used while a space is unoccupied but has no lingering effects when people enter a room after treatment, he said. The Clark County School District bought one Arc unit for each of its 372 campuses using $7.4 million in federal coronavirus relief money to cover the $20,000 per-unit cost, the Review-Journal said. The district has more than 310,000 students. Classes began Aug. 9.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is asking employees who have not yet returned to campus to keep working remotely until Oct. 4. The previous plan was for workers to return at the start of September, but the college is adjusting its plans as COVID-19 cases increase regionally and nationally, said Scott Bemis, chief human resources officer. Many of those who have already returned “can continue to work on-site,” Bemis said in an email to the community Friday. He said the date is being pushed back a month “to help slow the increase in the density of people on campus, with the goal of interrupting COVID-19 transmission wherever possible.” Bemis also said that weekly coronavirus surveillance testing will be conducted for vaccinated employees, instead of every 30 days. Unvaccinated employees who are coming to campus are still required to test twice a week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: About half a million residents stand to lose a $300 federal unemployment benefit when it expires Saturday. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday during a COVID-19 news conference that it would cost the state more than $1 billion a month to pick up the unemployment insurance tab from the federal government. “The proper way to extend federal UI benefits is through federal action, not a patchwork of state ones,” he said. “The reality is that continuing the $300-per-week benefit through state resources would be cost-prohibitive.” The expiration will affect about 500,000 people, according to the New Jersey Department of Labor. Federal jobless aid was first approved in 2020 when COVID-19 outbreak hit, sending jobless to record highs amid pandemic-related shutdowns. The state has administered $33.7 billion directly to 1.6 million residents since the start of the pandemic, the governor said. The lion’s share – $25 billion – has come from the federal government. To those unemployed residents affected by the expiration of the federal benefit, Murphy pointed to the state’s minimum wage, which will rise to $13 an hour in the new year from $12. He also pointed to the state’s paid sick and family leave programs, along with other social safety net aids.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland married her longtime partner, Skip Sayre, on Saturday night in her home state. Haaland wore a dress designed and sewn by her sister, said Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz. The ceremony incorporated elements honoring her Native American ancestry. The former New Mexico congresswoman is a member of the Laguna Pueblo. According to Schwartz, guests had to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend and wear masks per U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and New Mexico guidelines. But pictures on social media that show some people, including Haaland, not wearing masks indoors the whole time have drawn criticism. Her office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A “sequence of failures” in the city’s subway system following a brief power outage disrupted half of the system for several hours and stranded hundreds of passengers, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. Hochul said in a statement that a Metropolitan Transportation Authority review of Sunday night’s subway breakdown “uncovered a sequence of failures that resulted in some backup systems not providing power as designed last night, including an additional failure to quickly diagnose the underlying cause.” The unprecedented breakdown affected more than 80 trains on the subway system’s numbered lines plus the L train from shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday to about 1:30 a.m. Monday, Hochul said at an earlier news conference. The restoration of service was delayed because passengers on two of the stuck trains walked out onto the tracks by themselves rather than waiting for rescuers from agencies including the police and fire departments to help them, Hochul said. “We never, ever want riders to do that,” she said. “It is dangerous, and it caused a delay in the restoration of power.” Speaking outside a lower Manhattan subway system, Hochul promised a thorough investigation. “Let me be very clear,” she said. “Last night was unacceptable.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville: State environmental regulators say a plant that for years discharged so-called forever chemicals into the air and water is not currently in compliance with its air permit. In its letter to Chemours, the Department of Environmental Quality warned that it is preparing an enforcement action against the company’s Fayetteville Works plant in Bladen County, which has been exceeding its GenX air pollution limits for much of 2021. Officials said the company could be facing up to a $25,000 fine per day. In a statement, Chemours said the site experienced a temporary increase in air emissions this year from one of its carbon adsorption units. “The issue was quickly resolved when the carbon was replaced in this unit, and emissions returned to their usual low levels,” the statement said. “However, the data results from that one emissions sampling caused an exceedance of the site’s calculated 12-month rolling air emission allowance.” Chemours, a spinoff of DuPont Co., plans to take corrective action to fix the issue in the long term, according to its statement. GenX, a type of PFAS, has been found in drinking water wells near the plant and also the municipal utility serving the city of Wilmington, about 100 miles downstream.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A new quarterly report from North Dakota State University says the state’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has slowed a bit. The outlook predicts declines in the gross state product, which is the measurement of the state’s output, labor force participation, and total wages and salaries. “The overall economic outlook for the state had been improving amidst the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the most recent data shows a state economy that is at risk of declining economic growth and a shrinking labor force,” said NDSU economics professor Jeremy Jackson, director of the Center for the Study of Public Choice and Private Enterprise. Total wages and salaries are expected to hold steady with a slight decline in the third quarter of this year, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The labor force is predicted to decline in the third quarter, with that trend continuing into next year. The unemployment rate is projected to have a slight increase in the third quarter and then return to its declining trend. North Dakota’s gross state product grew 1.8% in the first quarter of 2021, up from 1.3% in the previous quarter, but gross state product is forecast to decline heading into 2022. Despite the forecast decline, the model predicts relative stability in total tax collections.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Supporters of a proposal to legalize marijuana got the green light Monday to collect signatures to place the measure before state lawmakers. The Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol’s proposed statute was approved as a single issue by the Ohio Ballot Board, a panel of legislative appointees led by Secretary of State Frank LaRose. The group will soon begin collecting the 132,887 signatures of registered Ohio voters needed to submit the proposed law to the Legislature. If the Legislature doesn’t pass or passes an amended version of the bill, supporters can collect another 132,887 signatures to put the proposal before voters, likely in November 2022. The proposal would allow adults age 21 and older to buy, grow, possess and consume marijuana. Proceeds of a 10% tax on marijuana would go to education, addiction treatment and municipalities with marijuana businesses. Municipalities could limit or ban marijuana businesses within their borders. Ohio’s medical marijuana businesses, several of which are backing the plan, could automatically get licenses for the recreational side. The bill establishes 40 new cultivation licenses and 50 additional dispensary licenses for economically and socially disadvantaged “social equity” applicants. Additional licenses could be granted two years later.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Hospitals are again overwhelmed as the spread of COVID-19 is surging through the state, but this time, they’re facing the wave with even further strain on health care workers. The state has dealt with a nursing shortage for at least two decades, Oklahoma nursing leaders said. But the pandemic has worsened it, with the stresses driving some burned-out nurses out of the industry or to other states, amid greater demands on the health care system. “The pandemic has brought on some extra stresses that we had no way of predicting, and that has impacted our retention rates enormously,” said Shelly Wells, president of the Oklahoma Nurses Association. “For example, I don’t think that humans were meant to see as much death as our nurses have seen, personally, in the last 16 months.” A nurse working in a hospital in normal times might expect to care for a dying patient once a week, Wells said. “These patients are dying much more frequently,” she said. “There’s no family support, so the nurses are having to double as family and offer that support” on top of caring for the patients themselves. And it can be especially troubling to care for someone your age or younger “that you know is probably not going to live,” said Elain Richardson, regional chief nursing officer with SSM Health St. Anthony.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Record-low numbers of steelhead are returning to the Columbia River this year, prompting conservationists and anglers alike to call for a halt to recreational fishing for the sea-run fish. As of last week, just 29,000 steelhead passed the Bonneville Dam since July 1 – the fewest ever recorded, less than half the average of the past five years, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. A coalition of conservation and fishing groups sent a letter to the Oregon, Washington and Idaho agencies that manage fish and wildlife requesting an immediate closure of recreational steelhead fisheries on the Columbia River, the Lower Snake River and their tributaries. “This is a really, really dire year for steelhead – especially wild steelhead – in the Columbia River Basin,” said Rob Kirschner, legal and policy director for The Conservation Angler, which advocates for protection and restoration of wild fish in the Pacific Northwest and Kamchatka, Russia. “We are trying to protect every eligible spawner,” he said. “Every one of these fish counts.” Steelhead on the Columbia and Snake rivers are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Their population has been devastated by habitat destruction, including construction of hydroelectric dams, as well as overfishing and climate change. High water temperatures have also been detrimental.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Hundreds of thousands of residents will lose federal pandemic unemployment benefits after this week, including an extra $300 per week, an extra 13 weeks of benefits and coverage for the self-employed. Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said Monday that there are sources of help for people who need it once their jobless aid runs out, including federal rental assistance through counties, Medicaid, food stamps and temporary cash-assistance for low-income families. In the first week of August, roughly 640,000 people were receiving the extra $300, according to figures from the state Department of Labor and Industry. About 388,000 of them were in the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for freelancers or the self-employed, and almost 175,000 were receiving an extra 13 weeks of assistance through the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program. About 78,000 people were receiving benefits through the state’s regular 26-week unemployment compensation program, which will continue running, but without the extra $300 federal benefit on top. The American Rescue Plan Act, signed by President Joe Biden in March, extended those federal benefits and set them to expire after this week.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee’s chief of staff, who is under scrutiny for whether he used his political clout to push through a development approval on some wetlands owned by his family, has stepped down, the governor’s office announced Monday. Anthony Silva maintains he did nothing wrong in the approval process, but the issue had become a distraction, the Democratic governor said in a statement. “Tony and I reached a mutual agreement that it is in the best interest of the administration for him to retire from state government effective immediately,” the statement said. “Right now, his situation is a distraction from the critical work we have ahead. I appreciate that Tony understands the need to remove the distraction to ensure we can continue serving Rhode Islanders effectively.” Silva once had an agreement to purchase the property in Cumberland – where McKee was once mayor and Silva was police chief. After the state Department of Environmental Management issued the necessary approvals, the property was purchased by Silva’s son, Ross. Town officials as well as neighbors oppose building on the land, saying developing it would exacerbate flooding problems in the area, and were concerned that Silva and his family got preferential treatment from the state environmental agency.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in the state has the Department of Motor Vehicles changing how it gives road tests for driver’s licenses. The agency started requiring masks for both new drivers and examiners Wednesday. As of Monday, it is again requiring appointments for driving tests, and on Sept. 7 the department will go back to how it handled testing at the start of the pandemic, with the examiner outside the car, the DMV said in a statement. The modified skills test evaluates the same abilities as the regular test, with the examiner scoring the test from outside, the DMV said. The agency is encouraging but not requiring masks inside its branches. Officials also said many basic services, like driver’s license renewal, can be done online.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Lawmakers tasked with redrawing the state’s political boundaries set a framework Monday that will allow them to speed through the once-in-a-decade process on a tight schedule this year. The two committees responsible for drawing the new legislative districts began their work in earnest Monday after the U.S. Census Bureau released detailed data earlier this month. Lawmakers only have about 10 weeks to propose districts before a special session of the Legislature convenes Nov. 8. The Census Bureau’s data was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. “We’re in for a very compact and a very intense schedule over the next two months to get all this accomplished,” Republican Sen. Jim Bolin told the committees, which met jointly Monday. Republican lawmakers cited the shortened process in setting two parameters that will guide their work: keeping new legislative districts between a lower threshold of 24,066 residents and an upper threshold of 26,600 people, and restricting access to the Legislature’s map-drawing software to committee members only. Legislative research staff said they were worried their work would get bogged down if the general public were allowed to propose maps through its software and said people could create their own proposals with other open-source applications.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Cummins Falls State Park has been named state park of the year. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation honored the Cookeville park for effectively managing an increase in visitors and overcrowding while enhancing safety measures, the department said in a news release Thursday. The 306-acre park in middle Tennessee used social media to inform people of river conditions, scheduled programs and activities. It also conducted more than 250 interpretation programs, held day camps for children and school programs, and hosted a weekly home-school group, officials said. Cummins Falls also has removed invasive plants, planted native species, built two greenhouses, and grown and processed sorghum, officials said. Cummins Falls is one of 56 state parks in Tennessee. It is one of several state parks honored with a 2021 Award of Excellence at a recent park management conference at Pickwick Landing State Park.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Black arts community is pushing to create a cultural center at the music venue Kenny Dorham’s Backyard, amid broader work for equity in the city’s cultural arts programs and historic preservation in East Austin. “Everybody says the words equity, sustainability. But it turns out, if there’s no intention, no action behind it, it means nothing,” City Council Member Natasha Harper-Madison told a diverse crowd of arts supporters in July as they gathered to celebrate the return of Black contemporary dance company Ballet Afrique to East Austin. “We have so much work to do to make this a truly equitable and truly inclusive city that lives up to our progressive reputation.” In 2019, the city contracted with an outside consultant, MJR Partners, to conduct a review of city-allocated cultural arts and heritage funding. An interim report released in June outlines strategies to achieve greater equity, as well as some of the challenges the city will face. The report notes that “traditional and white-led institutions struggle to accept that historic inequities exist in the city.” “I think the city is really trying,” said Carl Settles, director of the nonprofit E4 Youth, which aims to build bridges between underprivileged area youths and Austin’s creative and tech industries.\n\nUtah\n\nMoab: Two recently married Utah women were found dead from gunshot wounds after reports of a “weirdo camping near them” and a four-day search in Moab, about an hour away from Arches National Park. On Wednesday, 38-year-old Crystal Turner and 24-year-old Kylen Schulte were found by a family friend in the South Mesa area of La Sal Loop Road, where they had been camping. Schulte and Turner went missing Aug. 14, four days before they were found dead from gunshot wounds, according to the Grand County Sheriff’s Office. Schulte’s father had posted on Facebook that they hadn’t been to work, hadn’t called, were not in the hospital and were not in jail. “Kylen and Crystal told close friends that there was a weirdo camping near them that was freaking them out !!! And that they should move campsites. Now they have been missing for over 4 days and nights!” Sean-Paul Schulte posted. The couple’s bodies were transported to the Medical Examiner’s Office, which determined the cause of death to be gunshot wounds, the Sheriff’s Office said.\n\nVermont\n\nVergennes: The city is planning to erect a monument to the state’s first known black sheriff and chief of police. The city of Vergennes is planning to unveil and dedicate the monument to former Sheriff Stephen Bates on Oct. 3. Bates was first elected sheriff and chief of police in Vergennes in 1879. Bates had been formerly enslaved in Virginia. He gained his freedom and served Union soldiers during the Civil War. He first came to Vergennes in 1866 with Vermont U.S. Rep. Frederick E. Woodbridge. Bates served as sheriff of Vergennes for 25 years. He raised a family in the city before his death in 1907, and some of his descendants will be attending the event. A local team of historians and others spent the past year researching Bates’ life and rediscovering his story in Vergennes.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrat Terry McAuliffe has asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Virginia Republicans that seeks to remove him from the ballot in this year’s closely watched race for governor over an alleged paperwork error. In a filing Friday evening, attorneys for the former governor now running for a second term against GOP nominee Glenn Youngkin said the suit was based on a “legal lie” and would effectively invalidate hundreds of thousands of votes cast in the Democratic primary. The complaint filed last week by the Republican Party of Virginia against state election officials argued that McAuliffe should be disqualified from running in the November general election because of the omission of his signature on an official form declaring his candidacy. McAuliffe argued in his filing that nothing in Virginia code requires a candidate to sign the declaration of candidacy. Further, the filing said: “Even if there were a technical defect with the declaration of candidacy – and there is not – it would provide no basis for removing McAuliffe’s name from the general election ballot and preventing Virginia’s voters from choosing him as their next Governor. The declaration of candidacy is a prerequisite for placement on the ballot in the primary election, not the general election, and the primary election has already concluded.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Hundreds of people gathered at the state Capitol on Saturday to protest Gov. Jay Inslee’s vaccine mandate. Announced in early August, Inslee’s order requires most state workers, health care workers and school employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 18 or face losing their jobs. Inslee has said getting people vaccinated is essential for getting Washington past the pandemic. Organizers of the rally Saturday warned that a large segment of state workers, including many firefighters, sanitation workers and bus drivers, won’t get the vaccine – as much as 30% to 40% statewide, they said. It wasn’t clear what that estimate was based on. “If the Governor refuses to rescind his mandate, it will mean that multiple areas of the state will be severely reduced or shut down completely,” Tyler Miller, of the group Liberty, At All Hazards, said in a news release. “The Governor is unnecessarily threatening the genuine safety and well-being of the citizens of Washington if he forces his mandate to stand.” Inslee spokesman Mike Faulk defended the need for the mandate. “Employees are losing their lives to COVID. Hospitals are filling up. Communities are stressed by the pandemic’s impacts. The safest and most effective way to get beyond these tragic circumstances is vaccination,” Faulk said in a statement.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Residents who landscape for wildlife use can have their land designated a “wild yard.” The program already has 300 members around the state and is operated through the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources to create more natural habitat for wildlife around the state. “It’s such a wonderful program to get involved in,” Rebecca Linger, who owns a certified wild yard, said in a news release from the agency. “And you get the added benefit of creating an environment around your house where you can enjoy seeing wildlife coming and going. It really is delightful.” Jim Fregonara, a wildlife biologist with the division, said landowners who apply, provide a habitat plan and demonstrate that their property meets the needs of native wildlife will be added to a register of wild yards. They also receive a certificate for participating in the program and a sign post to display in the yard. “We want to encourage private citizens, whether they have a little bit of property or own a lot of land, to help wildlife thrive by providing them with food, water, shelter and space,” Fregonara said.

Tony Evers said Monday. Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have criticized the vetting process and warned about terrorists being allowed into the country. After a tour of the Wisconsin base last week, Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson questioned whether the refugees at Fort McCoy had been fully vetted and called White House assurances about the process “lipstick on a pig.” Evers also toured the base last week and met with refugees. He said Republicans criticizing the vetting of those refugees are “vastly uninformed.” “Or they like to raise that specter of maybe some of those little kids I saw at Fort McCoy are terrorists, or maybe those adults that I saw at Fort McCoy who were working hand in hand with our soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan, somehow they are terrorists even though they’ve been vetted four or five or six times even before they left Afghanistan,” Evers said. “To me, it’s dog whistle crap, and we don’t need any of that.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Donations are pouring in for the widow and unborn child of a U.S. Marine killed in a bombing in Afghanistan. Rylee McCollum, 20, was among 13 service members killed by a suicide bomb attack Thursday at the Kabul airport. The troops were providing security as the airport was overwhelmed with people trying to leave the country amid the U.S. withdrawal and Taliban takeover. McCollum was from Bondurant and expecting his first child in three weeks, according to his family. Almost $687,000 had been raised through two online fundraising campaigns, one for the child’s future education costs and one for McCollum’s widow, as of Tuesday morning. McCollum was on his first deployment and manning a checkpoint at the airport when the attack happened, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. McCollum attended Jackson Hole High School and competed as a wrestler. He graduated in 2019 from Summit Innovations School in Jackson.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/16/emissions-enigma-mask-scofflaws-dare-ammon-bundy-saga-news-around-states/115564646/", "title": "Emissions enigma, mask scofflaw's dare: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: City leaders likely will extend a mandate requiring face masks in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus despite the governor’s plan to end the statewide rule next month, said City Council President William Parker. While Gov. Kay Ivey has said the state order will expire April 9, Parker said officials in Birmingham have been in discussions with medical experts and will push to keep a requirement in place for face masks in public places. “I feel very confident that there will be a mask ordinance for the city of Birmingham,” he said Saturday at the opening of a new vaccination site. A City Council vote likely will be held April 6, he said. Jefferson County is among multiple counties the Alabama Department of Public Health rates as having a high infection rate over the past two weeks even as cases and hospitalizations decline overall in the state during a surge in vaccinations. More than 10,320 people in Alabama have died of COVID-19, and more than 503,000 have tested positive for the virus. About 400 people are hospitalized with the illness statewide, though that is the fewest since April and down from a peak of more than 3,000 in January.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: One year after the state announced its first case of the coronavirus, it reported that a third of its residents over age 16 have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The figures were reported Friday just days after Alaska dropped restrictions on who could get vaccinations, opening eligibility to anyone 16 and up living or working in the state. Alaska was the first state in the U.S. to remove vaccine eligibility requirements. About 187,000 people, or 33.1% of all residents over 16, had received at least one dose of a vaccine as of Friday. About 69% of residents 65 and older had received a dose. Alaska ranked first in the U.S. as of Friday with about 17% of its population having received both doses of the vaccine, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State health officials reported no new COVID-19 deaths Monday and 638 newly confirmed cases, one of the lowest figures in months. It’s not clear if the state Department of Health Services’ latest case count is low because data reporting from hospitalizes sometimes lags on weekends. Still, even the number of COVID-19 patients occupying hospital beds continues to drop. As of Sunday, 716 people were hospitalized due to the virus, with 210 in intensive care beds. The last time those figures were that low was October. Dr. Cara Christ, director of the state Department of Health Services, was expected to administer the state’s 500,000th dose of COVID-19 vaccine at State Farm Stadium in Glendale on Monday. The around-the-clock, state-run vaccination site has been praised as a model. Meanwhile, many Arizona schools reopened for full-time in-person instruction Monday as mandated by Gov. Doug Ducey’s executive order. And the University of Arizona announced it is anticipating allowing classes of up to 100 students to resume meeting in person. University President Robert Robbins said Monday during a virtual briefing that the change will take place the week of March 29. The school currently only allows a class of up to 50 students to meet. Outdoor events will still be held to a cap of 50.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he’s still considering removing the state’s mask mandate at the end of March even as many residents turn down vaccines. Speaking Sunday on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” the Republican governor said the vaccine skepticism in Arkansas is “troubling.” “Whenever we are opening up eligibility for the vaccine, we’re moving through it very quickly because we’re not having everybody sign up to take it,” he said. As of Sunday, nearly 300,000 residents had been fully vaccinated, or about 10% of the state’s population. Health officials reported 130 new cases of the coronavirus and 19 more deaths, while hospitalizations continued to decline. Hutchinson is considering removing his mask mandate at the end of March if the state meets certain benchmarks. That’s in contrast to the swift rollback of restrictions in neighboring Texas and Mississippi. “I think the time in this pandemic for heavy-handed restrictions and mandates are going by the wayside so people can make good judgments,” Hutchinson said Sunday. “And we expect that to happen even after March 31 if the mask mandate is lifted.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The city will now allow people with HIV to get vaccinated, along with people who identify as deaf or disabled, as California opens up the number of residents eligible for COVID-19 vaccines to those with certain significant, high-risk medical conditions or disabilities. An estimated 4.4 million Californians meet the state criteria as of Monday, including more essential workers; people who work or live in jails, homeless shelters and other congregant places; and those with disabilities and health conditions that put them at risk of severe COVID-19. San Francisco is going beyond the state’s eligibility rules to cover developmental, medical, physical, sensory or behavioral health disabilities, including severe mental health or substance use disorders, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. “Getting vaccinations to people with disabilities and who have severe underlying conditions, and people who are in congregate settings, is an important part of our efforts to save lives and protect our most vulnerable residents,” Mayor London Breed said in a statement. She cautioned that despite opening up eligibility for several new groups, supply remains low. So far, roughly 27% of San Francisco residents have received at least one dose of vaccine.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Marijuana sales have surpassed $10 billion since the state’s recreational market began in 2014 – thanks in large part to a record-setting 2020 in which businesses sold $2.2 billion worth of cannabis. The Denver Post reports the sale of nearly $152 million in recreational pot and nearly $36 million in medical marijuana in January alone pushed total sales since 2014 to $10.2 billion, according to Department of Revenue data released last week. January 2021 sales were nearly 35% percent higher than they were in January 2020. State revenues in taxes and fees were nearly $35 million this January. Colorado voters in 2012 approved a constitutional amendment broadly permitting the sale and use of marijuana for adults. Sales began two years later. State lawmakers are working on legislation that could cap the potency of THC, the drug’s psychoactive compound, for cannabis concentrates, require that residents seek medical use cards in person only, and improve data collection to more strictly enforce limits on purchases.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has received his second dose of the Pfizer vaccine and is urging residents to sign up for their shots when they become eligible. The 67-year-old received his second dose Friday at St. Francis Hospital in Hartford. He was administered his initial shot Feb. 16. “I view receiving the COVID-19 vaccine as part of my obligation to protect myself, members of my administration, and my family,” Lamont said in a statement. “As we continue our vaccine rollout, I continue to urge all of our residents to receive their vaccination once they are eligible. These vaccines are safe, effective, and they will help us get back to normal.” Currently, people age 55 and older are eligible to make vaccination appointments in Connecticut. The age threshold changes March 22, when people 45 and older can sign up for a shot. Lamont has said he expects the state will be able to meet President Joe Biden’s call to make all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccines by May 1. During an event Friday, Lamont said he hopes to speed up the current age-based rollout. “Give us a few days to get back to you, but I think we’re going to try and accelerate along the way,” Lamont said during a news conference at a Danbury vaccination clinic.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The University and Whist Club has settled a lawsuit that claimed employees were made to work without pay during the pandemic and told to seek unemployment benefits. The lawsuit, settled earlier this month, was filed in federal court in January on behalf of two former managers at the club. The mansion, which sits on a tree-lined property, is a premier location for weddings, banquets and other events. The lawsuit claims that the club’s owner told the plaintiffs the venue would close because of the pandemic, and they should file for jobless benefits. But the lawsuit also said the owner said they were also required to keep working to maintain the club’s operations. The lawsuit named the club and its owner, John Hynansky, as defendants. Jeffrey Weiner, an attorney for Hynansky and the club, declined to comment. Ron Poliquin, the attorney for the plaintiffs, said the settlement precludes him from discussing the suit. Experts believe there will be an increase in such worker wage disputes that came about during the pandemic.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. Health has set up one of its vaccine clinics in the home of the Washington Mystics – the Entertainment and Sports Arena, located in Ward 8. As of Sunday, with 196 deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic, it has tallied the most of any ward in the district, WUSA-TV reports. 3,000 Johnson & Johnson vaccines made it into D.C. residents’ arms over the weekend as the city opened two new mass vaccination sites, with the other set up in northeast D.C. at Providence Health System. At the arena, Georgetown University medical and nursing students staffed 13 vaccination cubicles, administering 750 doses a day. The volunteers said their desire to help has been fueled by hearing stories from residents who’ve finally been able to get inoculated after losing loved ones to the disease. “A lot of the patients that I’ve interacted with, it’s been like a very emotional experience for them,” fourth-year medical student John Hebb said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: With the state on Monday opening up vaccinations for the first time to people as young as 60, Lynn Duke wanted to be among the first people in her age category to get the shot. She arrived at a FEMA mass vaccination site at a community college campus in Orlando at 6:15 a.m. and was out of observation a little after 7:30 a.m. Florida previously had limited shots to people 65 and up, front-line health care workers, law enforcement, firefighters and school employees. Gov. Ron DeSantis extended eligibility starting this week to those 60-64. Given a choice between the Pfizer two-shot treatment and Johnson & Johnson’s one-shot vaccine, Duke picked the single shot. Most of the scores of people waiting with her for the shot were in her age group, she said. Duke said she had no problem waiting until now to get the vaccine. Until inoculations ramped up recently, she hadn’t been expecting to get a shot until May. “I’m 61 and have no other risk factors, so I understand there are other people who need it more than I do,” Duke said. The latest Department of Health statistics show roughly 4,204,200 Floridians, out of more than 21.4 million total residents, have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. About 2,323,400 have complete their shot regiment.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: Poorer and more rural areas of the state and Black people were hit hardest in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, crippled by years of poor health, neglect and occupational risk, with higher death rates and worse outcomes exacerbated by the pandemic even in younger people, an analysis found. Dr. Justin X. Moore and colleagues at Augusta University published an analysis of the first seven weeks of the data in Georgia that showed smaller, poorer rural counties – particularly in southwest Georgia, where an outbreak after two funerals in Albany had overwhelmed health systems – were experiencing far higher death rates than urban areas. The same held true when they later expanded the study through June 30, Moore said. “We saw some of the same patterns, just really bad disparities when you look at certain marginalized communities,” he said. Those disparities have continued throughout, Moore said. The toll remains greatest, however, in those rural counties with higher Black populations, less medical infrastructure, and higher rates of poverty and lack of health insurance. The COVID-19 death rates for Black adults are higher across all age groups compared to whites – up to 4.29 times higher for those in their 30s, an earlier analysis found.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state has the lowest COVID-19 infection rate in the nation but is also a pandemic standout for a more dubious reason: instituting the most extreme restrictions on the public’s access to official records. In March 2020, Gov. David Ige issued an emergency proclamation suspending the state’s open records law – just as people were thirsty for information about what the government was doing to respond to the public health crisis, said Brian Black, executive director of the nonprofit Civil Beat Law Center for the Public Interest. Black said one example emerged when the state Department of Health last spring said it had enough staff to track those infected with the coronavirus with its more than 100 contact tracers. A department employee told state senators that wasn’t true when they made an unannounced visit to her office. The state health director resigned, and the state epidemiologist went on leave a short time later. Ige, a Democrat, said he understands why the open records law is important, but during the pandemic his administration asked employees to focus on keeping the community healthy and safe. He said the law’s suspension did not make a difference in the contact tracer controversy. The state Senate this month passed legislation that would prohibit the governor or mayor from using emergencies to suspend public records requests.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Anti-government activist Ammon Bundy was arrested Monday after failing to attend his trial on charges that he trespassed during a legislative session last fall. Bundy didn’t appear in the courtroom because he was protesting outside the building instead, apparently angry in part over mask requirements put in place during the coronavirus pandemic. Bundy was joined by about two dozen other protesters Monday morning, some holding signs with slogans like “Ammon stands for truth” and others yelling misinformation and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic popularized by groups like QAnon. Bundy and followers of his “People’s Rights” organization have frequently protested coronavirus-related measures in southwestern Idaho since the pandemic began, including the protests at the Statehouse last August that originally led to Bundy’s arrest on trespassing charges. In one of the August protests, angry unmasked protesters forced their way into a House gallery with limited seating, shattering a glass door in the process. The next day, more than 100 protesters shouted down and forced from the room lawmakers on a committee considering the liability-shield bill. Bundy was arrested for trespassing when he wouldn’t leave the room and again the next day when he returned to the Statehouse despite a one-year ban.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Hundreds of people trickled into the Salvation Army on Saturday to get their first and only dose of the newest COVID-19 vaccine. The 400 doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine that were distributed at the Salvation Army were earmarked for individuals from underserved communities who are 65 or older, health care workers, other essential front-line workers or have high-risk medical conditions. “Just seeing the people that are coming in lets me know that we really did hit our target,” said state Sen. Doris Turner, who spent part of her week working to ensure the targeted communities had the information needed to register for the free doses of vaccine. “I’m really excited about the number of people that are taking advantage of this opportunity.” Walgreens partnered with the Springfield senator, the Salvation Army, Sangamon County, Capital Township and others in an effort to ensure that at least 800 doses of the J&J vaccine were distributed over the weekend. “A lot of my staff was pulled off what they normally do just to reach out so that we could get as many people here as possible,” said Dave MacDonna, executive director for Sangamon County Community Resources.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Teachers and other school employees became eligible Monday for vaccinations through shot clinics across the state. Health officials said last week that the eligibility expansion comes at the direction of the Biden administration, which earlier allowed teachers to be vaccinated at pharmacies taking part in a federal program. Indiana previously only allowed people 50 or older and those with certain health conditions to make vaccine appointments. The expansion for teachers now includes educators up to grade 12, as well as other school workers such as classroom aides, bus drivers, cafeteria workers and substitute teachers. Gov. Eric Holcomb and top state health officials had repeatedly said they believed targeting vaccinations to older age groups and health care workers, rather than school employees, was more effective at preventing serious illnesses and deaths. After vaccines are rolled out to teachers, health officials plan to open eligibility incrementally to those ages 40 to 49, said Indiana’s chief medical officer, Dr. Lindsay Weaver. The timeline for the next expansion will be dependent on the state’s weekly vaccine shipments from the federal government. To schedule a vaccine, Hoosiers can visit ourshot.in.gov and select a location from one of more than 400 clinics around the state.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Tyson says about a third of workers at the company’s Waterloo plant have received a COVID-19 vaccine, the Quad-City Times reports. The coronavirus has already sickened about a third of the site’s nearly 3,000 employees, and Waterloo Tyson is linked to at least six worker deaths from COVID-19. The company this month hosted vaccination clinics for Waterloo workers and partnered with grocer Hy-Vee to provide shots to its Independence, Iowa, employees. About a third of the 265 workers at the Independence plant have been vaccinated, according to Tyson. Last spring, major outbreaks at a number of meatpacking plants – where workers often stand shoulder-to-shoulder on production lines – forced them to close temporarily because of the number of illnesses and to install additional safety measures. The Waterloo site was among plants temporarily shuttered. The UFCW union, which represents roughly 80% of the nation’s beef and pork workers and 33% of its poultry workers, estimates at least 22,000 meatpacking workers have been infected or exposed to the virus, and 132 have died of COVID-19.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s top public health administrator told legislators Monday that Kansas could distribute at least five times as many vaccine doses as it is receiving now from the federal government. Dr. Lee Norman, head of the state health department, said the biggest issue facing Kansas in getting people inoculated is supply. Norman’s comments came four days after President Joe Biden vowed to make all adult Americans eligible for vaccinations by May 1. The GOP-controlled Legislature has criticized what it sees as a slow distribution of vaccines by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s administration. Kelly and Norman have said Kansas has had trouble keeping up with recording shots. The health department’s timetable anticipates vaccinations won’t be available for all Kansans 16 and older until June. Norman said the state is receiving between 140,000 and 150,000 vaccine doses a week. “The federal supply continues to be the largest barrier,” Norman told the Senate health committee during a briefing. “Probably, without even working overly hard at it – five times the amount, if it would come to us, we would be able to push it out.” And “we have enough vaccinating sites, probably, for 10 times the amount of vaccine that we’re currently getting.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The commonwealth marked its 1millionth COVID-19 vaccine administered Monday, and Gov. Andy Beshear said he believes Kentucky will be able to not only meet but beat President Joe Biden’s goal of having doses available for all adults who want them by May. “With over 500 (vaccine) sites” in Kentucky, Beshear said, “we believe that we are close to where we need to be.” Still, more sites will be announced “in the coming days or week,” and the state is seeing a supply increase, he said. Norton Healthcare has opened vaccine registration for the entire 1C category, expanding access to people 60 and up or with high-risk health conditions, along with a slew of essential workers. The announcement came Monday, as sites around Kentucky opened vaccine access to those 16 and older with conditions the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says could put them at higher risk, such as cancer and diabetes. There are more than 1 million residents in 1C. Essential workers include those employed by grocery stores, the U.S. Postal Service, manufacturing facilities, and people in fields like transportation and logistics, construction, finance, legal, communications and the media.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: At a time when the coronavirus pandemic has sparked interest in public health education programs, Loyola University says it is launching a new undergraduate public health degree. In a news release, the school said students in the fall will be able to pursue a Bachelor of Arts or Science degree in public health and may also minor in public health. “Public health majors at Loyola will prepare students for highly in-demand roles in health care, communications, and community advocacy; some will go on to continue their studies at the master’s or doctoral level to gain specialized skills,” Dr. Maria Calzada, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, said in the release. According to the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health, there was an 20% increase in applications to Master of Public Health programs for the current academic year among the more than 100 schools and public health programs that use the common application – a single admissions application form that students can send to multiple schools. Students in the Loyola program could research such issues as disease patterns, how to prevent or control outbreaks of infectious diseases, or how to design fitness and nutrition programs for vulnerable populations.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Monday marked one year since Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, declared a state of civil emergency because of the coronavirus. The order is set to expire Thursday, though Mills has extended it many times. The state has said the declaration allows Mills to “deploy all available tools to respond to and contain COVID-19.” That has included steps such as a statewide mask mandate and restrictions on businesses. The Maine Senate last week turned back a Republican-led effort to end the emergency powers. The Maine Policy Institute, which advocates for economic freedom and free-market principles, called on Mills to end the order Monday. She has said recently the emergency order is critical to allow the state to efficiently combat the virus.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Mayor Brandon Scott has enacted an order to maintain the city’s COVID-19 limitations, despite Gov. Larry Hogan’s decision to ease most capacity restrictions. The Baltimore Sun reports that under Scott’s order, the city’s restaurants and bars will continue to seat patrons at 50% capacity outdoors and 25% indoors. Retailers, fitness centers, libraries, museums, casinos, barbershops and salons, as well as theaters and outdoor entertainment venues, can entertain a quarter of their maximum volume of customers. During a news conference Friday, Scott said his administration would continue to follow the science and would not change course based on the decisions of Hogan and neighboring county leaders. Scott cited the impact the coronavirus has had on Baltimore: COVID-19 has infected at least 41,262 city residents and killed 810 more since officials began to track the disease last March. “Our nation and our city is still very much in the midst of this pandemic,” Scott said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The leaders of three teachers unions are supporting emergency legislation filed by lawmakers that would require the state’s education commissioner to give school districts more time to prepare for the return of elementary school students to full-time, in-person lessons. The Massachusetts Teachers Association, the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts and the Boston Teachers Union said the legislation would allow more school workers to get a vaccine before returning, The Boston Globe reports. Teachers and other school workers became vaccine-eligible last week. State Education Commissioner Jeffrey Riley has ordered districts to return prekindergarten through fifth grade students to classrooms for full-time instruction by April 5. Middle schoolers are scheduled to return April 28. Beth Kontos, president of the American Federation of Teachers Massachusetts, said it is unfair and unrealistic to require school staff to return to in-person classes without the protection of a vaccine. Gov. Charlie Baker last week announced that the state has set aside four weekend days over the next month exclusively for educators to receive shots at mass vaccination sites.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state appears poised to amend a 1,000-patron limit so more Detroit Tigers fans can attend home games on Opening Day and after. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office said Monday that the state health department has had talks with the team “to find a safe path forward to expand capacity limits at the stadium.” The Democratic governor said that “there’s nothing more exciting than fans rooting for the Tigers at a home game, and we look forward to making that happen very soon.” A state order says outdoor entertainment and recreational facilities can have no more than 1,000 customers gathered. Critics, including Republican lawmakers, have said that is too low given that Comerica Park holds more than 41,000.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz announced Saturday that CVS Health and Goodrich Pharmacy have been added to the expanding network of pharmacies vaccinating residents. The state now has five pharmacies with dozens of locations participating in the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, which is a collaboration among the federal government, states and territories, and 21 national pharmacy partners and independent pharmacy networks. Three CVS in-store pharmacies at Target stores in Duluth, Rochester and Eden Prairie will receive 3,510 vaccine doses this week, according to the governor’s office. Goodrich Pharmacy will receive 1,170 vaccine doses this week. “As vaccine supply from the federal government continues to increase, we’re building the path so getting your COVID-19 vaccine can be as easy as making an appointment online and walking into your local CVS at Target or pharmacy,” Walz said in a release. “We will continue to mobilize every option we have to get more life-saving shots into more arms as quickly as possible and end this pandemic together.” Appointments at CVS and Goodrich Pharmacy will become available in the coming days, and the locations and contact information for scheduling appointments will be accessible on the Vaccine Locator map when the information becomes available.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: All residents will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines starting Tuesday, Gov. Tate Reeves said. “Starting tomorrow, ALL new appointments will be open to ALL Mississippians,” Reeves tweeted Monday. “Get your shot friends - and let’s get back to normal!” Vaccinations have already been available for anyone 50 or older, staff at K-12 schools, first responders, health care workers, and those who are at least 16 and have health conditions that might make them more vulnerable to the coronavirus. Reeves urged those in the 50-and-up age group to make appointments Monday before eligibility expands to the entire state. “Almost 10,000 appointments available statewide over next 3 weeks,” he said. “If you’re over 50, lock them down TODAY!” People can get vaccinated at state-run drive-thru sites in counties across the state, at private clinics and community health centers, and at some pharmacies, like Walmart and Walgreens. People eligible to receive the vaccine can make an appointment at COVIDvaccine.umc.edu or by calling the COVID-19 call center at 1-877-978-6453.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The state’s rate of new coronavirus cases is ticking upward after months of decline. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports the infection rate has tumbled since the fall, when Missouri hit a peak seven-day average of 4,723 new confirmed cases Nov. 20. That average fell as low as 343 on March 6 but has since edged upward, to 395 on Friday. “It’s a vulnerable time, and we need to continue to use all methods available to contain this disease at this point,” said Dr. Sriram Vissa, chief medical officer at SSM Health DePaul Hospital. On Monday, 550,000 more Missourians became eligible for COVID-19 vaccines as the state added a group that includes teachers, some government workers, water and energy services employees, agriculture workers, and child care workers, among others. But the head of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force cautioned during a briefing last week that many area hospitals are still trying to vaccinate more in the current tier – seniors and first responders, for instance – before moving into the next group. St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson said Friday that 115,000 city residents are eligible now, but only 35,800 have received a first dose, according to state data.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: The state’s first independent public health institute is officially up and running with projects aimed at strengthening Montana’s public health system by focusing on its rural, frontier and tribal communities and by supporting sound health policy and funding, the Daily Inter Lake reports. With the forming of the Montana Public Health Institute, the state has joined the ranks of more than 30 others that also boast independent public health institutes. The entities are supported by the National Network of Public Health Institutes, which seeks to improve public health structures, systems and outcomes on a national scale. The new organization hired former Flathead County Public Health Officer Hillary Hanson as its first official employee in July 2020. She is serving as the nonprofit’s chief operating officer. The new resource came to fruition amid the COVID-19 pandemic – an event that has put on display just how vital the nation’s public health systems are. In rural states especially, public health departments have spearheaded various prevention and mitigation efforts throughout the pandemic with guidance from health leaders and organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Gov. Pete Ricketts railed Monday against a proclamation by the governor of neighboring Colorado that encourages people to avoid meat for one day a week, calling it a “direct attack on our way of life” and signing a pro-meat declaration of his own. Ricketts surrounded himself with top officials from Nebraska’s meat, agricultural and restaurant industries as he declared Saturday “Meat on the Menu Day” in Nebraska. The day was chosen to coincide with Colorado’s “MeatOut Day,” a nonbinding proclamation signed by Gov. Jared Polis late last month and backed by an animal rights group. Ricketts said meat is a nutritious, protein-rich food source and noted that beef production is Nebraska’s largest industry. “That is a direct attack on our way of life here in Nebraska,” Ricketts, a Republican, said at a news conference in an Omaha meat shop. Nebraska Department of Agriculture Director Steve Wellman said agriculture supports 1 out of every 4 jobs in state and generates $21 billion each year. Meat products alone generate about $12 billion annually, he said. The Farm Animal Rights Movement, which started “MeatOut Day” in 1985, argues that vegan, plant-based diets promote health and have been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes and other chronic illnesses.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority will be marketing messages to leisure travelers and conventioneers in a somewhat unconventional way in the rapidly changing travel environment. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the first of nearly two dozen social media influencers spent time in the Entertainment Capital of the World recently, with more planning to visit through the end of April. That’s when a paid advertising campaign directed at business travelers and tourists will kick off. “It’s really a layered approach for both business as well as leisure,” said Steve Hill, president and CEO of the LVCVA. “We’ve gone from basically six weeks ago having very few people (wanting to travel) to six weeks from now we think virtually everybody wanting to get back to traveling again.” That’s where the social media influencers come in. They have thousands of followers on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and they’ll share their experiences in Las Vegas in their social media posts. Not only will the message get out to would-be travelers, but it also won’t cost the LVCVA much. The authority collaborated with several resorts to host the influencers on a recent weekend, and more will be coming in weeks ahead.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire is helping public health officials better understand how variations of the coronavirus are circulating among the public. The university recently started genomic sequencing of the virus from samples submitted to its testing lab and samples provided by the Department of Health and Human Services. Sequencing of the first several hundred samples were completed this month, and the variant first detected in the United Kingdom was found in two samples. That variant first showed up in New Hampshire last month. Patient information in such cases is forwarded to the state for further action if necessary. More than 78,000 people have tested positive for the virus in New Hampshire, including 256 cases announced Saturday. Four new deaths were announced, bringing the total to 1,199.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state has reached 1 million residents fully vaccinated against COVID-19, its online data dashboard showed Monday. Just over 3 million people have had at least one of the two-shot vaccines, according to the state Health Department site. New Jersey’s vaccination rate is slightly better than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Twenty-one percent of the country has had at least one shot, with 11.3% fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In New Jersey, 23.9% have had at least one shot, with 12.2% fully vaccinated. The milestone came the same day New Jersey expanded vaccine eligibility to include transportation workers, members of tribal communities, the homeless, migrant farmworkers and child care workers. Gov. Phil Murphy has set a six-month goal to inoculate 70% of the state’s adult population, or about 4.7 million people. Vaccinations began in December, so that puts the deadline in June. Murphy and Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli have expressed optimism they’ll meet their deadline. In a tweet, Murphy noted that it took just two weeks to climb from 2 million people getting at least one shot to 3 million. That’s quicker than the 20 days it took to climb to 2 million from 1 million and 55 days to hit 1 million.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: While recent data showed spills from the oil and gas industry in the state declined last year, natural gas emissions appeared to climb, records show, creating concern for air pollution throughout the state and Permian Basin to the southeast. The Center for Western Priorities released its annual spill tracker report this week, detailing numbers of oil and produced water spills along with natural gas emissions tracked in multiple fossil fuel states. The report showed New Mexico oil and gas producers had 1,217 spills in 2020, releasing more than 64,116 barrels of produced water, about 13,401 barrels of oil and 1.7 billion cubic feet of methane emissions. Last year continued a year-over-year decline in spills, as the center reported 1,352 in 2020 and 1,523 in 2018. But the reported methane emissions were troubling, the report found, as 2020’s methane emissions were the highest since the center began tracking them in 2013 ahead of numerous booms in production in New Mexico in the years since. Increases in emissions could be tied to the COVID-19 pandemic, the report said, as it drove down fuel demand while production continued to grow, meaning less natural gas could be sent to market and was potentially released through venting or burned through flaring.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: High school students will be exempt from graduation testing requirements for the second year in a row, the Board of Regents determined Monday. State education officials also revealed some of their plans for a scaled-back version of standardized assessments for grades three through eight and promised more information will go out to schools this week. In a unanimous vote, the board agreed that students enrolled in Regents courses during the 2020-21 school year or the 2021 summer session will earn graduation credit as long as they pass the course. This exemption also applies to students who previously achieved course credit in a Regents class but had not yet passed a Regents exam or alternate assessments used for high school graduation eligibility in New York. The state Education Department is still seeking a federal waiver to cancel all state testing for the second consecutive school year, but the U.S. Department of Education has indicated it does not plan to grant such waivers this year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s unemployment rate fell below 6% during January, government officials said Monday, although jobless figures remain well above those recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic contracted commerce. January’s 5.9% seasonally adjusted rate compares to 6.1% for December, the state Commerce Department said in a news release. The U.S. unemployment rate was 6.3% in January. The state rate peaked during the pandemic at 13.5%, recorded for both last April and May. Employed workers in the overall state labor force increased by nearly 9,900 during January to 4.74 million people, according to the department. While the number of unemployed fell by 11,300 since December to 297,600, the total is still 118,000 above the total of unemployed in January 2020. Among nonfarm employment, the construction and the information and communications industries led the way in employment growth, according to department data. Categories of government and education and health industries recorded the largest employment declines. The pandemic peak rate of 13.5% is higher than the previously announced top rate of 12.9% from last April. That’s because the monthly rates in 2020 have undergone their annual revisions, resulting in adjustments, the department said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Health officials on Sunday reported 34 new cases of the coronavirus out of 1,650 tests that were processed at the state laboratory. The update increased the total number of positive tests to 109,976 since the start of the pandemic. One in every 1,299 people in North Dakota tested positive in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers. The number of fatalities remained unchanged at 1,457, which is the 11th highest per capita in the country at about 196 deaths per 100,000 people, researchers said. Three counties have reported more than 100 deaths, with 196 in Cass, 190 in Ward and 187 in Burleigh. Hospitalizations remained unchanged at 16, with three of those patients being treated in intensive care units.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center will be one of four sites in the country that will hold clinical trials for a vaccine booster against the coronavirus variant that originated in South Africa, officials confirmed. ClinicalTrials.gov, a registry of clinical trials run by the United States National Library of Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, announced the sites in an overview it published about the Moderna-developed vaccine study for the variant known as B.1.351. That strain and others can spread more easily, dodge some treatments and immunities or both, leaving them a threat even as more Americans get vaccinated. Cincinnati Children’s Gamble Vaccine Research Center has been a key site for COVID-19 vaccine trials throughout the pandemic. Researchers at the center have headed trials of the Pfizer-developed COVID-19 vaccine for both adults and children. They’ve also led a trial for the AstraZeneca vaccine. Anyone interested in volunteering for the Cincinnati Children’s trial can go to the Gamble Vaccine Research Center online to sign up.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Department of Corrections is now providing COVID-19 vaccinations to its most at-risk inmates. The first shipment of doses arrived last week, and vaccinations began for inmates in infirmaries, others susceptible to the coronavirus, and inmates 65 and older, the department said in a statement. Ofe about 21,600 inmates in state custody, a reported 7,301 have tested positive for the virus, according to the department’s website. The department has recorded 49 deaths possibly due to COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Also late Thursday, Oklahoma City Public Schools Superintendent Sean McDaniel announced that the district will return to in-person classes for four days per week starting April 6. Monday of each week will remain a remote learning day. Students who previously opted to remain in remote learning will continue to do so for the remainder of the school year.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland Public Schools and the teachers union have reached a tentative agreement on in-person learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. KOIN reports that under the agreement, which must be approved by Portland Association of Teachers members and the city’s Board of Education, hybrid in-person instruction could begin as early as April 1. The agreement follows months of bargaining discussions between the teachers union and the school district. The plan is for the youngest students – preschool through first grade – to begin April 1. Students in second through fifth grade would begin in-person instruction April 5, while students in sixth through 12th grades will start the week of April 19. The Portland district is Oregon’s largest, with about 49,000 students. In an effort to get students back into classroom faster, Gov. Kate Brown prioritized teachers for COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf will expand more business and event capacity limits and lift a raft of long-standing coronavirus restrictions on bar service starting on Easter Sunday, giving some relief to one of the hardest-hit business sectors, his administration said Monday. It’s the second lifting of limits by Wolf this month as spring sports seasons start up, virus-related hospitalizations continue to decline, and the number of people getting vaccinated rises each day. “It’s time to allow our restaurants, bars and other service businesses to get back to more normal operations,” Wolf said in a statement. The relief is still three weeks away, meaning bars and restaurants will still have to live with the current limits during St. Patrick’s Day celebrations and the NCAA Tournament’s March Madness craze. Bar and hotel trade associations have been pushing for relaxed limits and pointing to other states making similar moves. For restaurants, the relaxed restrictions means they can capitalize more fully on Easter business, raising indoor capacity limits to 75% from 50%, but must follow the state’s social distancing and masking requirements. Also going away are a ban on seating at the bar and serving alcohol after 11 p.m., as well as a requirement that patrons order food with their alcoholic drinks.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s vaccination sign-up portal has been slammed, with another batch of appointments scheduled to be released Tuesday. Registration opened Friday night for people at least 60 years old and adults with underlying medical conditions. The 1,570 available appointments were quickly snatched up, as were a few more slots that became available Saturday. Meanwhile, vaccinations for newly eligible teachers and school staff ramped up smoothly. Another batch of appointments will be released at 9 a.m. Tuesday and again Friday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nOrangeburg: A hospital that serves a rural area said it lost more than $8 million last fiscal year in large part because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Regional Medical Center in Orangeburg said the loss from July 2019 to June 2020 should be covered by COVID-19 aid expected to be doled out over the next several years, The Times and Democrat of Orangeburg reports. The pandemic hurt the hospital system’s finances through fewer visits to clinics and specialists as patients worried about getting the virus and as a result of extra costs in protecting people and workers from being infected and paying contract workers, officials said. “The COVID pandemic has been a challenge for all of America’s hospitals, and the RMC is no exception,” interim CEO and President Kirk Wilson said. “Thankfully, hospitals like the RMC were provided important relief to offset the impact of COVID-19 through the CARES Act of 2020.” The hospital system’s revenues were about $217 million, and its expenses were just under $240 million. The nonprofit hospital system has practices in Orangeburg, Calhoun and Bamberg counties and is jointly owned by Orangeburg and Calhoun counties.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: State Department of Health officials have dropped the rate of community spread of the coronavirus from substantial to moderate in Pennington County, which includes the Rapid City area. The county’s spread had been classified as substantial, the highest level, since May 2020. There have been a total of 13,022 positive tests in the county, including two in Monday’s daily report. Statewide, health officials reported 26 new COVID-19 cases, for a total of 114,540 positive tests since the start of the pandemic. The number of deaths remained unchanged at 1,912. Hospitalizations stayed the same for the second straight day at 64. Thirteen of those patients are being treated in intensive care units, and six are on ventilators. The update showed that the state has administered 307,059 doses of vaccine, with 34% of residents receiving at least one shot. The COVID Tracking Project reports there were about 249 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in South Dakota over the past two weeks, ranking it 17th in the country for new cases per capita. One in every 853 people in the state tested positive in the past week.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State revenues continued to exceed projections and grew year-over-year again last month, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Finance and Administration says February revenues totaled $1.1 billion, which is $112.7 million more than the state received in February 2020 and $190.9 million more than the budgeted estimate. The growth rate for February checked in at 11.1%. Finance Commissioner Butch Eley said sales and corporate tax revenues delivered extraordinary growth for the month. The sales tax revenue growth that represents January consumer activity occurred in almost all segments of the state economy except for restaurants and bars. On an accrual basis, February is the seventh month in the 2020-2021 fiscal year. Eley said the state has to monitor April and June returns closely because they are big corporate tax filing months and can be volatile. He also noted that federal COVID-19 aid continues to flow into the state.\n\nTexas\n\nGalveston: An arrest warrant was issued for a woman who refused to wear a mask at a bank, saying to a police officer: “What are you going to do, arrest me?” Police issued a warrant for the arrest of Terry Wright, 65, of Grants Pass, Oregon, on charges of resisting arrest and criminal trespassing. The incident Thursday at a Bank of America in Galveston was captured by the officer’s body camera, The Galveston County Daily News reports. Gov. Greg Abbott on Wednesday ended statewide orders requiring people to wear masks in public places, saying businesses should decide for themselves. Police said a bank manager called police after Wright refused to wear a mask or leave the building when asked. The officer’s body camera shows Wright standing in the middle of lobby, surrounded by other customers, all masked. Wright told the officer the law said she didn’t have to wear a mask. As the officer took out handcuffs, she pulled away and began to walk toward the door. The officer stopped her and forced her to the ground, and she complained her foot was injured. “Police brutality right here, people,” she said to other customers. Replies of “no” and “no, it’s not” could be heard. Wright told The Washington Post she was “attacked” and compared mask requirements to the way Nazi Germany forced Jewish people to identify themselves with a Star of David. She also referenced a false conspiracy theory claiming the coronavirus is a “plandemic.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state reported 3,529 new cases of coronavirus in the week ending Sunday, from 3,615 the week before. Utah ranked 20th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Within Utah, the worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Summit, Tooele and Davis counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Salt Lake County, with 1,221 cases; Utah County, with 694 cases; and Davis County, with 392. Weekly case counts rose in three counties from the previous week. The worst increases from the prior week’s pace were in Tooele, Davis and Summit counties. Utah ranked 45th among states in share of people receiving at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 19.1% of its residents at least partially vaccinated. The national rate is 21%, a USA TODAY analysis of CDC data shows. In the week ending Sunday, Utah reported administering another 174,328 doses, compared to 144,662 the week before that. In all, Utah reported it has administered 1,007,495 doses. Meanwhile, 51 people were reported dead of COVID-19 in the week ending Sunday. In the week before that, 41 deaths were reported.\n\nVermont\n\nNewport: A judge on Friday upheld the state’s mask mandate after it was challenged by the owner of a local store who refused to comply. In the Friday ruling, Superior Court Judge Mary Miles Teachout found that Derby Port Press and its owner, Andre Desautels, violated state rules designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus by not wearing a mask in the presence of others. The store offers printing services and, until recently, was also a pickup spot for packages. Last month, United Parcel Service Inc. severed its relationship with Desautels’ store, saying it refused to comply with the company’s uniform policy, which includes wearing masks. Desautels had argued the mask mandate was unconstitutional. At a hearing earlier in the week, Desautels’ attorney, Deborah Bucknam, described the governor’s orders under his emergency management authority as “fairly draconian.” “I think her decision is wrong,” Bucknam said Friday of Teachout’s ruling. “We are discussing an appeal.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam got a shot of COVID-19 vaccine Monday, joining the growing number of Virginians who are being inoculated against the potentially deadly disease. Northam shed a sport jacket and dress shirt before a member of the Virginia National Guard plunged a needle into his left shoulder. Northam, who is also a doctor, gave a thumbs-up and got a round of applause at the governor’s mansion. “I really encourage all Virginians to register through our central registration site and really stay by your phone or your computer so that we can communicate with you because we’ve got over 400,000 doses in Virginia,” he said. The state is not lifting many of its coronavirus-related restrictions, such as its mask-wearing requirement, despite more vaccinations and a decline in new cases. “We still have several months where we have to remain vigilant,” Northam said. “I want everybody to continue to wear their masks, social distance, keep your hands clean. And finally we can get this pandemic in the rearview mirror.” Northam and his wife, Pam, who also was inoculated Monday, tested positive for the virus in September. Officials with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said people should get vaccinated regardless of previous infection, though a delay after recovery is typically recommended.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The city’s new COVID-19 vaccination site aims to administer as many as 22,000 shots per day if supply allows, but it’s starting more modestly. King County Executive Dow Constantine, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Swedish Health Services CEO Guy Hudson welcomed the first patients as the site opened Saturday at the Lumen Field Event Center. Durkan said the site will initially vaccinate about 5,000 people per week but could eventually handle 150,000 per week, or about 22,000 per day, if enough vaccine is available. That would make it one of the country’s largest mass vaccination sites. The site was being staffed by an army of volunteers, including doctors, nurses and dentists. Live remote translation was available for more than 20 languages via portable video monitors. The vaccines are available by appointment only to King County residents who are eligible under state guidelines, including those over 65 and teachers, child care workers and first responders. The Washington Department of Health announced Saturday that the four state-led mass-vaccination sites – in Spokane, Ridgefield, Wenatchee and Kennewick – have now administered more than 110,000 doses. More than 2.2 million of Washington’s roughly 7.7 million residents have been vaccinated, according to state data.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Residents 16 and older with underlying medical conditions are now eligible for vaccines, along with all essential workers of any age, Gov. Jim Justice announced Monday. The list of eligible conditions includes asthma, heart disease, high blood pressure, intellectual disabilities, autoimmune disorders and more. Pregnant residents are also eligible, as are the caretakers of people with certain diseases. All residents 50 and over had already been eligible. Last week, Justice said the state “will absolutely step up” to meet President Joe Biden’s goal that all Americans be eligible for vaccinations by May 1. He and other governors, though, stressed the need for supply to increase. The state administered first shots to a record of more than 51,000 people last week, according to a review of state data. Nearly 22% of residents are partially vaccinated, while 13.7% are fully inoculated against the disease that has killed 2,531 people in West Virginia. Hospitalizations continued their decline to 151 patients from a peak of 818 in early January. As of Friday, only two long-term care centers had outbreaks among residents. Justice has urged mask-wearing, and a statewide mandate remains in effect, even as capacity limits on businesses have been lifted.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican state lawmakers introduced a bill Monday that would require prisoners to spend their pandemic relief dollars on restitution. President Joe Biden signed a $1.9 trillion aid package last week that includes $1,400 checks for Americans at qualifying income levels. Democrats rejected a Republican amendment to the package that would have prohibited prisoners from receiving checks. Under Wisconsin state Sen. Julian Bradley and Rep. Joe Sanfelippo’s bill, any federal COVID-19 recovery money sent to someone incarcerated in the state would have to go toward any restitution the prisoner owes. Bradley called the bill “a common sense proposal” in an email to the Associated Press and said that “President Biden’s irresponsible stimulus package sends stimulus checks to imprisoned murderers, rapists, and child molesters.” No one from Sanfelippo’s office responded to a message. A spokeswoman for Democratic Gov. Tony Evers had no immediate comment. A federal judge in September ruled that incarcerated people were eligible to receive stimulus checks from the federal CARES Act.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Significantly updated statewide public health orders go into effect Tuesday and are now available online, according to the Wyoming Department of Health. Gov. Mark Gordon announced the major changes last week. While the statewide order for mask use is ending, WDH recommends the continued use of face masks in indoor public places and when common-sense physical distancing cannot be maintained among people who don’t live in the same household. “With fewer cases, hospitalizations and deaths at this point, our overall situation related to the pandemic is encouraging,” said Dr. Alexia Harrist, state health officer and state epidemiologist with WDH. “But COVID-19 has not yet gone away, so we need to act with caution and personal responsibility for a while longer to ensure progress in the right direction while our vaccination efforts continue.” Restrictions related to restaurants, bars, gymnasiums and theaters are being lifted, and indoor school event requirements are being updated. In addition, limitations on personal gatherings and restrictions on outdoor events are being removed. Indoor events of more than 500 people may be held at 50% of venue capacity with mask protocols for large indoor events. The 50-person limit in organized sporting events and artistic performances will be eliminated.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/16/qanon-musical-fritz-hippo-hurricane-drones-news-around-states/50605669/", "title": "'QAnon the Musical,' Fritz the hippo: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A federal jury awarded Republican Roy Moore $8.2 million in damages Friday after finding a Democratic-aligned super PAC defamed him in a TV ad recounting sexual misconduct accusations during his failed 2017 U.S. Senate bid. Jurors found the Senate Majority PAC made false and defamatory statements against Moore in one ad that attempted to highlight the accusations against Moore. The verdict, returned by a jury after a brief trial in Anniston, Alabama, was a victory for Moore, who has lost other defamation lawsuits, including one against comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. “We’re very thankful to God for an opportunity to help restore my reputation, which was severely damaged by the 2017 election,” Moore said. Ben Stafford, an attorney representing Senate Majority PAC, said the group believed the ruling would be overturned on appeal. Moore, a former judge known for his hard-line stances opposing same-sex marriage and supporting the public display of Ten Commandments, lost the 2017 race after his campaign was rocked by misconduct allegations. Leigh Corfman told The Washington Post that Moore sexually touched her in 1979 when she was 14, and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. Moore denied the accusation. Other women said Moore dated them or asked them out when they were older teens.\n\nAlaska\n\nKetchikan: A cruise line, a floatplane operator and a pilot’s estate are all facing a lawsuit from the families of four people who died in a crash last year. The cruise passengers were on a floatplane tour when it crashed about 12 miles from Ketchikan, and the families claim in the suit that Holland America has a history of pressuring floatplane operators into unsafe operations, without warning passengers of associated risks, Alaska Public Media reports.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A ceremony at the Wesley Bolin Plaza on Sunday marked 80 years since the first Navajo Code Talkers joined the Marines, transmitting messages using a code based on their then-unwritten native language to confound Japanese military cryptologists during World War II. “It was the hardest thing to learn,” said Thomas H. Begay, 98, one of the last living members of the group. “But we were able to develop a code that couldn’t be broken by the enemy of the United States of America.” Hundreds of Navajos were recruited by the U.S. Marines to serve as Code Talkers during the war. Begay is one of just three who is still alive to talk about it. The Code Talkers participated in all assaults the Marines led in the Pacific from 1942 to 1945, including Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Peleliu and Iwo Jima. They sent thousands of messages without error on Japanese troop movements, battlefield tactics and other communications crucial to the war’s ultimate outcome. President Ronald Reagan established Navajo Code Talkers Day in 1982, and the Aug. 14 holiday honors all the tribes associated with the war effort. It’s also an Arizona state holiday and Navajo Nation holiday on the vast reservation that occupies portions of northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State and local authorities are investigating after a series of weekend shootings left three people dead and three others injured in the Little Rock area. As many as 11 shootings happened Saturday and Sunday, and authorities are trying to determine whether they are connected, according to a joint press release from Arkansas State Police, the Little Rock Police Department and the Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office. One person was killed Saturday night, and two other shooting deaths happened Sunday, included one at a convenience store, authorities said. Gunfire was also reported Sunday afternoon along Interstate 630 and at a busy intersection in west Little Rock, though no injuries were reported, police said. So far, police have linked the west Little Rock intersection shooting and the convenience store killing, police said Monday. A 31-year-old man was detained Sunday in connection with those two shootings.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state should invest tens of billions of dollars in water recycling, storage and desalination over the next two decades to shore up its supply as California gets drier and hotter, Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a proposal released Thursday. It comes as drought continues to grip the U.S. West and as the state prepares to lose 10% of its water supply by 2040, according to projections by the Department of Water Resources. The Democratic governor discussed the proposal at the construction site of a plant to remove salts from river water that should be fresh – the type of project of which he said the state needs more in the coming years. Newsom’s proposed water recycling targets, which would make treated wastewater safe for drinking, would cost $27 billion by 2040, his proposal said. That was the biggest price tag associated with the plan, which also relies on billions in money already approved in past state budgets. The plan envisions that money coming from both state and federal sources. In total, he wants to boost annual water supply by nearly 3 million acre-feet each year; 1 acre-foot can supply about two households. The plan also calls to expand water storage, in above-ground reservoirs and underground aquifers, by about 4 million acre-feet – nearly enough water to fill Shasta Lake, the state’s largest reservoir.\n\nColorado\n\nWellington: Extra chairs and palpable tension filled the board room of the town’s community center last week as residents pushed for new restrictions on some books in the local library. The room quickly filled with roughly 40 people, many of whom were there to comment on a list of books some residents want banned from Wellington Public Library. Though a book ban wasn’t officially on the board’s agenda Tuesday, a list of public records requests from Wellington residents in recent months was made publicly available ahead of the meeting. Among those requests was an inquiry by Christine Gaiter – the wife of Trustee Jon Gaiter – asking when 14 book titles were purchased and made available for checkout. Some of the books on the list were popular titles like E.L. James’ “Fifty Shades of Grey,” Stephen Chbosky’s “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” and Toni Morrison’s “The Bluest Eye.” The request gained traction on a Facebook page where several residents speculated there would be an effort to ban books from the library. Their suspicions were confirmed at Tuesday’s meeting, where multiple people asked for several books to either be banned or made less accessible at the library.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: A federal judge has rejected the latest attempt by an ex-mayor to have his sentence on child-sex charges shortened. Former Waterbury Mayor Philip Giordano, who has served 19 years of a 37-year sentence after being convicted of sexually abusing 9- and 11-year-old girls, had requested compassionate release, citing in part the threat to his health from the COVID-19 pandemic. Giordano, 59, who also said he suffers from chronic spinal pain, was convicted in 2003 of repeatedly abusing the daughter and niece of a girlfriend, including several times in his city hall office. He was charged after FBI agents overheard assaults taking place while conducting surveillance for a separate corruption investigation. In his request for early release, Giordano argued his health issues – combined with his cooperation in that federal corruption probe, his volunteer work in prison, and the harshness of his sentence – should lead to a new sentence of time served. U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill disagreed in a decision Friday, noting that Giordano “does not expressly address the conduct at issue in the underlying crimes in his litany of filings” and has never accepted full responsibility for his conduct.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Nearly a year after attorneys filed a lawsuit against Wilmington and the private towing companies with which it contracts, claiming the city’s towing practices are unconstitutional, a federal judge advised attorneys the case will move forward. “I don’t know when I’m going to get to this,” U.S. District Chief Judge Colm Connolly said last Tuesday, remarking on how busy the court is. “The case is going to go forward – I’ll tell you that. Some aspect of the case is going forward.” Last September, Wilmington residents Ameera Shaheed and Earl Dickerson filed a lawsuit saying the city is violating the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth and 14th amendments. According to the suit, the city allows private companies to tow legally parked cars that have unpaid parking tickets totaling over $200. If the owners do not pay the outstanding debt within 30 days, the tow companies can scrap the vehicles and keep the proceeds. Attorneys from the Institute for Justice – a Virginia-based national law firm focused on limiting the size and scope of government power – representing Shaheed and Dickerson claim the city is violating the Takings Clause by allowing tow companies to sell or scrap a vehicle without the value being credited to the owners’ parking ticket debt, which, in turn, amounts to an excessive fine.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser is once again seeking National Guard assistance in helping aid migrants being bused to D.C. from Texas and Arizona, WUSA-TV reports. Earlier this month, the Pentagon rejected a request from Bowser for National Guard help in what the mayor has called a “growing humanitarian crisis” prompted by thousands of migrants being bused to the city from the two states. In July, Bowser formally asked for an open-ended deployment of 150 National Guard members per day as well as a “suitable federal location” for a mass housing and processing center, mentioning the D.C. Armory as a logical candidate. In a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin on Thursday, Bowser again requested Guard assistance to help “prevent a prolonged humanitarian crisis in our nation’s capital.” Austin originally declined to provide Guard personnel and the use of the D.C. Armory to assist with the reception of migrants into the city, according to U.S. defense officials. Bowser said the National Guard did not approve of the “open-ended nature” of the request. In the new request, Bowser sets an official timeline of aid requested. The letter says Guard assistance would be needed starting Aug. 22 and last for a period of 90 days, with a reevaluation of the mission on Dec. 1, 2022.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: The state’s primary energy provider is ready to launch a powerful new technology, just ahead of the busiest weeks of the Atlantic hurricane season: a fixed-wing drone designed fly into tropical storm-force winds and speed the restoration of electricity after severe weather. FPLAir One resembles a small plane and is remotely operated, enabling the utility to capture and deliver images and video of damaged electrical equipment in real time to its command center. It can fly up to 1,000 miles at a time – enough to cover the length of Florida twice in the immediate wake of the most damaging storms. It’s a vast improvement on bucket trucks and hand-held drones when it comes to learning what a storm did at the top of a power pole. “Rather than going out and try to figure out what’s going on, we’re able to save hours and days on getting the lights on,” Florida Power and Light Chairman and CEO Eric Silagy told the Associated Press. The drone can even be pre-deployed when a major storm hits, skirting around to its wake and following its path across the utility’s power grid. That data can then point ground crews exactly where they need to go, Silagy said. While satellites need sunny days to document damage, drones can fly under the cloud cover. And unlike handhelds, FPLAir One can fly in much rougher weather, remaining airborne for 22 hours without refueling.\n\nGeorgia\n\nPlains: Former first lady Rosalynn Carter has dedicated a sculpture of monarch butterflies in a garden named for her in her hometown – part of Carter’s continuing advocacy for butterflies and their habitat. Former President Jimmy Carter also attended the dedication ceremony Saturday. The statue, meant to honor Carter days before her 95th birthday Thursday, is in the Rosalynn Smith-Carter Childhood Garden, next to her childhood home. Plains resident Tim Buchannan told WRBL-TV that the sculpture by artist Peter Hazel aims to raise awareness of “what the monarch needs to survive because it was added to the endangered species list just recently.” The sculpture titled the “Monarch Tree” stands about 15 feet tall and 15 feet wide, with eight stumps and 18 butterflies. Organizers plan to add plants nearby to attract butterflies. It’s the flagship of the Rosalynn Carter Butterfly Trail, an effort to create and register public and private butterfly gardens around the world. More than 400 public and more than 1,000 private gardens have been registered so far, according to the trail’s website. That includes 21 in and around Plains, where the Carters still live.\n\nHawaii\n\nPahoa: A 16-year-old boy has died, and the search has ended for his missing 14-year-old brother, after they were swept away while swimming off a remote beach on the Big Island last week, according to police. Rescuers responded Thursday to a report of multiple swimmers in distress at Haena Beach, also known as Shipman Beach, in the Puna district. The brothers, their father and another adult were swept out by the current and high surf, police said. The two adults and the 16-year-old were rescued by a fire department helicopter. The older boy was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police said. An autopsy was ordered. Rescue crews ended the search for the younger boy Sunday night, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is developing proposed aquatic life water quality standards for mercury pollution that could have statewide ramifications. The agency on Wednesday made public a proposed remedy resulting from a federal court’s 2021 ruling in a lawsuit by the Portland, Oregon-based Northwest Environmental Advocates and the Boise-based Idaho Conservation League. The court ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2008 disapproval of Idaho’s mercury criteria created a mandatory duty for the EPA to develop criteria for the state that complies with the federal Clean Water Act. The agency is taking public comments through Sept. 9 on its plan to propose the mercury criteria within 18 months. After the proposal is finalized, the EPA within nine months will determine whether the Endangered Species Act applies to it. Idaho has runs of salmon and steelhead that are federally protected under the act. Several snail species plus bull trout and white sturgeon are also federally protected in the state. If the Endangered Species Act does apply, the EPA will begin consultation with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s fisheries division and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Those agencies about eight years ago said Idaho’s allowable mercury standards were not stringent enough.\n\nIllinois\n\nGurnee: Three people were injured in a shooting outside a Chicago-area amusement park’s entrance that sent visitors scrambling for safety and prompted the park to close early, authorities said. Officers responded about 7:50 p.m. Sunday after 911 calls reporting shots fired at Six Flags Great America, about 45 miles north of Chicago, the Gurnee Police Department said. “The shooting … was not a random act, and appeared to be a targeted incident that occurred outside the park,” police said in a statement posted to Facebook. According to an initial investigation, police said a white sedan entered the parking lot and drove toward the park’s front entrance. People got out of the car and shot at another person in the parking lot before driving away, police said. Additional details about the suspects, including the number of people who fired shots, wasn’t immediately released. Police were investigating. A 17-year-old boy from Aurora, Illinois, had a thigh wound, and a 19-year-old woman from Appleton, Wisconsin, had a leg wound, police said. They were taken to a hospital, and their wounds were described as non-life-threatening. A third victim had a shoulder injury and declined to be taken to a hospital.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The 2022 IndyFringe Festival opens Thursday, with a lineup including a comedy called “QAnon the Musical.” Co-written starting early in the pandemic by Joe Cameron, a member of Indianapolis-based comedy boy-band Un5gettable, and Zach Harris, the musical started as a series of short songs posted to TikTok about the baseless conspiracy theory that claims there is a “deep state” apparatus working against ex-President Donald Trump. “It’s just a silly, irreverent take on kind of right-wing conspiracies that are, you know, flooding people’s everyday lives,” Cameron said. “I mean, it’s ruined some friendships and some families and/or at least put some serious strain on them, and my way of dealing with it was with humor.” The show’s cast and crew includes five people, three of whom are members of Un5gettable. Brendan Hawkins, also a part of both groups, said he knows everyone has their own views pertaining to QAnon, as it’s a difficult, sometimes confusing topic. Hawkins said he was a little hesitant about the material of the show and whether the group should actively pursue producing the musical, but once he began reading the script, he knew they had something special. Cameron and Hawkins said the show is meant to resemble an educational children’s program. The IndyFringe Festival runs through Sept. 4.\n\nIowa\n\nWinterset: A suspect in a Nebraska double homicide was arrested after barricading himself inside an Iowa church alone Sunday. West Des Moines Police Sgt. Jason Heintz said 27-year-old Gage Walter, of Omaha, ultimately surrendered and was arrested after several hours of negotiating with authorities from inside the church in Winterset. Heintz said Walter fled when police tried to pull him over in West Des Moines on Sunday morning and led officers on a chase for about 45 minutes before abandoning his vehicle and entering St. Paul Lutheran Church. Walter is a suspect in the deaths of Marceline Teeters, 93, and Linda Walter, 70, whose bodies were found Saturday inside an Omaha home. Police called their deaths suspicious but didn’t release details of how they died. Investigators were searching for a car stolen from the home where the bodies were found. Heintz said Walter faces charges of possession of a stolen vehicle and fleeing from police. He could also be charged with burglary for entering the church. Detectives from Omaha planned to visit Iowa to investigate, Heintz said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A statewide hand recount of this month’s decisive vote in favor of abortion rights had yet to begin Monday because the abortion opponents seeking it hadn’t shown they could cover the costs of an effort that wouldn’t change the outcome. The state’s elections director gave a western Kansas woman until 5 p.m. Monday to provide cash, a valid check or a credit card with a sufficient balance to cover the $229,000 in expected costs for the state’s 105 counties. The recount request came Friday from Melissa Leavitt, an election conspiracy promoter from Colby, but Mark Gietzen, a hard-right anti-abortion activist from Wichita, pledged to help pay for the recount. Voters on Aug. 2 overwhelmingly rejected a proposed amendment to the Kansas Constitution that would have allowed the Republican-controlled Legislature to further restrict abortion or ban it. The “no” side prevailed by 18 percentage points, or 165,000 votes. There has been no evidence of significant problems with the election. Baseless election conspiracies have circulated widely in the U.S., particularly among supporters of ex-President Donald Trump, who has repeated false claims that he lost the 2020 election through fraud.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: New FEMA mobile disaster recovery centers opened Sunday to assist eastern Kentucky flood survivors. The new centers are at the Magoffin County Health Department in Salyersville and the Owsley Recreation Center in Booneville. The centers will be open Tuesday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. They will reopen Aug. 21 from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. and Aug. 22-23 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fixed centers are also at the Breathitt Library in Jackson, the Clay County Community Center in Manchester, the Knott County Sport Plex in Leburn, the Letcher County Recreation Center in Whitesburg, Hazard Community College in Perry County, and the Dorton Community Center in Jenkins in Pike County. Survivors in Breathitt, Clay, Floyd, Knott, Leslie, Letcher, Magoffin, Martin, Owsley, Perry, Pike and Whitley counties can go to any center for help. They can also request assistance online at disasterassistance.gov, by calling 800-621-3362 or by using the FEMA mobile app.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBogalusa: The home that served as the base of operations for the Bogalusa Civil Rights Movement is now recognized with a marker along the Louisiana Civil Rights Trail. Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser and the Louisiana Office of Tourism on Thursday dedicated the seventh marker on the trail at the Robert “Bob” Hicks House in Bogalusa. “We are proud to tell the extraordinary story of Robert ‘Bob’ Hicks and the importance of his house,” Nungesser said. “It’s a privilege to honor Mr. Hicks, his family and all those from Bogalusa who strived to make rights real in Louisiana.” The house was a regular meeting place for the officers of the Bogalusa Civic and Voters League and the local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality, Nungesser’s office said in a news release. “The house was a safe place for civil rights workers and served as an emergency triage station. The breakfast room became the communications center for the Bogalusa chapter of the Deacons of Defense and Justice, an armed self-defense group who protected civil rights workers from violence,” the news release said. Hicks founded the Deacons of Defense and Justice chapter in Bogalusa and later served as president of the BCVL. Hicks joined with civil rights activists A.Z. Young and Gayle Jenkins to help lead the Bogalusa-to Baton Rouge March in 1967.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A metal object believed to have fallen from a trans-Atlantic jet came crashing down outside the Maine State House, landing with a loud bang just feet from Capitol Police worker, officials said Monday. The Federal Aviation Administration was alerted Friday and returned to the State House on Monday as it investigated the incident, Capitol Police Chief Matthew Clancy said. The object hit with a loud bang on a slab of granite lining a cobblestone walkaway about 6 to 8 feet from a security screener – and came close to hitting the building itself, he said. “It definitely shocked him,” the chief said. “He was walking back to the building and got quite a wake-up call.” The FAA believes the metal sleeve weighing 6 to 7 pounds came from a wing flap of a large passenger jet, he said. Airlines were notified, and all planes landed safely that day, he said. The situation could’ve ended in tragedy. The area where the airplane part crashed to the ground is usually busy when the Legislature is in session, and it’s routinely used for rallies, protests and press conferences, he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state raised a record $1.5 billion from gambling revenue in the last fiscal year, the lottery announced Monday. The new all-time state record includes money raised by the lottery, the state’s six casinos, sports betting and fantasy sports wagering. The revenue for the last fiscal year beat the amount raised in the previous one by $120 million, the lottery said. Maryland’s fiscal runs from July 1 to June 30. The lottery and casinos both contributed more than ever before to the state. Lottery profits totaled $673.7 million. Casinos contributed $832.3 million. The lottery’s profits to the state in the last fiscal year beat the record set in the previous year by $6.3 million. Sales totaled almost $2.67 billion, an increase of $51.5 million, compared to the prior record set in fiscal year 2021. Scratch-off tickets have boosted the lottery’s growth in recent years. John Martin, the Maryland lottery and gaming director, said the lottery, which will be 50 years old next year, has developed a variety of games to play over the years. “We have a fairly equal product mix,” Martin said. “We’re not overly dependent on any one thing.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A break in a 20-inch water main early Monday sent water rushing down a city street, formed a sinkhole that swallowed a vehicle, and flooded area basements, city officials said. The burst pipe in the city’s South End was reported about 3:30 a.m., according to the Boston Water and Sewer Commission. The water main is about 150 years old but was updated in the 1970s, the commission said. The flood also buckled the roadway, which was closed to traffic. “It was a significant amount of water over a short period of time,” commission spokesperon Dolores Randolph said. Service to area buildings was not affected, and no one was hurt. The vehicle, seen in television video tilting into the sinkhole, was removed later in the morning. Sarah Donner heard the pre-dawn commotion outside and looked out to see her vehicle in the sinkhole. “I saw the hole, and I was like, ‘Wait, wait, wait. My car is over there,’ ” she told WCVB-TV. “It was just kind of a gradual pre-coffee awareness that my car was in a sinkhole.” The water was shut off, and construction crews responded to the area to fix the roadway.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: A man charged with conspiring to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was ecstatic and exclaimed, “That’s it!” as he rode past her vacation home in 2020 and told an ally to make a video, according to trial evidence presented Monday. Jurors heard from Dan Chappel, who was known as “Big Dan” to Adam Fox and a band of anti-government extremists. He was a crucial informant armed with recording devices to help the FBI build its case two years ago. Fox and Barry Croft Jr. are on trial for the second time on conspiracy charges. A jury in federal court in Grand Rapids couldn’t reach a unanimous verdict in April but acquitted two other men. Chappel, an Army veteran who hauls mail, explained to jurors how he joined a paramilitary group, the Wolverine Watchmen, early in 2020 to maintain his gun skills and meet people who supported gun rights. He said he turned to the FBI when talk turned to killing police. Fox wasn’t a member of the Wolverine Watchmen, but the group became his ally that summer. Chappel participated in firearm drills, met privately with Fox in the basement of a Grand Rapids-area vacuum shop and made two trips with him to see Whitmer’s property in Elk Rapids. On a recording, Fox said they would pose as tourists on the first ride, “just checkin’ out pure Michigan, bro,” a reference to a state tourism slogan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two former police officers charged in George Floyd’s killing told a judge Monday that they have rejected plea deals that would have resulted in three-year sentences, setting the stage for trial in October. Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. They and Thomas Lane were working with Derek Chauvin when he pinned Floyd’s neck with his knee for more than nine minutes as the 46-year-old Black man said he couldn’t breathe and eventually grew still. The killing, captured on bystander video, sparked protests worldwide and a reckoning on racial injustice. Chauvin, who is white, was convicted of second-degree murder last year and sentenced to 221/ 2 years on the state charge. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill had set a limited window for accepting a plea deal ahead of trial, and Monday’s brief hearing served to formalize the two ex-officers’ rejections of the state’s offers. “It would be lying for me to accept any plea offer,” said Thou, who held back concerned bystanders as Chauvin pinned Floyd. Kueng did not give his reasons for rejecting the state’s offer.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The church where William Faulkner was married nearly a century ago has been heavily damaged in a fire. College Hill Presbyterian Church, northwest of Oxford, caught fire Saturday night and burned for more than three hours, the Oxford Eagle reports. The congregation was founded in 1835, and the church was built in 1844. Faulkner and his wife, Estelle, married there in 1929 – two decades before the novelist received the Nobel Prize in literature. The pulpit and most of church’s red-brick exterior and white columns survived the fire, but the original stained-glass windows and pews were destroyed. A firefighter retrieved a Bible from the pulpit. “So many pastors from the 1800s had written into that Bible and preached from that Bible,” said Casey Rodgers, a church elder. “There’s a lot of history that was lost, so we’re thankful that it was able to be saved.” Lafayette County County Fire Chief Wes Anderson said authorities are investigating what caused the fire. The church will continue to hold worship services in the fellowship hall next to the main building. The church’s nursery coordinator, Debra Patterson, said people will sometimes sit inside or outside the building, even when services are not happening. “The doors are never locked, so you can always just come in and pray,” she said. “It truly is a sanctuary.”\n\nMissouri\n\nBranson: Operators at the Promised Land Zoo say a staff member’s failure to properly lock an enclosure allowed a pair of olive baboons to escape. Although one of the animals was recovered, another was shot and killed after it bit an employee. The monkey, a longtime fixture at the park, was deemed dangerous by zoo officials and was shot and killed by the wildlife park’s owner, Jeff Sanders, according to Branson police. Laura Sanders-Remenar, the zoo’s director, said the June 22 shooting was a lawful and humane safety measure, but she knows others may think otherwise. “Unfortunately, we expect some blowback from animal rights activists who are anti-zoo, anti-faith-based business, animal ownership and anti-Branson,” Sanders-Remenar said in a wrien statement. According to a police report written by police Sgt. Stanley Kaufman, Sanders-Remenar was also wary of the optics in the immediate aftermath of the shooting on zoo property. “I only obtained one picture of the baboon as Mrs. Sanders got upset with me photographing it and was afraid we would release it to the media,” Kaufman wrote. “I explained to her that this report is available to the public if requested and I had to document the incident due to Mr. Sanders discharging a firearm within the city limits.”\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: John Engen, the city’s longest-serving mayor, died Monday of pancreatic cancer, city officials said. He was 57. After winning his fifth term in November 2021, Engen announced in March that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and had a tumor on his liver. His death was announced in a news release by city spokesperson Ginny Merriam. Gwen Jones, president of the City Council, has been appointed interim mayor until a new mayor can be chosen, Merriam said. Engen led with humor, strength and grace, Jones told the Missoulian. He was “an amazing mayor who brought this town forward and turned into a city,” Jones said. “The creative, beautiful Missoula that we all know and love.” One of Engen’s major accomplishments was using the city’s power of eminent domain to acquire the water company that served the city. The years­long legal case cost the city millions of dollars, but Engen and the City Council said the long-term benefits of owning the water utility would outweigh the purchase price and legal costs. Engen won his fifth term last year in a campaign focused on the city’s affordable housing and homelessness challenges, the Missoulian reports.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The City Council will hear from residents Tuesday on city charter changes and the 2023 budget, the Omaha World-Herald reports. A council meeting and an evening hearing on the budget are slated for the legislative chambers of the City-County Building.\n\nNevada\n\nGardnerville: Standing in front of 1,500 Republicans on Saturday for the 7th annual Basque Fry, gubernatorial candidate Joe Lombardo referenced the “elephant in the room” without naming him. The second-place finisher in the gubernatorial primary, Reno attorney Joey Gilbert, has baselessly claimed the mathematical counting was off and has continued to attack Lombardo. The GOP primary winner to this point hasn’t directly addressed Gilbert, who requested a statewide recount of the results and later filed a lawsuit that was thrown out last week. “No matter who you voted for, we’ve got to get past that,” Lombardo said. What has become a yearly tradition held in rural Douglas County, at a rural ranch backdropped by the Sierra Nevada mountains, includes live music, an inflatable rodeo ride and Basque cuisine. It’s modeled after Adam Laxalt’s grandfather and former Gov. Paul Laxalt’s cookouts. The elder Laxalt was the son of Basque immigrants, and Adam now hosts the event with the Morning in Nevada PAC. Several speakers, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Laxalt condemned the search of ex-President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home. Laxalt called it an example of “weaponizing the FBI” – a rally cry that many Republican lawmakers have made in the past week to tap into voter outrage.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: James Duggan, who expanded access to justice from the bench of the New Hampshire Supreme Court and as founder of the state’s appellate office for indigent defendants, has died. He was 79. Duggan died Saturday at his home in Amherst after a period of declining health, according to his family. He was nominated for a seat on the state Supreme Court in 2001 by then-Gov. Jeanne Shaheen after a screening committee praised his “unusual combination of scholarliness and pragmatism” and ability to work “tirelessly, wisely and courageously for the people of New Hampshire.” When he retired in 2011, former state Chief Justice Linda Dalianis called him the court’s “intellectual anchor” and praised his efforts to expand access to justice for citizens of limited means. That work began decades earlier when Duggan was recruited by his friend Paul Semple, the state’s first full-time public defender, to open an office in Manchester. He began teaching at what was then Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord in 1977, helped expand the public defender’s office statewide and founded the Appellate Defender Office to represent those appealing their convictions to the state’s highest court. Shaheen, now a U.S. senator, said Monday that she was deeply saddened by Duggan’s death.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Teachers and day care workers who are not vaccinated for COVID-19 will no longer be required to get tested regularly for the virus under an executive order signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on Monday. Testing requirements for unvaccinated state contractors and state workers, including state police, will also come to an end, Murphy said in a statement. But covered workers in congregate care, health care and correctional facility settings will still be required to be up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations, including the first booster dose, Murphy said. The change applies to school districts and child care settings immediately and to state contractors as of Sept. 1. The move comes a year after Murphy mandated the testing program that, he said at the time, was key to stopping the virus from spreading rapidly as most students returned to school in-person for the first time in more than a year. The recent expansion of vaccines to toddlers is part of the reason for the change in policy, Murphy said in the statement. But children have some of the lowest vaccination rates in New Jersey. As of Monday, only 4.8% of those ages 6 months to 2 years had received at least one shot, while 9.2% of children 3 to 4 years had received a first dose, according to state Health Department data.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An investigation has determined that a tree falling in power lines started a fatal fire that also destroyed more than 200 homes in the Ruidoso area four months ago. A report issued by the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department says wind gusts of up to 80 mph toppled a 49-foot-tall, drought-stressed tree April 12, causing electrical lines to arc and ignite the fire, according to the Albuquerque Journal. The following day, authorities reported finding the remains of an elderly couple who died while trying to evacuate their burning home. The fire has spawned two lawsuits filed on behalf of dozens of Ruidoso property owners. The suit alleges that Public Service Company of New Mexico and a contractor caused the fire by failing to properly maintain trees and vegetation near its power lines. PNM has denied any fault or wrongdoing, saying the tree that struck the electrical lines was located outside the company’s right-of-way.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: As part of an effort to keep illegal drugs and other contraband out of state prisons, New York is taking away one of the few pleasures of life behind bars: It will no longer let people send inmates care packages from home. Under the new policy, which the state began phasing in last month, friends and family aren’t allowed to deliver packages in person during prison visits. They also won’t be allowed to mail boxes of goodies unless those come directly from third-party vendors. While the rule won’t stop prisoners from getting items that can be ordered online, like a Snickers bar or a bag of Doritos, they will lose access to foods like home-cooked meals or grandma’s cookies. That’s a letdown for people like Caroline Hansen, who for 10 years hand-delivered packages filled with fresh vegetables, fruits and meats to her husband, who is serving a life sentence. “When I first started bringing him packages, he said he loved avocados. He hadn’t had them in about 20 years,” said Hansen, a single mother of two who works as a waitress in Long Island. “What breaks my heart is, I take for granted having a banana with my yogurt. Imagine never being able to eat a banana?” New York had been one of the few states in the nation that still allowed families to send packages to inmates from home.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A $100,000 reward is being offered in the case of a sheriff’s deputy found fatally shot along a dark stretch of road last week. “Horrified” by a string of shootings that have injured and killed several deputies in the state in recent weeks, the North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association announced the reward Monday for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or people responsible for the killing of Wake County Sheriff’s Deputy Ned Byrd. The 48-year-old K-9 officer had been with the office for 13 years. Byrd joined the sheriff’s office as a detention officer in 2009 and was sworn in as a deputy in 2018, according to the sheriff’s office. Byrd was fatally shot late Thursday on a dark section of Battle Bridge Road, but it was not immediately clear why he stopped there, sheriff’s office spokesperson Eric Curry said last week. Byrd had responded to a domestic call less than a mile away earlier in the night, then entered his notes into the system, he said. There was no radio traffic to indicate he was making a traffic stop, but it appears something caught his attention along the road, since his vehicle was positioned as if to illuminate something, he said. When Byrd did not respond to several attempts to contact him, another deputy found Byrd shot outside his vehicle with his K-9 still inside the vehicle, Curry said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Supporters of legalizing recreational marijuana in the state have succeeded in bringing the matter to a public vote in November. The group, New Approach North Dakota, submitted more than the required 15,582 valid petition signatures to get a measure on the November general election ballot, Secretary of State Al Jaeger announced Monday. Supporters submitted 26,048 signatures, and 23,368 were deemed valid, he said. The organization’s campaign manager, David Owen, has said the extra signatures show broad support for legalization. The New Approach initiative would allow people 21 and older to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts of cannabis. Public consumption of marijuana would not be allowed under the proposed provision. The measure would also establish policies to regulate retail stores, cultivators and other types of marijuana businesses. A similar effort failed in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hampered the group’s effort at gathering signatures. Marijuana was a major topic in the Republican-controlled Legislature last year. State representatives brought bills to legalize and tax the drug, but the Senate killed the bills that were passed by the House.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: After narrowing down the choice to two finalists and holding a public vote, the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden has decided to name the newest member of the hippo bloat Fritz. Fritz is Bibi the hippo’s second calf and the younger brother to the world-famous Fiona. His name was narrowed down by the hippo care team to the choices Ferguson and Fritz and put to a public vote. Fritz was the winner, receiving 56% of the more than 220,000 votes cast. The initial callout to the public last week to help name Fritz received a huge response, with more than 90,000 suggestions from every U.S. state and more than 60 countries, according to the zoo. And the vote between Ferguson and Fritz was even bigger: 223,542 votes were received, with 125,183 in favor of Fritz. “We would have been happy with either name, but we really think the name Fritz fits this spunky little guy’s personality,” Wendy Rice, the zoo’s head hippo keeper, said in a release. “We also thought it was funny that it was suggested because Fritz is here due to Bibi’s birth control being ‘on the fritz.’ ” Zoo staff appeared on NBC’s “Today” show Monday morning to announce the name choice, after also revealing the sex and the final two name choices on the morning show last week.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: In a sworn statement sent to the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board, the first prison wife of death row inmate Richard Glossip wrote that she feels used and “did not get anything out of the relationship.” “Glossip, on the other hand, got exactly what he wanted, which was financing for himself while in prison,” Leigha Joy Jurasik said in the affidavit signed Wednesday. She revealed in the affidavit that she spent $7,000 on Glossip and another $1,000 on other death row inmates at his request. “He only thought of himself,” she wrote. “Glossip was controlling and manipulative and used me for financial gain.” Glossip, 59, is set to be executed Sept. 22 for the murder death of his boss, Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese. The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board meets Aug. 23 to decide whether to recommend Glossip for clemency. He claims he is innocent. That claim has received widespread support, most recently from conservative pro-death penalty legislators in Oklahoma. One outspoken supporter, state Rep. Kevin McDugle, R-Broken Arrow, has vowed to fight to abolish the death penalty in the state if Glossip is executed. Attorney General John O’Connor and his assistants included affidavits from Jurasik and another woman, along with graphic crime scene photos, in their packet to the parole board.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: New state regulations now allow recreational crabbers to catch triple the number of invasive green crabs from Oregon’s bays and inlets. The Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission increased the bag limit of European green crab from 10 to 35 per day. It’s part of a concerted effort to eradicate these invasive crustaceans, which are known to compete with native crabs for food. Green crabs themselves are fine to eat, and some recipes even call for them. They are much smaller than Dungeness or even red rock crabs, making them harder to clean. Mitch Vance is a Shellfish Project Leader with the Marine Resources Program at Oregon Fish and Wildlife. He wants people to know for certain it is a European green crab they are harvesting. “Key characteristics that really help in the identification – five spines on each side of the crab, and between the eyes there are three rounded bumps,” he told KLCC. “It also has a very fan-shaped shell.” Vance said green crabs cannot reproduce in cold temperatures, but since the ocean warming events of 2015, their numbers have dramatically increased. He reminded recreational fishers that green crabs aren’t always green when they come out of the water. And juvenile Dungeness and native shore crabs can look a lot like green crabs in the rocky intertidal.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The judge in a case brought by Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration against three counties that aren’t reporting mail-in ballots lacking handwritten dates on their return envelopes told lawyers Friday that she will rule as quickly as possible. Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer presided over an online conference in the litigation brought by the Department of State under Wolf, a Democrat, against three Republican-majority counties over about 800 mail-in ballots from the May primary. The counties argue the ballots shouldn’t be counted because of the legal requirement for the exterior envelope dates, which are not used to determine if voters are eligible or if the ballots are received in time. Wolf sued Berks, Fayette and Lancaster counties a month ago, seeking a court order to compel them to “certify” the mail-in votes in question. Cohn Jubelirer, an elected Republican jurist, said Friday she “will work very diligently” to issue an opinion. The dispute has stalled certifications of statewide results from the primary in the high-profile races for Pennsylvania governor and U.S. Senate, as well as results for congressional and state legislative contests involving the three counties.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Mayor Jorge Elorza on Monday announced a six-month extension of the city’s guaranteed income program using $500,000 in American Rescue Plan Act dollars. The program, launched last year, offers $500 monthly payments to 110 randomly selected participants, all of whom were at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Those payments were set to end in October but will now be continued. Brandi Landry, a Providence resident who was homeless in the past but found an apartment using the income, called it “a blessing.” “It’s not just about the money,” she said. “It’s about what comes after that. Now I can kind of change my future around and make different decisions and go different directions.” The program’s extension means Landry can go “a little longer to get a little further,” she said. Elorza, reflecting on his own past growing up on Cranston Street, described his family as “very humble and incredibly poor,” though his parents together earned two incomes, and unlike other children in his neighborhood, Elorza had a father who was present in his life. “I was one of the fortunate ones,” the mayor said. “However, we know that being poor is not only difficult, but being poor is expensive.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nBluffton: A woman was killed by an alligator Monday – the second such attack in the state this year, authorities said. The woman’s body was discovered at the edge of the water near a pond in a gated community in the town of Bluffton by a resident, who told deputies the reptile appeared to be guarding the body, The Island Packet quoted Beaufort County Sheriff’s Maj. Angela Viens as saying. Information about the size of the alligator and whether it would be euthanized or relocated was not immediately available. On June 24, the Horry County Police Department said an alligator dragged a man into a pond. Prior to those attacks, authorities said, the state had not recorded any in two years. In May 2020, a woman was attacked and killed by an alligator in the gated community where she’d gone to do a homeowner’s nails. A 90-year-old woman walked out of a Charleston nursing home in 2016 and was killed, while a 45-year-old woman walking her dog was fatally attacked on Hilton Head Island in August 2018. David Lucas, a spokesman for the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, said then that the state had never recorded a person killed by an alligator before those attacks. Unprovoked attacks by alligators smaller than 5 feet long are rare, according to the National Wildlife Control Training Program.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem on Monday released a revised proposal for social studies standards in public schools that lays out a mostly shining vision of American history, after an initial draft of the standards came under heavy criticism last year from conservatives and Native American educators. The Republican governor claimed the new proposed standards are free from “political agendas” and include an increased focus on Native American history. But they received swift criticism from some educators as a thinly veiled political document. They emphasize the qualities of America’s founders and mimic language Noem has used as she jumped on the conservative cause of weeding certain “divisive” teachings on race from public schools. The 15-member standards workgroup, selected partially by the governor, included Noem’s chief of staff, two Republican lawmakers and the director of the South Dakota Catholic Conference but just three educators certified by the Department of Education. The group’s work was facilitated by William Morrisey, a former professor at Hillsdale College – a conservative institution in Michigan that has tried to remake education across the country.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A private prison company has agreed to settle a federal lawsuit over an inmate’s killing that got national attention after a judge ordered the plaintiff’s attorney to stop tweeting about it. Tennessee-based CoreCivic and attorney Daniel Horwitz, who represents the family of the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center inmate who died, noted the settlement Tuesday in a federal court filing in Nashville. The plaintiff in the lawsuit is G. Marie Newby, the mother of Terry Childress, who died in February 2021 after his cellmate assaulted him, court records show. The lawsuit, blaming low staffing levels, claimed correctional officers were not making timely rounds. It sought $10 million for Newby. CoreCivic spokesperson Matthew Davio said the settlement terms are confidential, and the company is “pleased to have reached a mutually agreeable resolution to this case.” Horwitz said he remains unable to comment due to last month’s gag order. A judge still needs to approve the settlement. The suit asked the judge to declare that CoreCivic failed to maintain a constitutionally required level of inmate safety at Trousdale. The facility, about 50 miles northeast of Nashville, houses about 2,500 inmates, the most of any Tennessee prison.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Firefighters in central Texas are gearing up for a run of several weeks that are expected to have the area’s greatest risk for widespread wildfires in a decade, with the peak of hurricane season in the next couple of months posing a major threat. Strong winds from Tropical Storm Lee, which made landfall along the coast of southern Louisiana over Labor Day weekend in 2011, amplified the most destructive wildfire in Texas history – the 34,000-acre Bastrop County Complex fire that burned for 55 days, destroyed 1,600 homes and killed two people. Randy Denzer, vice president of the Austin Firefighters Association, was one among hundreds of firefighters called to battle blazes in central Texas that 2011 weekend, including six in Travis County alone. The exceptional drought and low humidity, boosted by high winds from the tropical storm, created the ideal conditions for wildfires to ignite and spread rapidly. “This year looks like 2011 all over again,” Denzer said. The latest U.S Drought Monitor report released Thursday showed that drought conditions continue to intensify in Texas, with the two most severe levels of drought – extreme and exceptional – now covering 68.2% of the state. That’s the largest extent of extreme and exceptional drought since December 2011, when such conditions covered about 69.4% of the state.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A Republican state lawmaker said Friday that he plans to introduce legislation that would require clergy to report child abuse to authorities, eliminating the clergy-penitent privilege in a state where The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the predominant religion. Rep. Phil Lyman’s news release came a week after the Associated Press published an investigative story focusing on cases in Arizona and West Virginia that found the church’s abuse reporting system can be misused by church leaders to divert abuse accusations away from law enforcement and instead to church attorneys who may bury the problem, leaving victims in harm’s way. Lyman, a member of the faith who himself served six years as a bishop of a local congregation, said he had already been working for months on his legislation but called the AP story “powerful” and an example of the kinds of problems caused by delaying report of the abuse. He said he deeply values the repentance and confessional process. But he argued the clergy exception can delay intervention for victims and create uncertainty for clergy members. He would prefer to have clarity so clergy members could tell parishioners at the beginning of confessions that they are required to report abuse. The faith said in a statement issued one day after the AP story was published that the piece “seriously mischaracterized” the reporting systems and that a help line that local leaders are supposed to call to report abuse focuses on helping victims.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The federal government has awarded Burlington and Winooski $24.8 million to replace the 93-year old Winooski River Bridge. The cities, who are the joint owners of the bridge, applied for the highly competitive grant this year through the U.S. Department of Transportation with the help of the Vermont Agency of Transportation. Burlington, Winooski and the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission have been in discussions about the $31 million project for several years, and the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission published a scoping study about how best to replace the bridge in 2019 that greatly aided the grant application. If all goes as planned, and the cities are able to secure the remaining funding, they hope to start concept design in 2023, begin construction in 2027 and finish the bridge in 2030. Overdue for replacement, the bridge currently offers no bike lanes, four narrow vehicle lanes and crumbling sidewalks. The new bridge will feature widened lanes for cars and a mixed-use path for bikes and pedestrians on either side, protected by a wall.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state government failed to carry out numerous lessons from a 2018 snowstorm that caused highway gridlock, as exhibited by a similar event along Interstate 95 in January that left hundreds of motorists stranded, a state watchdog office concluded. The Office of the Inspector General report, released Friday, was critical of how the state transportation, police and emergency management agencies performed during the severe snowstorm that began Jan. 3, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. Logjams along a 40-mile stretch of I-95 in both directions not far from the nation’s capital led to outrage among motorists, some of whom were stuck in their vehicles overnight and pleaded on social media for help. In April, a state-commissioned report created by a nonprofit group didn’t place blame on any single person or agency. But it found state agencies collectively “lost situational awareness” and failed to keep up with growing gridlock through a confluence of heavy snowfall, abnormally high traffic and staffing shortages related to COVID-19. Up to 11 inches of snow fell in the area. Friday’s performance audit mentioned many of the same issues, but the I-95 mess could have been avoided if state officials had taken preventive measures recommended by Virginia DOT after a snowstorm in late 2018 blocked traffic on Interstate 81, in far southwest Virginia.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The same factors that produced a later and lighter cherry crop are affecting many Yakima Valley peach growers as well. Cold spring weather, a late April frost and their impact on pollination have delayed the peach harvesting season, usually at its peak by now, local growers and state agriculture officials say, according to the Yakima Herald-Republic. “Volume is down because of the cold conditions we saw this spring,” said James Michael, vice president of marketing for North America for the Washington State Fruit Commission. “Besides the severe cold and frost, we had a long, extended cool period that pushed everything back, including the peaches.” While there isn’t a formal Washington peach crop estimate, many of the state’s top peach areas were among the coldest points during the April freeze, Michael said. The consensus among growers is that there is about half a crop this season, he said. “We are getting into the peak of peaches now and will be transitioning through varieties until late September this year,” Michael said. “Traditionally, peach harvest begins in early July and lasts through mid-September, but the cool spring pushed most crops back by at least two weeks.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice scoffed Monday at a suggestion by Democratic lawmakers to let voters decide whether abortion should continue to be allowed in the state. The Republican governor said the state’s abortion law falls under the scrutiny of the Legislature and the attorney general. During a legislative special session initiated by Justice last month, majority Republicans failed to pass legislation criminalizing abortion. On Friday, top Democrats asked Justice and leading GOP lawmakers to bring the Legislature back to consider a resolution to allow voters to consider a constitutional amendment for “reproductive freedom.” Justice wanted no part of that. “Unfortunately, this place is surrounded with constant grandstanding,” he said at a news conference. Abortion had been banned after 20 weeks of pregnancy in West Virginia until the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. After that ruling, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said abortion was banned completely in the state because of an 1800s-era law that had been unenforceable while abortion was federally protected. But a Charleston judge barred the state from enforcing the ban, ruling it had been superseded by a slew of conflicting modern laws, including the 20-week ban. Morrisey has appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court, which is expected to take up the case this fall.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin System is launching a new tuition waiver at its 12 regional campuses. The program, dubbed the Wisconsin Tuition Promise, is modeled after the Bucky’s Tuition Promise program at UW-Madison. Beginning in fall 2023, Wisconsin residents who come from families making less than $62,000 a year will have any tuition and fees remaining after receiving financial aid waived. Undergraduates will be eligible for the waiver for eight semesters. Students seeking associate degrees and transfer students would be eligible for the waiver for four semesters. The discount works out to an average of $4,500 per student over four years. System officials plan to fund the program’s first year at $13.8 million and seek $24.5 million in additional state aid to cover the program in 2024-25. Students will be automatically considered for the Wisconsin Tuition Promise when they apply for federal financial aid.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A local man who taught hundreds of student pilots over a career spanning four decades will be added to the ranks of the Wyoming Aviation Hall of Fame, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. John B. Cooksey served in the Civil Air Patrol and helped people in rural areas through air drops of supplies during blizzards. He served in the Pacific theater during World War II and died in 1986, according to the newspaper. He’ll be inducted to the hall of fame Sept. 17 at the Newcastle Airport.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/29/lizzo-library-trap-church-medieval-manuscript-news-around-states/50785481/", "title": "Lizzo at the Library, 'trap' church: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: State lawmakers may consider harsher penalties for traffickers and distributors of illicit fentanyl next year, but some say a comprehensive approach should also include more health services and helping drug users reduce overdoses. Republicans Reps. Matt Simpson of Daphne and Chris Pringle of Mobile told Al.com they plan bills next year to increase penalties for distributing the deadly drug that accounted for 66% of all U.S. overdose deaths in 2021. Under Simpson’s proposal, prison sentences would increase based on the weight of fentanyl distributed in Alabama. Similar laws exist in other states, but Simpson’s proposal would be among the harshest. Traffickers caught with more than 8 grams of fentanyl could face a life sentence under his plan. “This is not the run-of-the-mill old-time drugs that there used to be,” Simpson said. “It’s not the pot of the ’70s or the cocaine of the ’80s. I hate to say it, but it’s not the meth of the early 2000s. It’s highly potent and deadly.” Around Birmingham in Jefferson County, health officials report a 118% jump in fentanyl-related deaths from 2019 to 2022, though this year still has more than three months remaining. Pringle’s legislation allows a felony manslaughter charge against someone who is not a licensed pharmacist who sells an illicit pill that causes death.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A landslide triggered by record rainfall significantly damaged three homes, prompted the evacuation of about a dozen residents and caused power outages in the capital city’s downtown. Geological assessment teams determined Tuesday that favorable weather has returned the threat level to pre-slide levels. The city’s public works department was preparing to begin removing debris, city spokesperson Meredith Thatcher said. Of the three homes, one was completely destroyed as it came down the mountain and slammed into a second home, which was significantly damaged but remains standing, she said. The extent of damage to the third home was not yet known. Residents will be allowed to return to their homes at their own discretion. “If you feel comfortable going home, you can go home,” Thatcher said. The local power company was expected to restore service after the debris has been removed to the point where crews need to work. Damage from the Monday evening landslide was confined to the one residential street above the downtown business district in the southeast Alaska mountain community of about 32,000 residents. There were no reported injuries, city officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A state scholarship program to train teachers doesn’t have enough money to serve all who are interested, and some universities are implementing waitlists and other cutbacks. The Arizona Teachers Academy is facing a $13 million budget shortfall, limiting its ability to produce new teachers at a time Arizona desperately needs them. The lack of funding comes even as the state sees record budget surpluses. The program has about $21 million on hand – not enough even to match last school year’s spending of nearly $25 million, the vast majority of which went to student scholarships for the more than 3,300 people enrolled. “The impact of a budget shortfall will surely reduce the number of future students who enroll in teacher-prep programs,” Carole Basile, dean of Arizona State University’s Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, wrote in an email. “That’s not an outcome Arizonans want and it’s not an outcome the state of Arizona can afford.” A survey by the Arizona School Personnel Administrators Association found the state’s teacher shortage has deepened, with initial findings showing 66% of the surveyed districts had more teacher vacancies this year than last. The state funds tuition and fees in teacher preparation programs, and in exchange, students commit to teaching in Arizona public schools for the number of years they were funded.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state senator won’t have access to Senate offices and can’t participate in legislative meetings after the chamber on Tuesday ruled he made a frivolous ethics complaint against a fellow lawmaker in retaliation for sanctions he received earlier this year. By a 26-4 vote, the majority-Republican Arizona Senate approved its ethics committee’s recommendation to suspend GOP Sen. Alan Clark for the rest of the 93rd General Assembly, which ends Jan. 8. The Senate earlier this month rejected a complaint Clark had filed against Democratic Sen. Stephanie Flowers accusing her of improperly receiving per diem payments for legislative meetings she attended via Zoom. The ethics panel ruled that Clark had filed the complaint as retaliation after the Senate stripped him and another lawmaker of their leadership posts because Clark sought reimbursement for a meeting he didn’t attend. “The committee felt that the comments and actions of Sen. Clark, including bringing these ethics petitions for the purpose of retaliation, were bringing dishonor and disruption to the institution of the Senate,” Republican Sen. Kim Hammer, who chairs the ethics committee, told senators before the vote. Clark didn’t attend Tuesday’s proceedings, citing a long-planned trip with his family and said his attorneys would not have been able to attend.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Homeless people and their advocates sued the city Tuesday, demanding that it stop harassing and destroying the belongings of people living on the streets with nowhere to go – and with the goal of forcing the city to spend billions of dollars on affordable homes that will keep residents housed. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area and others filed the lawsuit in federal court on behalf of the Coalition on Homelessness and seven individuals who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. Defendants include the city, several city departments and Mayor London Breed. The complaint says San Francisco “presents the image of a caring municipality” with a plan to address homelessness, but decades of inaction on affordable housing have left thousands forced to use tents and vehicles as shelter. An annual homelessness survey found 7,754 homeless people in San Francisco in 2022, with nearly 60% living unsheltered. Not only has the city failed to construct affordable housing, according to the complaint, but the city also uses heavy-handed tactics to get homeless people to move, threatening to arrest or actually arresting people, as well as taking people’s belongings in early morning encampment sweeps in which shelter is not offered, as required by law.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: A 20-year-old woman who was seriously injured when the parked police patrol vehicle in which she was detained was struck by a freight train in northern Colorado has been released from the hospital. Yareni Rios-Gonzalez, of Greeley, is recovering at home with nine broken ribs, a broken arm, a fractured sternum, and numerous other injuries to her head and back, her attorney, Paul Wilkinson, told KUSA-TV. “She is bedridden. She can move around a little bit. She also has a fractured leg that she wasn’t initially aware of,” he said. “She’s still really, really hurt.” Multiple law enforcement agencies responded to a report of a road rage incident involving a firearm in Fort Lupton on Sept. 16. A Platteville police officer stopped Rios-Gonzalez’s car just past a set of railroad tracks and parked the patrol vehicle on the crossing. She was placed in the back of the police vehicle, which was hit as officers were searching her car. Police bodycam and dashcam video shows officers scrambling as the train approaches and slams into the patrol vehicle, parked squarely on the tracks. One officer repeatedly says, “Oh my God.” And another yells, “Stay back,” as the train’s horn blares before the crash. Video shows officers running toward the mangled, crushed vehicle through what appears to be a debris field left by the impact. No one has been charged in the alleged road rage incident or the crash.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Lawyers for Randy Cox, a Black man who was paralyzed from the chest down in June when a police van without seat belts braked suddenly, filed a $100 million lawsuit Tuesday against the city. Cox, 36, was being driven to a police station in the city June 19 for processing on a weapons charge when the driver braked hard, apparently to avoid a collision, causing Cox to fly headfirst into the wall of the van, police said. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump said Cox’s legal team is still in talks with the city but filed a federal negligence lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court to make sure Cox is compensated for his suffering. “If we say we respect life and respect Randy Cox’s life experiences and people like Randy Cox, similarly situated, then we have to show that by action, not just by rhetoric,” Crump said. In the lawsuit, the city and the officers involved in Cox’s transport are accused of negligence, recklessness, use of excessive force, denial of medical treatment and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. Cox’s supporters say the police mocked his cries for help after he was injured and accused him of being drunk and faking his injuries. Police video shows the officers dragged him by his feet from the van and placed him in a holding cell at the police department before paramedics finally took him to a hospital.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Most people incarcerated in the state hail from Wilmington, Dover and Seaford, a new report from the Prison Policy Initiative found. Prison gerrymandering – the practice of counting incarcerated people as residents of the prison rather than their last home in the census – was outlawed in Delaware in 2010. That move allowed think tanks to determine where most of the people in the state’s prisons are actually from. The calculations are based on data from the 2020 census and information provided by prisons about the majority of their population. The findings paint a grim but not unexpected picture: People incarcerated in Delaware often come from cities with higher poverty rates and more Black residents. Wilmington has the highest incarceration rate of any city in Delaware, according to the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative. Over 1% of residents are incarcerated, and with the largest population in the state, the think tank has given Wilmington the “dubious distinction” of having the most people actually incarcerated in addition to the highest rate. Excluding towns, Seaford has the second-highest incarceration rate in the state – 748 people behind bars per 100,000 residents. It’s followed by Dover, which had 680 people incarcerated per 100,000 residents as of 2020.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Singer and flutist Lizzo paid a special visit to the Library of Congress on Monday while on tour in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. The performer gave Tuesday’s audience at her Capitol One Arena show quite the treat,when she surprised everyone by performing on a historical 200-year-old crystal flute. According to the Library of Congress, a French fluter made the ornate instrument in 1813 specifically for President James Madison in honor of his second inauguration. The iconic moment started with a simple social media exchange. Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden tweeted an invitation for Lizzo to visit the world’s largest flute collection, housed at the D.C. institution. After making a stop at the library to tour the collection and practice on a few instruments, Lizzo’s dream became reality when she got the chance to play the historic flute on stage Tuesday night. Handlers brought the flute onstage to Lizzo, who carefully accepted the historical instrument and carried it to a microphone. She played relatively few notes – adding a few of her signature moves – then returned the flute and ran back to her mic. “I just twerked and played James Madison’s crystal flute from the 1800s.” she shouted. “We just made history tonight!” Lizzo thanked the Library of Congress for “preserving our history and making history freaking cool.”\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: The polluted leftovers of the state’s phosphate fertilizer mining industry, more than 1 billion tons in “stacks” that resemble enormous ponds, are at risk for leaks or other contamination as Hurricane Ian comes ashore in the state, environmental groups say. Florida has 24 such phosphogypsum stacks, most of them concentrated in mining areas in the central part of the state. About 30 million tons of this slightly radioactive waste are generated every year, according to the Florida Industrial and Phosphate Research Institute. “A major storm event like the one we are bracing for can inundate the facilities with more water than the open-air ponds can handle,” Ragan Whitlock, staff attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity environmental group, said in an email Tuesday. “We are extremely concerned about the potential impacts Hurricane Ian may have on phosphate facilities around the state.” A leak in March 2021 at a stack called Piney Point resulted in the release of an estimated 215 million gallons of polluted water into Tampa Bay and caused massive fish kills. State officials, overseen by a court-appointed receiver, are working with a $100 million appropriation to shut down that long-troubled location.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state ran a surplus of more than $6 billion in the budget year that ended June 30, meaning the next governor and lawmakers could spend or give back billions. The State Accounting Office, in a Friday report, said Georgia ran a $6.37 billion surplus even after spending $28.6 billion in state taxes and fees in the 2022 budget year. Total state general fund receipts rose a whopping 22%. Even after filling its rainy day fund to the legal maximum, Georgia has $6.58 billion in “unreserved, undesignated” surplus – cash that leaders can spend however they want. Some money is already spoken for, with the state likely to transfer more than $1 billion to pay for roads, bridges and other transportation projects. That would make up for the state’s decision in March to waive its gasoline tax of 29.1 cents per gallon and its diesel tax of 32.6 cents per gallon. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has repeatedly extended the tax breaks since then, a move lawmakers must ratify when they return in January. Kemp, running for reelection against Democrat Stacey Abrams, has designs on an additional $2 billion of the surplus, pledging to give another $1 billion in state income tax rebates, plus spending $1 billion to renew a long-dormant property tax break for homeowners.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Department of Health said Tuesday it has fined the U.S. Navy $8.8 million for repeatedly discharging untreated or partially treated sewage into state waters from Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam. The department said in a news release that it recorded 766 counts of the Navy discharging pollutants in excess of limits established by a permit. The pollutants were released between January 2020 and July 2022 from the Hawaii Wastewater Treatment Pant operated by the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, the department said. The agency also found 212 counts of operation and maintenance failures. “The Navy’s failure to properly operate and maintain this wastewater treatment plant led to the pollution of state waters,” said Kathleen Ho, the department’s deputy director of environmental health, in a statement. “We are taking action to protect our state’s water resources and to hold the Navy accountable to make critical repairs and prevent a potential catastrophic failure of the facility.” Navy Region Hawaii said the Navy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed in June 2021 to address deficiencies with the treatment plant. The Navy is on track to meet these obligations, which may also address some of the issues pointed out by Hawaii’s Department of Health, it said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Embattled Boise Police Chief Ryan Lee has resigned at the request of the Mayor Lauren McLean. The city’s announcement came Friday afternoon after KTVB reported last week that nine officers had filed complaints against Lee and after an investigation into an allegation that he injured a high-ranking officer during a training demonstration last year. Sgt. Kirk Rush has said Lee broke parts of his neck during the demonstration, which required surgery to repair. Clearwater Prosecutor Clayne Tyler late last month told officials that while he felt there was probable cause to support charging Lee with felony battery, he wasn’t sure he could prove the crime in court. Lee’s attorney Chuck Peterson said earlier this year that Rush’s claims were “completely untrue.” McLean told the Idaho Statesman on Friday that she was having “conversations about management” and examining Lee’s role within the department. Boise City spokesperson Maria Weeg told KTVB: “It became clear to the mayor the department needed different leadership.” Lee’s resignation will take effect Oct. 14, but he will be placed on leave until then, city officials said in a statement. McLean has appointed retired officer Ron Winegar as acting chief.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Police filed eight felony counts Tuesday against a man who climbed five stories of a fire escape to infiltrate a police facility while officers were undergoing a SWAT training exercise. Donald Patrick, 47, of Waukegan, was charged with five counts of aggravated assault on a peace officer and three counts of burglary in the attack Monday at the facility in Homan Square on Chicago’s West Side. He’s due in bond court Wednesday. It wasn’t clear whether Patrick had an attorney who might comment on the charges. Patrick grabbed at least two guns before he was shot and wounded by an officer, police said. Patrick was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police Superintendent David Brown said the suspect was seen on video climbing the fire escape to the fifth floor, where a door had been propped open for ventilation because there are no windows. Brown said investigators believe the man grabbed at least two guns from a table and pointed them at officers. He said the guns did not contain live ammunition – they were either empty or contained munitions, such as pellets that are used for training exercises. Pellets sting but do not cause serious injury or death.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal judge has barred the state from enforcing a 2016 law’s provisions that require abortion clinics to either bury or cremate fetal remains, finding that they violate the U.S. Constitution. U.S. District Judge Richard L. Young ruled that the law’s requirements infringe on the religious and free speech rights of people who do not believe aborted fetuses deserve the same treatment as deceased people. “The Constitution prohibits ‘mechanisms, overt or disguised, designed to persecute or oppress a religion or its practices.’ The fetal disposition requirements are contrary to that principle,” Young wrote in Monday’s decision, which granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs who had sued the state. Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a defendant in the lawsuit, said Tuesday that his office will appeal the ruling. The lawsuit was filed in 2020 on behalf of the Women’s Med Group abortion clinic in Indianapolis, its owner, two nurse practitioners who work at the clinic and three women who are each listed only as Jane Doe. Shortly after the law was signed in 2016 by then-Gov. Mike Pence, Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky and the ACLU of Indiana sued the state over the law.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A federal judge has struck down the third attempt by the Iowa Legislature to stop animal welfare groups from secretly filming livestock abuse, finding once again that the law passed last year violates free speech rights in the U.S. Constitution. The decision Monday rejected the law approved by state lawmakers in April 2021 that makes it a crime to trespass on a property to place a camera to record or transmit images. The law, which had support from Republicans and some Democrats, made the first offense punishable by up to two years in prison and subsequent offenses a felony. The case is one of many so-called ag-gag laws that have surfaced in the U.S. in recent years that pit the right of farmers to protect their property from trespassers against animal welfare advocates. Farmers argue intruders could track in disease and want to unfairly portray their livestock practices, while animal welfare groups say producers don’t want the public to see how farm animals are treated. The lawsuit was filed in federal court Aug. 10, 2021, by animal rights groups the Animal Legal Defense Fund, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and Bailing Out Benji. They were joined by environmental and grassroots advocacy groups Food & Water Watch and Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Sunflower State is defending its honor after a big-city mayor claimed that “Kansas doesn’t have a brand.” New York Mayor Eric Adams said his city has a brand that’s recognizable around the world, unlike Kansas. “We have a brand,” he said. “New York has a brand. And when people see it, it means something. When we go there, it’s not ... Kansas doesn’t have a brand.” But Kansans took to social media Tuesday to challenge his assertion. For one, many noted, Superman – whose motto was “truth, justice and the American way” – didn’t grow up in New York City or even his adopted hometown, Metropolis, but in the also-fictional Smallville, Kansas. And the Plains state gets far more recognition these days in sports than its coastal counterpart. The New York Jets and Giants both posted 22-59 records (points for consistency) from 2017 to 2021. Basketball hasn’t been particularly relevant in New York since the 1970s. Right now, the Kansas and Kansas State football programs are making more national headlines than the Jets and Giants. The Jayhawks are off to their first 4-0 start in more than a decade, and the Wildcats just upset the No. 6 team in the country on the road. In April, Kansas basketball won its fourth NCAA championship in school history. Famous Kansans include Jason Sudeikis, Paul Rudd, Annette Benning, Janelle Monáe, Melissa Etheridge and Elvira, to name a few. Another common retort was that Kansas has created a brand identity through its association with “The Wizard of Oz,” in which a tornado leaves farm girl Dorothy Gale in the magical land of Oz, only to find that she most wants simply to go home.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Despite multiple lawsuits, expensive reviews and community outrage, the city’s police continue to pull over and search Black drivers at disproportionate rates. Since 2020, Black people have made up 33% of Louisville Metro Police Department traffic stops with a citation and 53% of searches while accounting for about 20% of the population 18 and older, an analysis of city data found. The disparities are consistent with previous analyses and independent reviews conducted since at least 2000. And as officials await results from a U.S. Justice Department investigation of the department, some community members say they’re proof LMPD’s self-imposed changes aren’t working. The mayor and police chief “did a city tour touting their reforms and their new policies, but that’s all theory,” said Khalilah Collins, a project manager for the DOVE Delegates pilot, which dispatches “community responders” trained in crisis intervention to some 911 calls. “The numbers aren’t changing and/or are getting worse.” Some law experts were reluctant to say the data indicates racial bias without knowing more information about why the stops happened and what their outcomes were. Still, LMPD officials acknowledge enforcement disparities exist and said the department is “making a serious investment into personnel and technology” that will allow it to better scrutinize traffic stops.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As the state continues to be plagued by a spiraling insurance crisis, with insurers leaving the state and canceling homeowner policies as thousands of claims remain unpaid following a series of hurricanes, Gov. John Bel Edwards will travel to London this week to meet with a leading insurance underwriter. During the economic development trip, the Democratic governor’s sixth international trip, Edwards will also meet with high-ranking executives of major energy companies, including Shell, to discuss the company’s expanding portfolio of clean energy investments. On Sunday he will attend the New Orleans Saints game, which is being played in London as part of the NFL’s annual International Series. “I am excited to be able to capitalize on this opportunity to represent Louisiana’s economic and cultural interests on the world stage,” Edwards said in a press release Tuesday. “Few states are more directly impacted by the insurance underwriting and energy markets than Louisiana, which is why it’s so important to maintain an open dialogue with global leaders in those sectors.” Following a series of damaging hurricanes in 2020 and 2021 – Delta, Laura, Zeta and Ida – more than 610,000 residential property claims were filed in Louisiana, according to Louisiana Department of Insurance data.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A bargain hunter who went to an estate sale in Maine to find a KitchenAid mixer, a bookshelf or vintage clothing walked away with a 700-year-old treasure. Instead of a kitchen appliance, Will Sideri stumbled upon a framed document hanging on a wall. It had elaborate script in Latin, with musical notes and gold flourishes. A sticker said 1285 AD. Based on what he’d seen in a manuscripts class at Colby College, the document looked downright medieval – and a bargain at $75. Academics confirmed the parchment was from The Beauvais Missal, used in the Beauvais Cathedral in France, and dated to the late 13th century. It was used about 700 years ago in Roman Catholic worship, they said. An expert on manuscripts said the document, first reported by the Maine Monitor, could be worth as much as $10,000. After spying the unusual manuscript, Sideri contacted his former Colby College professor, who was familiar with it because there’s another page in the college collection. The professor reached out to another academic who’d researched the document. They quickly confirmed the authenticity. The parchment was part of a prayer book and priests’ liturgy, said Lisa Fagin Davis, executive director of the Medieval Academy of America and a professor of manuscript studies at Simmons University in Boston. The full missal was once owned by William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper publisher, before being sold in the 1940s and, much to the consternation of today’s academics, divvied up into individual pages, she said.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: A woman who said she was left to give birth to her baby alone on the dirty, concrete floor of her jail cell last year filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday alleging jail nurses ignored her screams and pleas for help for six hours. Jazmin Valentine alleges some nurses working for the jail’s contracted medical provider, PrimeCare Medical Inc., said she was withdrawing from drugs, not in labor, and some jail staffers and medical staff laughed at her, saying she was just trying to get out of her cell late at night in July 2021 at the Washington County jail in Hagerstown. Valentine claims she punched the walls of her solitary confinement cell, which did not have blankets or sheets, during her most painful contractions and removed what she believed was her baby’s amniotic sac, sliding it under her cell door to prove she was about to have a baby. A fellow inmate, hearing her pleas, called Valentine’s boyfriend, who called the jail pleading with staffers to help her, the lawsuit said. The nurses also ignored a concern raised by a jail deputy about Valentine, but he did not contact any superiors, the lawsuit said. He discovered Valentine holding the baby girl in her cell about 15 minutes after she was born, and an ambulance was called to take them to the hospital, according to the lawsuit. Because of the unsanitary conditions in the cell, the baby developed a type of staph bacteria infection that is resistant to many antibiotics, the lawsuit said. Valentine, who had never given birth before, said she feared her baby would die, and she might bleed out.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Federal workplace safety regulators have proposed fining a subcontractor nearly $1.2 million in connection with the death of a worker during the demolition of a downtown Boston parking garage. The worker was operating an 11,000-pound excavator in the Government Center Garage on March 26 when an upper floor gave way, and he fell 80 feet to his death, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration said in a statement Tuesday. It was his first day on the job. The worker has previously been identified as Peter Monsini, 51, of Easton. An investigation found that JDC Demolition Co. Inc. violated the demolition plan by placing heavy equipment on partially demolished floor bays, OSHA said. JDC also failed to adequately train its workers on the demolition plan and safety management systems, OSHA said. In total, JDC was cited for 11 alleged violations. “JDC Demolition Company Inc. knew the heavy equipment on the partially demolished floors were over the weight limits and still allowed a worker, unaware of the hazards, to do demolition work,” OSHA Regional Administrator Galen Blanton said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Belle Isle Nature Center reopened Wednesday – with a $2.5million makeover – after being closed since March 2020. Located on 5 acres at the northeastern tip of Belle Isle State Park, the Belle Isle Nature Center boasts educational, environmental and natural experiences that help connect visitors with urban nature. Highlights of the upgraded facility include an expanded mudpuppy habitat, a replica Detroit sewer tunnel and a pollinator area that allows guests to see how bumblebees experience their world. “We are so proud of this new facility, and after more than two years of being closed, we are ready to show everyone what we have been working on,” Amy Greene, nature centers director for the Detroit Zoological Society, said in a news release. “We have so many new and exciting features for guests to explore.” The new experiences are designed to give visitors the opportunity to connect with nature while also learning how to celebrate and save wildlife and wild places found in their own backyards and communities. “The Belle Isle Nature Center is truly unique,” Greene said. “We’ve completely reimagined a new nature center that puts the focus on urban wildlife. Our intention is to reinforce the connections people have and the spaces they share with the nature that surrounds us.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Democratic Gov. Tim Walz has $3.2 million in cash on hand heading into the final weeks of the campaign, while Republican challenger Scott Jensen has $916,000 left in the bank. The Jensen campaign said it raised $1.8 million in the two-month reporting before Tuesday’s filing deadline to bring its total for the campaign cycle to $4.2 million. The campaign said in a statement Wednesday that it was a new record for a Minnesota GOP gubernatorial candidate, beating the $3.3 million that then-Gov. Tim Pawlenty raised for his 2006 campaign. The Walz campaign said it raised $1.73 million in the same period, which ended Sept. 20, for a grand total for the election cycle of $4.4 million. In other statewide races, Democratic Attorney General Keith Ellison’s campaign reported it had $923,000 in cash on hand after raising $996,000 since Jan. 1. GOP candidate Jim Schultz reported raising $775,000 this year and had $321,000 left. Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon had $967,000 in cash on hand after raising $799,000 this year, while Republican challenger Kim Crockett had $119,000 left after collecting $286,000.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Years before residents were left without running water for weeks, Gov. Tate Reeves claimed to have helped block money to fund water system repairs in the capital city. Reeves, a Republican, blames Jackson’s water crisis on mismanagement at the city level. The city’s latest water troubles are far from its first, stemming from decaying infrastructure beyond one water treatment plant. The EPA said 300 boil-water notices have been issued over the past two years in the city. As Reeves climbed Mississippi’s political ladder, he cited his opposition to financially helping the capital as evidence of his fiscal conservatism. Jackson-area lawmakers say the troubled water system is one example of Jackson’s status as a political punching bag for Republican officials, who control the Legislature and the state Bond Commission. “We operate under the golden rule here,” said Democratic Sen. John Horhn of Jackson. “And the golden rule is: He who has the gold makes the rules.” In Jackson, 80% of residents are Black, and 25% live in poverty. Repeated breakdowns made it unsafe for people to drink from their tap, brush their teeth and wash their dishes without boiling the water first. At a September news conference, Reeves said water service was restored to most of the city only after the state “stepped in” to provide emergency repairs.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A judge on Tuesday allowed a Christian boarding school to remain open for now, scheduling two days of hearings in October to determine its fate after multiple current and former students alleged widespread abuse. Cedar County Associate Circuit Judge Thomas Pyle’s ruling came a day after he took over the case involving Agape Boarding School in Stockton. The Missouri attorney general’s office had asked Pyle to close the school after requesting the new judge for the case previously presided over by Cedar County Circuit Judge David Munton. The state didn’t say why it sought a new judge. Pyle also approved the state’s request to again place Missouri Department of Social Services workers at Agape. On Monday, Munton lifted the order allowing state workers at the school. They had been there to monitor for abuse since Sept. 8. Two days of hearings to determine Agape’s fate are scheduled for Oct. 13-14. Agape’s attorney, John Schultz, said he was pleased with the judge’s decision allowing Agape to continue operating. “The students at Agape are not facing immediate harm as the State argued,” Schultz said in a statement. “We monitor the students 24/7 and will continue to do so with the DSS workers returning.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The public has been warned to stay out of the Missouri River during a rare Rainbow Reservoir drawdown. This week, the bed of the river in Great Falls will lie more exposed than it has in years. The sight above and below Rainbow Dam will be compelling, revealing riverbed features that are only rarely seen – as well as significant dangers. NorthWestern Energy and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks said in a statement last week that the utility would start drawing down the reservoir Sunday to replace leaky boards on the dam. According to NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Jo Dee Black, the 11-feet river drawdown will last approximately five days, and the reservoir upstream from Rainbow Dam is expected to back to full pool by Oct. 6. The public safety concern is not that some unwitting hiker might get swept away by a sudden release of water but rather that the exposed riverbed is unstable, slick and potentially dangerous. “When the river is drawn down there’s islands, things you can see in the river that you don’t see when the reservoir is at full pool,” Black said. “However, we want to caution people not to go onto the exposed riverbed. There will be deep mud and slippery rocks. Just because the river’s lower doesn’t mean that its safe to go out onto it.”\n\nNebraska\n\nChampion: A semitrailer collided with a school bus in southwestern Nebraska, injuring eleven children and the two drivers, officials said. The crash happened about 4 p.m. Tuesday on a rural highway near Champion when a bus dropping off children from school turned left in front of a semi loaded with grain, a news release from the Chase County Sheriff’s Office said. The grain truck hit the rear passenger side of the bus, causing the bus to spin and tip on its side, officials said. The truck was forced off the road and into a ditch. Eleven children ages 6 to 15 were on the bus, and all were taken to the Chase County hospital “with a wide range of injuries,” investigators said. Three of the children were later taken to regional trauma centers, the sheriff’s office said. The bus driver was a 39-year-old man from Champion, officials said, and the truck driver was a 20-year-old man from Venango. Both were taken to the Chase County hospital.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Authorities were searching Tuesday for a 42-year-old convicted bombmaker who escaped from a prison where he was serving a life sentence for a deadly 2007 explosion outside a Las Vegas Strip resort. Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered an investigation into the incident after he said late Tuesday that his office learned the escapee had been missing from the medium-security prison since early in the weekend. “This is unacceptable,” Sisolak said in a statement. Officials didn’t realize until Tuesday morning that Porfirio Duarte-Herrera was missing during a head count at Southern Desert Correctional Center near Las Vegas. A state Department of Corrections statement said search teams were looking for him. Duarte-Herrera, from Nicaragua, was convicted in 2010 of killing a hot dog stand vendor using a motion-activated bomb in a coffee cup atop a car parked at the Luxor hotel-casino. Records show his co-defendant, Omar Rueda-Denvers, remained in custody Tuesday. The 47-year-old from Guatemala is serving a life sentence at a different Nevada prison for murder, attempted murder, explosives and other charges. A Clark County District Court jury spared both men from the death penalty in the slaying of Willebaldo Dorantes Antonio, whom prosecutors identified as the boyfriend of Rueda-Denvers’ ex-girlfriend.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A 100-year-old woman who left high school to care for her brother during the Great Depression has been awarded an honorary diploma. Josephine Sad left Central High School in Manchester to take care of her younger brother while both of their parents worked. She later joined the Women’s Army Corps and served during World War II. Sad’s friend, Terry Seavey, shared her story with Mayor Joyce Craig, and a surprise award ceremony was held Tuesday. “When the mayor reached out, we were immediately on board,” said Jennifer Gillis, Manchester School District superintendent. “Mrs. Sad’s service to her family, community and country in times of need is inspiring.” According to Gillis, Sad shared her secret to a long life: “Never slow down.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A grand jury has indicted 14 corrections officers on charges stemming from what authorities said was a brutal attack in 2021 on inmates at the state’s only prison for women. The grand jury handed up the indictments after a more than yearlong investigation into the events at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility for Women, in the community of Clinton, Acting Attorney General Matt Platkin’s office said late Tuesday. Attorneys for the guards charged have said previously that they planned to fight the allegations in court. The charges include charges conspiracy, official misconduct, tampering with public records and aggravated assault, Platkin said. The indictments are the latest development in a state criminal probe that resulted in significant fallout, including the departure of the state’s corrections commissioner and Gov. Phil Murphy’s declaration that he will close the prison. A picture of what happened in January 2021 at the prison has emerged, based on accounts from law enforcement, videos released by authorities showing extractions of prisoners from their cells, and a report commissioned by the governor. One video clip, for example, showed five prison guards wearing helmets and chest, back and shoulder armor filing into a woman’s cell and punching her in the head. “Stop punching me in my face!” the woman calls out.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New state data shows New Mexico’s repeat rate for child abuse is among the worst in the country, a newspaper reports. The Albuquerque Journal said more than 40% of children in New Mexico who had a substantiated serious injury from physical abuse or neglect in fiscal year 2022 came from families who had a prior involvement with the state’s Children, Youth and Families Department in the preceding 12 months. A report by the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee said the Families Department “continues to underperform on targets for repeat maltreatment, maltreatment of foster care children, and serious injuries after protective services involvement,” and the state’s rates for repeat maltreatment “are among the worst in the nation.” Barbara Vigil, a retired New Mexico Supreme Court judge who became the Families Department’s secretary nearly a year ago, told the Journal that the agency is “incredibly proud of the ongoing improvements that are being made in our child welfare system … but we acknowledge that improvements must continue to be made.” Vigil said a key to reducing child maltreatment rates is strengthening the Families Department’s workforce including hiring and retaining employees.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Some historical battle reenactors are holding their musket fire because of worries about the state’s new gun rules – an unplanned side effect of a law designed to protect the public’s safety. The law that went into effect this month declares parks, government property and a long list of other “sensitive” places off limits to guns. The rules were geared more toward semi-automatic pistols than flintlock weapons, but reenactors who fear being arrested if they publicly restage battles from the Colonial era to the Civil War are staying off the field. Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration insists that historical battle reenactments are still OK, and some have still taken place this month. But persistent skepticism among event organizers and participants has resulted in some cancellations, like an 18th-century encampment and battle reenactment planned for last weekend north of Saratoga Springs. “We’ve been getting reports from units that were supposed to attend that they don’t feel comfortable transporting muskets or bringing muskets to the site,” said Harold Nicholson, a reenactor involved in the event at Rogers Island. “And so at that point, we decided that it was probably best not to (go ahead).”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The head of a national political action committee working to elect women who support abortion rights visited the state Tuesday, joining candidates she says must win this fall to block Republican attempts to enact more restrictions. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper also stood beside EMILY’s List President Laphonza Butler while warning the ability of women to control reproductive health choices at current standards will depend on General Assembly races. “I have seen in states across this country abortion under attack,” Butler said at a news conference outside state Democratic Party headquarters. “That’s why here in North Carolina, we know that these legislative races … are all difference makers in protecting abortion rights and protecting essential health care options for all women in this great state.” Republicans could earn veto-proof majorities if they win two more state Senate seats and three more state House seats, making it difficult for Cooper to derail abortion legislation with his veto stamp. The GOP-controlled Legislature hasn’t overridden any of Cooper’s nearly 50 vetoes since Democratic seat gains during the 2018 election took effect. “In North Carolina, women still have reproductive freedom,” Cooper said. “And as governor, I aim to keep it that way. But I cannot do it alone.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A one-of-a-kind construction and research project is using hemp in an effort to make healthier homes. Two small houses going up on the back half of a lot just off a busy street not far from downtown Fargo “are identical in blueprint – they’re 13 by 23, with 12-foot ceilings; there’s a loft in each of them,” said Grassroots Development president Justin Berg, the man behind the project. One of the houses is built with a traditional wood frame, with fiberglass insulation covered with a commonly seen shiny white house-wrap material. A second house a few feet away also has a wood frame, but the walls are filled with 12 inches of hempcrete, giving it a brown, textured look inside and out. The raw material, called hurd, is the inner, woody core of the hemp plant, chipped into small pieces. The hurd is mixed with a lime binder and water. “And we hand-packed, physically hand-packed, this entire house,” said Grassroots Development sustainability consultant Sydney Glup. They’re being guided through the process by Bismarck-based Homeland Hempcrete. These homes might become short-term rentals, but the primary purpose is research. “We’re just trying to get that concrete nonbiased research to contribute to the industry so we can troubleshoot and figure out how to do better,” Glup said. “We want it to be so that anybody who wants a healthier dwelling can afford it.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A judge extended a temporary block Tuesday on a state law banning virtually all abortions for an additional 14 days, further pausing a law that had taken effect after federal abortion protections were overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in June. The decision by Hamilton County Judge Christian Jenkins means pregnancy terminations through 20 weeks’ gestation may continue in Ohio through Oct. 12. Jenkins issued his first 14-day pause Sept. 14 in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU of Ohio on behalf of the state’s remaining abortion providers, finding their lawsuit was “substantially likely to prevail on the merits.” The action argues that the abortion ban violates protections in the state constitution guaranteeing individual liberty and equal protection. It also says the law is unconstitutionally vague. The law signed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in April 2019 prohibits most abortions after the first detectable “fetal heartbeat.” Cardiac activity can be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many people know they’re pregnant. The law had been blocked through a legal challenge, then went into effect after the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision was overturned. Jenkins has scheduled the next hearing in the case for Oct. 7.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The University of Oklahoma Medical Center confirmed Wednesday that it is planning to stop offering some gender-affirming medical treatments after state lawmakers threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding earmarked for the University Hospitals Authority. The Republican-controlled Legislature, which returned for a special session Wednesday to appropriate $1.87 billion in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds, has already targeted transgender young people with new laws that restrict their ability to play sports or use school bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. Transgender medical treatment for children and teens is increasingly under attack in many Republican-led states, labeled child abuse and subject to criminalizing bans. But it has been available in the United States for more than a decade and is endorsed by major medical associations. “The OU Health Senior Leadership team is proactively planning the ceasing of certain gender medicine services across our facilities and that plan is already under development,” OU Health said in a statement. A spokeswoman for OU Health declined to say which services the center was planning to stop offering.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A renewable energy plant being commissioned Wednesday that combines solar power, wind power and massive batteries to store the energy generated there is the first utility-scale plant of its kind in North America. The project, which will generate enough electricity to power a small city at maximum output, addresses a key challenge facing the utility industry as the U.S. transitions away from fossil fuels and increasingly turns to solar and wind farms for power. Wind and solar are clean sources of power, but utilities have been forced to fill in gaps when the wind isn’t blowing or the sun shining with fossil fuels like coal or natural gas. At the Oregon plant, massive lithium batteries will store up to 120 megawatt-hours of power generated by the 300-megawatt wind farms and 50-megawatt solar farm so it can be released to the electric grid on demand. At maximum output, the facility will produce more than half of the power that was generated by Oregon’s last coal plant, which was demolished earlier this month. On-site battery storage isn’t new, and interest in solar-plus-battery projects in particular has soared in the U.S. in recent years due to robust tax credits and incentives and the falling price of batteries. The Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility in Oregon, however, is the first in the U.S. to combine integrated wind, solar and battery storage at such a large scale in one location, giving it even more flexibility to generate continuous output without relying on fossil fuels to fill in the gaps.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Mifflin: A western Pennsylvania amusement park announced new security measures Wednesday following a shooting that wounded three people, including two teenagers. Kennywood Park officials said the measures would include more police, more security along perimeter fences, limits on bag sizes and masks covering faces, and required adult chaperones for all juveniles at all times during the park’s Phantom Fall Fest, scheduled to run until mid-October. Park officials declined to discuss the investigation into the shooting shortly before 11 p.m. Saturday that followed an altercation between two groups of teenagers near the Musik Express ride at the park in West Mifflin, southeast of Pittsburgh. A male wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and a dark-colored mask was being sought. Park officials said Wednesday that they have doubled the number of police hired for each night of Phantom Fall Fest and will require adult chaperones at least 21 years old for everyone under 17 who enters the park at any time during the event. Chaperones had previously been required only after 4 p.m. Officials said they have cut down trees along the perimeter fence to improve visibility and are installing new floodlights and security cameras that will completely cover the fence line, also vowing to “significantly” increase security patrols.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is ramping up investments in clean transportation as consumers take advantage of rebates for electric cars and the state expands the network of charging stations. In the first two months of the reinstated DRIVE EV program, which offers incentives of up to $4,500 to buy electric vehicles, the state Office of Energy Resources has approved 54 applications. Interest has risen since the July 7 launch date of the program that provides funding for both new and used cars, particularly since passage last month of climate legislation in Congress that will expand a federal tax rebate for EVs. “It picked up in August, and we’ve been very busy this month as well with applications,” said Sara Canabarro, administrator of clean transportation for the energy office. The work to green the transportation sector is key to meeting the state’s climate goals. Transportation accounts for 35% of Rhode Island’s greenhouse gas emissions. If the state is to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, as required with the passage last year of the Act on Climate, it will require a big investment in electric cars.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A church that was painted pink with the word “Trap” written above it by a real estate developer is listed for sale for $2.5 million, leaving some locals feeling betrayed and angry. The former Bibleway Full Gospel Missionary Baptist Church property, sold for $425,000 in April, is now listed on LoopNet as available for “redevelopment in booming West Greenville.” The listing came after developer Ron Rallis heard concerns from residents about gentrification. Now neighbors of the property fear that’s exactly what would be spurred by the sale Rallis seeks. On July 30, he held an impromptu “community forum” where he addressed his painting of the closed church, as well as personal concerns he’s made public on social media, podcasts and media outlets about claims that he was falsely accused and arrested for two felonies. In a video posted on Instagram on Aug. 4, he expressed willingness to work with neighbors in his efforts to redevelop the property but included a statement that struck a nerve with some: “Daddy is here to make money.” Restaurant owner Dayna Lee said that statement “made it very clear to me that not only did I waste a lot of time ever giving him the benefit of the doubt, he turned a historically Black church into an eyesore because he doesn’t care.” She believes Rallis used the forums “as tools to deceive everyone that attended. He wasted their time and never was committed to being anything more than a publicity stunt in the first place.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem made a campaign promise Wednesday to repeal the state’s tax on groceries, changing course to lend outspoken support to a bipartisan proposal she did not publicly endorse in March. The Republican governor made the announcement two days ahead of a Friday debate with Democratic challenger Jamie Smith, a state lawmaker who pushed the repeal of the 4.5% tax on groceries for years and helped broker a bipartisan vote to pass it in the House this year. Noem billed the campaign promise Wednesday as “the largest tax cut in South Dakota’s history,” saying it would push $100 million “directly to families to help them with their budget.” But Smith said the campaign promise was “just another example of Gov. Noem trying to manipulate the voters of South Dakota by proposing a policy she clearly didn’t believe in and is doing it for her political gains at this moment.” A spokesman for Noem’s campaign, Ian Fury, said Noem had privately voiced support for the grocery tax cut bill to Senate leadership during budget negotiations. At the time, Republican state Sen. Lee Schoenbeck, one of the most powerful lawmakers in the chamber, had said the House proposal was dead on arrival in the Senate. He said in a text message that he remains opposed to the tax cut. Schoenbeck also told The Dakota Scout that Noem, even in a private conversation in March, was “adamantly opposed” to the House proposal.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A man already charged with a fatal shooting that police said set off a daylong crime rampage now faces murder charges in two more killings, officials said Wednesday. Ezekiel Kelly, 19, was indicted Tuesday on two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of Richard Clark and Allison Parker, the Shelby County district attorney’s office said. Kelly already has been charged with fatally shooting Dewayne Tunstall in the head outside a home in east Memphis. At least three witnesses saw Kelly shoot Tunstall about 1 a.m. Sept. 7, according to a police affidavit. Clark and Parker were shot later that day, as Kelly was driving around Memphis, livestreaming some of his activities and leading officers on a citywide manhunt, police said. Police said three other people were wounded in the shootings. The indictment also charges Kelly with attempted first-degree murder and more than 20 other charges, including reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon, commission of an act of terrorism, theft of property and evading arrest. The shootings had police warning Memphians to shelter in place, locking down a baseball stadium and university campuses and suspending public bus services. Kelly was arrested after crashing a stolen car while fleeing police.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A Jewish death row inmate who was part of a gang of prisoners who fatally shot a police officer in 2000 after they had escaped is one step closer to getting a new trial after prosecutors agreed with defense claims that the judge who presided over his case held antisemitic views. Lawyers for Randy Halprin have contended that former Judge Vickers Cunningham in Dallas used racial slurs and antisemitic language to refer to the inmate and some of his co-defendants. Halprin, 45, was among the inmates, known as the “Texas 7,” who escaped from a South Texas prison in December 2000 and then committed numerous robberies, including the one in which they shot 29-year-old Irving police Officer Aubrey Hawkins 11 times, killing him. During a three-day hearing in August in Dallas, several witnesses, including Cunningham’s brother and two lifelong family friends, testified that the former judge had frequently used antisemitic and racial slurs before and after Halprin’s 2003 trial in reference to him and several of the other escaped inmates. One witness testified when Cunningham ran for district attorney in 2005, she heard him say he was running for office to save Dallas County from Latinos, Black and Jewish people, but using racial slurs to refer to these groups of individuals, according to court documents.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utahns often rate among the friendliest and most polite in state-by-state rankings, but there is a glaring exception on Beehive State roadways, according to a new survey. Utah motorists rank as the worst in the U.S. when it comes to road rage, according to nationwide survey work published last week by Forbes Advisor, a consumer services advice company based in New Jersey. More than half of Utah residents surveyed said they had been on the receiving end of a rude or offensive gesture while driving, including a highest-in-the-nation 76% who said they had been the target of a honk. Utah drivers were also the second most likely to say they had been tailgated (73%). About 27% said they knew someone who had been injured due to a road rage incident. The survey was conducted with more than 5,000 U.S. car owners last month, including at least 100 in every state, according to Forbes Advisor, which commissioned the survey work from the research company OnePoll. The companies said the margin of error was plus or minus 2.2 percentage points, with a confidence interval of 95%. “Overall, 85% of drivers surveyed said they’ve experienced at least one form of road rage,” according to the authors. “Some instances, like frustrated honking, may be fairly innocuous, but other forms can have far more severe consequences.”\n\nVermont\n\nBrattleboro: Three police officers will not face charges in the fatal shooting of a person of interest in a suspected homicide who charged at two of the officers with a knife, the offices of the state attorney general’s office and a county prosecutor announced Tuesday. A Brattleboro police officer and two Vermont State Police detective sergeants on July 19 were pursuing Matthew Davis, who was a person of interest in the death of his ex-girlfriend, a Massachusetts woman who was found dead in her truck in Brattleboro with a suspected gunshot wound earlier that day. Family members had reported her missing, and foul play was suspected on the part of Davis, who had a criminal history including assault to kill, according to the attorney general and county prosecutor’s office. One of the officers had spotted Davis walking on a Brattleboro road, but he fled. The three officers then found him in culvert under a bridge, which he fled, refusing orders to stop. Officers confronted him in nearby woods. One officer yelled that Davis had a knife. They ordered him 10 times to drop the knife, but he refused, according to the release. After one officer asked Davis, “Why did you kill her?” he then ran out from behind a tree with the knife and charged downhill toward two officers, they said. All three officers fired their weapons.\n\nVirginia\n\nPetersburg: A new documentary explores the history of a hospital founded in Richmond in 1870 as the world’s first mental institution for Black people, in a state that had also established the first state mental hospital in the nation in 1773. When the American Psychiatric Association celebrated its 175th anniversary three years ago in San Francisco, it featured photographs of two Virginia mental institutions that contributed to its birth – what are now Eastern State and Western State hospitals. Former Virginia Mental Health Commissioner King Davis, a featured speaker, was struck by the absence of another state mental institution, now known as Central State Hospital, near Petersburg. “They had no idea,” Davis said, even though the association awarded him its coveted Benjamin Rush Award for his work to preserve and digitize more than 800,000 records and 36,000 photographs documenting a century of the hospital’s past. During a recent reception, the American Psychiatric Association Foundation saluted the archives project by showing the documentary, “Central Lunatic Asylum for the Colored Insane,” and giving tours of an exhibition of documents from the archives. The film was written, directed and produced by Virginia Commonwealth University professor Shawn Utsey.\n\nWashington\n\nSkykomish: A section of U.S. Highway 2 is again closed because of the Bolt Creek Fire burning near the roadway. Three miles of the highway were closed Monday night, and officials extended the closure to 4 miles Tuesday morning, KING 5 News reports. On Tuesday, U.S. 2 was closed between Northeast Old Cascade Highway and 747th Avenue Northeast in Skykomish, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation. The department tweeted a video showing crews working in smoky conditions cutting down burnt trees near the roadway. The fire burning since Sept. 10 has grown to an estimated 17.7 square miles. Some evacuation orders remained in effect. A 13-mile stretch of U.S. 2 had reopened Saturday after a fire-related, weeks­long closure. Officials said hot and dry conditions Monday slightly increased fire behavior, which resulted in more wildfire smoke in the area. Air quality in western Washington was moderate with some areas experiencing short spikes of air quality that was unhealthy for sensitive groups, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: A new children’s hospital at West Virginia University is finally opening. Officials held a ribbon-cutting Saturday in Morgantown for the new WVU Medicine Children’s Hospital. The 150-bed, $215 million facility will open Thursday. Plans to build the hospital were announced in 2017 due to rising demand for primary and specialty services for children and women. Officials say the existing children’s facility’s four care units were operating at an average daily capacity above 70%, with just one or two beds available at some times. Officials say the new hospital includes a significantly larger care team, a pediatric emergency department, the state’s only Level IV neonatal intensive care unit and a spa-like birthing center.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Complaints against nursing homes continue to pile up and could surpass a record number filed last year as the state struggles to find enough nurses and nursing home inspectors. State officials have contracted with two private companies – Healthcare Management Solutions and Long Term Care Institute, Inc. – to help inspect nursing homes that have complaints against them. The rise in complaints comes as the nursing home industry continues to deal with the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which in some cases has left facilities without enough staff to properly care for residents. Approximately two out of every five nursing homes in Wisconsin reported a shortage of nurses earlier this month, worse than during the height of the pandemic, according to data submitted by the facilities to the federal government. Wisconsin has received more than 1,500 complaints against nursing homes so far this year, or about 190 new complaints each month, according to numbers from the state Department of Health Services. The state last year received an average of 165 per month, for a total of 1,984 complaints.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The Biden administration has finally responded to the state’s plan for a federally funded network of electric vehicle chargers, but few of the exemptions Wyoming officials requested were granted, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. States have access to money from a bipartisan infrastructure bill signed by President Joe Biden, but the federal government required that the charging stations be no farther than 50 miles apart and no more than a mile away from highway exits. The program envisions expanding the range of electric vehicles by building up the infrastructure to support them, removing disincentivizes to adoption for people who live in or travel to more rural areas. Wyoming had sought exceptions to the distance requirements in some less-populated areas, but the administration only approved a few, according to the newspaper. It told state officials they had given “insufficient justification” for leaving longer spans of highway unserved by chargers and denied the request for a new station being built farther from Interstate 80 to count toward the network.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/01/26/ice-castles-mirage-volcano-stolen-puppies-news-around-states/49720973/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabama motorists are about to have new license plate designs added to their options on Feb. 1, and three plate designs are being retired. The new plates are for the Alabama Poultry Foundation, Sickle Cell Awareness and Troy University, according to AL.com. Also available on Feb. 1 will be an Alabama Audubon “Protect Our Birds” tag. Most of the proceeds of the tag - $41.25 of its $50 cost – will go to Alabama Audubon to support bird conservation. Discontinued are the Rotary International, Civitan International and Square/Round Dancing plates.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: Police are investigating vandalism at a Russian cemetery in Sitka. Police are investigating vandalism at the Russian Cemetery. About 20 headstones were knocked over or damaged and Russian Orthodox crosses were broken and left the ground, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reported. Police were informed of the vandalism Friday by the cemetery’s caretaker, Bob Sam, who had last checked the cemetery a week before. Wooden crosses were destroyed, numerous cement headstones were pushed off their bases, statues on top of headstones were toppled and glass vases were broken, Sitka Police Department spokesperson Serena Wild said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Phoenix Public Transit Department has received a $920,000 grant to manage the planning of 11 stations along a 5-mile streetcar route that would connect four activity centers in Mesa. The money from the Transit-Oriented Development Planning grant will be used to conduct extensive planning efforts, determine design guidelines and establish economic strategies, according to Mesa officials. The route would connect Riverview Marketplace, Asian District, Fiesta District and downtown Mesa when it’s completed, the officials said. The Valley Metro Tempe Street Car Project was allocated $17.4 million last June under the American Rescue Plan to advance the 3-mile streetcar plan with 14 stations and six vehicles.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A University of Arkansas professor pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI about patents he had for inventions in mainland China. Simon Saw-Teong Ang pleaded guilty in federal court in Fayetteville to one count from a 58-count federal indictment. Prosecutors said 24 patents bearing Ang’s name were filed with the Beijing government but that he failed to report the patents to the university and denied having them when questioned by the FBI. The university requires disclosure of all faculty patents, which the university would own. The plea deal called for a one-year prison sentence, but the crime could be punishable by up to five years in prison. The 64-year-old Fayetteville resident was suspended from the university faculty when he was initially indicted in July 2020. The university website no longer lists him on its faculty directory.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The descendants of Native American tribes on the northern California coast are reclaiming a bit of their heritage that includes ancient redwoods that have stood since their ancestors walked the land. Save the Redwoods League planned to announce Tuesday that it is transferring more than 500 acres on the Lost Coast to the InterTribal Sinkyone Wilderness Council. The group of 10 tribes that have inhabited the area for thousands of years will be responsible for protecting the land dubbed Tc’ih-Léh-Dûñ, or “Fish Run Place,” in the Sinkyone language. Priscilla Hunter, chairwoman of the Sinkyone Council, said it’s fitting they will be caretakers of the land where her people were removed or forced to flee before the forest was largely stripped for timber. The transfer marks a step in the growing Land Back movement to return Indigenous homelands to the ancestors of those who lived there for millennia before European settlers arrived. The league first worked with the Sinkyone council when it transferred a 164-acre plot nearby to the group in 2012. The league recently paid $37 million for a scenic 5-mile stretch of the rugged and forbidding Lost Coast from a lumber company to protect it from logging and open it to the public.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Student enrollment has continued declining across Colorado public schools, with the state counting about 1,200 fewer students in kindergarten through 12th grade this fall than last year, when enrollment in preschool through high school plunged by about 30,000 students. State officials largely attributed last year’s enrollment slump – which was the first of its kind reported in more than 30 years – to parents’ pandemic-driven decisions. Many held off on enrolling kids in preschool and kindergarten and other families switched to homeschooling or online education programs. And the Colorado Department of Education, which on Wednesday released enrollment numbers from a count conducted in October, expected that enrollment numbers would increase again within the next few years. But the dip in K-12 students this year points to an underlying issue that has nothing to do with the pandemic: declining birth rates. Declining numbers could spell financial trouble for some school districts, because district budgets are largely determined by pupil counts.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Three Connecticut breweries have closed or announced closings within the last month because of the pandemic, and a fourth announced it is leaving its current space and assessing options for the future. It’s a blow to an industry that has been thriving in the state in recent years and it reflects a nationwide trend. Sales of craft beer dropped more than 9% in 2020, according to the Brewers Association. Brewery owners told the New Haven Register they faced challenges from an overall decline in taproom business to having to comply with the state’s post-lockdown requirement that they also serve food. 30 Mile Brewery, which opened in 2016, announced it is closing recently on its Facebook page. Better Half Brewing of Bristol closed on Dec. 31 and Shebeen Brewing Company in Wolcott also is closing its taproom, the Register reported. Taproom sales are especially important for small breweries that might not be able to make enough money from selling their products wholesale, William da Silva, a founder of Derby’s Bad Sons Beer Co., told the Register.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Surf-fishing permits for 2022 will got on sale starting Feb. 1 after a nationwide supply chain disruptions pushed back the sale dates, which are usually around the winter holidays, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control said. Sales for surf-fishing permits will begin at 10 a.m. Feb. 1, and annual passes for the Delaware State Parks will go on sale at 10 a.m. Feb. 15. The annual passes allow visitors to access the parks for the entire fee season from March 1 to Nov. 30, and surf-fishing permits allow people to drive onto designated sections of Delaware State Parks beaches for fishing. An annual pass costs $35 for a Delaware registered vehicle and $70 for an out-of-state vehicle. A Delawarean can get an annual surf-fishing permit for $90, and an out-of-state angler can get it for $180. First-time permit holders must also obtain a surf-fishing plate on which they will affix their surf-fishing permit decal. Beyond drive-on beach access, the decal grants entrance into the other state parks without paying the daily entrance fee.

Keepers at the National Zoo’s small mammal house reported for duty on Jan. 4 to discover Beatrix had given birth overnight. Now 2 weeks old, zoo staff said the prickly little one is doing well. The porcupette has bonded with its mom and is nursing well and gaining weight, keepers said. “Our team is looking forward to learning if the newborn will take after Beatrix, who is relaxed and easy-going, or be more active and curious like Quillbur,” the zoo said in a social media post. It’s not known whether the new bundle of spiny joy is a boy or a girl. Newborn porcupettes look anatomically similar until they are about 6 months old, staff said. Keepers sent quill samples to scientists at the Zoo’s Center for Conservation Genomics for DNA analysis. They should know the newborn’s sex in a few weeks. Quillbur and Beatrix gave birth to their first offspring back in 2019, soon after Quillbur came to the National Zoo. After a naming contest that year, the son was named Quilliam. Quilliam and this newborn porcupine are the fourth generation of this family to live in the small mammal house\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville:Data released by the International Shark Attack File said Florida ranked No. 1 in the world for unprovoked shark bites in 2021. Florida had 28 unprovoked bites last year, compared to 19 in the rest of the U.S. and is consistent with Florida’s most recent five-year annual average of 25 attacks. Of Florida’s 28 unprovoked bites, 17 were in Volusia County, which includes Daytona Beach. Researchers with the ISAF, which is a division of the University of Florida’s Florida Museum of Natural History, scour media reports for news of shark bites, include reports from field researchers and verify with medical personnel the veracity of the information. “Unprovoked attacks” are defined as incidents in which a live human is bitten in the shark’s natural habitat with no human provocation of the shark, according to the report. “Provoked attacks” occur when a human initiates interaction with a shark in some way, including spearfishers, divers that harassed or tried to touch sharks, people that tried to feed, unhook or remove sharks from a fishing net.\n\nGeorgia\n\nGriffin: A pastor has denied he was holding people against their will in an unlicensed group home. However, police have charged Curtis Keith Bankston and his wife, Sophia Simm-Bankston, with false imprisonment in connection with the operation. Police said the couple at times locked as many as eight people in the basement, seizing control of their finances. Police said earlier this week city firefighters responded on Jan. 13 to a report of a person having a seizure at the location and found people were in a deadbolted basement, with paramedics climbing through a window to reach a patient. Police said they found the residents were all mentally or physically disabled and the Bankstons also controlled their medications and had denied medical care to residents. Dexter Wimbish, Curtis Keith Bankston’s attorney, told local news outlets on Thursday that his client hadn’t committed a crime. Police said the couple disguised the home as a ministry of Bankston’s church called One Step of Faith 2nd Chance. Investigators said the couple locked residents in the basement during parts of the day. Police said all the residents were moved to new homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: A reinforced fence has been installed around Kahului Airport on Maui after a deer blocked a runway earlier this month. Vinyl fencing now overlaps an existing wood fence surrounding the airport to prevent deer from squeezing through, Maui District Airports Manager Marvin Moniz told The Maui News. The added barrier installed for an estimated $100,000 will prevent a “small kitten” from getting through, Moniz said. Workers also cut brush growing along the fence to make it less appealing for hungry deer, Moniz said. Tens of thousands of invasive axis deer roam Maui. At one time, up to 700 axis deer were spotted around the perimeter of the airport fence, Moniz said, but that number has since reduced to about 300 as they move more north seeking greener pastures and water. Deer herds have also trampled trees and brush around the Molokai Airport. Gov. David Ige recently extended through March 7 an emergency disaster declaration for Maui County so the state can take measures to reduce and control the deer.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin asked legislative budget writers for $29,000 in taxpayer money to cover legal fees incurred after she lost a public records lawsuit. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July after several journalists said she wrongly denied public record requests for materials relating to her new Education Task Force. McGeachin lost the lawsuit, with the judge saying she acted in “bad faith” in denying access to the public documents. He ordered her to release the records and pay the Idaho Press Club’s legal fees, which came in just below $29,000. McGeachin hired a private attorney to represent her in the case rather than using the Idaho Attorney General’s office. That work cost her an additional unknown amount in legal fees, but she told the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee on Wednesday she was still “auditing” that bill, the Idaho Statesman reported.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man known as the “Dreadhead Cowboy” has pleaded guilty to animal cruelty in connection with a rush-hour horseback ride he took along Chicago’s Dan Ryan Expressway in 2020. Adam Hollingsworth pleaded guilty Friday to aggravated animal cruelty and was sentenced to a year in prison by a Cook County judge, court records showed. With credit he earned while on electronic home monitoring as his case was pending, Hollingsworth could be released from the Cook County Jail as early as Monday. Hollingsworth was arrested in September 2020 after disrupting traffic on the Dan Ryan Expressway while galloping his horse, Nunu, amid rush hour traffic in an act of civil disobedience he said was intended to draw attention to gun violence against children. Hollingsworth’s ride resulted in extensive delays on the expressway, with traffic backed up for miles. Officials initially said the horse was so severely injured by the 8-mile ride on asphalt that it might have to be euthanized, but Nunu was later reported to have significantly recovered.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: A historic barn that once housed elephants and tigers from well-known circuses and now is home to the International Circus Hall of Fame museum is in need of emergency repairs. Bob Cline, treasurer of the nonprofit hall of fame, said volunteers discovered in December that a main beam supporting an upper wall of the structure had rotted completely and given way, the Kokomo Tribune reported. The barn was built in 1922 by the American Circus Corporation. It is among several structures located east of Peru, in northern Indiana, that once served as the winter quarters for the world’s largest circuses, including Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey. The hall of fame has been working for years to preserve the structures. Cline said the $4,200 to repair the barn’s beam is just the “tip of the iceberg” of what needs to be done. The group is seeking donations to help cover costs for the project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The Red Bull Soapbox Race – an extreme soapbox derby for adults – will make its Iowa debut this summer. Red Bull promotes several extreme sports to publicize its energy drink line and give consumers “wings.” Its soapbox race is similar to the traditional version for children in that carts coast downhill, but the Red Bull Soapbox Race challenges “the most fearless, fun-loving and foolhardy teams to prototype and create the wackiest of rides” using homemade carts, according to its website. Sponsors include West Des Moines-based Hy-Vee and Ankeny-based Casey’s. Casey’s plans to set up a committee that will look for the best “hometown racers” celebrating where racers are from and what they love about Casey’s. Winning hometown racers will receive free Casey’s pizza for a year. The Des Moines event will take place June 18, with the course running along East Walnut Street just south of the state Capitol, from East 12th to East 7th streets. Those interested in entering a cart for the race can apply now.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:Clipeez salon is catering to the needs of children and parents, with child-friendly salon chairs that look like firetrucks, airplanes and more. Owner Amanda Rice, who has been a stylist for almost a decade, said she has dreamed of opening a business like Clipeez since she was in beauty school. Rice said she has learned tricks over the years to help children feel at ease while getting their hair cut. With two children of her own, she knows haircuts can be a stressful experience for some children. Rice’s small customers also are greeted with a play area that includes a chalkboard wall for drawing, child-sized tables and chairs, and a variety of toys and activities to keep them busy while they wait. Although Clipeez is a child-focused salon, Rice said customers of all ages are welcome. Parents can schedule a haircut for themselves, knowing their child will be entertained during the appointment. Rice is the only stylist taking appointments at Clipeez but is in the process of hiring additional help. She said she hopes to add five to six stylists to her team so Clipeez can offer walk in appointment options in the future.\n\nKentucky\n\nLivermore: This city in western Kentucky has become certified as the 25th trail town in the state, officials said. Livermore in McLean County received its certification from the Kentucky Department of Tourism, officials said in a statement. The tourism and economic development program provides a strategic plan for communities, which commit to sharing outdoor opportunities, culture, history and stories with visitors looking for adventure, the Kentucky Department of Tourism said. Livermore offers paddling on the Rough and Green rivers and cycling on three new routes, officials said. “There are thousands of miles of trails and waterways throughout the commonwealth,” Department of Tourism Commissioner Mike Mangeot said. “These trail towns offer the perfect destination for long-distance adventures or day trips and we are excited to have Livermore join the other 24 destinations who have received this designation.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A worker on a crew replacing corroded grating on an oil platform wasn’t wearing his safety lifeline when he fell to his death off Louisiana in May 2020, the federal offshore safety agency said. The man stood on grating after he and another worker had cut through its metal crossbars so it could be removed in sections, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said. He died after falling 50 feet. The job safety plan said such cutting, called ripping, should be done in sections but the crew “proceeded to rip the entirety of the work area,” weakening it, according to the report. Workers had set out the safety gear called a self-retracting lanyard but didn’t put it on, the report said. The rig operator and the man’s supervisors also contributed to the accident, the agency said. The man was not identified. His employer, Fluid Crane and Construction Co. of New Iberia, had no comment. The rig’s operator, Fieldwood Energy LLC, is reorganizing under a bankruptcy court administrator. Its website shows only the administrator as a contact. Neither the administrator nor Fieldwood’s bankruptcy attorneys responded to emails requesting comment.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Maine wildlife managers will soon start accepting applications for the 2022 moose hunt, which will follow a year in which hunters had limited success. Tens of thousands of hunters typically apply for a spot in the state moose permit lottery. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife said it will start accepting applications in February. The lottery typically happens in June and then the hunt is in the fall. The wildlife department said 68% of hunters killed a moose during the 2021 hunt. That was the third-lowest success rate in the four-decade history of the modern hunt, the Bangor Daily News reported.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:New housing in Ocean City is scheduled to be built at Philadelphia Avenue and Dolphin Street. On Friday, SVN Miller announced that Dolphin Street Development has purchased the corner parcel and plans to build 22 “upscale townhomes” on the property. Dolphin Street Development Owner Jeff Thaler isn’t a stranger to Ocean City development and has completed numerous projects in the area. SVN Miller’s release did not say when construction would begin. This announcement came a month after the Ocean City Town Council approved conceptual plans to build workforce housing between Somerset and Dorchester streets.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMethuen: The city’s first female firefighter has been promoted to captain after a state board ruled in her favor, saying she was passed over for a promotion because of her gender and favoritism in the department. City officials approved Tracy Blanchette’s promotion to captain of the Methuen Fire Department at the request of Fire Chief Tim Sheehy, The Eagle-Tribune reported Friday. The promotion followed the Civil Service Commission’s ruling in November that stated Blanchette was passed over for a promotion from private to captain because of her gender. According to Blanchette and witnesses who testified before the commission, the department fostered an environment of “mutual back-scratching employment culture” among male firefighters. The commission also ruled that Blanchette receive back pay at a captain’s salary dating back to February 2019, when she was passed over for the promotion. Blanchette also filed a sexual discrimination suit against the city in November 2020, seeking $2.75 million in damages, the newspaper reported.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Clair Shores: It’s rusty and no longer needed, but a 165-foot water tower still has fans in a Detroit suburb. St. Clair Shores City Council member David Rubello wants to save the tower, which stands at the city’s golf course, The Macomb Daily reported. The tower was built in the 1920s to improve water pressure in the community but now is obsolete. To some, it’s a local landmark that deserves love. “I hate to see any part of the history of St. Clair Shores destroyed,” Rubello said. “If the people of our community can come together and save this tower, that would be amazing and a win.” He has proposed finding a company that would pay to repair it in exchange for placing advertising on the tower. It could cost roughly $400,000 – 10 times the cost to demolish it. Tall structures can be converted into wireless phone towers, but the area appears to be covered. “It has become part of the landscape. Sadly, demolition looks to be the proper choice,” said Chris Rayes, community development and inspections director. The council voted to table the issue for six months.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A state appeals court on Monday issued a mixed opinion in a complicated case contesting one of the key permits that a St. Paul-based company needs to build what would be the state’s first copper-nickel mine. The Minnesota Court of Appeals reversed a decision by regulators to issue the PolyMet Mining Corp. a water quality permit for the project. It now goes back to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to determine whether any pollution discharges from the mine into groundwater would violate the federal Clean Water Act. However, the three-judge panel rejected several other arguments from PolyMet’s opponents. Among them, there was a demand for more stringent limits on the treated wastewater that’s discharged from the mine and a call for a contested case hearing to gather more evidence and testimony on certain aspects of the permit before a neutral judge, Minnesota Public Radio News reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson:Parts of Mississippi’s capital city have had little or no water pressure in recent days because of broken pipes and problems at a water treatment plant. Areas with higher elevation in south Jackson have been most affected. Problems started Thursday after a major water main broke, and other water lines have broken since then, the Clarion-Ledger reported. On Monday, low water pressure forced four Jackson public schools to have classes online instead of in person and students from four elementary schools were sent to other campuses. City engineer Charles Williams told news outlets he expected crews to make significant progress in restoring service this week. “We are seeing improvements and will continue to see those improvements over the next couple of days,” Williams said during a news conference Monday. “We just ask for patience from our residents. We know they’re frustrated with this, especially in south Jackson.” Multiple pipes broke when temperatures dropped below freezing. The city had problems with a membrane system at a treatment plant, which delayed the crews’ ability to fully restore water pressure to all residents, WAPT-TV reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: Eastern Missouri prosecutors have refiled a felony terrorist threat charge against a man accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people while he was dressed as the Batman villain known as The Joker. St. Louis County prosecutors refiled the charge Friday against Jeremy Garnier, 50, of University City, a day after a judge dismissed the case because prosecutors could not produce a key witness for the grand jury, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Garnier was arrested in March 2020 in a University City restaurant in the midst of his livestream. In it, prosecutors said, he was dressed as The Joker and ordered a soda in the restaurant, saying: “I can’t be inebriated when I’m planning on, you know, killing a bunch of people.” Garnier’s costume and alleged threats were reminiscent of a 2012 shooting in Aurora, Colorado, in which 12 people were killed and dozens injured during the showing of the Batman movie “The Dark Knight Rises.” Shooter James Holmes, who was dressed as The Joker during the shooting, received multiple life sentences after a jury couldn’t agree unanimously on a death sentence.\n\nMontana\n\nRonan: The Flathead Water Compact officially got in gear managing one of the Flathead Indian Reservation’s most valuable assets, water rights on the 1.3 million-acre reservation. On Thursday, four new board members took their seats and outlined the rules for granting, managing and enforcing the water rights, which include drinking-water wells, irrigation water, river flows, wetlands, high-mountain lakes, and some of the reservoir behind Hungry Horse Dam. “This is a landmark day for the tribes and the state,” board member Teresa Wall-McDonald said. “With continued cooperation, we can work through any challenge that presents itself.” The CSKT Tribal Council appointed Wall-McDonald, head of the Tribal Lands Department, and Tribal Services Director Clayton Matt to the board, the Missoulian reported. Gov. Greg Gianforte appointed geologist Roger Noble and attorney Ken Pitt. Their first job was to pick a fifth member, which they agreed to choose from a list of five people put forth by the CSKT and governor’s office, at their next meeting. The U.S. Interior Department will also appoint a sixth, nonvoting member to the board. The second, and much larger, task is to set up staff to redo all the previous water rights and get future allocations going. That includes hiring a lead water engineer and a team of five technicians, along with record-keepers and other staff.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Contract talks between the biggest freight railroads and unions that represent 105,000 employees are headed to mediation this week after the unions declared an impasse following more than two years of negotiations. The unions said Monday the contract talks had deadlocked because the railroads are still seeking concessions, even after workers remained on the job throughout the pandemic and endured significant staff cuts in recent years as the railroads overhauled their operations. Michael Maratto, general counsel of the National Railway Labor Conference that represents the railroads, said it is routine for federal mediators to get involved in contract talks, and the railroads welcome their help in reaching an agreement. The NRLC group is negotiating on behalf of more than 30 railroads, including Union Pacific, BNSF, Norfolk Southern, CSX and Kansas City Southern. Since 2017, the major freight railroads have collectively cut more than 20% of their staff as the industry adopted a new operating model called Precision Scheduled Railroading. It calls for running fewer, longer trains with a mix of freight to reduce the number of crews and locomotives needed to deliver millions of tons of goods nationwide. Unions have said the widespread cuts have spread employees thin, raising concerns about whether defects that could cause derailments will be missed during inspections or allowed to linger in the rail network because routine maintenance has been delayed.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Hard Rock International, owners of the Mirage Hotel & Casino, said it plans to demolish the property’s iconic volcano as part of a major renovation plan, KLAS-TV reported. Hard Rock International Chief Executive Officer Jim Allen confirmed plans to rebrand the resort and get rid of the entire front area. A guitar-shaped hotel will take over, according to a recent rendering. MGM Resorts International, the previous owner, said in a statement it will license The Mirage name and brand to Hard Rock for the next few years while the rebranding process continues. Some are not happy with the decision to do away with the volcano. An online petition on change.org to save the Mirage volcano had gathered more than 1,500 signatures as of Monday.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nRye: A flock of 10 loons rescued on frozen Lake Winnipesaukee was released Monday into the Atlantic Ocean. WMUR-TV reported the 10 adult loons trapped on Lake Winnipesaukee were rescued Saturday by members of the New Hampshire’s Loon Preservation Committee. “It could just be that they stuck around a little bit too long because the lake was still open, the fishing was good, and then they molted those flight feathers and as the water started to come in it was too late for them to be able to leave,” said the committee’s Carolyn Hughes. Loons commonly spend the summer and fall months on inland lakes where they breed and raise their young. Loons typically spend the winter on the ocean. The birds were examined on Sunday and found to be in good health.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy has tapped Sarah Adelman, the acting head of the state Department of Human Services, to become the commissioner of the state agency. Murphy said Adelman has successfully led the department since taking over on an interim basis in January 2021. She stepped in after Commissioner Carole Johnson left Murphy’s Cabinet for the Biden administration, where she was tapped to oversee COVID-19 testing. Adelman previously served as a deputy commissioner at the department, overseeing a number of divisions, including one that oversees NJ FamilyCare, which is the state’s program to provide health care for children and lower-income residents. She also has served on the board of the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency, and before joining the Murphy administration was an executive at the New Jersey Association of Health Plans. The Human Services Department is one of the state’s biggest agencies, with 7,400 employees and a $20 billion budget, which includes state and federal funds. Adelman’s nomination is subject to confirmation by the state Senate.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Two COVID-19 testing sites that were not on the list of facilities approved by state public health officials have closed indefinitely. The Santa Fe New Mexican reported the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office said in a statement it will investigate the Illinois-based operator, Center for COVID Control. The operator ran roughly 300 testing sites nationwide, including one in Santa Fe and one in Albuquerque. According to its website, sites are closed so that all staff can undergo more training. Center for COVID Control has been riddled with allegations, including falsely billing the federal government for tests for people who had health insurance, falsifying test results and being unhygienic.\n\nNew York\n\nLake George:Ice Castles, a new winter attraction in Lake George that features a wintry playground of tunnels, slides and sculptures all made from ice, opened Sunday. In early December, ice artisans began growing and harvesting icicles to create the frozen attraction that is expected to draw tens of thousands of visitors. Each day, they harvested and hand-placed up to 10,000 icicles to build the acre-sized winter experience. About 25 million pounds of ice went into the creation. The frozen playground includes ice-carved slides, tunnels, fountains, crawl spaces, caverns, and intricately carved ice thrones. At night, color-changing LED lights embedded in the ice create a beautiful glow. Tickets, which range from $15 to $27 a person, are on sale at www.icecastles.com/new-york.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Department of Natural and Cultural Resources said a record 22.8 million visitors entered the system’s 41 parks, recreation areas and natural areas in 2021, WRAL-TV reported. That’s a 15% increase from the 19.8 million visitors in 2020, when visits surged as more people sought outdoor activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Jockey’s Ridge State Park was the most visited park in 2021 with more than 1.8 million visitors, about 100,000 fewer than in 2020. The second-most frequented park, Jordan Lake State Recreation Area, saw the largest growth, up 84% from the nearly 877,000 visitors in 2020. Falls Lake State Recreation Area came in third and saw 46% growth last year. Nearly 1.5 million people traveled to the Wake Forest location, up from the 1 million visitors in 2020.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Officials said a produced water spill at an oil well near Watford City Sunday was the result of vandalism. North Dakota Oil and Gas Division officials said valves were opened on the location, leading to a spill of more than 18,000 gallons. Most of the wastewater had been recovered by vacuum trucks, officials said. Produced water is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals. It’s a byproduct of oil and gas development. A state inspector has been to the Abraxas Petroleum Corp. site and will monitor the cleanup.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio has settled an environmental lawsuit with Volkswagen over the company’s 2015 emissions scandal for $3.5 million, state Attorney General Dave Yost said. As that scandal unfolded, the automaker was found to have rigged its vehicles to cheat U.S. diesel emissions tests. and ultimately paid more than $33 billion in fines and settlements. The Ohio Attorney General’s Office also sued the company, alleging Volkswagen’s conduct – affecting about 14,000 vehicles sold or leased in Ohio – violated the state’s anti-air pollution law. The Ohio Supreme Court ruled in June the federal Clean Air Act did not preclude Ohio from seeking its own compensation against Volkswagen. In November the U.S. Supreme Court turned away Volkswagen’s appeals. In settling the lawsuit, Volkswagen did not admit liability. “This agreement fully resolves Ohio’s legacy claims and puts this matter behind the company as we focus on building a future of sustainable mobility,” Volkswagen said in a statement.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The Cherokee Nation Film Office has unveiled plans for a new incentive program offering up to $1 million in annual funding for productions filmed within the Cherokee Nation in northeastern Oklahoma. The 7,000 square-mile Cherokee Nation spans all or parts of 14 Oklahoma counties: Adair, Cherokee, Craig, Delaware, Mayes, McIntosh, Muskogee, Nowata, Ottawa, Rogers, Sequoyah, Tulsa, Wagoner, and Washington. The specialized film incentive is devised to generate economic development and jobs in the Cherokee Nation, as well as to help Oklahoma’s burgeoning film industry continue to grow, the tribe announced Tuesday in a virtual news conference. Plus, the new incentive will provide additional funding for employing Native American citizens and using Native-owned businesses. It is billed as the first tribal film incentive program in the United States. The tribal film office will begin accepting applications for the tribe’s film incentive on March 1. The base incentive offers a cash rebate for qualified production expenses. Prequalified productions filming anywhere in Cherokee Nation are eligible for the rebate.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Supreme Court has OK’d a proposal that would give would-be lawyers the option to skip the bar exam and instead become licensed to practice law through experience or supervision. The state’s highest court in a unanimous vote “expressed approval in concept” to two alternative pathways designed for law students and postgraduates seeking admittance to the state bar, according to draft minutes from the court’s Tuesday business meeting. The court disbanded a previous task force and ordered the Oregon Board of Bar Examiners to convene new committees to further develop the proposals, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Brian Gallini, dean of the Willamette University College of Law, said one proposed alternative would allow Oregon law school students to become licensed attorneys after completing a standard curriculum and likely a capstone project. The other proposed alternative is tailored for out-of-state applicants and would require would-be lawyers to spend 1,000 to 1,500 hours with a licensed Oregon attorney. Many attorneys-in-training would likely continue to take the arduous bar test, as students who score high enough on the uniform exam can be admitted to practice law anywhere in the state.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State authorities said Scranton has been removed from a program for financially distressed municipalities after three decades. The Department of Community and Economic Development said Tuesday the decision was made after “a thorough review” of city audits and financial data, as well as the record from a November public hearing. Secretary Dennis Davin credited “years of hard work and collaboration” on the part of residents, businesses and others. Scranton was designated as distressed in 1992 under the Municipalities Financial Recovery Act or Act 47 following “years of recurring deficits, ineffective financial management practices and unfavorable socioeconomic and demographic trends,” the department said. State officials credited the mayor and city council for working together to help the city “prepare and follow realistic budgets and find ways to improve services while cutting costs.” Monetization of the sewer authority also provided funds to address pension shortfalls and pay off punitive loans, officials said. Officials said Scranton is the 16th municipality to exit the Act 47 program enacted in 1987 to provide fiscal management oversight, technical assistance, planning and financial aid to municipalities experiencing severe fiscal distress.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has reached a settlement of more than $114 million with an opioid manufacturer and three distributors, most of which will go directly to fighting the crisis and helping people with addiction, state Attorney General Peter Neronha said. The settlement includes $21.1 million from Johnson & Johnson and an additional $90.8 million from AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson, he said at a news conference. The money is an addition to a $2.6 million settlement reached with McKinsey & Co. last year. Rhode Island’s settlement is separate from a $21 billion global settlement proposed for other states. Rhode Island was not satisfied with how much it would have received under the global settlement and did better this way, Neronha said, noting the state did better than other New England states that signed onto the global settlement.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster is considering whether to sign into law a bill that would make it easier for businesses that recycle plastic by melting it to open in the state. The bill passed both chambers of the General Assembly on Thursday after a group of House and Senate lawmakers worked out a compromise. Supporters said recycling plastic this way is a safe business and good for the environment because it reduces trash in landfills. Opponents of the bill said melting plastic to recycle it is an unproven industry and it’s not enough to require firms that use the technique to pay a bond to promise to clean up any excessive pollution for five years after the law goes into effect. The five-year bond requirement was a compromise after the bill’s original three-year requirement stalled the proposal in 2021. A spokesman for the governor said McMaster is reviewing the bill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A state House committee approved a proposal to prod school districts to use most of their boost in state funding for teachers’ salaries. The Republican-dominated committee approved the bill on an 8-6 vote, sending it to debate on the House floor. Lawmakers were also considering whether to approve a historic 6% boost in state funding for schools to keep up with inflation. In recent years, South Dakota has been trying to climb up the rankings of states with the lowest average teacher pay in the country. But even as a 2016 sales tax hike channeled more money to school districts, South Dakota’s average teacher pay has remained among the lowest in the nation. Republican Rep. Hugh Bartels is championing the bill, which would extend for three years a requirement that came with the 2016 tax plan. It would require school districts to use at least 85% of their funding increase for teachers’ salaries and benefits. School districts would risk losing funding if they don’t at least match average teacher compensation from 2017, but they could also apply for a waiver if they fail to.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Security officers at Tennessee’s major airports found more than 280 guns in passengers’ carry-on luggage in 2021, a significant increase from prior years, officials said. The 283 guns found last year at security checkpoints in airports in Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga and the Tri-Cities area surpassed the 162 weapons discovered in 2020 and exceeded the total of 181 guns found in 2019, Transportation Security Administration spokesman Mark Howell said in a news release. Nashville International Airport led with 163 firearms found in 2021, more than the total found at the other four airports. The TSA screened about 10.7 million departing travelers at the five airports, an 88% increase over the number screened in 2020, the news release said. Travelers face criminal and civil penalties for bringing firearms to a security checkpoint. Guns can be transported on a commercial aircraft only if they are unloaded, packed in a locked, hard-sided case and placed in checked baggage, the TSA said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:An 812-acre fire that ignited Jan. 18 and caused at least 250 families to flee from their homes in central Bastrop County after officials said a prescribed burn in Bastrop State Park grew out of control, was 100% contained Monday night, the Texas A&M Forest Service said. “The fire received beneficial rainfall today,” the forest service said Monday. Bastrop County Judge Paul Pape told the Advertiser on Friday that the fire management team’s strategy going into the weekend was to let the fire burn itself out within its footprint and to maintain security around the fire’s perimeter.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar Hills: A teenager was seriously injured in a sledding accident just as health officials were giving out helmets and warning of the sport’s potential hazard’s at a nearby safety event. The accident – at a popular sledding site known as “the Bowl” in American Fork Canyon south of Salt Lake City – came as doctors in the area have reported more serious sledding accidents and a doubling in head injuries, KSL-TV reported. The 16-year-old injured on Saturday was airlifted to a hospital in stable condition after receiving a serious cut to the head. Medical workers and first responders nearby had been seeking to raise awareness about safety and encouraging the use of helmets.\n\nVermont\n\nElmore: The city is asking the U.S. Postal Service to renew a contract with a local store to retain an outpost where people can collect their packages and mail. The post office at the back of The Elmore Store serves fewer than 1,000 people and could close as early as February, New England Cable News reported. The store was taken over by new owners at the beginning of January, according to its Facebook page. In a statement, the Postal Service told New England Cable News: “The business that runs this unit has recently been sold and the Postal Service is in the process of negotiating a contract with the new owner. If there is any change to service there, Post Office Box customers will be given advance notice.” If the post office closes, free mail delivery would be available to residents, but some do not want their packages left outside in the weather, or for other reasons prefer to rent a post office box at the store.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: A newborn husky stolen from an eastern Virginia pet salon has been found and reunited with her mother, but the dogs’ owner said two more puppies from the litter of six are still missing. Bandi Murdock, who owns the dogs and the Critter Cleaners pet salon in Hampton, said the female puppy was returned Sunday, the Virginian-Pilot reported. The six puppies were stolen from the pet salon early Friday, but three were recovered quickly. Hampton police announced Saturday a homeless man had been charged with breaking into Critter Cleaners, animal larceny and other crimes in connection with the theft of the puppies, each about 2 weeks old. Officers and the business owner said someone entered through a window and took money and the puppies early Friday. There was surveillance video. Police found two puppies in the home of an acquaintance of the suspect, according to Murdock, who said she reimbursed a woman who returned a third dog she bought for $100. On Sunday, a woman contacted police to report that her boyfriend bought the fourth puppy and she wanted to return the puppy to her owners, Murdock said. Officers met the woman and Animal Control checked the puppy. Murdock said she and her husband gave the woman a $100 reward, then rushed the puppy to her mother, Nala. “Everybody’s doing great,” Murdock said of the recovered puppies and their mother. “They were all very hungry, but they’re all doing good.” The puppies must be nursed by their mother until they’re at least 4 weeks old, so it’s critical to return them to Nala, Murdock said. Anyone with information about the remaining two puppies is asked to contact Hampton police.\n\nWashington\n\nEverett: Flights departing and arriving at Paine Field in Everett were canceled Tuesday morning, as foggy weather and new 5G restrictions hampered the airport’s operation. The Seattle Times repotred all commercial flights out of the small airport were canceled on Monday. On Tuesday morning, the first four outgoing flights were also canceled, according to flight trackers, as were the morning’s first arrivals. Alaska Air, whose regional carrier Horizon Air is the only commercial airline operating out of Paine Field, warned that cancellations could continue for several days and was offering some accommodations to affected travelers. Ticket-holders can reschedule their flights for later this week at no additional cost, or try to reschedule their trips to depart from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration has imposed limitations on low-visibility flying to avoid 5G interference with cockpit instruments. That has created a problem specific to the Embraer E175 regional jets that operate out of Paine Field and to certain airports, including Paine Field and Portland International Airport.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Signaling an eagerness to diversify its energy offerings, coal-dependent West Virginia would eliminate a ban on nuclear power plants under a bill that passed the state Senate on Tuesday. The bill was approved on a 24-7 vote. Three senators did not vote. A similar bill is pending in the House of Delegates. The state’s ban on nuclear plants was enacted in 1996, but nuclear power has in recent years gained support as a tool to keep climate change under control, with proponents noting that it emits few planet-damaging emissions and is safer on average than nearly any other energy source. “All this bill does is simply says we’re open to discussion. That’s it,” said Kanawha County Republican Sen. Tom Takubo, the bill’s sponsor. “We’re not close-minded. “I think it’s important for West Virginia to be looking forward to the future, looking forward to diversify, and simply say to the rest of the world we are open for discussion should this technology come to our mountain state.” West Virginia is the nation’s second-largest coal producer, behind Wyoming, and accounted for 5% of the nation’s total energy production in 2019, ranking fifth among the states, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But West Virginia has lost thousands of coal jobs in the past decade as companies and utilities explore using other energy sources such as natural gas, solar and wind.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republicans who control the state Assembly were set to approve bills Tuesday that would require employers to count a prior coronavirus infection as an alternative to vaccination and testing and prohibit vaccine passports. Both measures would face a likely veto from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The governor last year vetoed a GOP bill that would have barred public health officials from requiring people get vaccinated. Republican backers maintain natural immunity is at least as effective as being vaccinated. Similar bills passed in Florida and Arkansas last year. A number of Wisconsin medical groups, including the Wisconsin Medical Society, oppose the measure, arguing vaccination is the best way to protect against COVID-19 and it’s not known how long natural immunity lasts. Data from the state health department showed unvaccinated people are hospitalized at a rate nearly 11 times higher than fully vaccinated people. No groups have registered in support the proposal.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming’s first Black sheriff last year fired a white deputy who is accused of tormenting a Black subordinate for years with racist name-calling that led him to quit, a new federal lawsuit revealed. Albany County Patrol Sgt. Christian Handley once drove past and yelled a profanity and the N-word at Cpl. Jamin Johnson while Johnson and his wife and children were walking out of their home, according to one example of racism alleged in the discrimination lawsuit filed last week. “Mr. Handley later apologized for having not realized that Mr. Johnson’s family was present, as if his vile racism was otherwise acceptable,” the lawsuit said. Johnson is suing Handley, seeking a jury trial if necessary and damages for the years of racism that he said led up to his decision to quit in 2017. The allegations put a new spotlight on the sheriff’s office in Laramie, the Albany County seat known for the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, a crime that drew unprecedented attention to LGBTQ rights and hate crimes. The racism allegations came after Sheriff Aaron Appelhans’ appointment as Wyoming’s first Black sheriff in the wake of an outcry in Laramie over a deputy’s 2018 shooting of an unarmed man who had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Handley used racial slurs to refer not only to Johnson but to Black citizens he came in contact with on the job, including four University of Wyoming students who were in a vehicle he once pulled over, according to Johnson’s lawsuit against Handley, filed Jan. 18 in U.S. District Court in Cheyenne. The suit didn’t provide the reason for the stop. Handley declined to comment when reached by phone and asked about the lawsuit Monday.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/31/navajo-baby-shark-stanley-hotel-final-plunge-pete-news-around-states/40914241/", "title": "Navajo 'Baby Shark,' Stanley Hotel: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nAuburn: Auburn University is launching a partnership with Auburn City Schools to offer dual-enrollment classes to high school students. The partnership will allow Auburn High School students to begin taking Auburn University classes to help prepare them for college, The Opelika-Auburn News reports. The program allows students to earn high school and college credits at the same time, officials said. Auburn University calls the dual-enrollment program Auburn First. Auburn High School has been participating in dual enrollment with Southern Union since 2015 and the University of Alabama since 2018.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A recently released mapping project seeks to show the importance of the Tongass National Forest in terms of carbon, the Juneau Empire reports. The Oregon-based Geos Institute published an analysis of the Tongass this month that highlights the importance of the national forest as a “carbon sink,” which the report says has global climate implications. “The Tongass is part of a global network of temperate rainforests that make up ~2.5% of the world’s total forest coverage,” the report says. “But these rainforests have exceptional carbon stores for their relatively small spatial extent and are critically important in climate regulation collectively and individually.” Trees absorb carbon from the atmosphere and convert it to oxygen as part of their natural life cycle, says Dominic DellaSala, chief scientist at the Geos Institute. Excess carbon is stored in the roots and soils of old-growth forests. “Just like Amazonia is the lungs of the planet,” DellaSala says, “the Tongass is the lungs of North America.”\n\nArizona\n\nFort Huachuca: Conservation activists are pressing for the federal government to reexamine the effects of groundwater pumping at Fort Huachuca in southern Arizona. The pressure comes amid a leaked report that details how the area’s wells are taking a growing toll on the flow of the San Pedro River. The confidential 2010 study commissioned by the Army base was released by Robin Silver, a co-founder of the Center for Biological Diversity, who says the findings show the base’s groundwater pumping has been harming the river for years and will do more damage unless water use is scaled back. Silver says the study’s projections of worsening effects on the river’s flow in the coming decades weren’t adequately considered when U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials issued an opinion in 2014 approving the base’s groundwater pumping for another decade.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Visitors to Clysta Willett Park will soon be able to enjoy some improved amenities courtesy of the city and the state Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism. The city received a $96,500 grant from the state this month to make improvements to the Ritter Communications Field and the NEXT Powered by NAEC Field at the park. Plans call for Mountain Home to replace the two fields’ old wooden seats with modern aluminum bleachers that include sun screens. Concrete aprons will also be installed behind home plate, leveling that area for the bleachers. The fields’ chain-link backstop will also be replaced with modern netting, providing visitors with an easier view of the field. The grant also includes adding additional playground equipment to the park’s play area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: Authorities have confirmed a fire chased eight people out of an evacuated and condemned building, injuring one person before fire crews could extinguish the blaze. Assistant Fire Marshal Emmanuel Watson compared the event to the 2016 fire that trapped and killed 36 people in the Ghost Ship warehouse illegally repurposed as living quarters for artists, San Francisco Chronicle reports. It took four engines, two trucks and a total of 27 responders to extinguish the Friday fire, authorities said. One woman suffered minor burns and was hospitalized. No firefighters were injured. At least six of the eight people who escaped Friday’s fire were living in the warehouse illegally, sneaking in after the building was reg-flagged twice this year, most recently in November, fire authorities said. The building needed sprinklers, extinguishers and alarm systems, they said.\n\nColorado\n\nEstes Park: Something new will be on tap at the Stanley Hotel in 2020. The Post Brewing Co. – a Colorado brewery and comfort food restaurant chain – will open a new location in the historic hotel’s carriage house, according to an announcement from Big Red F Restaurant Group, which runs The Post’s locations. The carriage house, one of the hotel’s original buildings, is currently undergoing a renovation as part of the project. It was built in 1905 to house entrepreneur F.O. Stanley’s famous Stanley Steamer vehicles. It is the last of the property’s original buildings to be fully renovated, according to a news release. The brewery and restaurant is set to open in the 4,400-square-foot space this summer.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Public and private institutions across the state can begin applying to become sponsors of a federally funded program that provides nutritious meals and snacks to needy children and adults. Participating entities will be reimbursed for each meal they serve. More than 375 local child care centers and adult care centers across Connecticut currently participate in the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program, providing meals to more than 24,000 people daily. Approximately 800 day care home provider locations also participate, providing meals to more than 3,900 children daily. The initiative is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. More information about CACFP and the application process can be found on the Connecticut State Department of Education website.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The downtown public library will crack down on the kinds of bags allowed inside, a policy the city’s homeless say could keep them out of one of the few warm, free places to go in the winter. Beginning Jan. 1, bedrolls, blankets, garbage bags, wheeled carts and luggage will be prohibited from the library, according to signs posted on the doors. Patrons also will be limited to bringing two bags and cannot store anything at the library, according to the policy posted on the library doors. Administrators at the library, which is run by New Castle County, did not respond to multiple requests for comment in the business days before Christmas. The policy has frustrated those who have no place to store their belongings and heightened anxieties among the homeless population who feel they’re being pushed away from view in Wilmington’s business district.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A small, brown, endangered bat would become the “official state mammal” of America’s capital city under a proposed ordinance that will get a public hearing in January. The idea was proposed earlier this year by several Girl Scout troops after they studied the little brown bats, according to a D.C. Council statement. The creatures, known to scientists as myotis lucifugus, typically grow to about 3.5 inches tall with a wingspan of up to 11 inches. They are found in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, according to the Chesapeake Bay Program. Though small, the bats can fly up to 22 mph and eat up to 1,200 bugs per night, according to the legislation. The little brown bat population has been hurt by a fungal disease called white-nose syndrome, which kills bats by increasing the amount of energy used during hibernation, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Smyrna Beach: A big red navigation buoy that bounced along Atlantic waves for two years has beached in Florida, where it’s drawing attention. Crowds of spectators streamed to New Smyrna Beach over the weekend for a close-up view and some pictures with the navigational marker that some described as “the size of a truck,” news outlets report. The beacon came from South Carolina and has been displaced since 2017, said Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan Dickinson, spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard Sector Jacksonville. “This one was from Sector Charleston,” Dickinson says. “We’re going to try to get it back up there.” Charleston is more than 300 miles north of New Smyrna Beach. The Coast Guard plans to bring in a crane sometime this week to remove the buoy. Officials say the move will depend on several factors, including the weather.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Coastal Georgia’s largest city is delaying a plan to swap its current police headquarters for a new building farther from downtown. The plan calls for the city to trade the current building for a new one that Savannah College of Art and Design would build at no cost to the city. The Savannah Morning News reports City Manager Pat Monahan is seeking the delay because part of the proposed new site may be needed for widening of a canal. Part of the 5-acre site could be needed to build a foundation to replace the current Talmadge Memorial Bridge. The Georgia Ports Authority has said the bridge isn’t tall enough to accommodate larger new container ships. There are also concerns about maintaining the historic nature of the current red-brick headquarters and maintaining a police presence downtown.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Protesters at the Mauna Kea Access Road removed barricades for the first time since July as the demonstrators against a giant telescope project shift their focus away from the construction site. The access road was fully reopened Saturday to all traffic except construction equipment for the Thirty Meter Telescope project, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Telescope opponents are planning a demonstration at the Capitol in Honolulu when the legislative session begins Jan. 15, they said. “The movement and clearing this road is only the beginning of where we’ve got to go on this issue here, and hopefully this is the start of that,” Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim said. An international consortium wants to build the telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii’s tallest peak. But some Native Hawaiians believe the project will desecrate sacred land, and demonstrators blocked construction.\n\nIdaho\n\nRexburg: Police say they’ve made no progress despite receiving hundreds of tips about two missing children whose parents aren’t cooperating with authorities. The Rexburg Police Department has eight officers who are following leads that have come in from across the country in their search to find Joshua Vallow, 7, and Tylee Ryan, 17, according to the East Idaho News. The children haven’t been seen since September. Rexburg police say the parents, Chad and Lori Daybell, are named as persons of interest because they never reported the kids missing, have repeatedly lied about where their children are – initially saying the boy with special needs was in Arizona – and aren’t cooperating with the investigation. The couple issued a statement through an attorney last week, saying they love their son and daughter and look forward to addressing “allegations once they have moved beyond speculation and rumor.” The couple married in recent months after both of their spouses died under unusual circumstances earlier this year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials say $11.5 million in city vehicle sticker debt has been forgiven in three months from a program started by Mayor Lori Lightfoot. Nearly 11,500 motorists applied for the program that began in October and followed an amnesty program for late penalties on sticker purchases. Lightfoot has touted the debt relief as one of several initiatives in her first year as mayor aimed at easing the burden on Chicago families. City residents have to buy a sticker for each car they own. Prices vary depending on vehicle type. It’s nearly $140 for a large passenger vehicle. Violators get ticketed with steep fines. Critics have said that the program has fallen short, as only a small fraction of the roughly 500,000 motorists with city sticker debt applied. Unpaid city sticker debt – which at one time could reach nearly $500 each with late fees – is the biggest source of ticket debt in the city, according to a WBEZ and ProPublica investigation.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Indiana University has started a yearlong test of using license plate reading cameras for parking regulation enforcement on its campus in the city. The project that began in November involves a camera mounted on a vehicle and comes as campus officials plan a switch from hang-tag parking passes to a system involving license plates registered by the parking permit holder. “It’s not really a pilot to evaluate if we want it,” campus parking operations manager Amanda Turnipseed says. “It’s to figure out how to do it the most efficient way and with the least amount of hardship on our end users.” Parking officials will consider issues such as how to track whether more than one vehicle registered to a permit are on campus at the same time and how to account for multiple people sharing a permit.\n\nIowa\n\nRockwell City: The city is the next victim in a growing list of small rural towns that have lost or are about to lose their only grocery store. The town of about 2,000 learned last week that Heartland Market, formerly known as South Side Grocery, will soon close, following the small chain’s closures in Manson, Rolfe, Rockwell and, soon, Manning. The closing will leave most of Calhoun County without a grocery store. A Facebook post last week notified shoppers that the store would close in the next “few weeks,” offering them 30% off groceries as it started the liquidation process. Owner Nick Graham would not specify a last day for the store. Mayor Phil Heinlen said the city received notice from an employee Tuesday, as soon as at least one employee apparently said they were told, setting the city in motion to contact chain stores to explore an alternative for the town.\n\nKansas\n\nNeodesha: This small southeast Kansas town hopes a new program offering free college tuition to graduates of the local high school will help attract new residents. A wealthy former resident of the town about 150 miles southwest of Kansas City, Kansas, announced the scholarship offer last month. Ben Cutler says he doesn’t think he would have been nearly as successful in life without his Neodesha upbringing in the 1950s and ’60s. He decided to create the college tuition program as a way to give back to his hometown. Cutler declined to say how much he donated, but he estimates it should be enough to cover at least 25 years of college costs for the town’s graduates. Cutler is a retired former CEO of USHealth Group, which provides health insurance to small businesses and the self-employed.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A partnership between Louisville Gas and Electric and Kentucky Habitat for Humanity aims to lower families’ utility bills by giving them shares in a solar project. The utility’s solar share program allows ratepayers to purchase a share of a large solar field and get a credit on their utility bills for the solar energy the share generates, WKYU-FM reports. Solar share participants can also give their energy credits to another person or to a nonprofit. “And I hope they’ll consider this as an option as they look to make some kind of impactful contribution to Habitat and other nonprofits across our service territory during the holiday season and really all year round,” says LG&E Vice President of Customer Services Beth McFarland.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state will be stocking 1- to 2-pound rainbow trout in 13 ponds statewide during January for kids and grown-ups to catch. It’s part of the Get Out and Fish! program put on by the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Foundation. The department put thousands of channel catfish into the ponds in the fall. Rainbow trout can be stocked only in cold and cool weather, according to a news release. There are four stocked sites in cities along I-20, from Turner’s Pond in Minden, through Grambling and Ruston to Kiroli Park in West Monroe. There’s one at William T. Polk Park in Vidalia and four in southwest to south-central Louisiana, from Purple Heart Memorial Park in Ragley through Jennings and Lafayette to Southside Regional Park in Youngsville. And four are in the southeast, from BREC’s Burbank Park in Baton Rouge through Walker and Hammond to Joe Brown Park in New Orleans.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: The state wants to find a way to keep more of the plastic used by agriculture greenhouses out of landfills with a new recycling program. The state is targeting low-density polyethylene, a clear film used to cover agricultural structures such as greenhouses and high tunnels. The state disposes of more than 30 tons of the plastic, and most of it goes to landfills, according to the University of Maine. University of Maine Cooperative Extensive is set to receive more than $38,000 from a Maine Department of Environmental Protection Waste Diversion Grant to develop a statewide pilot program to recycle the plastic, the university said. The goal is to collect at least a third of the state’s annual waste greenhouse plastic and work with an end-user with the ability to convert it for use in new materials. The university expects the volume of the plastic waste will increase, in part because of the growth of the hemp and cannabis markets.\n\nMaryland\n\nMiddletown: The average number of bushels of corn per acre is between 180 and 250. This year, Drew Haines of Middletown yielded over 422 bushels per acre, beating Maryland’s state corn yield record and winning first place in the National Corn Yield Contest in the no-till, non-irrigated corn category, the Frederick News-Post reports. “It’s turned into an addiction,” he says. No-till means no tilling was done other than the corn-planter itself going into the ground. Non-irrigated means there was no mechanical watering. “We rely on whatever Mother Nature gives us as far as water,” Haines says. The National Corn Yield Contest is a program of the National Corn Growers Association. Any NCGA member is eligible to apply for the contest, which has both national and state-level winners.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nGloucester: Hundreds of people plunged into the chilly ocean Saturday to honor Peter Frates, the former college baseball player whose battle with Lou Gehrig’s disease helped spread the ALS ice bucket challenge. About 1,000 people showed up for the final “Plunge for Pete” at Good Harbor Beach, and more than half of those braved the frigid waters on what would have been Frates’ 35th birthday. The event, in its eighth year, raised money for the Pete Frates #3 Fund, which helped pay for Frates’ medical bills. “He is laughing so hard right now at me getting into the ocean,” said Frates’ wife, Julie, who participated in the plunge for the first time wearing the bikini she had on when she first met her husband. “This is the best birthday party he could ask for, and wherever he is, he is very grateful.”\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: A company that makes self-driving food delivery vehicles will begin testing them out in Ann Arbor this week with patrons from four restaurants. Ann Arbor-based Refraction AI makes the REV, an autonomous robot that’s 5 feet tall, with wheels and a fuselage that can hold delivery bags. The company will begin using its REVs on Friday to make meal deliveries from four restaurants to a test group of 300 customers in downtown Ann Arbor. Refraction AI hopes that its electric, 100-pound REV can make food deliveries for half the cost of existing delivery services like Grubhub, EatStreet and DoorDash, the Detroit News reports. If successful, the robots could open the door to metropolitan areas being serviced by self-driving vehicles that hustle meals, groceries and documents to customers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBloomington: Police were called to remove a group of 50 rowdy juveniles from the Mall of America over the weekend. Mall security had asked the young people to leave because they were disturbing other people, but the group refused, Bloomington Deputy Police Chief Mike Hartley said. Police arrived Friday night and escorted the group out. A couple of juveniles were cited for disorderly conduct, the Star Tribune reports. “It was a large group that was asked to leave. Once they weren’t going to leave … (Bloomington police) just assisted mall security in moving them out,” Hartley said.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: A bar will be opening inside a hotel on campus at the University of Mississippi. The university received state approval for resort status for the Inn at Ole Miss, and that allows the sale of alcohol. The Oxford Eagle reports the current McCormick Cafe inside the hotel is being renovated. The 2,000-square-foot indoor and outdoor space will feature a bar handcrafted by Ben Napier, an Ole Miss alumnus. He and his wife, Erin, co-star of the HGTV show “Home Town,” live in Laurel, Mississippi, and frequently visit Oxford. The school’s football arena, Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, began selling alcohol for the first time Oct. 19 during the Ole Miss-Texas A&M game, and beer sales have continued at the Pavilion during basketball games.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A family that saw its application to grow medical marijuana rejected by the state is now suing, demanding a license to participate in Missouri’s fledgling medical cannabis industry. The lawsuit filed Friday by Paul Callicoat and his family, of Sarcoxie, came a day after the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services granted 60 licenses from the more than 500 companies that applied. The Callicoats, who had planned to open a cultivation facility called Sarcoxie Nursery, were not among those who won a license. The family’s lawsuit argues the state’s 60-license limit violates the state constitution’s “right to farm” amendment passed by voters in 2014. The lawsuit also challenges the state’s selection process that gave more points to businesses in high-unemployment ZIP codes, saying that “geographic bonus” was announced after the family had already paid a non-refundable $10,000 application fee.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: A Montana outfitter has announced plans to purchase multiple electric bikes for rental use on a scenic mountain road in Glacier National Park. Glacier Guide and Montana Raft Company is already taking reservations for bike rentals and guided tours on Going-to-the-Sun Road in spring 2020, The Flathead Beacon reports. The decision comes months after the U.S. Secretary of the Interior ruled to allow powered bikes to be used in national parks, officials said. It is unclear what brand of e-bikes will be purchased, but the company is expected to buy at least 10 to start, company officials said. They have plans to make test trips with the bikes in April to see how they can withstand the elevating road, officials said. All bicyclists must obey speed limits and any other state traffic laws, authorities said.\n\nNebraska\n\nWayne: Students may receive two bachelor’s degrees from two colleges after four years in a new biology and agriculture program. Wayne State College and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln announced the program earlier this month. Students can earn a life sciences degree with a concentration in biology from Wayne and an applied science degree with concentrations in agriculture and natural resources from the Lincoln university. Tammy Evetovich, dean of the Wayne State School of Natural and Social Sciences, praised the flexible program, saying that “people can take it and do what they want with it.” The Norfolk Daily News reports students will spend three years at Wayne State’s School of Natural and Social Sciences and then finish with a year at UNL’s College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. Graduates will be prepared for jobs related to farming, ranching, parks and recreation and land management.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A nonprofit organization promoting vaccinations has canceled two events this month in Reno and Las Vegas after it said anti-vaccination activists harassed restaurant vendors hired to host the events. Immunize Nevada executive director Heidi Parker says several people posted bad reviews for each vendor for supporting the organization’s events on Facebook and Yelp. The comments were bringing down the overall review rating. Immunize Nevada reported the hecklers to Facebook and Yelp, which took down the comments. With sponsorships from groups such as the Community Health Alliance, Immunize Nevada booked the venues and made food arrangements several months in advance. The organization said it lost a few thousand dollars after canceling both events.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A bill up for consideration before the Legislature in 2020 would require school districts to offer lessons on climate change. The House bill would require at least 10 hours of climate education or a full semester of environmental education in high school and anywhere from two hours to eight hours for younger students. It would take effect July 1, 2021. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Chris Balch, a Democrat from Hillsborough, said some teachers incorporate climate change into their science curriculum, but it’s the state’s responsibility to prioritize it. “We need to have a common base of knowledge of what climate change is, how it works, how it happens, what we can do about it,” he told New Hampshire Public Radio. Nationally, many teachers report they shy away from the topic, not only because of issues with materials but also because of political sensitivities and uncertainty about where to introduce an issue that crosses so many disciplines.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEast Rutherford: Organizers are billing it as the largest gathering MetLife Stadium has ever hosted. But the throng of more than 92,000 men and women expected to pack the venue Wednesday aren’t gathering for a playoff game or New Year’s gala. They will celebrate having read the entire Babylonian Talmud from cover to cover in an event called Siyum HaShas. Learning the ancient, voluminous work of Jewish law and folklore is no simple feat: It takes participants seven and a half years to complete all 2,711 pages. Such a venture warrants a momentous celebration – in Hebrew, a siyum. The MetLife gathering will be the largest venue – organizers have erected seating and a large dais on the field – and an overflow crowd of 20,000 is expected at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Through satellite hookups, the event will be beamed to over 100 sites across the globe.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Creators of the popular video “Baby Shark,” whose “doo doo doo” song was played at the World Series in October and has been a viral hit with toddlers around the world, have released a Navajo version of the tune. Pinkfong, a brand of the South Korea company SmartStudy, announced it unveiled the new version Sunday after holding singing auditions on the Navajo Nation. “Łóó’ Hashkéii Awéé,” which loosely means “Navajo Baby Shark,” is the 20th language version of “Baby Shark,” SmartStudy marketing manager Kevin Yoon said in an email. The project was launched after Navajo Nation Museum director Manuelito Wheeler reached out to SmartStudy in September about translating “Baby Shark” into Navajo. The museum previously had lobbied for Navajo versions of the movies “Star Wars” and “Finding Nemo” that were eventually made.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: This year’s New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square will spotlight efforts to combat climate change when high school science teachers and students press the button that begins the famous 60-second ball drop and countdown to next year. “On New Year’s Eve, we look back and reflect on the dominant themes of the past year, and seek hope and inspiration as we look forward,” Times Square Alliance President Tim Tompkins said in a statement. The honorees, he said, “are working to solve this global problem through science.” Jared Fox, who teaches at the Washington Heights Expeditionary Learning School, and seniors Ricardo Herrera and Diane Arevalo are working on a clean-air and greening project in the school’s Upper Manhattan neighborhood. Aida Rosenbaum, a Bronx Latin School teacher, and seniors Daniel Soto and Van Troy Ulloa led a fundraising walk to raise money for places without clean water.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The deadline to comment on how the state Wildlife Commission should manage more than 1,700 acres of new public game land is coming up this week. The commission has sought the public’s view of how to manage the 1,760-acre Dan River Game Land since September. The deadline to respond is Wednesday, says Jodie Owen, a commission spokeswoman. The opinions will help guide the management and activities on the game land, located 4 miles southwest of Eden on the Dan River, for the next 10 years. The state became the full owner of the property in the spring of 2018 after purchasing acreage from the Piedmont Land Conservancy, according to the News & Record of Greensboro. The commission’s plans include a canoe and kayak launch to provide a take-out for paddlers coming from other access points upstream and downstream.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMandan: A local man is accused of threatening to “shoot up” a state government agency. Christopher Chase, 46, faces a felony terrorizing charge. According to a police affidavit, Chase allegedly threatened Workforce Safety and Insurance in social media posts, saying, “I want them all to suffer the way I have,” and “Gonna take out as many as I can before they kill me so they know what it feels like.” Police responded to a request for a welfare check after a caller saw the posts. Chase made his initial court appearance Thursday. His bail was set at $1,000 cash with a stipulation that he not have contact with the state agency, The Bismarck Tribune reports. He was not listed on the Burleigh Morton Detention Center roster Friday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The U.S. Census Bureau is seeking thousands of temporary workers to help conduct its 2020 count in the state. Workers are needed to interview residents and update address lists, The Columbus Dispatch reports. The Census Bureau also is seeking field supervisors, recruiting assistants, clerks and office supervisors for its eight field offices. The positions will pay between $14 and $23.50 an hour. Census Day is April 1. It is unclear how many people will be hired in the state. The Census Bureau hired 24,000 temporary workers for the 2010 count. The bureau is seeking about 88,000 applicants in Ohio and has received about 36,000 thus far. Job offers will be made between January and April, with some positions lasting through September. Information about Census Bureau jobs and qualifications is available online.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Department of Commerce is seeking additional money for an economic development fund dedicated to attracting businesses and jobs to the state. The department is requesting legislators appropriate $14 million next year to the Quick Action Closing Fund – a pot of money the governor can use to cover infrastructure and development costs for businesses relocating to the state. The request comes after the Legislature appropriated more money for the fund this year than ever before. At Gov. Kevin Stitt’s behest, legislators appropriated $14 million to the fund this year on top of a $5 million supplemental appropriation approved in March. “Cumulatively, that was more than we had put in there since the foundation of the program,” says Brent Kisling, the department’s executive director. “We’re just asking that we maintain that baseline of $14 million for another year so we can see that growth.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A plan that would require purchasing a permit before entering three of the state’s most popular wilderness areas has received a largely negative response. More than 13,700 comments were submitted on a proposal to charge $4 to $11 per day to enter the Three Sisters, Mount Jefferson and Mount Washington wilderness areas beginning in 2020. The comments, which came from across the country, echo the idea that while action is needed to combat overcrowding and garbage on wilderness trails, the proposal is too costly and restrictive. “There is something amiss when an American citizen has to pay a fee to hike on their lands, which are really our birthright, not a commodity to be ‘sold,’ ” said George Nickus, executive director of Wilderness Watch.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city has appointed a new police chief to lead a troubled department that has been plagued by sexual harassment lawsuits and racial discrimination – issues she will be suited to tackle with “conviction,” Mayor Jim Kenney said Monday. Democratic Mayor Jim Kenney announced his choice of Portland, Oregon, Chief Danielle Outlaw to fill the job, which has been open since August, when the last commissioner abruptly resigned amid a scandal. Outlaw spent nearly two decades with the police department in Oakland, California, before being named Portland’s chief more than two years ago, becoming the first black woman to hold that job, as she is in the new Philadelphia position. Kenney said Outlaw will focus on addressing racism and gender discrimination and “horrid instances of sexual assault on fellow officers.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Firefighters are doing their part to keep city streets drunken-driver free by offering free rides home on New Year’s Eve. This is the sixth year that the city’s firefighters’ union has offered the Safe Night program, in which off-duty firefighters provides rides from bars and restaurants to private residences within city limits. The program will run from 8 p.m. Tuesday until 7 a.m. Wednesday. The union is urging patience to people requesting a ride because only a limited number of off-duty firefighters will be available. “It’s an opportunity to give back to our community by offering a free and safe ride,” IAFF Local 799 President Derek Silva says.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSt. Phillips Island: Guests will soon be able to rent a beach house that once belonged to billionaire Ted Turner’s family on a private island, state officials say. South Carolina State Parks is finishing rehabilitation work on the property and expects to open the site for rental starting in spring 2020, Duane Parrish, director of the South Carolina Department of Parks, Recreation and Tourism, told The Post and Courier. The four-bedroom, four-bathroom house sits on what was once the family compound on the 4,680-acre St. Phillips Island across the sound from Hilton Head Island. But there’s more work to do. The newspaper says there’s no bridge, electricity or water line to it, and restrooms are portable. Travel on the island is limited to sand trails through the forest, and the house is set almost 4 miles from the boat landing. Parks staff plan to run a tram though the island, among other upgrades.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The rain and snow that hit the city over the year’s final weekend was enough to make 2019 the wettest year in Sioux Falls history. So far this year, 39.27 inches of precipitation had fallen on Sioux Falls as of Sunday morning. That amount broke the previous record of 39.17 inches, set last year. The past two years have been the wettest in the history of the city. Annual precipitation totals date back to 1891. Over the course of that history, Sioux Falls has averaged 25.7 inches of precipitation a year. Steady rainfall throughout Saturday and a mix of rain, sleet and snow overnight clinched the record early Sunday morning in Sioux Falls, according to the National Weather Service. The precipitation broke daily rainfall records for Sioux Falls on Saturday and Sunday as well.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State parks are offering free, guided hikes on New Year’s Day. Free hikes will be available at all 56 state parks Jan. 1 with the exception of Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, which hosts a New Year’s Eve event in Nashville, state park officials said in a news release. Hikes are led by a park ranger and vary in degrees of difficulty. The free hikes are part of America’s State Parks First Day Hikes in all 50 states, officials said. State parks also offer free hikes on National Trails Day, National Public Lands Day, after Thanksgiving Day and to mark the coming of spring. More information can be found at the Tennessee State Parks website.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Texas business leaders say they’re all for college students pursuing their passions, even if it means majoring in contemporary dance, sculpture or something similarly esoteric. They’d just like to convey a few financial details first – like the probability of earning a bigger paycheck as a computer programmer or even a plumber. “A lot of people have no clue” how many jobs are available in various occupations and what they pay, said Tony Bennett, president of the Texas Association of Manufacturers. Beginning in the new year, wage and workforce statistics will have a higher profile during the application process for Texas colleges and universities under a measure backed by Bennett’s organization and other business groups around the state and approved by lawmakers during this year’s session of the Legislature. The law requires a “prominent link” to the data on the standardized electronic college application called ApplyTexas.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state is known for its high birth rate, but an ongoing lag has researchers wondering if it’s in a new era of lower fertility. The state’s demographers expected people to start having more children as they recovered from the Great Recession, but even with more people working and making more money, the state’s fertility rate has continued to drop, the Deseret News reports. Utah’s fertility rate fell to 2.03 births per woman last year – the lowest rate in more than 50 years, new census data shows. The state, which had the highest rate in the United States as recently as 2015, now sits behind North Dakota, South Dakota and Nebraska. The national fertility rate has fallen to a historic low of 1.73 births per woman.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Thirty-four people took advantage of the state’s aid-in-dying law in the most recent two-year period studied, according to a report released by the Vermont Department of Health. The report, which was submitted to the Legislature last week, covered the two years ending June 30. It found that of the 34 cases, 24 were from people with cancer; four had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig’s disease; three had other degenerative neurological diseases; and three were due to other events. Of the 34 people, 28 hastened their deaths using a drug prescription; five died of the underlying disease without taking a prescribed aid-in-dying drug; and the mechanism of death in one case was unknown, the report said. Since Vermont’s law, known formally as the Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act, passed in 2013, the law has been used 87 times.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: As much of central Appalachia looks to reinvent itself amid the decline of coal, community leaders in mountainous southwest Virginia say they are seeing some early success by focusing on another natural resource: the Clinch River. The Clinch is the centerpiece of what will be one of Virginia’s newest state parks, thanks to a years­long grassroots effort. Advocates say the park will help protect the river, a biodiversity hot spot, and support a growing regional outdoor recreation and tourism industry. The generally gentle river – ideal for mellow floats during the summer, or canoeing, kayaking and fishing – has the highest concentration of rare aquatic species of any river in the United States, says Brad Kreps, an employee of The Nature Conservancy who has been involved for years in the push to create the park. State lawmakers have allocated about $5 million so far to the Clinch River State Park.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The state’s age for legally purchasing tobacco was set to increase from 18 to 21 beginning Jan. 1, but a change in federal law has already effectively raised the age. The state Liquor and Cannabis Board said that prior to Jan. 1, state officers encountering retailers selling to people under 21 were to provide education instead of pursuing enforcement, The Seattle Times reports. Congress inserted the provision raising the purchase age into an emergency spending bill signed by the president Dec. 20. New federal legislation does not normally take effect immediately, but the change was made to existing law, a Food and Drug Administration spokesman said. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee requested that more regulations on vaping products be adopted in the next legislative session, which begins Jan. 13.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharles Town: A historic home that played an important role in the area’s African American history is changing hands as a way of continuing to preserve it. The Webb-Blessing House was the only residence owned by a free African American family living in Charles Town before the Civil War, The Journal reports. Since 2003, it had been owned by the Jefferson County Black History Preservation Society. When group members decided they were no longer able to take care of it, Friends of Webb-Blessing House stepped forward to help. The property officially changed hands Friday. Doug Perks, chair of the Friends group’s steering committee, told the paper the group will maintain the building and tell its story. That includes the story of the Webb family that built the house before the Civil War and continued to live in it until 1866, when it was purchased by John Frederick Blessing, Perks said. Blessing was a confectioner who supplied meals to John Brown after Brown was incarcerated in the Jefferson County Jail, Perks said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The Wisconsin Elections Commission deadlocked Monday over whether to remove the voter registrations of more than 200,000 people in response to a judge’s order. The commission’s inability to reach a consensus means the voters will stay on the rolls for at least the time being. An appeal in the case is ongoing, and the commission faces a separate lawsuit that is trying to make sure people are not pulled from the rolls. The three Republicans on the commission sought to take many of them off the rolls, but they were blocked by the three Democrats on the panel. It was the second time in as many weeks that the commission broke down along party lines over the lawsuit, which has drawn national attention because of Wisconsin’s top-tier status in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A new state rule seeks to reduce a record number of applications for permits to drill oil and gas wells. The Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission rule makes it easier for other developers and mineral owners to challenge permit applications and contest permits when drilling doesn’t begin right away. Wyoming Oil and Gas Supervisor Mark Watson says the rule encourages competition. Recently, companies with no immediate plans to drill have been applying for multiple permits to secure control over potential drilling areas in Wyoming. The commission received almost 70,000 drilling permit applications in just three years. The Casper Star-Tribune reports the commission faced a backlog of thousands of permit applications and protests from competing operators. The new rule took effect Dec. 20.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/11/high-line-milestones-iowas-big-stink-muscle-beach-makeover-news-around-states/39566201/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Researchers are in the midst of recording the city’s civil rights history in a new way. Three archaeologists and an architect are wearing yellow vests and carrying iPads, snapping pictures and recording information about every structure built before 1969. Those actions are part of a two-week effort, during which Paleowest Archaeology will visit 2,500 structures in west Montgomery neighborhoods to identify culturally significant buildings, histories and landmarks related to the struggle for civil rights. Once the data is compiled, a historian and researcher will comb through the information to provide a complete history of the culturally significant neighborhoods. “Montgomery has a rich civil rights history,” said Robert Smith, planning director for the city and the mastermind behind the project. “The city does not have a comprehensive document of that civil rights history.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A state labor department report says recent job gains after three years of losses could signal the end of the state’s recession. The report says Alaska saw year-over-year job growth for seven straight months, starting in October. This followed revisions to 2018 figures. The Anchorage Daily News reports the department revises job numbers after releasing initial estimates. While the growth was small, department economist Karinne Wiebold says it strengthens the case that the economy is recovering. The numbers remain subject to change, and Wiebold says it’s too early to say the downturn is truly over. The recession, which began in 2015, is the longest Alaska has seen, though it wasn’t on the level of an economic crash that occurred in the 1980s.\n\nArizona\n\nMesa: Dozens of Asian-owned businesses have set up shop in western Mesa, with two large supermarkets serving as anchors for development that includes restaurants and other businesses. The commerce cluster is aided by proximity to Mesa Community College and the presence of Arizona State University’s main campus in neighboring Tempe. With the closing of the Chinese Cultural Center in Phoenix last year, many see the Asian business district in Mesa as a natural successor to become a hub for Asian-Americans in metro Phoenix. Property manager Steven Diep says when Mekong Plaza opened in 2008, fewer than 10 Asian-owned businesses were open in the area. Now, Mekong is at full occupancy with 28 tenants and has spurred development in the rest of the Asian business district in Mesa.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Hemp and CBD producers are hopeful about the future of the industry in the state. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that CBD has been extracted from Arkansas’ first legal hemp harvest. CBD is a chemical compound derived from cannabis plants, and users say it can ease pain, anxiety, epilepsy, nausea and hangovers. It doesn’t cause a high and is often sold as a dietary supplement. Hemp also belongs to the cannabis family and can be used in products including rope and paper. Congress legalized industrial hemp in December. Industry experts expect the CBD market in Arkansas to explode over the next five years. Some farmers hope they’ve found their newest cash crop. The Food and Drug Administration is assessing how it should regulate CBD, which is largely unregulated by the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Clarita: A fast-moving brush fire erupted near a huge amusement and water park Sunday, sending hundreds of visitors to the exit to escape clouds of smoke and ash before fire officials asked them to stay put while they worked to contain the blaze. Six Flags Magic Mountain and Hurricane Harbor announced the evacuation shortly after noon, citing concern for the safety of park visitors and employees. About a half-hour later, the park said on its Twitter account that fire officials asked guests to shelter in place due to nearby road closures. Park visitors were asked to move to the back of the 260-acre property, away from firefighting activity near the entrance, said Rachel Gallat, who was visiting a friend who works at the park. “I was getting iced coffee and when I walked outside, ash was raining down on me,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A ski resort trade association expects visits to the state’s ski resorts to be up 13% from last year following a snowy winter and spring that extended the ski season. The Denver Post reports Colorado Ski Country USA released its projections Thursday, showing a nearly 12% increase in visits from the five-year average. The group that represents 23 resorts expects the season to end with 13.8 million skier days, which measures people participating in skiing or snowboarding for any part of one day at a resort. The Rocky Mountain region is projected to end the season with 24 million skier days. The region includes Utah, New Mexico, Wyoming and Montana.\n\nConnecticut\n\nMiddletown: Wesleyan University’s Center for the Arts has received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to support residency activities of the dancer Netta Yerushalmy. The $15,000 Art Works grant also will support a performance by Yerushalmy on Oct. 4 in the Center for the Arts Theater. Center for the Arts director Sarah Curran said support from the NEA is central to its ability to bring contemporary dance to audiences that might not otherwise be able to see it. Yerushalmy grew up in Israel and has been based in New York since attending college there.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Parts of a neighborhood damaged in the 1968 riots ignited by Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination are set to be redeveloped after many years of empty restoration promises. The 36-block West Center City neighborhood never rebounded from the riot and an ensuing nine-month occupation by the National Guard. It has struggled with vacant homes and gun crimes ever since. For decades, city officials promised restoration and development initiatives that didn’t happen. Now state grants to demolish and rebuild several properties have been awarded, and the Wilmington Housing Authority also plans to renovate and sell about 20 properties. A demolition and rebuilding project by the nonprofit Wilmington Land Bank started last week and is set to be completed by March.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Logan Circle in northwest D.C. has been named one of the nation’s 28 friendliest neighborhoods, WUSA-TV reports. The National Geographic Traveler magazine list is based on user-generated data such as walkability, home affordability, and social surroundings such as the number of nearby restaurants, breweries and cafes. National Geographic Traveler also used perception data from TripAdvisor and Yelp to create the unranked list of the United States’ most open-minded and open-hearted neighborhoods. Logan Circle made the list for its design-centric shops and dozens of restaurants in early 20th-century and contemporary buildings. The list features Colada Shop for its rooftop Cuban cocktails and empanadas, as well as Miss Pixie’s Furnishings & Whatnot for unique finds like old postcards and 1960s lamps.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Beach: A famous part of South Beach is getting a makeover. City of Miami Beach officials unveiled tons of new equipment Sunday for the popular outdoor workout area along A1A, known as Muscle Beach. Locals and tourists frequent the area, which includes equipment for push-ups and pull-ups. Muscle Beach is free and open to the public. But the area was lacking in strength training equipment. The city added a multi-modality training center for up to 80 people including 18 pull-up stations, a rope climb tower and five squat stations. There are also medicine balls, kettle bells, bumper plates and battle ropes.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: The Richmond County Coroner’s Office has made progress in matching the military grave markers that were discovered at an old funeral home. Coroner Mark Bowen says the majority are for veterans who have been buried locally. The National Cemetery Administration, the Richmond County Vital Records Office and Richmond County Cemetery Services are also assisting in finding the graves of the veterans whose names are inscribed on the markers. About 125 bronze and marble markers were found. They date back to the late 1960s. The Augusta Chronicle reports that a deputy had discovered the markers in packages under old blankets and trash in the home’s garage. The deputy was assisting a land official who was preparing to show the property to Atlanta investors when the grave markers were discovered.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The head of Honolulu’s planned rail line has submitted a revised recovery plan for the $9.2 billion project. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation CEO Andrew Robbins hand-delivered the plan to federal officials in San Francisco on Friday. The Federal Transit Administration has been withholding about $744 million in promised funding until it approves an updated recovery plan. The agency demanded that the city submit a recovery plan when the project’s price tag jumped from $5.3 billion. The City Council approved the plan by an 8-1 vote on Wednesday. The 20-mile-long rail line is due to connect Honolulu’s western suburbs to the airport, downtown and the Ala Moana Center, Oahu’s biggest mall.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal authorities are taking public comments on a plan to conduct an extensive environmental study involving killing wolves and other predators in the state that attack livestock, deer and elk. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that it will take comments through July 10 on a planned environmental impact statement. A federal judge ordered the study last year after ruling the Agriculture Department’s Wildlife Services violated environmental laws by not providing the justification to support its decision to expand killing mountain lions, coyotes, bears and other predators in Idaho. The new environmental impact statement will replace the agency’s 2016 Idaho environmental assessment involving those predators, as well as its 2011 wolf environmental assessment that guides its wolf-killing decisions in the state.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Dispensaries in the state are staffing up and remodeling in preparation for the legalization of recreational marijuana. The General Assembly approved the marijuana legislation last month, and it now awaits a signature from Gov. J.B. Pritzker. He plans to sign it, making Illinois the 11th state, along with the District of Columbia, to permit recreational use. Under the new law, adults could buy and possess up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use. The measure would let the state’s 55 medical marijuana dispensaries submit applications to set up two more dispensaries to sell marijuana for recreational use. Companies already in the medical marijuana market said expansion to meet recreational needs could result in a hiring boom. If approved, sales would start Jan. 1, 2020.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The fifth annual Chreece hip-hop festival will bring Talib Kweli to the city. Kweli, a rapper known for eight solo albums as well as collaborations with Mos Def, Kanye West and Hi-Tek, headlines a 70-act lineup announced Monday. Chreece is slated for Aug. 24 at multiple Fountain Square venues. Kweli, who made landmark 1998 album “Black Star” with Mos Def, is one of multiple national acts on the festival’s roster. Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine and Benny the Butcher will share the stage, representing Griselda Records. Houston rapper Fat Tony will promote his 2018 album “10,000 Hours.” The Chreece roster includes high-profile Indiana acts Flaco, Drayco McCoy, Trajik, Sirius Blvck & John Stamps, Clint Breeze & the Groove, Mathaius Young and Parris LaDame.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: It’s a stinky distinction, but the state leads the nation when it comes to the amount of poop its people and livestock generate, research from a University of Iowa scientist shows. Christopher Jones, a UI research engineer, calculated Iowa’s population would be the equivalent of 168 million people, based on the waste from the state’s 3.2 million people and nearly 110 million chickens, pigs, turkeys and cattle. It’s about as many people as in Bangladesh, a country in south Asia. Factor in land size, and Iowa ranks first in the nation for waste creation, Jones writes in a blog he’s titled “50 Shades of Brown.” “Just to ensure clarity, in Iowa, we are generating as much fecal waste in every square mile as 2,979 people,” he says. “For reference, Iowa City is the second-most densely populated city in Iowa and has 2,775 people per square mile. So imagine an Iowa-sized Iowa City.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: May was the wettest month in state history. The Kansas State University Weather Data Library says average rainfall in May was 10.26 inches, the wettest month on records going back 125 years. The Kansas News Service reports the deluge broke the previous record set in June 1951. In addition, 19 weather stations recorded monthly totals of more than 20 inches. The rainfall was uneven but followed typical patterns of being drier in the west and wetter in the east. Southeast Kansas stations averaged 17 inches in May, while west central Kansas stations averaged only 5.31 inches, which is still 175% of normal rainfall for the region in May. The amount of water moving through the state was the highest the U.S. Geological Survey’s Kansas Water Science Center has ever seen.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An analysis of traffic stop data has found African Americans in the city are disproportionately stopped and are three times more likely to be searched than white drivers. Of 130,999 stops between 2016 and 2018, African Americans accounted for 33% of the stops, although they make up only about 20% of Louisville’s driving-age population. Of 8,942 searches, 57% involved African Americans. That’s despite a much higher incidence of contraband found with white drivers. According to the analysis, police found contraband in 72% of the searches of whites versus only 41% for African Americans. Speaking before the Metro Council Public Safety Committee on Wednesday, Police Chief Steve Conrad outlined changes in which stops will no longer be “a matter of routine.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nSt. Joseph: New cabins are open at Lake Bruin State Park. The Louisiana Office of State Parks opened the accommodations at the site in St. Joseph on Friday. The park is in the Mississippi River delta, in the state’s southeast. Two standard cabins and one deluxe cabin are available for reservations. The one-bedroom cabins sleep up to four people and have a barbecue pit, fire ring and picnic table. They rent for $85 a night Sunday through Thursday and $95 a night on Friday and Saturday. The three-bedroom deluxe cabin sleeps up to eight people and has a two-car carport and two dedicated boat slips. It rents for $150 per night Sunday through Thursday and $175 per night on Friday and Saturday.\n\nMaine\n\nSkowhegan: Apparently hungry and thirsty vandals have trashed a fairgrounds booth, stealing 120 whoopie pies and drinking half a gallon of iced tea. John Youney, a director of the Skowhegan Lions Club, tells the Morning Sentinel that a refrigerator full of cookies was also emptied and that plastic gloves and silverware littered the floor. Youney says there’s about $1,000 worth of damage or stolen goods. The group discovered the break-in at its Skowhegan fairground booth Sunday morning and believes it occurred overnight Saturday. Youney says whoever is involved can confess and work off their crime by assisting the club with its volunteer work. A police officer said he could not comment on the investigation.\n\nMaryland\n\nBurkittsville: A video game inspired by the Maryland-based horror film “The Blair Witch Project” is expected to come to PCs and Xboxes in August. The Baltimore Sun reports the game was announced Sunday at a video game conference in Los Angeles. The game will draw on events from the 1999 film, with a release date of Aug. 30. The movie was shot in locations in Maryland, including the town of Burkittsville. The film follows a group of college students as they create a documentary in the Maryland woods about the legend of the Blair Witch. The low-budget film earned a reputation as a cult classic that popularized the “found footage” horror genre. According to the trailer, the game follows a detective’s search for a missing person amid supernatural occurrences.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: The town is taking a literary twist this week. The eighth annual Nantucket Book Festival opens Thursday and runs through June 16. It features more than 30 local authors, including Nantucket native and bestselling writer Nathaniel Philbrick. Philbrick will discuss the third book in his Revolutionary War series, “In the Hurricane’s Eye: The Genius of George Washington and the Victory at Yorktown.” Other participating award-winners include “Washington Black” writer Esi Edugyan, “The Library Book” author Susan Orlean, and Dave Cullen, who’s authored books about the Columbine and Parkland school shootings. The festival is operated by the Nantucket Book Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded to celebrate and promote the joys and rewards of reading, writing and literacy.\n\nMichigan\n\nHolland: Families can follow the yellow brick road as a project brings “The Wizard of Oz” to a local park. The Holland Sentinel reports that yellow bricks have been laid in Centennial Park as part of the Holland Oz Project. It’ll direct visitors to a living mosaic book that’s been constructed out of plants and flowers in a tribute to the L. Frank Baum novel and classic 1939 film. The outdoor exhibit in western Michigan will also include life-sized bronze sculptures of characters that Dorothy met along her journey through the whimsical world of Oz. The sculptures will be installed in August. The city has collaborated with the Holland Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, Holland in Bloom and the Herrick District Library to bring the project to life.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinnetonka: A local dog rescue organization says it’s saving the lives of golden retrievers by flying them to the U.S. from China, where they’re used in the dog meat trade. KARE-TV reports that Retrieve a Golden of the Midwest says its volunteers in China take in dogs that have been rescued from butchers and slaughterhouses. The Minnetonka-based group says its Chinese shelters can house hundreds of rescued dogs at a time. Humane Society International estimates that 10 million dogs are consumed each year in China. RAGOM board member Nicole Stundzia says a volunteer family recently traveled to the country to bring five golden retrievers to the U.S. Stundzia says volunteers are limited in the number of dogs they can travel with. The group says such rescues are challenging and costly.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state Supreme Court has changed the rules to say a person seeking to become a lawyer has to pass the bar exam within three attempts or will have to go back to law school for at least 12 semester hours before they can retake it. The rule change comes after the annual passage rate on the Mississippi Bar exam has dropped from 79% in 2014 to 48% last year. The rule change says an applicant has to successfully complete 12 additional semester hours of law school courses at an American Bar Association accredited law school on subjects covered by or skills necessary to pass the bar exam. After going back to law school and successfully completing the 12 hours or additional course work, an applicant will be permitted to take the bar exam one additional time, the state Supreme Court order says.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Area attorneys whose underwire bras had been setting off jail metal detectors can now see their clients without removing their lingerie for screening, but only if they agree to talk to their clients by phones separated by glass. KCUR-FM reports that the new protocol was announced Thursday, the same day nearly 100 defense attorneys signed an open letter complaining that the restrictions were making it difficult to represent inmates. Jackson County Department of Corrections Director Diana Turner described the option of allowing attorneys to have non-contact visits without clearing metal detectors as a “happy medium.” But it didn’t sit well with attorney Denise Kirby, who signed the open letter. She says the compromise shows a lack of understanding about what it takes to defend an inmate.\n\nMontana\n\nStevensville: Trumpeter swans have built a nest in a wildlife refuge that biologists hope will lead to the first offspring documented in the Bitterroot Valley following restoration efforts. The Ravalli Republic reports the large waterfowl couple constructed the nest on top of a muskrat lodge on a remote pond at the Lee Metcalf National Wildlife Refuge. Refuge project leader Tom Reed says he discovered the nest in recent weeks. Reintroduction efforts began decades ago after the swan population was decimated by hunters and feather collectors. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes wildlife director Dale Becker says 60 trumpeter young were recorded from about 18 nests in Montana last year. He says the young usually appear right after Memorial Day, but this year they’re a bit late.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Health officials in the eastern part of the state are taking steps to control mosquito populations that carry West Nile and other diseases as a wet spring has led to more breeding grounds for the biting insects. The Douglas County Health Department says it’s using mosquito larvicide in potential breeding sites or stagnant waterways to help curb the spread of West Nile virus. The department is also trapping mosquitoes every other week. Trapped mosquitoes are counted and tested for Zika, West Nile virus and chikungunya at the state public health lab. The department also has begun collecting dead birds – including crows, black-billed magpies and blue jays – to test them for West Nile virus. Nebraska reported a nation-high 245 West Nile cases in humans last year, including 11 deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Lawmakers have agreed to let voters decide next year whether to amend the state Constitution to recognize same-sex marriages, add a voters’ bill of rights and overhaul the state board of pardons. The measures are among a handful of proposed changes to Nevada’s Constitution that lawmakers took on during their legislative session this year. As in most states, it isn’t easy to amend Nevada’s Constitution. Changes can either come from a citizen-driven ballot initiative, which would need to be approved by voters twice, or from the Legislature. Any proposal from lawmakers to amend the Constitution must be approved by the Legislature two sessions in a row and then approved by voters on the ballot. The state Constitution currently includes an unenforceable ban on same-sex marriage.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state would join more than a dozen counterparts requiring insurance coverage of fertility treatments under a bill that passed the House. Supporters of the bill said the requirement would help the state attract young families as its population ages. They said they heard from many couples who said they work in Massachusetts in order to obtain coverage. Opponents said they were concerned about the impact such a mandate would have on insurance premiums for small businesses. The House passed the bill and sent it back to the Senate, which previously passed a different version.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: “Seinfeld” star Jason Alexander, rock band The Smithereens, rocker Southside Johnny Lyon, New York Giants Harry Carson and Bart Oates, and legendary basketball player and coach Anne Donovan are among this year’s inductees to the New Jersey Hall of Fame. Gov. Phil Murphy announced the winners of the Hall’s 11th class Monday at a ceremony at Newark Liberty International Airport. They include “Jaws” author Peter Benchley of Pennington, longtime Star-Ledger sport columnist Jerry Izenberg of Neptune and “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin of Bayonne. Other winners include Olympic gymnast Laurie Hernandez of Old Bridge, Hoboken teachers activist Elizabeth Allen, and Newark cardiac surgeon Victor Parsonnet. The induction ceremony will be held Oct. 27 in Asbury Park.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest city is the latest to embark on upgrades to its portion of the historic Route 66 Highway. Officials in Albuquerque want to see improvements to a barren stretch of Route 66 in an area that some complain is a forgotten part of the city, KRQE-TV reports. City officials are eyeing a $2.3 million plan that would add medians, landscaping and lighting along the Mother Road west of downtown. Currently, there are no sidewalks, landscaping or bike lanes and very few streetlights. Albuquerque has the largest part of Route 66 in an urban area. The move comes as an endangered federal program that has helped preserve the historic Route 66 Highway for two decades is set to end, and federal legislation to designate Route 66 as a National Historic Trail remains stalled in Congress.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The creators of the High Line park turned a disused rail line into an urban oasis, art showcase and tourism magnet that welcomes 8 million visitors a year. The park is now marking two milestones. Its final section opened Wednesday, days before the 10th anniversary Sunday of the opening of the first section on June 9, 2009. The elevated rail line was built in the 1930s to raise freight trains above street level. Efforts to preserve the line started in the 1980s, after the trains stopped running. The blocks surrounding the High Line then were largely undeveloped and considered dangerous by some. Anthony Annaruma remembers the area when it was frequented by sex workers. Now, he’s working on a new building where apartments will sell for millions of dollars.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBrevard: The General Assembly is looking to impose stricter guidelines on zip lines and high ropes courses after some deaths in the state. A bill before the North Carolina Senate seeks greater oversight of the “aerial adventure course” industry, just in time for summer camp season. But some camp owners say they feel the law could increase expenses and paperwork and force some operations to close altogether. Some course owners also questioned whether safety would improve. The bill is known as Sanders’ Law, named for 12-year-old Sanders Burney, who died in 2015 when her harness snapped during a zip line accident at a YMCA camp.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nNew Salem: A mud run is expected to draw hundreds of people for good, dirty fun in western North Dakota. Medieval Rush will be held Saturday in New Salem. It’s billed as the longest mud run in North Dakota, at 3.2 miles. The event has a medieval theme and runs rain or shine. Gates open under the big cow statue “Salem Sue” at 9 a.m. Opening ceremonies are set for at 11 a.m. This year’s event also will add a medieval dirt bike race through the mud. Participants must be at least 14 years old. The Bismarck Tribune reports about 700 people take part each year.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A new interactive exhibit at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is set to open next month. Cleveland.com reports that the “Interactive Garage” exhibit opening July 1 will enable visitors to play instruments on their own or with friends or strangers at the museum. Visitors can get help with instruments from trained professionals on site. Rock Hall president and CEO Greg Harris said earlier this year that the museum has been working to create a more immersive, hands-on experience for visitors. The exhibit opens July 1 and will take up the entire second floor of the museum. It will include keyboards, mixing boards, guitars, drums, studio space and a lounge for playing acoustic instruments.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Researchers at the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University are jointly developing drone technology to more accurately forecast the weather. The Journal Record reports that OU School of Meteorology professor Phil Chilson says he launched the project in 2008, and it received a boost of National Science Foundation funding in 2015. Chilson said a “long-recognized lack of observation” in the bottom 2 miles of the atmosphere hinders storm forecasting. OSU is building the drones, and OU is focusing on the meteorology portion, which includes what type of information and equipment is required for the unmanned aircraft. Both schools are working through regulatory concerns with the Federal Aviation Administration. OSU professor Jamey Jacob says the development of drones for more accurate storm prediction will cause a “paradigm shift.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two protesters have been sentenced to five days in jail for throwing horse lubricant mixed with gold glitter on two police officers at a protest. The Multnomah County District Attorney’s Office says the defendants were protesting against a rally organized by a right-wing group called Patriot Prayer when the officers asked to see what was in two 4-gallon buckets they were carrying. Prosecutors say Robert Majure and Tristan Romine-Mann instead sprayed the slimy liquid on the officers and ran. Prosecutors say the two attempted to “fist bump” in celebration after they were arrested and cuffed in a patrol car. A jury convicted them of harassment and acquitted them of a charge of disorderly conduct.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDeer Lake: The rustic training camp where Muhammad Ali prepared for some of his most famous fights has undergone an elaborate restoration and opened to the public Saturday as a shrine to the heavyweight icon’s life and career. The famed Deer Lake camp was in disrepair when California real estate investor Mike Madden, son of retired broadcaster and NFL Hall of Fame coach John Madden, bought it shortly after Ali died in June 2016 at age 74. Ali bought the wooded, out-of-the-way property about 90 miles from Philadelphia in 1972 and installed 18 primarily log buildings, including a gym, dining hall, small mosque, visitors’ cabins and a horse barn. It was at Deer Lake where Ali prepared for his epic bouts against George Foreman and Joe Frazier, attracting crowds who watched him work. He trained at the camp until his last fight in 1981.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Community College of Rhode Island is using a sensory tool to help the public understand what it’s like to live with dementia. CCRI bought an instructional program known as the Virtual Dementia Tour with help from the state. For the first time, it’s offering free demonstrations to the public. The demonstrations will be held Tuesday at the Lincoln campus, June 18 at the Providence campus, June 21 at the Warwick campus and June 25 at the Newport campus. The demonstrations, facilitated by CCRI nursing staff, take about half an hour. Registration is required in advance. CCRI says it’s the only college in the state to offer this technology, and it’s trying to do more to help caregivers and health care professionals understand how to treat people with dementia.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state has passed a new law that bars protein grown in a laboratory via stem cells from being advertised as “meat.” Primary sponsor Republican Rep. Randy Ligon of Chester says he didn’t want people to confuse lab-grown protein with the real thing. The lawmaker and member of the South Carolina Cattlemen’s Association told The Post and Courier of Charleston he doesn’t want to stop research into the alternative food, but he does want to make sure consumers understand what they are getting. The bill passed both the House and Senate unanimously, and Gov. Henry McMaster signed it into law last month. Lab-grown meat hasn’t made it into stores yet, but federal agencies have announced how they will regulate the industry.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A Native American woman is bringing attention to the impact of methamphetamine addiction from within the South Dakota Women’s Prison. Heather Shooter, 37, started the support group Sober is Sacred to encourage other inmates to join the fight to demand more drug treatment services at the Pierre facility. Within the past year, the group has put on two anti-meth rallies at the women’s prison, where many inmates share stories about how the drug derailed their lives. About 64% of women in the prison are incarcerated on a primary drug charge, most of which involved meth. Shooter has been in prison since April 2017 for participating in a high-speed police chase with her 6-year-old in the car while high on meth. “That was my wake-up call,” she said. “This is my chance to change.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee Promise scholars can fulfill their community service requirement during a volunteer event in state parks this month. According to a news release, 54 of the state’s 56 parks will be offering a volunteer event. Most of those will take place Saturday, June 22. Work projects include landscaping, invasive plant removal, litter pickup and trail maintenance. Tennessee Promise provides scholarships for eligible students to attend state community and technical colleges for free. Students must complete eight hours of community service. The deadline to complete the service this year is July 1. Details of Tennessee Promise Saturday events are available on the state parks website.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Houston Zoo’s new Texas Wetlands Exhibit showcases some whooping cranes that were relocated from Maryland after their federally funded habitat closed last year. The Houston Chronicle reports that the $20 million Texas complex, which opened in late May, is the first of four exhibits being built to mark the zoo’s 100th anniversary in 2022. The cranes are among three species featured in the exhibit. The other two are American alligators and bald eagles, and all three are native to Texas. At one time, all were nearing extinction. Zoo CEO Lee Ehmke says that the goal is to make the new exhibit engaging and genuine, for both visitors and animals. Whooping cranes have been listed as endangered since 1967.\n\nUtah\n\nMapleton: A woman in Utah County is celebrating 15 years rehabilitating wildlife in her backyard. The Daily Herald reports Patti Richards rescues hundreds of birds each year, including falcons, eagles, hawks and talking crows. Richards said she channeled her passion for birds and bears into starting the Great Basin Wildlife Rescue out of her home. The rescue has also taken in bobcats and foxes. Richards said the majority of the birds are released back into their natural habitat once they’ve recovered from their injury or illness, but some are relocated to zoos and animal facilities throughout the country. The rescue is also home to several education birds who work at schools, memorials and fundraisers. Richards said the rescue has received a lot of community support that has helped it continue to thrive.\n\nVermont\n\nWhite River Junction: The state attorney general’s office says a second forum for a hate-free Vermont is being held this week in White River Junction. The office says the event was organizated in conjunction with the Vermont NAACP, the Vermont Partnership for Fairness and Diversity, and others. Organizers say the purpose is to generate community conversation about bias incidents and hate crimes in Vermont. The moderator says the series “is intended to take the pulse of Vermonters’ experience of discrimination” and to bring together policymakers and community members to discuss the issues. Community members are encouraged to tell their stories. The event takes place Thursday from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Hartford High School.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: He was known as the man Norfolk never forgave. David Farragut, the U.S. Navy’s very first admiral and a major player in Union Navy operations during the Civil War, called Norfolk home before the war. But when Virginia seceded from the Union, his loyalty to the United States led him to flee north and continue to serve with the Union Navy – a “betrayal” that residents of this Southern city didn’t forget, The Virginian-Pilot reports. In 2016, more than 150 years after the war’s end, Norfolk named a quarter-acre pocket park in Freemason after Farragut. The park, essentially a small lawn and dog park, was dedicated in May. The park’s name stands out in Norfolk history and is perhaps indicative of a shifting attitude: Many public spaces and buildings in the city bear the names of Confederate military men. Farragut’s park is the first to recognize a Union officer.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: Skagit County officials estimate the growing elk population in the region is costing farmers $1.4 million a year. The Skagit Valley Herald reports that figure is slightly down from the $1.5 million estimate released in January. The new estimate by the Skagit County Assessor’s Office is based on 140 survey responses from farmers involved in a state program that offers tax benefits to keep farms in production. In survey responses, damage to fences and crops were listed as the top issues. Assessor Dave Thomas says the average for farms reporting elk damage was $13,000. Individual damages were as high was $150,000. Rural property owners have complained about damages as the North Cascades – or Nooksack – elk herd has grown in recent years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMinden: Thirty years after residents marched to bring attention to the PCB contamination causing cancer in their community, members of Minden Community Action say more work must be done. The Register-Herald reports the group organized a Saturday march as a re-enactment of a 1989 march for the contaminated Fayette County community. The march aimed to draw attention to ongoing problems and also honor local residents who pushed the federal government to act. Minden was contaminated after workers at the now-defunct Shaffer’s Equipment Co. dumped the carcinogenic industrial chemical PCB around the town. There have been three cleanup efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and none has fully removed the contamination.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State agriculture officials are concerned farmers will be tempted by quick access loans and credit cards as many take on more debt this year. Frank Friar, an economic development specialist for the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, tells Wisconsin Public Radio the state agency is worried farmers may turn to predatory lending agencies after years of low crop prices. The American Farm Bureau Federation warns that farm debt is at a record high, lending standards are tightening, and the cost of credit is rising. Katie Wantoch, an agriculture agent with the University of Wisconsin-Extension, says farmers in debt may also spend more on their credit cards, which will likely worsen their financial situation. Wantoch says there may be more fees they didn’t anticipate.\n\nWyoming\n\nPine Bluffs: Roman Catholics from the region have marked the 20th anniversary of a shrine featuring one of the largest concrete sculptures in the U.S. A 30-foot sculpture of the Virgin Mary stands at the center of the Our Lady of Peace Shrine outside Pine Bluffs in southeast Wyoming. It’s the largest sculpture in the state. Nearby at the shrine are 14 carvings representing the Stations of the Cross, a series of events in the life of Jesus. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports a Mass and devotional prayers took place at the shrine Saturday. Ted and Marjorie Trefren of Cheyenne built the shrine in 1999 after touring shrines in Europe.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/11"}]}

At first, he'd thought the popping sounds were coming from a blown speaker cabinet. But then he was whisked off stage in the middle of his set. Awash in fear and disbelief, he peered around a wall at a television, hoping for some news that could help him make sense of what was happening.\n\nAbout that time, Jake Owen, who'd performed earlier, hid behind a car with a group of people. Singer Chris Young and SiriusXM host Storme Warren pressed themselves against the floor of a trailer backstage. They could hear the relentless pulsing of a gun spraying bullets from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino into a crowd of roughly 22,000 country music fans gathered on the Las Vegas Strip for the Route 91 Harvest Festival.\n\n“The last possible thing I thought could be happening was somebody shooting a gun at us,” Aldean told The Tennessean months later. “Once you figure out what’s going on … what people don’t realize is that we didn’t know where it was coming from. For all we knew he was on the ground backstage walking around mowing people down. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever experienced, hands down.”\n\nCountry music has spent a year coming to terms with the deadliest mass shooting in United States history, a massacre that, arbitrarily or not, targeted the genre’s fans and its artists. The shooting, which left more than 500 people wounded and 58 dead, strained the gun culture that has long permeated country music, with some major stars taking the once-unthinkable measure of calling for stricter firearm regulations.\n\nArtists have coped through songs that address the tragedy head-on and, despite tightened security in the wake of the attack, some describe a new awareness of their own vulnerability every time they take the stage. At the same time, the country music industry has rallied around its fans and musicians, creating a network of mental health and support programs to help the healing process.\n\n\"Country music possesses a really powerful ability to connect not only the hearts of individual fans but our entire nation,\" said Academy of Country Music CEO Pete Fisher. \"I really feel like country music was the medium in which a lot of that healing was realized, but there's more healing to go. Country music is about real people and real lives, and if something is on people's hearts, you can trust country music is going to meet them there.\"\n\nHealing through song\n\nEric Church, who played the Route 91 Harvest Festival two nights before the shooting, has been open about the guilt and devastation he’s felt since the tragedy. The concert was Church’s last of 2018, and his team had used his website to promote incentives for travel to the festival.\n\n“I felt like the bait,” Church told Rolling Stone. “People come to see you play, then all of a sudden they die? That is not an emotion that I was prepared to deal with.”\n\nOn Oct. 4, three days after the shooting, his chest heaving with emotion, Church took center stage at the Grand Ole Opry to share a song he’d written after the tragedy: “Why Not Me.”\n\n“Those were my people,” he said. “Those were my fans. Sunday night something broke in me, and the only way that I’ve ever fixed something broke in me was with music. So I wrote a song.”\n\nHe sang: \"Why you from Tennessee did life capture/ And me from Tennessee get away/ And when the morning sun hit the mountain/ And a glorious still calmed the breeze/ I asked the God of all knowing wisdom/ Why you and why not me?\"\n\nMaren Morris teamed with Vice Gill to release the award-nominated “Dear Hate,” a song that reflected the moment but that she wrote with Tom Douglas and David Hodges in 2015 after the Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting.\n\nEarlier this month, Carrie Underwood included the song “The Bullet” on her new album “Cry Pretty.” The singer had planned to record the song for years but hesitated in the moment because she didn’t want it seem opportunistic. Underwood decided the song’s message was too powerful not to share.\n\nCARRIE UNDERWOOD:Underwood is crying. And that's a good thing\n\nWritten by Nashville songwriting heavyweights Marc Beeson, Andy Albert and Allen Shamblin, lyrics include: \"You can blame it on hate or blame it on guns, but mamas ain’t supposed to bury their sons.\"\n\n“It doesn’t matter who is on the other end of it,” Underwood told The Tennessean. “The thing that matters is that there are real people affected and you … don’t think about how many people are beyond (the victim), the moms, the dads, the siblings, the future that isn’t there anymore.”\n\nCalls for gun control\n\nIn the coming months, Church and other stars in the genre, including Tim McGraw, Faith Hill and Brothers Osborne, used their voices in another way: to call for commonsense laws and gun control.\n\nChurch is an adamant supporter of the Second Amendment but told Rolling Stone the shooting changed his feelings about guns “a little.”\n\n“Nobody should have 21 AKs and 10,000 rounds of ammunition and we don’t know who they are,” he said. “Something’s gotta be done so that a person can’t have an armory and pin down a Las Vegas SWAT team for six minutes. ... I don’t think our forefathers ever thought the right to bear arms was that ... I blame the lobbyists. And the biggest in the gun world is the NRA.”\n\nMcGraw and Hill were devastated by the shooting. What hit Hill's heart was when she heard doctors who treated gunshot victims say that wounds of that magnitude were only expected in war. As singers and the parents of three daughters, they couldn’t stay quiet.\n\n“This isn’t about the Second Amendment, this is about gun control,” Hill said in an interview with The Tennessean in November. “Our military … have been fighting for … the democracy of this country for so long. It’s not so we can have citizens that walk this free country … and be afraid they’re going to be shot up by someone as if they were on the battlefield from hundreds of yards away.”\n\nMcGraw added: “It takes smart, thoughtful, pragmatic, commonsense approaches to things. It takes good ideas on both sides. And people have a right to express their opinions, but don’t yell your opinion at somebody and put your fingers in your ears.”\n\nSecurity now a 'daily conversation'\n\nSince the shooting, security has gotten tighter at concerts around the country. Artist teams worked with concert venues to map exit strategies for fans in case the worst happened and history repeated.\n\n“My tour manager has security meetings at shows now, and they go through a lot of things they didn’t go through a year ago,” said country singer Michael Ray. Ray played Route 91 Harvest two days before the shooting. “They go through in case of a shooting, where’s the exits, what about the safety of the fans? It’s a daily conversation.”\n\nSoon after the shooting, vigils were held in Nashville, where the genre’s biggest singers tried to comfort the community. The Onsite Foundation and MusiCares teamed with trauma experts to host a community town hall at the performing rights organization BMI. Days after the shooting, Aldean performed an emotional version of Tom Petty's \"I Won't Back Down\" on the cold open of “Saturday Night Live,” and duet partner Miranda Lambert showed up at his first concert after the shooting to offer her support.\n\nAldean, along with singers including Ray, Dierks Bentley and The Railers visited first responders and victims in the hospital. Six weeks later, artists including Bentley, Keith Urban, Sam Hunt, Lady Antebellum and Little Big Town participated in a benefit concert to raise money for the shooting victims.\n\nWhen much of the country music community returned to Las Vegas in April for the Academy of Country Music Awards, Ray made a special return visit to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center to help ACM's Lifting Lives and Musicians on Call launch a bedside performance program for the hospital's patients.\n\nTRIBUTE PINS AT ACM AWARDS: Explaining the Las Vegas Shooting tribute pins\n\nArtists and others in the industry freely admitted they were nervous to be back. They wore commemorative pins on their clothes at the awards show to remember those lost.\n\nOn his next tour, Ray gave Route 91 survivors tours of the venues to show them where the pyrotechnics were located and gave them all-access passes to his dressing room so they had a place to go if they got overwhelmed.\n\n“I wanted to show them that we’re all in this together and don’t let this ruin what you love to do,” Ray said. “I think we all need to hold each other closer.”\n\nMUSICIANS ON CALL:Michael Ray, ACM Lifting Lives help launch Musicians on Call in Las Vegas\n\nA year later, the Nashville-based Onsite Foundation is still working to facilitate that — holding each other closer. The organization provides funding and mental health resources to vulnerable groups of the population, including victims of mass tragedies. Proceeds from the group’s annual Inspire event this year will go to fund a weeklong intensive trauma therapy camp for victims.\n\n“The most common stage we see a year later is shock,” said Miles Adcox, CEO of the Onsite Foundation. “Grief isn’t linear. Grief is messy. We’re saying it’s been a year since this happened, let’s offer these families the healing they deserve.”\n\nAdcox said the most important thing for victims to remember on the anniversary of the shooting is that it is healthy to pause.\n\n\"Do not feel like you have to run from that,\" Adcox said. \"Check in with somebody. Don’t sit in it alone.\"\n\nReach Cindy Watts at ciwatts@tennessean.com or 615-664-2227 and on Twitter @CindyNWatts.\n\nIf you go\n\nWhat: The Onsite Foundation’s annual INSPIRE event\n\nWhen: 6 p.m. Oct. 23\n\nWhere: Marathon Music Works, 1402 Clinton St. in Nashville\n\nPrice: Tickets start at $300.

The documents provide the most detailed look to date into Paddock's possible motive and gambling habits, delving into the weeks and years before he fired from his 32nd-floor windows into a crowd of 22,000 people at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.\n\nA fellow gambler told the FBI that \"Paddock was very upset at the way casinos were treating him and other high rollers,\" noting that roughly three years earlier casinos had started banning high rollers from certain events, hotels and even casinos.\n\nMass killing database:Revealing trends, details and anguish of every US event since 2006\n\nThe gambler described Paddock as a high roller with a bankroll of approximately $2 million to $3 million who preferred playing video poker. The report states that the acquaintance believed the stress about how high rollers were being treated could \"easily be what caused Paddock to 'snap.'\"\n\nThe Mandalay Bay hotel, Paddock's acquaintance told the FBI, \"was not treating Paddock well because a player of his status should have been in a higher floor in a penthouse suite.\"\n\nThe collection of FBI documents were released last week in response to a public records request by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nWho was Stephen Paddock?\n\nPaddock gambled hundreds of thousands of dollars in Las Vegas, Reno and other Nevada properties over roughly a decade prior to the shooting, according to records provided to the FBI by the Nevada Gaming Authority that were among the newly released documents.\n\nIn 2006, for example, Paddock gambled more than $945,000 and came out with roughly $4,300 in winnings. During September, the month prior to the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting, Paddock had four reservations at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino.\n\nPaddock considered himself a professional gambler, according to the documents, and told one person interviewed by the FBI that it had become his main source of income roughly three years prior to the shooting.\n\n\"Paddock purchased handgun out of concern that he had been earning a lot of cash and wanted it as a means of protection,\" the person, whose identity was not disclosed, told the FBI. The individual told the FBI Paddock had mentioned that he was banned from several casinos because he had \"made too much money from them.\"\n\nAn FBI Behavioral Analysis Unit brought together a panel of experts for a yearlong look at what motivated Paddock to fire over 1,000 rounds at the crowd over 11 minutes. The panel concluded that there was \"no single or clear motivating factor\" that drove him to the rampage.\n\nMore:US appeals court blocks ban on rapid-fire ‘bump stocks,’ device used in Las Vegas mass shooting\n\nAnother woman interviewed by the FBI at the Tropicana hotel in Las Vegas noted that Paddock would visit once every three months or so, usually during the week to play casino games.\n\n\"Paddock only wanted to discuss gambling,\" she said, recalling that during one stay from Sept. 12 to 14, just a few weeks before the shooting, Paddock lost $38,000.\n\nA new day:Couple who survived Las Vegas mass shooting together marry on tragedy's anniversary\n\n'No evidence of a conspiracy'\n\nIn 2018, Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo said that a 10-month investigation by the department resulted in \"no evidence of conspiracy or a second gunman\" and no definitive motive for the shooter.\n\nInvestigators determined that Paddock spent $1.5 million over two years, including debts paid to casinos; meanwhile, a look at 14 of his bank accounts showed he had $2.1 million in September 2015 but only about $530,000 two years later.\n\nLas Vegas sheriff:Investigation into mass shooting shows no conspiracy or second gunman\n\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter @latams or email her at tami(at)usatoday.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/08/15/maui-police-chief-john-pelletier-las-vegas-response/70594938007/", "title": "John Pelletier, Maui police chief, led response to Las Vegas shooting", "text": "Maui Police Chief John Pelletier is no stranger to responding to mass tragedy. Nearly six years before disaster struck in the form of wildfires that ripped through parts of the island and killed at least 99 people, he was on the ground in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\n\nPelletier was named chief of the the Maui Police Department in 2021 after more than two decades working in Las Vegas. On Oct. 1, 2017, Pelletier was the incident commander covering the Strip when a gunman unleashed a hail of bullets on a country music festival, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more.\n\nPelletier over the weekend referenced his experience in Las Vegas while describing the the long, painstaking process of identifying the remains of the dozens of people recovered from the burned area so far, and asked for patience with the process. Officials said they'll start releasing names Tuesday, after families have been notified.\n\n\"Give us a little bit of time,\" Pelletier said at a news conference. \"We've got to go make 89 notifications. And coming from a place that had to make 58, I understand the pain this is going to take, and we're not done with 89.\"\n\nOfficials say they expect the death toll to rise significantly over the next several days as crews search the area burned in the wildfires.\n\n\"When we find these – you know, our family and our friends – the remains we're finding is through a fire that melted metal. We have to do rapid DNA to identify them,\" Pelletier said.\n\nHere's what to know about Pelletier:\n\n22-year veteran of Las Vegas police\n\nBefore moving to Maui, Pelletier was with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department for 22 years, where he rose through the ranks and became captain, the Maui News reported when he was named chief of police.\n\nThe third-generation police officer had also been the commander of the Major Violator/Narcotics Bureau since 2020, the outlet reported. He has a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Nevada Las Vegas and also earned a certificate from the FBI academy.\n\nHe was born in Buffalo, New York, and moved around the country before settling in Las Vegas at the age of 17, according to the Honolulu Civil Beat. He said he had been visiting Hawaii for more than 20 years, the Maui News reported.\n\nWith the Las Vegas police, he managed three different area commands, including the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nPelletier says experience during massacre prepared him for post\n\nPelletier told a commission considering him for the Maui chief job that his vast experience in policing a large tourist destination while understanding the local community made him a good fit, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported in 2021.\n\nHe also said responding to the 2017 massacre would make him prepared to handle any situation. He described leading the area command that night as his greatest professional achievement to the commission, according to the outlet.\n\n“It took years to build that response. It took years to get that right, but we got that right, and we got our hands around it, and we did something incredible,” he said of the police response at the time. “We took the biggest crime scene, second only to 9/11, and we did everything to mitigate that. We brought a community together. We did something really, really great.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/12/06/las-vegas-shooting-victims-split-mgm-settlement-judges-decide/2601704001/", "title": "Las Vegas shooting settlement: Judges decide how victims split ...", "text": "On Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman perched on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas opened fire on thousands of country music fans enjoying the open-air Route 91 Harvest Festival.\n\nThe ensuing carnage from the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history echoed that of a war zone.\n\nChelsea Romo, 30, a single mom from Temecula, California, no longer has her left eye. Jason McMillan, 37, a sheriff’s deputy from Riverside, California, took a bullet to the spine. Heather Melton, 51, an orthopedic surgeon from Paris, Tennessee, lost her husband, Sonny.\n\nAll told, 58 concert attendees died, more than 800 were injured and thousands experienced varying degrees of trauma. About 4,500 plaintiffs retained attorneys to sue MGM Resorts International, Mandalay Bay's parent company, citing the hotel's lax security as the reason Stephen Paddock was able to bring 23 guns up to his suite.\n\nAfter some controversial legal maneuvering, MGM agreed Oct. 3 to settle with the plaintiffs and pay $800 million. Now comes the delicate part: Two retired judges working with input from lawyers will attempt to put a dollar figure on all that pain and suffering.\n\nHow much for the death of a spouse? How much for curtailed mobility? How much for emotional trauma? That raw calculus is scheduled to begin next month, and the money is likely to be dispensed by late 2020.\n\nOne veteran of mass tort cases – defined as involving loss or harm – offers a sober warning about the upcoming fiscal drama: Few will be happy.\n\n“In my experience, justice, fairness, satisfaction, happiness, none of it enters into this equation,” says Kenneth Feinberg, whose Washington law firm has administered some of the biggest victim compensation funds, including $7.1 billion awarded to victims of the 9/11 attacks and $6.5 billion after the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\n\n“The idea that money is an adequate substitute for loss or horrible injury is a fallacy,” Feinberg says. “This is mercy, not justice. You do the best you can. And whoever’s handling this should brace themselves for a lot of emotion and anger.”\n\nThat would be Jennifer Togliatti of Las Vegas and Louis Meisinger of Los Angeles, two retired judges in the mediation field. Togliatti and Meisinger were proposed by attorneys for the plaintiffs in an unopposed motion approved by a Clark County, Nevada, district court judge Nov. 12.\n\nLas Vegas shooting:2 years after shooting, another victim dies, making the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history even deadlier\n\nLawyers working for plaintiffs say two mediators were chosen instead of one because of the complexity of the various cases. One hails from the town where the incident happened, and the other is from California because many of the plaintiffs and their attorneys are from that state.\n\nThe judges declined a request for comment on how the valuation process works, citing an agreement made with attorneys for MGM and the plaintiffs. Interviews with lawyers representing victims, as well as experts in the tort law field, reveal some basics.\n\nShooting victims must opt into $800M fund\n\nThe first step, which will unfold over the next few months, is for victims to discuss with their attorneys the relative merits of opting into the $800 million settlement, which requires them to waive any claims they have against MGM.\n\nOpting out means being able to move ahead with an individual lawsuit, which must be filed by May 2020. That approach should be weighed with care, says Craig Eiland, whose Austin, Texas-based firm handles the cases of about 1,400 MGM shooting plaintiffs.\n\n“It could run several million dollars to prepare your case for trial, and what if the damages you end up getting don’t support that cost?” Eiland says. He anticipates most clients will agree to opt in, so they can move on with their lives. “There are risks in not participating in the settlement.”\n\nWhile plaintiffs deliberate that choice – a large number of opt-outs would mean the pot would grow for those opting in – the two judges overseeing the claims administration process will create what amounts to a compensation menu, which can result in a points system for suffering.\n\nAt the high end, families whose loved one was killed at the concert. At the low end, those inside the festival gates but not subject to injury, treatment or post-traumatic stress syndrome.\n\n“Then it’s a sliding scale, people with more significant injuries, people who were shot or trampled, people who spent time in a hospital or maybe have ongoing care at home now,” Eiland says. “Once these broad categories are set, my responsibility is to make sure we have all the information possible, so the judges can make a financial judgment on each case based on things such as lost wages, medical bills and summaries of care.\"\n\nWhat each victim of the MGM shooting will get remains unknown, but simple math suggests the pie is not overwhelming. If $800 million were to simply be divided equally among 4,500 people, that amounts to about $178,000 per plaintiff.\n\nBy contrast, Feinberg notes that when he oversaw compensation from a variety of charity funds set up for victims of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, families of the four dead, as well as two people who had to have both legs amputated, each received $2.2 million. The 14 people who lost one limb got $1.2 million each.\n\nFeinberg says the overall pool of money is so low that, were he involved in administering this case, he would focus on incidents of death, physical injury with a hospital stay and physical injury with outpatient treatment.\n\n“I would eliminate compensation for mental anguish, as that’s often very hard to prove and there’s often a very fine line,” Feinberg says.\n\nAttorneys for MGM plaintiffs acknowledge there will inevitably be unhappy clients, but reaching a settlement at least allows people to begin healing.\n\n“Some people will wish they got more, we always wish we were getting more,\" says Las Vegas attorney Robert Eglet, whose firm Eglet Adams represents roughly 2,500 of the plaintiffs in the case.\n\nEglet applauds MGM for settling. “In my view, MGM has set the bar for corporate citizenship in this country,” he says. “This was the most devastating thing to ever happen to our city, and they stepped up.”\n\nEglet was among plaintiff lawyers who spent the past February through September in mediation with MGM attorneys. That summit meeting led to the $800 million figure, the bulk of which will be paid by MGM’s insurance company.\n\nMGM at first sued shooting victims\n\nBefore the settlement, MGM took a hard-line approach. In 2018, MGM sued hundreds of victims on the grounds that it was immune from liability under a post-9/11 law known as the SAFETY (Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies) Act because the shooting should be considered an act of terrorism.\n\nThe negative public image of taking on victims may have contributed to bringing MGM to the mediation table.\n\n\"Our goal has always been to resolve these matters so our community and the victims and their families can move forward in the healing process,\" MGM Chairman and CEO Jim Murren said in a statement announcing the settlement.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to more than a dozen MGM plaintiffs to ask what their expectations were going into the settlement distribution process. Although a number had done interviews over the past two years, victims either did not return calls and emails or explained through attorneys that after a settlement was reached, they were not inclined to talk.\n\nA few did speak out when the settlement was announced. Their comments reflect the pain of what happened the night of the shooting but also hope for a redemptive future.\n\n“The scars and injuries from that night can never be erased,” Sheriff’s Deputy McMillan said in a statement released by his lawyer, Mark Robinson of Newport Beach-based Robinson Calcagnie.\n\nMcMillan has spent the past few years in rehabilitation and married the girlfriend he protected at the concert by acting as a human shield.\n\n“I’m glad we could reach a resolution that allows us to put this nightmare behind us so our family can move forward,” he said.\n\nRomo appeared at a news conference alongside her attorney, Jim Frantz of San Diego-based Frantz Law Group. With strands of her long blond hair covering her left eye, Romo said she was grateful she could see her two young children after doctors initially told her she might go blind.\n\nTechnically, in settling the case MGM does not admit to any liability for the shooting. Frantz said that although he was pleased the company had settled, he hoped MGM would make security a greater priority at its properties.\n\nRomo echoed that, adding that beyond her upcoming financial settlement, the safety of future concertgoers looms large in her mind.\n\n“The past can’t be changed,\" she said. “As far as going forward, if things could be safer and better, that’s all I could ask for.”\n\nHow much will victims' lawyers get?\n\nSuch altruistic sentiments aside, Romo and others face large medical bills associated with their treatment and rehabilitation. Even if some plaintiffs and their attorneys successfully negotiate settlements that cover those costs, surprises lurk.\n\n“In these sorts of cases, plaintiffs see a number, and that becomes an expectation, only to then find that figure gets watered down and watered down by fees,” says Elizabeth Burch, professor at the University of Georgia School of Law and author of “Mass Tort Deals: Backroom Bargaining in Multidistrict Litigation.”\n\nBurch says that attorney fees in personal injury cases – which lawyers typically take without upfront payment but reap the rewards if the client wins – can be as high as 45%. She says a portion of the overall settlement is set aside for the firms administering it, which include those of the two judges, as well as BrownGreer, a Virginia-based claims administration firm.\n\nBurch says it is unlikely the individual payout amounts will ever be publicly revealed.\n\n“Not even the plaintiffs should be aware of what others are getting, although sometimes they do reach out to each other,” she says. “Hopefully, there’s some horizontal equity since the same people are handing it all out. But in the end, one person has PTSD and another suffered loss of life, how do you compare that?”\n\nShe says mass tort cases usually are about “tempering your clients’ expectations” when it comes to financial windfalls. If not, plaintiffs can take matters into their own hands.\n\nRecipients of a recent $8 billion settlement – the result of lawsuits brought against seven companies by 100,000 women who had adverse affects from pelvic mesh procedures undertaken to battle urinary incontinence – were so displeased with how much money was eaten away by legal fees, they sued their attorneys.\n\nHerring & Panzer, a Dallas law firm, set up a website aimed at women looking to join its investigation of cases “in which lawyers for victims may have failed to recover all available benefits or may have charged clients too much in fees or expenses.”\n\nAttorneys representing plaintiffs in the MGM cases declined to specify what percentage of their clients’ fees they planned to take.\n\n“As with any practice, fees are dependent on fairness and the amount of work done on the case,” says Patrick McGroder III, an attorney with Phoenix-based Beus Gilbert.\n\nMcGroder handles about a dozen MGM cases, including that of Jovanna Calzadillas, 32, who was shot in the brain at the concert and spent two years learning to walk and talk again.\n\nMcGroder says his focus is on making sure his clients' cases get a fair hearing with the claims administrators so they receive a maximum payout.\n\n\"Attention needs to be paid to the merits of each and every case,\" he says.\n\nOne lawyer familiar with personal injury cases says he’s sure all the plaintiffs whose dream of seeing country singer Jason Aldean turned into a nightmare would prefer not to be assigning a dollar figure to their agony.\n\n“It’s important to for the public to know this isn’t about greed or winning the legal lottery, because I don’t know a single client wouldn’t pass up the money for a time machine trip back,” says Tim Hale of Santa Barbara, California-based Nye, Stirling, Hale & Miller, who specializes in childhood sexual abuse cases and won a settlement against the Boy Scouts of America.\n\n“That said, handing someone a check for $500,000 or $1 million can be a very positive thing,” he says. “I simply tell them, ‘I can’t change what happened to you, but you can use this to try and hit the reset button.’ ”\n\nFollow USA TODAY national correspondent Marco della Cava: @marcodellacava", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/10/02/new-jersey-politicians-express-sympathies-horror-after-las-vegas-shooting/722685001/", "title": "Las Vegas shooting: N.J. politicians express sympathy, oppose gun ...", "text": "NEWARK — Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr. reaffirmed his opposition at a news conference Monday to a Republican-sponsored bill that would loosen restrictions on the purchase of gun silencers, as the nation dealt with the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in recent American history.\n\n“I’m against it and I will oppose it,” he said, referring to the Sportsmen Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act. “The fact of the matter is this is insanity. We need stronger background checks. Not everybody is fit to own a gun.”\n\nPascrell, D-Paterson, and Rep. Leonard Lance, R-Clinton Township, were at Newark City Hall on Monday to urge Congress to preserve the federal deduction for state and local taxes in the plan to reform the federal tax code. But the congressmen said they felt compelled to address Sunday’s shooting at a country music festival that killed at least 59 people and injured hundreds of others.\n\nLance said that for now everyone should pray for the victims and their families, and that he hopes the police will get to the bottom of what happened in Las Vegas soon. Lance left the conference after one question from news media because he said he needed to catch a train.\n\nIn addition to his opposition to the Sportsmen Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, which was expected, Pascrell, while in Newark on Monday, called for stronger background checks for people buying guns in the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.\n\n“No one wants to take guns away from people who have legal licenses. But the weapons that this guy had were ones you go to war with,\" Pascrell said. \"Why do we have those in the street?”\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey's politicians expressed their condolences for the victims and families affected by the shooting in Las Vegas, and some pushed for stricter gun control to prevent mass shootings.\n\nThe gunman, whom authorities identified as Stephen Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada, was found dead in his hotel room in Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Police have not offered details on what weapons were used in the shooting.\n\nIn a series of tweets, Sen. Cory Booker expressed his sympathies for those injured and killed in the shooting while also calling for efforts to prevent a shooting like this from happening again. Sen. Bob Menendez and gubernatorial candidates Phil Murphy and Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno all expressed sympathy for the victims.\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer, D-Wyckoff, in a statement on Monday, offered his condolences to those affected.\n\n\"North Jersey grieves with Las Vegas and with all of the families of those lost to inexplicable and senseless violence,\" Gottheimer said in the statement. \"I am deeply grateful for the strength and the resolve of the first responders who worked to quickly neutralize the shooter and care for the injured. May their heroism serve as our inspiration as we seek answers and pursue justice in the wake of this tragedy.\"\n\nIn light of the Sunday night shooting, Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, a Ewing Township Democrat, said the shooting should push Congress to take a stand on gun safety.\n\n\"There are no words for this intentional act of evil, and as the investigation continues to unfold I must express my desperation for Congress to take on gun safety reform,\" Coleman said in a statement. \"Dotted across our map are harrowing accounts of gun violence that have devastated communities — tragedies that claim more and more lives of the innocent with every breaking news report. There is nothing left to debate.\"\n\nAt the news conference in Newark, Pascrell and Lance said the focus in the immediate wake of the shooting should be on the victims and their families. But they both said they hoped more answers would be forthcoming about the gunman, the weapons he used and how he acquired them.\n\n“I think that we should pray for the victims, and then we should get to the bottom of this,” Lance said. “The first question I have is how so many weapons were allowed in that hotel.”\n\nThe tragedy hit close to home for Pascrell, whose son Bill Pascrell III was in Las Vegas on Sunday night and was staying at a hotel near where the shooting occurred.\n\n“I was calling him and he wasn’t answering, and that just heightened the anxiety for my wife and I,” Pascrell said. “Thankfully he was safe, but I can’t get my mind off those people who were shot down while having fun.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/10/02/las-vegas-concert-shooting-during-jason-aldean-show-what-we-know/722221001/", "title": "Las Vegas shooting: What happened at Mandalay Bay, who are the ...", "text": "A gunman killed at least 59 people and injured more than 500 Sunday night in a mass shooting during a country music festival in Las Vegas, police said.\n\nThis is the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history, coming fourteen months after a shooting spree at a Florida nightclub that killed 49 people.\n\nThe shooting occurred at the Route 91 Harvest Festival at about 10:08 p.m. (Pacific Time) during a performance by Nashville country artist Jason Aldean.\n\nClark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said the suspect was found dead.\n\nWhat happened:\n\nAuthorities shut down part of the Las Vegas Strip and Interstate 15 after reports of an active shooter at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, near the Mandalay Bay Casino Sunday night.\n\nLombardo said the shooter, identified as Stephen Paddock, had fired from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay.\n\nMore:Las Vegas shooting: 'There's people bleeding and lying in the street,' Jake Owen recounts\n\nMore:Las Vegas shooting: Chris Young recounts horrific moments as gunfire erupted\n\nLas Vegas police said in a news release that Paddock opened fire on a crowd of more than 22,000.\n\nThe shooting happened during the country music festival's closing performance by Jason Aldean.\n\nVideos shared on social media show the moment gunfire erupted as Aldean performed.

Some beats were harsh, like there was anger in the mourner’s swing. Others were faint, as if they could barely muster the strength.\n\nBut every beat of the gong, loud or soft, represented the same thing – a life cut short.\n\n“This evening, I am grateful to all who we have all come together,” said Bishop Joe Pepe, of the Diocese of Las Vegas, as he wiped away tears Monday night. “In the face of this tragedy, we need each other.”\n\nThis gong was sounded over and over in front of about 300 mourners at a multi-faith vigil in Las Vegas just one day after the deadliest mass shooting in American history. Gunman Craig Paddock, 64, opened fire on a country music festival from a hotel room window on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay resort, killing at least 59 and injuring over 500 people.\n\nAt least a few of the people at Monday’s vigil had been at the festival when the gunshots began, and most knew someone who had. Through dozens of conversations with Las Vegas residents, it became clear that most everyone knew someone – a loved one, a co-worker, a friend of a friend – who had been hurt in the attack.\n\n“It was a 50-50 chance we could’ve been a that concert last night,\" said Tobi Thomas, whose daughter had a friend that narrowly escaped. “It’s devastating. It’s sad. It’s scary. I’ve just been in bed all day.”\n\nThe vigil offered a comfort to residents like Thomas. Mourners sat among tall stained glass windows and colorful murals as they listened to religious leaders from the city’s Catholic, Jewish, Protestant and Muslim communities.\n\nMore:Las Vegas shooting: How to find your loved ones\n\nRelated:Pulse survivor on Las Vegas massacre: 'It hurts'\n\nLas Vegas shooting:What we know now\n\nThe cathedral sits sandwiched between the massive Encore casino and a strip mall with a hookah lounge, a souvenir shop and an all-you-can-eat buffet. An all-gold Trump tower loomed across the street, glistening in the sunset as the vigil began.\n\nThis was Las Vegas in a nutshell, and community leaders urged the mourners not to let it change.\n\nStephen Sisolak, Clark County Commission chairman, insisted that the heavy-armed gunman could have attacked anywhere, but it was preparedness of Las Vegas Metropolitan police and casino security had prevented a tragedy far worse. Sisolak praised the city’s first responders, but also its everyday folk, who had responded so generously that “now you can’t get an appointment to donate blood until next week.”\n\nBut Sisolak drew the largest applauds of the night when he announced that a Go Fund me page designed to raise money for the families of the shooting victims had raised more than $1.8 million as the time of the vigil.\n\n“Las Vegas will never be quite the same as a result for this,” Sisolak said during the vigil. “But it doesn’t matter if this is Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Little Rock or Lansing, Michigan. This could have happened anywhere. … We cannot let the heinous acts of one individual effect our lives.”\n\nAnother vigil, this one at City Hall, opened in prayer.\n\n\"It's a heavy heart we are gathered today,\" began Pastor Troy Martinez. \"We combine strength and salvation and look to Jesus. He is the Shepard that will carry the sheep.\"\n\nSurrounded by various city, religious and public safety leaders, Mayor Carolyn Goodman addressed her city and the dozens who had come out weep together and pray for those who had been killed and injured in the shooting.\n\n\"Our city has a broken heart,\" Goodman said. \"Everyone in his community has been touched by the loss of these lives and the horror at Mandalay Bay by a sick, horrible human being.\"\n\nLas Vegas attack:Who is Stephen Paddock?

Let the Kent County country music festival battle begin.\n\nThe team behind Dover's Firefly Music Festival announced Thursday it is getting in the country game. It unveiled the Big Barrel Country Music Festival a day before tickets went on sale for the Delaware Junction country music festival in Harrington. Details for that festival were announced last week.\n\nOn top of that, Big Barrel put its tickets on sale Thursday just hours after its announcement with $99 three-day passes, $100 cheaper than Delaware Junction's $199.\n\nJune's Big Barrel is backed by concert giant AEG and Firefly creators Chicago-based Red Frog Events. August's Delaware Junction is funded and organized by live entertainment leader Live Nation and Dewey Beach's Highway One Group, headed by Alex Pires.\n\nThe front lines are now clear: two of the biggest event promoters in the world, along with their deep pockets, will fight for country music festival supremacy this summer with Kent County as their arena.\n\nAnd they will bring major acts like Carrie Underwood, Toby Keith, Merle Haggard and Jason Aldean with them.\n\nCountry music fans are suddenly facing an avalanche of country superstars coming to Delaware after years of having mostly only the Delaware State Fair hosting large-scale country concerts.\n\n\"Absolutely, they're at war,\" said Bob Lefsetz, longtime music industry analyst and critic who has published his popular The Lefsetz Letter column for 25 years. \"There can be a lot of profit in festivals and all of the companies, whether it's Live Nation, AEG or SFX Entertainment, are territorially trying to stake out their claim.\"\n\nFor country fans like Ashley Figat, 24, of Camden, Kent County's overnight transformation into a music festival capital of sorts is hard to believe. The Dover-area native, who says she will probably attend both festivals with her boyfriend, points to Firefly as the turning point after years of hoping for big-time acts to come to Dover.\n\n\"They've always talked about it since I was a kid, and they finally did it a few years ago,\" Figat says. \"It's really cool that they're both coming. There's going to be a lot of stuff to do this summer.\"\n\nThree-day passes for Big Barrel ($99-$499) went on sale Thursday and Delaware Junction's passes ($199-$799) go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. Both offer basic and VIP camping packages.\n\nTeaming up\n\nBoth Big Barrel Country Festival and Firefly Music Festival are organized by Red Frog Events, an events production company. Red Frog teamed up last year with Goldenvoice, the creators of Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in California, which is owned by concert promotion giant AEG.\n\nOne of Goldenvoice's marquee festivals, California's 7-year-old annual Stagecoach festival, is the model for Big Barrel – a mixture of modern, traditional and alternative country with bluegrass, roots and a little Southern rock thrown in.\n\nStagecoach is held at the same site as Coachella on the weekend after the two-week rock festival, just like how Big Barrel will use the same Firefly grounds the weekend after Firefly ends. Stagecoach draws about 50,000 country fans each April.\n\nFirefly officials have still left the door open for extending Firefly to two weekends in the future, which would create three straight weekends of music festivals just like Coachella and Stagecoach do in Indio, California.\n\nBig Barrel will feature music on three stages, including Firefly's main stage, using only a portion of the 300-acre site near Dover International Speedway, capitalizing on the country music/NASCAR crossover amongst fans. Firefly's silent disco, Dogfish Head craft beer hub and other attractions will be replaced by a saloon, a large-scale dance hall and barbecue area for Big Barrel.\n\nGreg Bostrom, director of both Firefly and Big Barrel for Red Frog, believes his crew will be able to change over the site in less than a week following Firefly, which is expected to once again draw 80,000 rock fans over four days.\n\nBig Barrel is expecting 20,000 to 30,000 fans and Delaware Junction is hoping for about 20,000 in its first year, organizers for both festivals have said. For comparison, Firefly drew 35,000 in 2012, its first year, and quickly grew to 80,000 last summer.\n\nBostrom says the timing of the Big Barrel announcement was largely coincidental. Firefly organizers have toyed with a sister country festival since 2011, he says, and ramped up plans when they teamed up with Goldenvoice in September.\n\n\"We were more affected by holiday timing since it's a big time to gift, obviously,\" Bostrom says. \"We got it up as soon as we possibly could with the goal of getting it in before Christmas and, obviously, I think that was a goal for the Harrington festival as well.\"\n\nNeither Highway One Group's Alex Pires nor Live Nation responded to messages Thursday for comment about the arrival of Big Barrel.\n\nLefsetz says Big Barrel has the early advantage thanks to the proven Firefly brand, familiarity, infastructure costs, comparable headliners and an earlier festival date.\n\n\"Will Live Nation stick it out with this new festival? It depends on how much money they lose or whether they make money for that matter,\" he adds. \"Does this mean only one will succeed? Not necessarily.\"\n\nCountry music has seen an explosion in popularity in recent years. The genre is the number one format for radio in the United States, and the audience has increased by 17 percent since 2006. As of spring of this year,69.7 million listeners tune to country radio each week, according to Nielsen.\n\nDifferent audience\n\nThe country music festival explosion will bring more attention (and money) into the state, says Linda Parkowski, director of the Delaware Tourism Office. But the best part of the two new country festivals is that they boast a different audience than the youth-heavy indie rock crowd.\n\n\"This new event is important because of the opportunity it gives us to expand the demographic of Firefly-driven tourism,\" she notes. \"Delaware benefits when it attracts a diverse range of visitors, and having a country festival means we'll be seeing more families, more older couples, with more money to spend.\"\n\nBoth festivals have released partial lineups, promising more to come.\n\nBig Barrel's 35-act list is led by headliners Underwood, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert with Haggard, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Loretta Lynn and critically-adored indie country newcomer Sturgill Simpson on board.\n\nAlso included are Firefly alum The Felice Brothers and Shakey Graves. (Bostrom also gave a hint for Firefly's 2015 roster by saying one of Big Barrels' acts will make its Firefly debut this summer.)\n\nDelaware Junction has released the names of 15 modern country acts with its three nights headlined by Aldean, Keith and Florida Georgia Line. Popular country singers Colt Ford, Cole Swindell and Thomas Rhett are also Delaware-bound.\n\nWhile all of Delaware Junction's headliners have previously played the Delaware State Fair, Big Barrel boasts legendary figures like Haggard and Lynn, which never seem to end up touring in The First State.\n\nFor Middletown's Jordan Shupe, the choice between the two festivals was easy: only one has Merle.\n\n\"The chance to see Merle Haggard, that doesn't happen much,\" says Shupe, 25. \"Some of these people I've been dying for them to come around here for a while, and now they're going to be in our backyard. That's awesome.\"\n\nBringing in people\n\nJim Lutz, CEO of Fordham and Dominion Brewing Company in Dover, says another musical festival in Dover is a win for both the city, county and their businesses.\n\n\"Whenever we have an opportunity to bring non-Delawareans or non-Kent County people here I think that's a good thing,\" Lutz says. \"I think we have an opportunity as a community to embrace these people and show them a good time when they're here, and hopefully they'll come out and spend a couple of dollars at the businesses in Dover and in Kent County.\"\n\nBostrom says only about 15 percent of Firefly attendees came from Delaware last year with the rest made up by fans from the 49 other states and 24 different countries around the world. He expects about the same for Big Barrel, drawing the rest from outside.\n\nWith Big Barrel targeting a wider country/Americana audience, Delaware Junction is focusing intently on modern country and with out-of-state fans making up the bulk of the crowd, Bostrom believes both festivals can survive in Kent County, which has a population of about 169,500.\n\n\"Delaware is now an event epicenter. All of a sudden, people are seeing it for what it should be: a great destination event location. And I think Firefly helped pave the way for that,\" he says. \"With us being in June and them being in August and look at the differences in the line-ups, I think it's going to be a space where both can be successful and I'd be surprised if a there's not thousands of people who end up doing both.\"\n\nAnd its those fans who should benefit the most over Delaware's country music festival showdown, Lefsetz says: \"It's always good news for the fans when there's competition.\"\n\nContact Ryan Cormier at (302) 324-2863 or rcormier@delawareonline.com.

Another search warrant was executed Monday at a separate home that Paddock owned in Reno, but details weren't released as to what was found in that house.\n\nLombardo described Paddock, the son of a 1960s bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list after escaping from prison, as \"a distraught person intent on causing mass casualties.\" Lombardo said Paddock was likely a \"lone wolf\" and that a motive for the shooting had not been determined.\n\n\"This is a crazed lunatic full of hate,\" Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman said. \"This has been a hugely traumatic time for all of us.\"\n\nPaddock had checked into the Mandalay Bay on Sept. 28, but officials couldn’t say by Monday evening whether he specifically requested the towering room. They also couldn’t offer a definite timeline of Paddock’s actions in the days leading up to the shooting, the moments during the massacre, or how Paddock managed to transport nearly two dozen weapons into his room undetected.\n\nAssistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo said he knew the public was eager to understand Paddock’s motive, but urged patience during the investigation.\n\n“We’re hunting down and tracing down every clue we can get in his background,” he said.\n\nOther officials touted the city’s resilience in the aftermath of the city’s tragedy. Blood banks were now stocked, and by Monday evening were turning away would-be donors. And a GoFundMe page had collected more than $2.2 million from 30,000 donors, including a $400,000 donation from Stephen Cloobeck, the founder of Diamond Resorts International.\n\nPaddock’s brother, Eric Paddock, who lives in Florida, says his multimillionaire brother was a big spender at casinos and often received free meals and rooms there.\n\nWith hospitals jammed with victims, authorities put out a call for blood donations and set up a hotline to report missing people and speed the identification of the dead and wounded. They also opened a “family reunification center” for people to find loved ones.\n\nMore than 12 hours after the massacre, bodies covered in white sheets were still being removed from the festival grounds.\n\nPresident Trump addressed the nation Monday from the White House, calling the attack \"an act of pure evil\" and ordering flags flown at half staff. He thanked first-responders for their \"miraculous\" efforts and said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday.\n\nThe mass shooting underscored how easy it can be to bring weapons and other contraband into hotels . Although it wasn't immediately clear how Paddock got the weapons and ammo to his room, security experts say he easily could have hid them in innocuous containers.\n\n\"You can bring a long gun in disassembled in a small suitcase. Nobody would think twice about somebody carrying in a golf bag, or something like a big snow ski bag,\" said Angela Hrdlicka, a former Secret Service agent who is now a private security consultant for Major League Baseball parks and other professional sports.\n\nLombardo said officials have yet to locate any manifesto or other indication of motive.\n\nLombardo laid out the frantic minutes between the shooting and officials locating Paddock in his 32nd-floor hotel room. He said officers received information from security that the shooter was likely staying between the 28th and the 32nd floor.\n\nA team of six officers approached security, went up in elevators and checked “each floor, floor by floor,” until they reached Paddock’s room, he said.\n\nAs they approached the room, the team came under fire and one security guard was shot in the leg. The team then backed off for a SWAT team to intervene. They were able to gain entry into the room and found Paddock dead.\n\nMore:\n\nThe three-day Route 91 Harvest festival started Friday, and Lombardo estimated that 22,000 people were in the crowd when the shooting began Sunday at about 10 p.m. local time.\n\nThe festival's headliner, country music singer Jason Aldean, was on stage when the barrage of bullets began and continued to play through the first, extended volley, video from the scene shows. The crowd appeared confused, unsure what the sound was.\n\nThe music stopped at about the same time the volley did, but after several seconds another, lengthy round of gunfire began, setting off bedlam in the crowd. Videos on social media show people ducking for cover and fleeing amid the unrelenting bombardment.\n\nCassie Manzanares, who was covering the festival for a Utah radio station, said she heard a \"popping\" noise.\n\n\"I've shot guns before, and it didn't sound like a gun,\" Manzanares said. \"I thought maybe someone was doing firecrackers as a joke, or something happened with the pyrotechnics. But the next round (of gunfire) started, and that's when we heard the screaming.\"\n\nTerrified, she said she froze. But a friend was shot, and she said she realized they had to run.\n\n\"We jumped over the wall and there were just bodies and blood and people screaming and trying to get away,\" Manzanares said. \"People were breaking down fences to use to carry the bodies.\"\n\nJustin Zimmerman, of Dexter, Iowa, said he was with four friends when the carnage began.\n\n\"I left my friends to go get more beer, then you heard a distinct 'Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!,'\" he said. \"(I) thought it was the sound guy messing up, but you learn quickly it's actual gunfire.\"\n\nHe said he, too, froze and then hit the ground. Eventually he ran to the safety of a nearby casino.\n\nAmong the victims was Sonny Melton, 29, a registered nurse from Big Sandy, Tenn. \"He saved my life,\" his wife, Heather, said. \"He grabbed me from behind and started running when I felt him get shot in the back.\"\n\nAldean confirmed that he and the rest of his team were safe.\n\n\"Tonight has been beyond horrific,\" Aldean posted on Instagram. \"It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night.\"\n\nAaron Rouse, chief of the FBI’s Las Vegas office, disputed an Islamic State claim that Paddock was one of the militant group's soldiers. Rouse said no connection to the militant group had been found.\n\n\"We have no idea what his belief system was,\" Lombardo said. \"We believe he was the sole aggressor.\"\n\nAuthorities were reviewing the recent transfers of large amounts of money involving the suspect and the possible relationship to gambling activities, a federal law enforcement official said. The official, who was not authorized to comment publicly, said the review is part of wide-ranging search for a possible motive in the attack.\n\nLombardo said Paddock checked into the hotel Thursday. He said that when the shooting started, authorities could see the gunfire was coming from Mandalay Bay. Employees and guests helped direct officers to the room. Officers used explosives to \"breach\" the door and found Paddock's body.\n\nAbout 23 weapons, many of them rifles, were found inside Paddock’s hotel room, authorities said at a late press conference Monday.\n\nA federal law enforcement official, who has been briefed on the matter but is not authorized to comment publicly, said that police also found two tripods positioned at the hotel windows in what appeared to be a fully-equipped sniper’s nest to take better aim at the crowd below.\n\nHundreds of rounds of ammunition were among the suspect’s possessions, a cache that could have sustained him in a much longer assault, the official said.\n\nThe Associated Press also reported that two of the weapons were modified to make them fully automatic, according to two U.S. officials briefed by law enforcement who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still unfolding.\n\nAuthorities believe that the gunman, who had no serious criminal background, purchased many of the weapons legally. Though investigators were attempting determine whether he illegally converted some to operate as fully automatic weapons, the official said.\n\nLombardo said authorities also searched Paddock's home and found even more weapons — 19 firearms, explosives, and unidentified electronic devices, as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition.\n\nGuns & Guitars, a shop in Mesquite, confirmed that Paddock had purchased guns from them in a past. Manager Chris Sullivan said all necessary background checks and procedures were followed.\n\n\"He never gave any indication or reason to believe he was unstable or unfit at any time,\" Sullivan said. \"We are currently cooperating with the ongoing investigation.\"\n\nMesquite is a town of about 18,000 people 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas. Paddock lived in a retirement community, Sun City Mesquite, an upscale development of about 1,400 homes. The community includes an 18-hole golf course, indoor and outdoor swimming pools and a recreation center. Residents must be at least 55 years old, and no children are allowed.\n\nPaddock's brother, who lives in East Orlando, Fla., said that to his knowledge, his brother had no history of mental illness or substance abuse. He said his brother had \"nothing to do\" with political or religious organizations. His brother owned guns and played high-stakes video poker, he said.\n\n\n\n\"There's absolutely no way I can even conceive that my brother would shoot a bunch of people he didn't even know,\" Eric Paddock said. \"There's no rationale. There's nothing anywhere that said why he did this.\"\n\nThe FBI confirmed that the shooter’s father was a bank robber who reached the FBI’s Top Ten Most Wanted list in 1968 after escaping prison. The wanted poster described Benjamin Paddock as a \"psychopath\" and \"very dangerous.\" He was recaptured 10 years later and has since died.\n\nLombardo said police had named Paddock's roommate, Marilou Danley, as a person of interest. She is out of the country, and Lombardo said she will be questioned further upon her return.\n\nCity officials urged local residents to donate blood as blood drives organized across the city drew long lines. Kay Anne Johnson, 32, who has lived in Las Vegas for about six years, said she fell asleep before she knew the extent of the shooting spree. Her husband woke her at 5 a.m. with the tragic news.\n\n\"At that point, you aren't going back to sleep, she said. \"You get up and try to find a way to help.\"\n\nPope Francis expressed his “spiritual closeness” to victims and promised his prayers in a telegram addressed to the Bishop Joseph Anthony Pepe of Las Vegas.\n\nNevada Gov. Brian Sandoval called the shooting a \"cowardly\" act.\n\n\"We are angry, we are grieving,\" he said. \"We're confused. People are hurting.\"\n\nContributing: Jane Onyanga-Omara, Alan Gomez and Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY; Emily Havens, The Spectrum and Daily News; Caroline Glenn, Florida Today; Aaron Young, The Des Moines Register; Brett Kelman, The Desert Sun; Josh Susong and Megan Cassidy, The Arizona Republic; Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/10/03/mgm-resorts-pay-las-vegas-shooting-victims-up-800-million/3851787002/", "title": "Victims in Las Vegas shooting massacre to receive up to $800 million", "text": "The Tennessean\n\nAttorneys for victims of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history say they’ve reached a settlement to resolve lawsuits that’s expected to pay between $735 million and $800 million.\n\nA statement Thursday from Las Vegas law firm Eglet Adams says the amount of the settlement with MGM Resorts International depends on the number of plaintiffs who choose to take part.\n\nHundreds of lawsuits have been filed against the owner of the resort where the gunman opened fire into an outdoor concert on Oct. 1, 2017. The company also owns the venue that hosted the Route 91 Harvest festival where 58 people died and hundreds were injured.\n\nEglet Adams represents nearly 2,500 victims and made the announcement just days after the second anniversary of the massacre.\n\nAn independent administrator will be appointed by a court to dole out money from the settlement fund, attorneys and MGM said. They expect to wrap up the process by late next year.\n\n“Our goal has always been to resolve these matters so our community and the victims and their families can move forward in the healing process,” said Jim Murren, chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts. “This agreement with the plaintiffs’ counsel is a major step, and one that we hoped for a long time would be possible.”\n\nMGM’s insurers will fund a minimum of $735 million. Depending on the number of victims who participate, the company will contribute more, up to $800 million, according to the victims’ attorneys.\n\nThe shooting occurred during the festival's closing set by headliner Jason Aldean. Fellow country stars Jake Owen and Luke Combs were side stage while \"Hangin' On\" singer Chris Young was backstage with popular radio personality Storme Warren. Independent country singer Jordan Mitchell was also among those backstage.\n\nNo one from Nashville was injured. A Tennessee resident, Sonny Melton, was killed shielding his wife, Heather Melton, from flying bullets.\n\nPrior to Aldean taking the stage, Nashville artists Luke Combs, Jason Owen and Kane Brown performed on Sunday.\n\nIn addition to Aldean, another Nashville label had two other artists, Walker McGuire and Adam Craig, perform at the festival.\n\n“The last possible thing I thought could be happening was somebody shooting a gun at us,” Aldean told The Tennessean months later. “Once you figure out what’s going on … what people don’t realize is that we didn’t know where it was coming from. For all we knew he was on the ground backstage walking around mowing people down. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever experienced, hands down.”\n\nRELATED:Franklin woman recounts swirl of 'panic' during Vegas shooting\n\nLas Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock\n\nThe gunman, identified as Stephen Craig Paddock, was stationed 32 floors above the show in Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.\n\nA wealthy retired accountant, 64-year-old Paddock was an avid gambler who enjoyed playing high-stakes poker. He killed himself shortly before officers stormed his hotel room, said Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo.\n\nAccording to a final three-page behavioral report released in January by the FBI, Paddock wanted mass destruction but wasn't motivated by a grievance against anyone injured or killed in the attack.\n\n\"It wasn't about MGM, Mandalay Bay or a specific casino or venue,\" said Aaron Rouse, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Las Vegas office. \"It was all about doing the maximum amount of damage and him obtaining some form of infamy.\"\n\nThis is a developing story, check back for updates.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/03"}]}

Two-time WNBA MVP Elena Delle Donne played there as well.\n\n“The opportunity to join Conference USA is a very proud moment for our entire university,” athletic director Chrissi Rawak said. “With this step forward, we will continue to offer an incredible student-athlete experience and elevate the visibility of all that is remarkable about UD.\"\n\nThe Blue Hens currently play in the Coastal Athletic Association. The CAA, which changed its name earlier this year from the Colonial Athletic Association, had 15 teams in football this season. The league lost James Madison after the 2021 season, and the Dukes’ transition to the FBS has gone so well they reached the AP Top 25 this year.\n\nUMass, Old Dominion and Georgia State are a few other former CAA programs that now play in the FBS.\n\nDelaware will compete in Conference USA in baseball, men’s and women’s basketball, cross-country, football, men’s and women’s golf, women’s soccer, softball, men’s and women’s tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The school said there would be more information in the months ahead about where its other programs will compete. The Blue Hens reached the NCAA Tournament in men's lacrosse last season and nearly upset top-seeded Duke.\n\nDelaware's most recent FCS football title came in 2003, and it has reached the championship game twice since then. The Blue Hens beat Lafayette last weekend in the FCS playoffs. Coach Ryan Carty's team plays at Montana in the second round this weekend.\n\nDelaware's varsity programs will stay in the CAA through the 2024-25 season, and all of them except football will remain eligible to compete for conference championships and the NCAA postseason. Football is not eligible for a conference title or the FCS playoffs once its transition to the FBS begins after this season.\n\nThe school said its 2024 football team will play an FCS schedule. It will be in Conference USA the following year, but won't be eligible to play in the league championship game until 2026.\n\nThe football team plays at 22,000-seat Delaware Stadium.\n\n\"We are confident that we have the infrastructure in place at UD to compete with the very best in college football and simultaneously witness the growth of our other intercollegiate programs in the department,” Rawak said. “UD Athletics continues to ascend, and Blue Hen football is prepared to take the next step and lead the way.”\n\nFBS football requires extra scholarships, and with gender equity in mind, Delaware said it will be adding another women's varsity sport that will be announced later.\n\n___\n\nAP College Football Writer Ralph D.

Villanova has played Penn State, but not since 1951.\n\nMORE IN SPORTS:\n\nPenn State transfer Reeder is Blue Hens' \"heartbeat\"\n\nSmyrna's Wormley, a force up front, is Penn State-bound\n\nSix factors could make or break Blue Hens in 2018\n\nIt’ll be a huge challenge for the Blue Hens. Delaware has not defeated an FBS team since a 59-52 victory at Navy in 2007 in which Joe Flacco passed for 434 yards, third most in UD history.\n\nSince then, Delaware has lost at FBS Maryland 14-7 in 2008, Navy 35-18 in 2009, Navy 40-17 in 2011, Navy 51-7 in 2013, Pitt 62-0 in 2014, North Carolina 41-14 in 2015, Wake Forest 38-21 in 2016 and Virginia Tech 27-0 last season.\n\nDelaware does not play an FBS foe this year but goes back to Pitt in 2019 and travels to North Carolina State in 2020.\n\nVisits to FBS opponents from power-five leagues typically net about a $500,000 guaranteed payment for the visiting school. It isn’t known what Delaware will receive at Penn State.\n\nPlayers often relish the opportunity to go against higher-level opposition especially in familiar areas at well-known, packed stadiums.\n\nAs a result, the games at Penn State should serve as a valuable recruiting tool for Delaware, which gets many of its players from Pennsylvania.

Steven Floyd a final farewell", "text": "Xerxes Wilson\n\nThe News Journal\n\nMore than 1,000 people gave a final farewell Saturday to Lt. Steven Floyd Sr., a correctional officer killed during a hostage situation at Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna earlier this month.\n\nThose who attended said Floyd was eulogized in a packed gymnasium at the school with hundreds paying respects outside the service. Later, a procession of dozens of vehicles was saluted by first responders who gathered on Del. 1 as Floyd was taken to Barratt's Chapel Cemetery, where he was buried.\n\n\"It was a moving expression of sympathy for the family and at the same time, an impressive showing of solidarity from those in the law enforcement community,\" said State Sen. Brian Bushweller, D-Dover.\n\nFloyd, 47, was a 16-year Department of Corrections veteran. He is survived by his wife, Saundra, as well as two children.\n\nLaw enforcement officials from throughout the United States and Canada attended the services. Reporters were asked not to attend.\n\n\"What an absolutely amazing send off for (Lt.) Steven Floyd. I know he would of been so proud of today,\" wrote a Milford resident identified as David Halton M III on Facebook after sharing a video from the service. \"The support (Delaware corrections workers) received is beyond just a simple 'thank you.'\"\n\nMore than 18 hours after inmates at Vaughn took control of hostages in one of the prison's buildings on Feb. 2, police used a backhoe to break into the building and found Floyd unresponsive. He was the only casualty from the tense standoff that has shaken the state.\n\nRELATED: Correctional officer's death ruled homicide by trauma\n\nRELATED: Prisons plagued for years by chronic understaffing\n\nFloyd is believed to be the first Delaware correctional officer to be killed in the line of duty since the Delaware Department of Corrections took control of three county jails in the 1950s.\n\nState officials posthumously promoted Floyd from sergeant to lieutenant, effective Feb. 1. A Medal of Valor was presented to his 28-year-old son, Steven Floyd Jr., at a graduation ceremony for a new class of correctional officer cadets.\n\nFloyd spent his entire career at Vaughn Correctional and was promoted to sergeant in 2002, according to the Correction Department. He received the facility's Warden Award for Outstanding Performance in 2016 and was recognized for not missing a single day of work in 2004 and 2005.\n\nIn the days since the prison standoff, Floyd has been described as a hero. Geoff Klopp, president of the Correctional Officers Association of Delaware union, has said Floyd warned his fellow guards as the takeover began.\n\n\"When the lieutenants came into the building, that's when (Lt.) Steven Floyd Sr. then told the lieutenants that it was a trap and to get out of the building,\" Klopp said the day after the standoff ended. \"(Lt.) Steven Floyd Sr. saved lives in an emergency situation yesterday in [Building C] at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.\"\n\nSTORY: Delaware Gov. Carney orders review of prison standoff\n\nSTORY: DOC officer assaulted at Vaughn, but details scarce\n\nThe correctional officer's death was determined to be a homicide by trauma, state police said following the standoff. But mystery remains about Floyd's death and what caused the prison standoff. State Police have said the criminal investigation is ongoing.\n\nGroups centered on prison reform have called for a federal investigation into the riot, which inmates said stemmed from conditions in the jail, in phone calls to The News Journal during the standoff. Last week, Gov. John Carney said the state would initiate an independent review of the incident. He's expected to announce more information about that review early next week.\n\nBushweller, a member of the State Senate's Public Safety Committee, said his mind was on the well-being of Floyd's family Saturday and he's confident the investigation will be exhaustive.\n\n\"I'm very comfortable that Governor Carney has every intention of conducting an independent and comprehensive inquiry here as to what happened so we can all concentrate on taking the steps necessary to ensure this doesn't happen again,\" Bushweller said.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

Vaughn Correctional Center inmates had been staging increasing numbers of peaceful protests inside the Smyrna-area prison, including refusing to obey commands, refusing to line up for headcount or to bus their dinner trays in the chow hall.\n\nA nearly 18-hour siege of Vaughn Correctional Center's Building C began with a choreographed fight by prisoners who covered their faces with cloth as they returned from the recreation yard shortly after 10:30 a.m. on Feb. 1.\n\nFeb. 1\n\n10:38 a.m.: Radio call by Sgt. Steven Floyd reports a disturbance in C Building involving an inmate fight and request for assistance. Taken hostage along with Floyd are corrections officers Winslow Smith, Joshua Wilkinson, Cpl. Justin Tuxward, Cpl. Matthew McCall, Cpl. Owen Hammond and prison counselor Patricia May.\n\nMoments later, Vaughn Correctional Center, as well as all Delaware prisons, are placed on lockdown. The DOC emergency response team was initiated.\n\n1:47 p.m.: DOC confirms via press release that officers are responding to a hostage situation at Vaughn Correctional Center near Smyrna.\n\n1:59 p.m.: The News Journal receives its first call from an inmate identifying himself as a hostage inside the prison. The person lists demands, says an officer has been stabbed.\n\n2:25 p.m.: First hostage, a DOC employee, is released with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nFeb. 2\n\n5:06 a.m.: Delaware State and Maryland State police use a backhoe to break through the unit wall, allowing authorities with heavy weapons to rush in and end the siege. Floyd's body is found unresponsive and he is pronounced dead at 5:29 a.m.\n\n8 a.m.: DOC announces that hostage situation is resolved.\n\n10:30 a.m.: DOC, Gov. John Carney, and other officials hold a press conference to detail how the hostages were found, what occurred and what they will do to ensure it never happens again. Details on a motive by inmates to take hostages is not released.\n\n2 p.m.: Correctional Officers Association of Delaware holds a press conference to mourn the loss of Floyd and call attention to the problems within the prison, including understaffing and safety issues.\n\nFeb. 7\n\nHours after the Delaware Coalition of Prison Reform and Justice demands an independent federal investigation into the deadly hostage situation, Carney says the state would initiate an independent review of the incident.\n\nFeb. 11\n\nMore than 1,000 people give Floyd a final farewell. The DOC's 16-year veteran is eulogized at Delaware State University Memorial Hall before he is taken to Barratt's Chapel Cemetery, where he was buried.\n\nFeb. 13\n\nThe DOC confirms correction officers resigned or announced their resignation from employment at Vaughn Correctional Center since the Feb. 1 standoff.\n\nFeb. 14\n\nThe initial lawsuit that provides what appears to be the first account of the ordeal from a prisoner's perspective is filed in federal court by inmate Donald Parkell, who claims he was held hostage in the standoff. His lawsuit outlines how no more than 10 inmates in Building C restrained and \"savagely\" beat three correctional officers, whose heads were covered with cloth bags or hoods to prevent them from seeing their captors.\n\nFeb. 23\n\nSenate Labor Committee Chairman Robert Marshall, D-Wilmington, conducts a hearing in which correctional officers described a prison in which inmates not only dangerously outnumber officers but have been allowed to wield unprecedented power over staff.\n\nMarch 6\n\nFrustrated by silence, the family of Lt. Steven Floyd delivers a letter to Gov. John Carney asking the governor to fix the state's \"broken\" DOC.\n\nMarch 13\n\nGov. John Carney announces that he plans to add more correctional officers and buy new safety equipment for prison staffers. Carney authorizes $340,000 to purchase new protective gear and communications equipment and his administration increases the frequency of random security sweeps at Vaughn by specialized teams. The first-term governor also promises to ask the General Assembly to hire 50 new correctional officers at Vaughn and 25 new officers at Baylor Women's Correctional Institution. That would cost an estimated $2.3 million.\n\nMarch 15\n\nIn a statement issued by attorneys representing Lt. Steven Floyd's family, the widow of the slain corrections officer said she refused to meet with the governor and claimed she had been \"threatened by lawyers for the state\" demanding the repayment of her husband's funeral expenses.\n\nMarch 21\n\nThe DOC confirms that David Pierce, who was Vaughn's warden during the prisoner siege, had been reassigned. Pierce was quietly placed on administrative leave with pay three weeks after inmates took control of a prison building. The state has declined to say why Pierce was removed from the position, again citing private personnel records.\n\nMarch 24\n\nThe Rev. Christopher Bullock, founder of the Delaware Coalition of Prison Reform and Justice, lists demands his coalition wants to see occur inside the state's penal system, including a federal investigation of Delaware's prisons.\n\nApril 17\n\nCorrectional officers do not report to work as part of a planned \"sick out\" to put pressure on elected officials to increase their pay. While DOC officials would not say how many corrections officers called out that day, The News Journal was told that about 200 of the department's total 2,500 workforce did not show up.\n\nApril 18\n\nFamily of Lt. Steven Floyd and five DOC workers taken hostage during the Feb. 1 incident file a federal lawsuit claiming that years of failure in Delaware prisons led to the deadly takeover. In addition to placing the blame on the administrations of governors Ruth Ann Minner and Jack Markell for understaffing the DOC, the lawsuit also raised questions about whether the siege could have ended sooner and possibly saving Floyd's life.\n\nMay 1\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Charles M. Oberly III joins the Independent Review Team's investigation into the deadly prison after former Delaware Supreme Court Justice Henry duPont Ridgely recuses himself due to a conflict of interest. Ridgely stepped down when a federal lawsuit was filed against past and present Delaware officials, including his sister-in-law Ann Visalli, the former state budget director.\n\nMay 19\n\nDOC officials name Air Force Lt. Col. Dana Metzger as the new Vaughn warden. Metzger boasts more than 20 years of military experience and at the time was serving as the commander of the 436th Security Forces Squadron, which oversees a force of 300 personnel providing combat support, emergency services, law enforcement and security and antiterrorism efforts.\n\nJune 2\n\nFormer U.S. Attorney Charles Oberly III and retired Judge William Chapman release a preliminary report on what they found led to the deadly incident. They conclude previous failures to follow recommendations made in 2005, coupled with the recent mixing of gang members, a lack of programs for inmates and an \"us vs. them\" mentality between rank-and-file and officials, ultimately led to the death Floyd and the injuries of other correctional officers held hostage for nearly 18 hours.\n\nJune 20\n\nCarney and the unions that represent prison correctional officers announce an agreement that would increase starting pay and lead to safer conditions inside prison walls.\n\nJune 28\n\nClaire DeMatteis, a former senior counsel to then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden, is named temporary special assistant to Carney. DeMatteis is and charged with spearheading reform at the DOC and to produce public reports at six months and a year with a focus on the implementation of recommendations made by the independent review team.\n\nSept. 1\n\nThe Independent Review Team releases its final report on what led to the deadly incident, including in the report was how Floyd's request to have specific inmates moved out of Building C – 12 days prior to the siege – was never carried out. The report also made its final 41 recommendations on what needed to be improved.\n\nOct. 17\n\nDelaware prosecutors indicted 18 inmates in connection with the deadly siege at Vaughn. Sixteen of the men are charged with Floyd's first-degree murder.\n\nNov. 1\n\nSuperior Court Judge William C. Carpenter Jr. is assigned to handle the cases of 18 inmates indicted in the rebellion.\n\nDec. 15\n\nThe state agrees to pay more than $7.5 million to settle a federal lawsuit filed by the family of slain correctional officer Lt. Steven Floyd and six DOC workers taken hostage during the siege.\n\nJan. 12\n\nClaire DeMatteis, the special assistant charged with spearheading reform at the DOC, issues her first progress report, claiming that while work is still needed to implement all 41 recommendations strides have been made. This includes the purchase and installation of security cameras, the formation of a prisoner-led advisory council and an end to masked prison cell shakedowns.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/02/16/10-iconic-places-delaware-you-should-visit/330984002/", "title": "10 iconic places in Delaware newcomers should visit", "text": "Ken Mammarella\n\nSpecial to The News Journal\n\nOriginally published 2/15/18.\n\nFor such a small state, Delaware is packed with places to see, ranging from the splendiferous mansions of the du Pont family in the north, to the incredible marshlands of Prime Hook in the South.\n\nHere are our picks for the 10 you have to see:\n\n1. Rodney Square\n\nRodney Square has been the symbolic heart of Wilmington since its creation in 1921, on land that used to be a courthouse, and before that, a reservoir.\n\nOver the years it has hosted festivals, concerts, rallies, farmers markets and other events, and it has also served as a landmark place to meet, particularly next to the 1923 statue of patriot Caesar Rodney on his horse. The statue was removed in 2020 after national and local protests.\n\nThe adjacent buildings have all evolved. The building to the west was erected to house DuPont Co. headquarters, but DuPont has moved to the suburbs, leaving it as the headquarters of spinoff Chemours and a hotel and theater run by others.\n\nThe federal office building to the north is now primarily banking space.\n\nThe city-county building to the east is now primarily law offices. The library to the south is still a library, but with the world gone digital, it has fewer books.\n\n2. Michael N. Castle Trail\n\nMore than 100,000 hikers, runners, cyclists and equestrian enthusiasts each year appreciate the pastoral scenery and maritime traffic of the Michael N. Castle Trail along the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal, one of the busiest in the world.\n\nThe 12.1-mile trail in 2013 was named for Castle, a former governor and U.S. congressman, with extensions named for other things connecting it to the Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay.\n\nA Delaware trifecta occurs if you pause under the William V. Roth Bridge (named for another U.S. congressman, known nationwide for the Roth IRA) and contemplate the canal, which symbolically splits the state into an urbanized north and more agriculture-based south.\n\n3. Old New Castle\n\nA leisurely walk in Old New Castle is like a step back in time, in an area second in the country in the number and authenticity of its colonial and federal structures.\n\nStart in that one block of Market Street that retains cobblestones and feel what it’s like to move on this quaint technology (answer: no wonder waterways were more popular).\n\nLook for signs of history in the centuries-old houses nearby, such as emblems that showed which fire company was paid to protect which house, boot scrapers anchored to the sidewalk and used to remove mud and muck and gossip mirrors that allowed people on the second floor to see who was at the front door.\n\nDouble marriage:Wilmington twin sisters to marry twin brothers\n\nMuseums run by the state, the Delaware Historical Society and the New Castle Historical Society get into more depth, and themed fare in Jessop’s Tavern (the building dates to 1674) complete the period visit.\n\nAsk residents if they’ve followed the tradition of William Penn in declaring their ownership of the land. His livery of seisin involved “one turf with a twig upon it, a porringer with river water and soyle, in part of all,” according to the historical marker.\n\n4. WWII towers\n\nEleven concrete towers along the Sussex County coast form a somber contrast to the beach fun under their shadows.\n\nThey were installed during World War II to protect upriver industries from a Nazi invasion that thankfully never happened. The towers were built quickly, 40 to 90 feet tall, 17 feet wide. Over the decades, staircases have rusted, and sand and saltwater have weakened the structures.\n\nBut until recurring calls for restoration generate enough money and commitment, they remain silent and unused witnesses to war.\n\n5. Kalmar Nyckel\n\nThe original Kalmar Nyckel in 1638 brought the inhabitants of the first permanent European settlement in Delaware. The replica tall ship, launched 359 years later, serves as a floating classroom and a maritime adventure.\n\nIn cold seasons, there are weekend ship tours at its Wilmington shipyard (200 yards from where those Europeans landed) plus more nautical and historical insight in the adjacent Copeland Maritime Center.\n\nTours continue in warmer weather, and there are day sails, pirate sails and river cruises out of Wilmington and Lewes – plus specialized events in both ports and in locations along the East Coast.\n\nwww.kalmarnyckel.org.\n\n6. Hagley, Nemours, Winterthur\n\nThe legacy of the du Ponts, whose company for decades dominated the state’s economy, has a more genteel side with three impressive family mansions that have become museums.\n\nEleutherian Mills was the family’s first home in Delaware, overlooking the Hagley yards where the black powder was made (explore that area as well). Nemours (110,000 objects, 77 rooms, 300 acres) and Winterthur (90,000 objects, 175 rooms, 1,000 acres) represent the visions of Alfred I. and Henry Francis.\n\nWhich gardens, antiques, design and backstory are the most memorable? You need to revisit to decide.\n\nwww.hagley.org, www.nemoursmansion.org and www.winterthur.org.\n\n7. Prime Hook\n\nHundreds of thousands of migratory birds benefit from the preservation of the Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, 10,144 acres of mostly wetlands on the Delaware Bay, northeast of Milford.\n\nOf particular concern are the endangered red knots and piping plovers. The rufa red knot is the “first U.S. bird listed explicitly [as threatened] because its existence is imperiled by global warming,” Audubon magazine wrote in 2016.\n\nLIVING AT THE BEACH:Sussex House features views of bay, Ocean City\n\nThe refuge is the home for 308 species of birds, 51 species of fish, 45 species of reptiles and amphibians and 37 species of mammals. Another 80,000 mammals — that would be us — visit the refuge each year to hunt, fish, take photos, canoe, kayak, learn about the environment and observe all that wildlife.\n\nwww.fws.gov/refuge/prime_hook.\n\n8. Dover Green\n\nDelaware became the first state during a Dec. 7, 1787, meeting at a tavern called the Golden Fleece. The tavern, since demolished, was on land that’s part of Dover’s Green.\n\nThe area hosts events (like Dover Days and Christmas caroling) and is the focus of the boundary-free First State Heritage Park. Not far away are offices of the state’s General Assembly, many state agencies and the governor’s mansion.\n\nPark tours, by interpreters in Colonial attire, cover “markets and fairs, suffragists and abolitionists, soldiers and slaves, lawmakers and law-breakers,” according to the Kent County Tourism Corp., plus “fires, poisonings and tragic love.”\n\nwww.destateparks.com/partk/first-state-heritage/index.asp.\n\n9. Lewes\n\nLewes calls itself the first town in the First State because the first European settlement of Delaware was nearby. The 1631 Dutch colony, looking for whales and named after swans, was found burned and empty by another expedition the next year.\n\nThe Lewes Historical Society offers tours on land and water of its buildings and other important local sites.\n\nOne unusual stop is the Cannonball House, at various times the mayor’s office, a restaurant and a laundry but known and named for the cannonball in its side, from the War of 1812.\n\nLewes is also home to the Overfalls, one of seven lightships nationwide open to the public, boutiques and a variety of restaurants.\n\n10. Barratt’s Chapel\n\nBarratt’s Chapel earned its place in history on Nov. 14, 1784, when “sacramental ordinances were administered for the first time by Methodist clergy in America,” a state historical marker says.\n\nCalled the cradle of U.S. Methodism, the simple brick building near Frederica still looks like what it did on that historic day, although the inside has been updated.\n\nYou can get inside the chapel and the adjacent Methodist museum twice a week, with plans this summer to resume Thursday evening worship.\n\nwww.barrattschapel.org", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2019/03/10/no-3-north-carolina-beats-no-4-duke-for-share-of-acc-title/39175349/", "title": "No. 3 North Carolina beats No. 4 Duke for share of ACC title", "text": "AP\n\nCHAPEL HILL, N.C.

Donald Trump has failed to be a uniter and has targeted immigrants and people of color with his \"law and order.\" He’s pushing through a dangerous lawsuit to take away health care from millions of Americans in the middle of a pandemic. Those who are middle and low-income earners are struggling to get by, and the recent pandemic has made things worse. Instead of providing a clear vision of leadership for our country, Trump bullies and blusters.\n\nTrump failed to protect us from the pandemic. Our health care heroes rose to the occasion and selflessly worked to care for those impacted by the virus. Local leaders and organizations secured and produced PPE when the federal government failed us. Sewers and seamstresses delivered thousands of masks and gowns to those who needed them. Now, it is time for Americans to pull together once again and vote. Whether it is by mail, early in person, or at the polls, every voice and every vote must be counted.\n\nMore:Absentee ballot requests are outpacing 2016 in many Iowa counties. Here's how election offices say they've prepared.\n\n— Karen Pratte, Waterville\n\nInsulin is not as cheap as water\n\nDuring the first debate, President Donald Trump claimed that Insulin, a medication taken by millions of Americans, was as cheap as water.\n\nThis is patently false. I have been on Insulin for over 20 years and my co-pay has not changed in over four years; the cost of the medication is unchanged. Under many health insurance plans diabetics are forced to pay thousands of dollars each month for insulin until their deductibles are met.\n\nThe president has signed an executive order on insulin prices; according to PolitiFact, this action will do little to help Americans. The order affects only 1 in 5 Americans who get their insulin from 1 in 10 clinics. For the millions of Americans who rely on insulin to stay alive because of diabetes, the full federal and state governments need to take action to bring the cost down on this medication that has been on the market for over 20 years to give us a chance to live a normal life.\n\n— John Tagliareni, Ankeny\n\nWe need leaders who take heed on climate change\n\nMy lilacs bloomed this month because of the crazy weather. 2020 is on track to be the earth’s hottest year on record. We need to make changes right now, the scientists say. I worry that my children and grandchildren will be climate refugees, struggling to find food and water.\n\nI will be voting for U.S. Rep. Cindy Axne. We need people in office who understand we are in the midst of a climate crisis and that protecting our piece of the world requires global cooperation and tough choices. We need someone from Iowa who will fight for farmer-led versus corporate-decided agricultural climate solutions.\n\nI will not be voting for David Young for U.S. representative. During his previous time in office he supported President Trump’s attacks on the environment. Young voted against carbon pollution limits for power plants, voted to cut funding for environmental and public health concerns, voted against collaborative efforts to protect the oceans, voted against reducing the release of the greenhouse gas methane, and much more. We're the ag state. Iowa should lead with farmer-led climate solutions. We need someone who will move us forward, not backward. I trust Axne to continue to work hard for Iowans.\n\nMore:Climate warriors: Iowa farmers are joining new initiatives that pay them to battle climate change\n\n— Denise Franck, Polk City\n\nGrandparents hold things together\n\nI’d like to thank all the grandparents who are providing safe havens and now school instruction for all their grandkids. They are unpaid, untrained, and possibly under-appreciated. They are proving that you’re never to old to learn … or teach.\n\n— Nancy Brown, Urbandale\n\nAmerica needs a new direction\n\nTuesday evening’s debate was a complete disaster. The moderator, Chris Wallace, lost control of the debate several times when Donald Trump interrupted Joe Biden constantly. The entire debate should have been canceled after the first 30 minutes. Trump did not show respect toward Biden and constantly made a fool of himself. After watching the first third of the debate I decided it was a waste of my time and switched channels. The United States does not need another four years of Trump.\n\nMore:Des Moines Register, 3 TV partners to host U.S. Senate debate Oct. 15: Joni Ernst vs. Theresa Greenfield\n\n— Roger Hammelman, Urbandale\n\nTax relief wasn’t much for some\n\nThere is the old saying, the devil is in the details, and that can be said about Sen. Joni Ernst’s claim of providing tax relief to Iowans. In a debate, Ernst said, “Bottom line, we would love to see lower taxes for everybody, including all of our hard-working Americans,\" Ernst said. \"The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was part of that effort, which gave tax relief to 1 million Iowans.”\n\nSo yes, 1.3 million Iowans got a tax cut due to the law; however, the average tax change for the bottom 20% of Iowans, those earning less than $26,290 per year, was a $110 cut.\n\nCompare that to the top 1% of Iowans, those who earn more than $475,120, who saw an average $43,060 cut!\n\nWhile technically Ernst’s statement is true, I wonder if Iowans already struggling to get by and working paycheck to paycheck saw this $110 as much relief.\n\nThe bottom line is the tax code and the tax cut law, which Ernst supported, favors the wealthy and not those hard-working Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\n— Cindy Garlock, Cedar Rapids\n\nHating Trump isn’t a policy, isn’t helping\n\nFor four years Democrats have expressed a deep-seated hatred for President Donald Trump, his supporters and virtually all Republicans. This irrational hatred has resulted in no benefit to the people of the U.S. or the world, except the leaders of China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, all of whom seek to damage America’s standing in the world. Trump’s policies have addressed many of the nation’s problems and helped to bolster those nations who believe in democracy and freedom.\n\nDemocrats have dedicated all their energy to a policy of trying to thwart any attempt by Trump to address the problems we face. Instead of helping solve the nation’s problems, the goal is to deny the president and Republicans any successes. This has failed, except for the doubt created about Russian collusion, which enabled Democrats to win the House in 2018. The party of hate has doubled down on this philosophy for four years, and when Trump is re-elected, it will only increase. Hate breeds more hate when it doesn’t get its way.\n\n— Ron Eklund, West Des Moines\n\nSupreme Court must be invested in people\n\nMost of the American people agree that the Supreme Court nominee should be replaced after the election. Yet this is not what we are seeing today. Donald Trump replacing Ruth Bader Ginsburg with Amy Coney Barrett just days before the election is a blatant example of Trump not working for the people, but for his own personal interest. Back in 2016, before Barack Obama was leaving office and he had the chance to make a nomination, there was a Republican outcry that the people needed to influence who receives a lifelong appointment.\n\nEither Republican officials have suddenly changed their minds or they are continuously proving that they will act solely for the sake of their self-interest, not for the majority of Americans. Tell senators that this situation is hypocritical, disrespectful to Ginsburg, and biased toward Trump's wishes. Our leaders need to see that the public is not settling with the lack of morals and backbone the Senate majority is displaying today.\n\nMore:3 Iowans are on President Trump's list of potential Supreme Court nominees\n\n— Elizabeth Sheldon, Pella\n\nThe rich have to do their part paying taxes\n\nFor all of those who think President Donald Trump's not paying taxes is a good thing, I could ask: If no one pays taxes, from where will the money come to pay down the trillions of dollars of debt, or what money will be used to support the farmers and businesses harmed by the economic strife from the COVID-19 crisis? I think there should be some sharing of the financial burden of this country's financial responsibilities from the super-class.\n\nMore:Sen. Chuck Grassley: 'I'd be very concerned' about how President Donald Trump's tax returns got out\n\n— Don Franzen, Urbandale\n\nErnst represents Iowans’ values\n\nIowa has gone Republican for the past three election cycles because our conservative, Midwest values oppose the radical left agenda. We don’t believe in defunding the police, rioting and looting, or woke professors polluting the minds of our students. We also believe Supreme Court justices should uphold the Constitution, not re-write its plain meaning.\n\nThe left is outraged, but if they had the White House and Senate, they would support an election-year nominee. Judge Amy Coney Barrett checks all the boxes: She is a brilliant legal scholar, is roundly supported by a bipartisan collection of her colleagues, and is committed to preserving the original intent of the Constitution. Thank you, Sen. Joni Ernst, for standing up to the leftist outrage machine, and the national media, in supporting this great choice for the court.\n\n— State Sen. Jake Chapman, Adel\n\nWe cannot forego reproductive freedom\n\nAmericans face a threat to reproductive freedom and health care and Iowans are experiencing the threat firsthand as our access to affordable, high-quality reproductive health care has been severely diminished with the defunding of Planned Parenthood and dismantling of the state’s family planning program. A program providing low- to moderate-income individuals with birth control, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, cancer screenings and annual exams.\n\nFourteen thousand Iowans were impacted by the Trump administration forcing Planned Parenthood’s exit from the federal Title X family planning program. Women were discontinuing their birth control because of the expense. Planned Parenthood patients needing STI testing and treatment left without care because they could not afford a co-pay.\n\nIn an attempt to control a person’s right to reproductive freedom, Republican lawmakers, having control of the Legislature and governor’s office, have introduced anti-abortion bills, including a constitutional amendment stripping Iowans of their right to access safe and legal abortion. In addition, these lawmakers passed one of the most restrictive abortion bans and waiting period, later ruled unconstitutional by our state courts.\n\nAmericans have the right to quality, affordable health care and the right to make reproductive decisions with their health care provider. Yes, abortion is health care. Funding Planned Parenthood will provide Americans access to health care no matter their ethnicity, racial background, sexual orientation or ability to pay. Planned Parenthood provide accurate, honest information to its patients along with providing sex education in schools and advocacy.\n\nMore:Opinion: Iowa's crisis is not abortion. Iowa's crisis is maternal health, and we shouldn't make it worse.\n\n— Tracy Creason, Des Moines\n\nTrump must do what is best for country, not party\n\nOne of the most important positions in this country is that of a Supreme Court justice. A person in that position makes decisions that will affect the country for years, even generations, to come. In filling such a position it only makes sense to take time to find the most qualified person in the country. It would be a person with a long list of accomplishments, one known for fair and scholarly decisions formed without bias to the left or right. To find just the right person would require casting a wide net and spending considerable time in the vetting process. That’s not what is happening.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made it clear in choosing a person from the Federalist Society list a person with scant experience and an unimpressive record that he is not looking for the best person. He wants a person he has cause to believe would strike down the Affordable Care Act. He wants someone who would reverse Roe v. Wade. He wants someone who would placate the gun lobby. Most importantly, he wants someone who would cast a deciding vote for him if he can create enough chaos in the election to bring the result to the steps of the Supreme Court.\n\nIt is clear that Trump and the Republican Party are not seeking a justice. They want an accomplice.\n\nMore:Iowa primary: Republicans trying to recapture a formerly red district in Des Moines' suburbs\n\n— Karl Schilling, Des Moines\n\nEven our president isn't above federal law\n\nThe saying that “actions speak louder than words” could not be more true than when observing Donald Trump. Trump’s tax forms show that he has paid little if any income tax over the last decade. We don’t need to see his taxes to know this because he has blatantly bragged about how smart he is on this topic. I pay my taxes with pride because I feel it is critical that we support our military, FBI, CIA, police and many others that keep America safe from foreign influence. I pay my taxes because I want to support government-funded research in medicine, environmental protection and renewable energy. I pay my taxes because I want to help ensure every American has access to adequate and affordable medical care, to excellent public education, and to safe and modern infrastructure.\n\nI pay my taxes so that America can protect and care for our national parks, wildlife refuges, and forests. I pay my taxes so that when a natural disaster strikes a region of our country, our government can help. Additionally, I pay my taxes so that so that the national debt does not grow any larger than it already is, because any time we allow the national debt to grow, we are choosing to serve ourselves and put the cost on our grandchildren. That is not acceptable. Mr. Trump, a real patriot pays his share of income taxes, because paying your tax is what makes America great.\n\nMore:Vice President Mike Pence to return to Des Moines for Family Leader event\n\n— Thomas Rosburg, Colo\n\nOur republic at risk of disappearing\n\nAfter watching the presidential debate Tuesday, I thought of a statement by one of our founders, Ben Franklin. At the infancy of our government he replied to someone asking what kind of government was developed to which he replied, “a republic, if we can keep it.” I think it would behoove everyone casting a ballot this election cycle to give Mr. Franklin's response some very deep consideraton.\n\nMore:Steve King votes 'no' on resolution affirming peaceful transfer of power following the election\n\n— Joe Youngwirth, Des Moines\n\nAnyone appointed by Trump is suspect\n\nBeing appointed or nominated for a position by President Donald Trump puts the candidate's integrity in question. Trump has repeatedly asked for a pledge of loyalty from his nominees. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' appointment was considered by Trump a big mistake because he failed to get a prior loyalty pledge.\n\nIt would be crazy to think the Supreme Court nominee is an exception. She has been compromised by Trump. She will not recuse herself if contested election results are put before the Supreme Court. Trump cannot be trusted even for an otherwise fine appointment.\n\nMore:At the White House, Kim Reynolds, Donald Trump, Mike Pence talk about the resilience of the food supply amid virus outbreak\n\n— Daniel Prescott, Bettendorf\n\nNo one should be above paying taxes\n\nIf anything will bring our country down, it will be the laggards in the upper-class income groups of our society who pay no taxes.\n\nThese citizens often have the attitude that they are wiser and more competent than those of us who actually take responsibility and annually pay our dues. I have been in the lower-middle to higher-poverty levels of income my entire adult life, paid taxes every year, and still do in retirement. I've had family members who've repeatedly implied that to pay taxes is foolish and unnecessary and that I have been greatly amiss for not learning how to work our system.\n\nDonald Trump has this pompous attitude, not only toward those who have been foolish enough to serve our country, but also toward those who pay taxes. What a poor model of outstanding, responsible, and gracious integrity.\n\nMore:Iowa tax revenue drops by 48% as tax deadlines pushed back over coronavirus\n\n— Mary McBee, Tama\n\nTake the time to count all the ballots\n\nA bill has been proposed by Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida that\n\nwould stop all ballot counting 24 hours after polls close. Scott may perhaps not have noticed that we are in the midst of a pandemic and that many, many people are choosing mail-in voting this year as a precaution.\n\nIt's obvious counting ballots may take a while this year. That doesn't mean we simply throw the remainder away if counting isn't done at a certain time. If we have to take some extra time to process and count every ballot, so be it. No one has the right to toss any legitimate ballot, to do so is to undermine one of the most sacred premises of our democracy.\n\nMore:Iowa Legislature adjourns after passing budget that includes new voter ID requirements\n\n— Jerry Parks, Burlington\n\nWe need a leader who can manage a crisis\n\nPeople have good reasons for voting for Donald Trump, and people have good reasons for voting for Joe Biden. The next president will have many days of routine presidential duties that are not a challenge for him or the country. The test of true leadership comes when there is a domestic or international crisis and normalcy goes away.\n\nTrump was faced with a pandemic and did not handle the crisis well, even though he said he did a great job. The primary variable among several variables is the president’s personality, his character, his temperament. These will guide how he treats his advisers, his friends and foes, and how he deals with the threat coming at him in a crisis. So those voters who are still pondering their presidential choice in this election should look at the character and temperament of both candidates. Then they can make a serious judgment call based on how these men have responded to past crises in their personal and professional lives.\n\nMore:Joe Biden fills out Iowa general election leadership team with 4 new hires\n\n— Thomas Beck, Ankeny\n\nSecretary Pate can make right decision for blind\n\nThis year COVID-19 robbed most of us of a great deal of our independence. It made us fearful to associate with others. It jeopardized in-person voting as well.\n\nIn recognition of this, Secretary of State Paul Pate has taken some steps to make voting safer for Iowans during the pandemic. Despite some initial pushback, he ultimately requested and got permission from the Legislative Council to send out absentee ballot request forms to all registered voters. He was helping many of us regain the independence of access to voting.\n\nA solution exists that allows blind individuals to complete the ballot independently, legally, safely and securely, and it isn’t electronic voting. This solution was presented to Pate. In a meeting with the council, he chose not to request permission to make it available.\n\nPate has told blind Iowans he needs legislative approval to implement the voting system. Yet, he refuses to request that approval. He is wrong. Federal court decisions as recently as last week in North Carolina are specific that these voting options are mandated by the Americans with Disability Act. Mr. Pate, please do the right and legal thing by giving the blind of Iowa the independence to join other Iowans to vote privately and safely.\n\nMore:Iowa Senate passes bill prohibiting secretary of state from automatically mailing absentee ballot request forms\n\n— Don Wirth, Ames\n\nConsider Affordable Care Act in court nomination\n\nIn Iowa, 4% of children under the age of 18 have a disability. We are home to one of those children. My daughter is a pure delight despite her profound physical disabilities. Yet, without quality health insurance, we would go broke. I was particularly relieved when the Affordable Care Act was passed. The ACA afforded my child the opportunity to remain on my insurance until she is 26; she cannot be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions, and there is no longer a lifetime cap on the services she receives.\n\nThe ACA has been a financial lifeline. Yet, the ACA could be erased with the appointment of a new Supreme Court justice. Some are cheering the pro-life position of Amy Coney Barrett. Sen. Chuck Grassley and Sen. Joni Ernst, your vote for Barrett's appointment has the potential to financially doom the lives of children with disabilities. For the sake of my family and 4% of other Iowa families, don’t let a single issue be your deciding factor.\n\nMore:It's time to sign up for the Affordable Care Act. Here's what you need to know.\n\n— Julie Simanski, Ankeny\n\nGood reasons for everybody to vote\n\nI have been a Democrat my entire adult life. I am also a retired art teacher, homeowner, and active community volunteer. I support my church, the UNI Panthers and our local high schools. I am a citizen and I am weary of the current volatile rhetoric that aims to attach extreme labels and further divide us. I am not a crazy leftist socialist any more than my Republican friends and neighbors are radical right-wing fascists. I should not be labeled a Trump hater simply because I disagree with his policies and style of governing.\n\nI long for leadership that will guide our country back closer to a middle ground. My appeal is not only to moderate Democrats and Republicans and those who consider themselves without a party. It is also to those citizens who choose not to vote because they feel their vote will not matter. If you want to see an America that is quieter, more efficient and more fair to all citizens, then vote for change. Your vote in this election is more powerful and important than at any time in recent history.\n\nMore:Expecting a surge of mail-in votes, Iowa will give counties a head-start on opening absentee ballots\n\n— William Close, New Hartford\n\nTrump shouldn't cast doubt on election's credibility\n\nPresident Donald Trump has suggested invalidating the Nov. 3 presidential election if results don’t go his way. The culprits in his plan to discredit the election will be state-controlled voting procedures in strategically chosen states. His banter of challenging a peaceful transfer of power may affect the credibility of election results across the ballot.\n\nSome people may forfeit voting if they believe their vote is for naught. Further, Trump has threatened to coerce state legislatures to switch Electoral College voters to persons more favorable to him.\n\nOur right to self-government is dependent upon credible and reliable elections. The power of incumbents to invalidate an election ensures authority over voters who have lost the ability to make choices in their own best interests. State and county auditors are responsible for keeping all election results beyond reproach. Transparency of election procedures and results is a buffer between an electoral democracy and totalitarianism.\n\nMore:The pandemic, the post office and the politically driven panic undermining voting by mail\n\n— Geoffrey Abelson, Ames\n\nIt's not who I vote for but what I vote for\n\nI vote for kindness. It helps you see the poor, the outcast and the broken-hearted.\n\nI vote for honesty. It gives you respect. You don't blame others.\n\nI vote for humility. You don't care who gets recognized.\n\nI vote for mercy. You don't think about getting even.\n\nI vote for gentleness. It makes you approachable.\n\nI vote for self-control. You think before you talk.\n\nI vote for compassion. You love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nI vote for faithfulness. You are committed to justice and liberty for all.\n\nIf it's a school board member, town council member, congress person or a president, I vote for these things.\n\n— Gerry Klopfenstein, Wayland\n\nPut Trump on mute\n\nOuch! Trump didn't look at the camera and address the American public once in the debate. When he wasn't interrupting, he was slouching and glancing around. Plus, he argued with the moderator nearly as much as with Joe Biden. There were a few moments where Biden looked a little shaky and was evasive at times, and calling Trump a \"clown\" was out of line, but Trump was a raging dumpster fire. I think Trump lost ground with independents and with Obama voters who switched sides in 2016.\n\nThe next debate (if there is one) needs to put the candidates in separate rooms and turn off the microphone when the other candidate is answering a question.\n\n— Jim Zeller, Des Moines\n\nHate, anger and lies\n\nAre my fellow Iowans proud of our president?\n\nA president who can't denounce white supremacy.\n\nA president who will not commit to a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nA president who is telling us the election is rigged.\n\nA president who has no vision for America, only hate, anger and lies.\n\n— Ronald J. Davidson, Clive\n\nTrump, Ernst keep hurting farmers\n\nI grew up on a farm in northwest Iowa. My parents and our neighbors, also farmers, were some of the wisest, most caring people I will ever know. Iowa needs wise, service-oriented leaders and representatives.\n\nThe denial of some oil refiners’ requests for exemptions from U.S. biofuel laws helps Iowa but is not permanent and did not come until right before the re-election bids by both Donald Trump and Sen. Joni Ernst.\n\nThe farm aid bill advocated just weeks before the election gives the president unlimited allocation discretion; this after Californians had to beg him for federal aid to address fires that have destroyed lives, homes, the forest and air quality.\n\nWe have cut a deal with China to sell soybeans, but that hinges on the president’s relations with China. There could be another potential cold war between Trump and China. The U.S. can be strong with China without destroying trade relationships. Bullying does not equate with strength. Diplomacy has in the past led to bilateral benefits. Iowans want markets, not just last-minute handouts to garner votes. Iowans, please show your wisdom at the polls and elect leaders committed to wisdom, service and diplomacy, Joe Biden and Theresa Greenfield.\n\nMore:Ernst as flip-flopper? Greenfield as court packer?

Chuck Grassley continues to fuel the doubt that citizens have in our institutions. When he continues to contradict his words and actions, he leaves voters little room for doubt.\n\nThe beaming Grassley who led Neil Gorsuch around the Senate chambers during the first day of his confirmation hearing in 2017 after refusing to even hold a hearing for Merrick Garland was hypocritical, to be outdone only by the senator's current flip-flop in his rush to appoint a replacement for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nWhen I can no longer take a person’s word for what it is, then my trust in that person is lost.

I will be one of them. As a breast cancer survivor, I have seen firsthand how devastating breast cancer can be. That’s why I’m working with the National Breast Cancer Coalition to stop the clock.\n\nIn 2020, 42,170 women will die of breast cancer in the United States alone, and 90% of those deaths will result from metastatic disease, which is cancer that has spread from the breast to the bones, lungs or other parts of the body. There is no cure, and the average life expectancy is just three years. The Metastatic Breast Cancer Access to Care Act (H.R. 2178, S. 1374) would waive Medicare and Social Security disability waiting periods for people with metastatic breast cancer.\n\nTo date, 173 members of the House of Representatives and 21 senators have signed on as co-sponsors. October may be Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but breast cancer takes lives every month, every day, every 13 minutes. I encourage others to join me in contacting our elected officials to ask them to support The Metastatic Breast Cancer Access to Care Act and to take action this October.\n\nMore:'One way or another': He promised to be by her side during chemo, but he wasn't counting on a pandemic\n\n— Danielle Mason, La Porte City\n\nVery few of Trump's policies are pro-life\n\nI was raised in the Catholic faith and I believe in the sanctity of life. However, Kristan Hawkins’ essay in the Sept. 26 Register (\"Catholics can't ignore abortion or Harris' bigotry\") strikes me as myopic. She challenges Catholics to “put aside personalities and to focus on the human rights issue of our day” — abortion. I was stunned that Hawkins’ support for Donald Trump ignores his apparent brutality toward people he deems unworthy: Immigrants are placed in cages and Black lives don’t matter as he sends in troops during protest marches.\n\nReinstating the death penalty doesn’t show respect for life. Does Trump show he values elderly people as he chips away at Social Security? Attacking the Affordable Care Act and offering no alternative shows little care for people with pre-existing conditions and no health care coverage.\n\nTrump ignores our present climate crisis and works to open pristine forests for logging and fragile landscapes for drilling oil; these aggressive acts affect every single person in the United States as our climate becomes more violent and kills more people. To me, being pro-life means respecting life from birth to death as a seamless garment of love for all people and for our home, Mother Earth. When people cast their votes in this presidential election, I urge everyone to remember this consistent lack of human compassion from Trump and all his supporters.\n\n— Kay Kopatich, Des Moines\n\nWe'll be the judge of that\n\nBeing an elected official, you can claim to be happy, disappointed, or elated.

This is not a comprehensive list.\n\nAfghanistan withdrawal\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment in Afghanistan upon its military withdrawal in 2021.\n\n“Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country, where we lost lives, left Americans behind and surrendered $85 billion worth of the finest military equipment anywhere in the world,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: Trump’s figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion — a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.\n\nThere is not any basis for Trump’s claim that $85 billion worth of equipment was left behind. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, that was a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. Only part of this funding was for equipment.\n\nStrategic Petroleum Reserve\n\nTrump claimed his administration “filled up” the Strategic Petroleum Reserve but it has now been “virtually drained” by the Biden administration.\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are false. He didn’t fill up the reserve, and the reserve is not “virtually drained.”\n\nThough Trump has repeatedly boasted of supposedly having filled up the reserve, it actually contained fewer barrels of crude when he left office in early 2021 than when he took office in 2017. That’s not all because of him – the law requires some mandatory sales from the reserve for budget reasons, and Democrats in Congress blocked the funding needed to execute Trump’s 2020 directive to buy tens of millions more barrels and fill the reserve to its maximum capacity – but nonetheless, it didn’t get filled.\n\nAs CNN’s Matt Egan and Phil Mattingly reported in mid-October, the US reserve remains the largest in the world even though it was at a 38-year low after President Joe Biden released a major chunk of it to help keep oil prices down in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine (and, coincidentally or not, prior to the midterm elections). The reserve had more than 396 million barrels of crude oil as of the week ending November 4.\n\nTariffs on China\n\nTrump also boasted about his tariffs on China, claiming that “no president had ever sought or received $1 for our country from China until I came along.”\n\nFacts First: As we have written repeatedly, it’s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an “average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.”\n\nAlso, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments – and study after study during Trump’s presidency found that Americans were bearing the cost of the tariffs.\n\nSea level rise\n\nTrump claimed that unnamed people aren’t talking about the threat of nuclear weapons because they are obsessed with environmental issues, which he said, “they say may affect us in 300 years.” He added, “They say the ocean will rise 1/8 of an inch over the next 200 to 300 years. But don’t worry about nuclear weapons that can take out entire countries with one shot.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claims are false – even if you ignore the absurd contention that people aren’t paying attention to nuclear threats because they’re focused on the environment. Sea levels are expected to rise much faster than Trump said. The US government’s National Ocean Service said on its website that “sea level along the U.S. coastline is projected to rise, on average, 10 - 12 inches (0.25 - 0.30 meters) in the next 30 years (2020 - 2050), which will be as much as the rise measured over the last 100 years (1920 - 2020).”\n\nAnd though Trump didn’t use the words “climate change” in this claim, he strongly suggested that people say climate change may only affect us in 300 years. That is grossly inaccurate; it is affecting the US today. The Department of Defense said in a 2021 report: “Increasing temperatures; changing precipitation patterns; and more frequent, intense, and unpredictable extreme weather conditions caused by climate change are exacerbating existing risks and creating new security challenges for U.S. interests.”\n\nDrug use and punishment in China\n\nTrump claimed that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had told him that China has no “drug problem” at all because of its harsh treatment of drug traffickers. Trump then repeated the claim himself, saying, “if you get caught dealing drugs in China you have an immediate and quick trial, and by the end of the day, you are executed. That’s a terrible thing, but they have no drug problem.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s claim is not true, just as it was when he made similar claims as president. Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University’s Dornsife School of Public Health, said that “yes, China has a drug problem” and that “China, like the US, has a large number of people who use (a wide range of) drugs.” The Chinese government has itself reported that “there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide” as of the end of 2021; in the past, officials in China have acknowledged that the number of registered drug users are a significant undercount of actual drug use there.\n\nAnd while Trump solely credits harsh punishments for what he claims is China’s success in handling drugs, the Chinese government also touts its rehabilitation, education and anti-poverty efforts.\n\nPresidential records\n\nComplaining about how he is under criminal investigation for taking presidential documents to his Florida home and resort, Trump repeated a debunked claim about former President Barack Obama’s handling of presidential documents.\n\n“Obama took a lot of things with him,” Trump said.\n\nFacts First: This is false – as the National Archives and Records Administration pointed out in August when Trump previously made this claim. Though Trump claimed that Obama had taken millions of records to Chicago, NARA explained in a public statement that it had itself taken these records to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area – which is near where Obama’s presidential library will be located. It said that, as per federal law, “former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration.”\n\nNARA has also debunked Trump’s recent claims about various other presidents having supposedly taken documents to their own home states; in those cases, too, it was NARA that moved the documents, not the former presidents. It is standard for NARA to set up temporary facilities near where former presidents’ permanent libraries will eventually be located.\n\nGas prices\n\nAs he has on other occasions during Biden’s tenure, Trump used misleading figures when discussing the price of gas. He said: “We were $1.87 a gallon for gasoline, and now it’s sitting five, six, seven and even eight dollars, and it’s gonna go really bad.”\n\nFacts First: This is so misleading that we’re classifying it as inaccurate. While the price of a gallon of regular gas did briefly fall to $1.87 (and lower) during the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, the national average for regular gas on Trump’s last day in office, January 20, 2021, was much higher than that – $2.393 per gallon, according to data provided to CNN by the American Automobile Association. And while there are some remote gas stations where prices are always much higher than the national average, the national average Tuesday is $3.759, per AAA data, not $5, $6, $7 or $8. California, the state with the highest prices as usual, has an average of $5.423.\n\nDeportations under Obama\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday evening that his administration, unlike Obama’s administration, had convinced countries like Guatemala and Honduras to take back their gang members that had come to America.\n\n“The worst gangs are MS-13. And under the Barack Hussein Obama administration, they were unable to take them out. Because their countries where they came from wouldn’t take them,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn’t take back their citizens during Obama’s administration, though there were some individual exceptions.\n\nIn 2016, just prior to Trump’s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant,” or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals.\n\nFor the 2016 fiscal year, Obama’s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. You can read a longer fact check, from 2019, here.\n\nMissile landing in Poland\n\nTrump claimed Tuesday that a missile that was “sent in probably by Russia” landed 50 miles into Poland. “People are going absolutely wild and crazy and they’re not happy,” Trump said from Mar-a-Lago.\n\nFacts First: This claim is false. While Poland said a Russian-made missile did land in their territory Tuesday, killing two Polish citizens, the explosion happened about four miles west from the Ukrainian border.\n\nAdditionally, it remains unclear where the missile was fired from, and why it fell in Poland.\n\nFinishing the border wall\n\nTrump made a false claim about one of his signature policies, a wall at the border with Mexico.\n\n“We built the wall, and now we will add to it. Now, we built the wall – we completed the wall – and then we said let’s do more, and we did a lot more. And we did a lot more. And as we were doing it, we had an election that came up. And when they came in, they had three more weeks to complete the additions to the wall, which would’ve been great, and they said no, no, we’re not going to do that,” he said.\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that Trump “completed” the border wall.\n\nAccording to an official “Border Wall Status” report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump – but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not completed. The report, provided to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280, about 74 miles of barriers were “in the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,” and that 206 miles were “currently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.”\n\nDemocratic leaders and the National Guard\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic governors and mayors refused to ask for “help” even during “a total breakdown of law and order,” and “don’t want to ever ask to do anything,” so “we sent in the National Guard in Minneapolis and in other places.”\n\nFacts First: This is a false claim Trump liked to make during his presidency. It’s not true that Trump sent in the National Guard to Minneapolis and that Democratic leaders there refused to ask; it was actually Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard amid unrest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for more than two decades, first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself.\n\nWhen Trump made this false claim in 2020, Walz’s office told CNN that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul – cities also run by Democrats.\n\nBiden’s acuity\n\nMocking Biden’s mental acuity, Trump said, “There are a lot of bad things, like going to Idaho and saying ‘Welcome to the state of Florida, I really love it.’”\n\nFacts First: This never happened. Biden, like Trump, has made occasional gaffes in referring to places, but this one is fiction. At a rally earlier this month, Trump claimed that Biden had gone to Iowa and wrongly claimed to be in Idaho; that false claim was published by a satirical website in 2020.\n\nIllegal immigration\n\nLamenting illegal immigration, Trump said, “I believe it’s 10 million people coming in, not three or four million people. They’re pouring into our country.”\n\nFacts First: False. “There is no empirical basis at all for the idea that 10 million undocumented people have entered under President Biden,” Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the University of Southern California’s law school, who studies immigration, said in a Monday email when CNN asked her about Trump making this claim earlier in November. Julia Gelatt, an expert at the Migration Policy Institute think tank, concurred: “Based on the data available, it is not possible that 10 million unauthorized immigrants have come across the border to the U.S. under President Biden. In fact, the reality is a fraction of that.”\n\nMark Morgan, who served as acting commissioner of Customs and Border Protection under Trump (and head of the Border Patrol under Obama), told The Arizona Republic in an early-November article that the “worst case scenario” for the number of illegal border crossings under Biden through October “could be 6.2 million.” Trump’s estimate was not close even to that estimate.\n\nAnd there are a bunch of important nuances here. Customs and Border Protection has recorded more than 4.3 million total nationwide border “encounters” under Biden, but that number includes people who presented themselves to the authorities to begin the process of seeking humanitarian protection. And while Trump used the word “people,” Ryo emphasized that the number of “encounters” is not the same as the number of separate individuals who have crossed the border. Because many people encountered at the border are rapidly expelled under the Title 42 policy – including more than half of those encountered in the 2021 fiscal year – lots of the same people quickly come back to the border and try again. In the 2021 fiscal year, the recidivism rate was 27%, according to official data.\n\nInflation in turkey prices\n\nTrump claimed, “Good luck getting a turkey for Thanksgiving. Number one, you won’t get it and if you do, you’re gonna pay three to four times more than you paid last year.”\n\nFacts First: This isn’t even close to true. Turkey prices have increased since last Thanksgiving season, but they haven’t come close to tripling or quadrupling. The weighted average advertised supermarket price of a whole frozen hen is 97 cents per pound as of the most recent US Department of Agriculture report – up about 10% from the same time last year. The price of a whole frozen tom was up by about 7%.\n\nAnd though Trump made these comments while criticizing the Biden administration over inflation, it’s worth noting that the turkey market in particular has been significantly impacted by avian flu.\n\nTrump and wars\n\nTrump said that his critics claimed during the 2016 presidential campaign that there would be a war within weeks if Trump was elected – “and yet I’ve gone decades, decades without a war. The first president to do it for that long a period.”\n\nFacts First: This is nonsense. Trump was president for four years, so he could not possibly have gone “decades, decades” without a war. Also, Trump presided over the US involvement in wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, though he obviously didn’t start any of these wars and withdrew some troops from all three countries. And he was commander-in-chief for dozens of US airstrikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia, Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, plus a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds Force, that prompted Iranian retaliation against US service members.\n\nTrump and ISIS\n\nTrump gave himself credit for the liberation of ISIS’s “caliphate” in Syria, saying “the vicious ISIS caliphate, which no president was able to conquer, was decimated by me and our great warriors in less than three weeks.”\n\nFacts First: This is a major exaggeration. The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019, not “less than three weeks” into his presidency in 2017; it’s not entirely clear what Trump meant by “decimated,” but the fight continued long after Trump’s first weeks in office. And Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past. There was major progress against the caliphate under Obama in 2015 and 2016 – and Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting.\n\nIHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing the size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.\n\nTerrorism under Trump\n\nTrump claimed: “We had practically, just about, not that I can think of, no Islamic attacks, terrorist attacks, during the Trump administration.”\n\nFacts First: Trump did qualify the claim by saying “practically, just about, not that I can think of,” but it’s not true that there were no terrorist attacks carried out by Islamic extremists during his presidency. Trump’s own Justice Department alleged that a terror attack in New York City in 2017, which killed eight people and injured others, was an act of Islamic extremism carried out in support of ISIS. In fact, Trump repeatedly lamented this attack during his presidency. And Trump’s Justice Department alleged that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda.\n\nThe military’s use of old bombers\n\nBoasting of how he supposedly rebuilt the military, Trump said, “When I got there, we had jet fighters that were 48 years old. We had bombers that were 60 years old, we had bombers where their grandfathers flew them when they were new. And now the grandchild is flying the bomber – but not anymore.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not true that Trump ended the use of 60-year-old bombers. The military continues to use B-52 bombers that old; they are now being outfitted with new Rolls-Royce engines to prolong their life even further. (And the B-52 isn’t the only decades-old plane still in use.)\n\nTrump’s popularity along the border\n\nAfter boasting of how he is viewed by Latinos, Trump claimed that “along the border in Texas, won every single community – I won – every single community.” He said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told him that he had “won every single area along the border, the longest since Reconstruction.”\n\nFacts First: We don’t know what Abbott told Trump, but it’s not true that Trump won every single area along the border with Mexico. Trump lost border states in both of his previous races – California and New Mexico in both 2016 and 2020, Arizona in 2020 – and also lost numerous border communities in Texas and elsewhere both times, as you can see in these New York Times maps here and here.\n\nTrump did make major gains with some Texas border counties between 2016 and 2020, becoming the first Republican in decades to win some of them, but his claim was about how he supposedly won them all. That’s inaccurate.\n\nInflation\n\nTrump claimed about inflation: “As we speak, inflation is the highest in over 50 years.”\n\nFacts First: This is not true; Trump exaggerated a statistic that would have worked in his favor even if he had recited it accurately. October’s year-over-year inflation rate of 7.7% is the highest since 1982, if you don’t count previous months this year when it was higher. So, ignoring those other Biden-era months, it is the highest in 40 years, not the highest in “over 50 years.”\n\nWe might let this go if Trump did not have a years-long pattern of exaggerating numbers to suit his purposes.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Paul Leblanc", "Daniel Dale", "Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/30/politics/trump-pence-2020-election/index.html", "title": "Trump says he wanted Pence to overturn the 2020 election and ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump in a statement Sunday said he wanted then-Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 presidential election, repeating the false claim that Pence had the power to do so and slamming recent bipartisan efforts to reform the Electoral Count Act.\n\nTrump falsely claimed that a bipartisan group of lawmakers working to reform the Electoral Count Act proves his claim that Pence had the power, according to the ECA, to overturn the 2020 election. Though the Act is vague, it is clear the role of the vice president is ceremonial and does not include the power to overturn the result of a presidential election.\n\n“Actually, what they are saying, is that Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away. Unfortunately, he didn’t exercise that power, he could have overturned the Election!” Trump wrote.\n\nTrump’s argument mirrors that of conservative lawyer John Eastman, who in a memo outlined steps, invoking the Electoral Count Act, to prevent the transfer of power in the days leading up to the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Eastman argued that Pence had the power to deem certain electoral votes invalid and that states had the power to use legislative steps outlined in the Electoral Count Act to ultimately throw out certain states’ electoral votes. Eastman argued that Pence should do so for seven key states that President Joe Biden won.\n\nAsked on CNN’s “Newsroom” Sunday to respond to Trump’s new statement, Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California said, “We’re taking a look at the Electoral Count Act because it’s an old statute and there were some of our colleagues in the House had tried to exploit ambiguities in it. But I frankly think the role of the vice president will probably remain unchanged.”\n\nLofgren, a member of the House select committee probing the January 6 attack, added: “I guess the former President is saying that the vice president gets to choose the next president, in which case Kamala Harris will be presiding at the counting of the votes, and I guess he’s saying she gets to choose who the next president is. That’s clear to me, not what the Constitution provides for. He must be kidding.”\n\nGOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, whom Trump targeted in his statement, has led a bipartisan group of senators in discussions on ways to reform the Electoral Count Act, after it was used to try to disrupt the ceremonial counting of the vote in 2021. Collins on ABC’s “This Week” said those meetings will resume Monday over Zoom. Collins was pressed earlier Sunday on whether there was a chance she would vote for Trump in 2024. She said it was “unlikely” but did not rule it out.\n\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, another member of the committee investigating January 6, responded on Twitter to Trump’s statement that Pence could have overturned the election. The Illinois Republican wrote, “This is an admission, and a massively un-American statement. It is time for every Republican leader to pick a side… Trump or the Constitution, there is no middle on defending our nation anymore.”", "authors": ["Sarah Fortinsky"], "publish_date": "2022/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/10/politics/fact-check-trump-documents-george-hw-bush-bowling-chinese-clinton/index.html", "title": "Fact check: National Archives debunks Trump's false claim about ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nFirst, former President Donald Trump tried a false claim about the document-handling practices of former President Barack Obama. Now, Trump is making the same false claim about other former presidents.\n\nIn August, after the FBI recovered classified documents and numerous other presidential records from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence and resort in Florida, Trump declared that Obama had taken millions of presidential documents to Chicago. The National Archives and Records Administration quickly debunked his assertion, explaining it was NARA itself, not Obama, that took the documents to a NARA-managed facility in the Chicago area.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Trump tried using Obama as a defense after FBI search. Hear why it doesn't work 03:13 - Source: CNN\n\nThen, at rallies in Nevada and Arizona this weekend, Trump not only repeated the false claim about Obama but added near-identical dishonesty about previous presidents George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.\n\nMost dramatically, Trump said, “George H.W. Bush took millions of documents to a former bowling alley and a former Chinese restaurant; where they combined them. So they’re in a bowling alley slash Chinese restaurant.” Trump added, “A Chinese restaurant and a bowling alley. With no security and a broken front door.”\n\nTrump also claimed that “Bill Clinton took millions of documents from the White House to a former car dealership in Arkansas” and that “George W. Bush stored 68 million pages in a warehouse in Texas.”\n\nFacts First: All of these Trump claims are false. George H.W. Bush did not take millions of documents to a former bowling alley and Chinese restaurant. Rather, the National Archives and Records Administration took Bush’s presidential documents to this facility prior to the opening of the Bush presidential library in the same city. Trump’s claims about Clinton and George W. Bush are inaccurate in precisely the same way: NARA, not the former presidents themselves, put the documents in temporary storage at NARA-managed facilities at the former car dealership in Arkansas and the warehouse in Texas. And Trump was also wrong that there was “no security” at the facility where the elder Bush’s documents were housed: the facility was heavily secured, according to a news report at the time.\n\nSo there is no equivalence between Trump’s handling of presidential documents and those of his predecessors. In the others’ cases, the presidential documents were in NARA’s possession and stored securely and professionally. In Trump’s case, the presidential documents found in haphazard amateur storage at Mar-a-Lago were in Trump’s own possession, despite numerous attempts by both NARA and the Justice Department to get them back.\n\nNARA sent CNN a statement on Tuesday, after the initial publication of this article, confirming that Trump’s claims are false.\n\nThe statement said that NARA had possession of Bush, Bush, Clinton, Obama and Ronald Reagan presidential records after those presidents left office and that NARA moved the records to temporary facilities NARA leased near the locations of their future presidential libraries. The statement continued: “All such temporary facilities met strict archival and security standards, and have been managed and staffed exclusively by NARA employees. Reports that indicate or imply that those Presidential records were in the possession of the former Presidents or their representatives, after they left office, or that the records were housed in substandard conditions, are false and misleading.”\n\nTrump’s claims about George H.W. Bush\n\nTrump urged the authorities to “look into what took place” with George H.W. Bush and presidential documents. But there is nothing of substance to investigate: the National Archives and Records Administration has been forthright since the 1990s about where it temporarily stored Bush documents before his permanent library opened. In fact, the NARA official who was in charge of the transition of the Bush documents to the permanent library publicly joked about the temporary facility at the time.\n\n“I’ve told reporters this for the last four years: It’s not just a bowling alley; it’s a bowling alley and a Chinese restaurant,” David Alsobrook said.\n\nWhile the temporary College Station, Texas, location made for a fun story, there was nothing unusual about NARA’s use of such a building. NARA needs lots of space to house presidential documents before presidents’ permanent libraries are built, so it finds and modifies large nearby facilities that often have formerly housed other activities.\n\nSomeone listening to Trump’s rally comments might have pictured documents from the first Bush administration being scattered carelessly in bowling lanes. But that’s not what happened. The Washington Post reported in 1993: “There aren’t any lanes anymore. No gutters, no pins, no beer. Thanks to a rush remodeling job after last November’s election, there are a few simple offices, a massive, fire-resistant vault and row after row of steel shelves filled with cardboard boxes and wooden crates.”\n\nAs NARA’s Tuesday statement said, there was also extensive security. The Associated Press reported in 1994: “Uniformed guards patrol the premises. There are closed-circuit television monitors and sophisticated electronic detectors along walls and doors. Some printed material is classified and will remain so for years; it is open only to those with top-secret clearances.”\n\nRobert Holzweiss, who began working on the George H.W. Bush library in 1996 and is now deputy director, told People magazine for an article in early 2022: “When I got involved the temporary facility for the Bush museum was in College Station, Texas, in an old bowling alley. Without the alleys it was perfect, it was like a warehouse. They just built a secure space within to house the classified material.”\n\nBush died in 2018. His son Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who ran against Trump in 2016 for the Republican presidential nomination, wrote on Twitter in response to Trump’s claims about the late president: “I am so confused. My dad enjoyed a good Chinese meal and enjoyed the challenge of 7 10 split. What the heck is up with you?”\n\nTrump’s false claims about Bill Clinton and George W. Bush\n\nTrump’s rally claims about former presidents Clinton and George W. Bush are false for the exact same reason as Trump’s claims about Obama and the elder Bush are false.\n\nThat former Balch Motor Company building in Little Rock, Arkansas, where millions of Clinton presidential documents were stored? Again, it was the National Archives and Records Administration that took the documents to this facility, which NARA managed, in advance of the opening of Clinton’s library in the same city.\n\nThat warehouse in Lewisville, Texas where millions of the younger Bush’s presidential documents were stored? It was a NARA-managed facility, used to store documents while Bush’s permanent library was being readied in nearby Dallas.\n\nUpdate: This article has been updated to add NARA’s Tuesday statement.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/10/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/05/us/power-outage-moore-county-investigation-monday/index.html", "title": "Moore County: Tens of thousands still in the dark after 'targeted ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWith no suspects or motive announced, the FBI is joining the investigation into power outages in a North Carolina county believed to have been caused by “intentional” and “targeted” attacks on substations that left around 40,000 customers in the dark Saturday night, prompting a curfew and emergency declaration.\n\nThe mass outage in Moore County turned into a criminal investigation when responding utility crews found signs of potential vandalism of equipment at different sites – including two substations that had been damaged by gunfire, according to the Moore County Sheriff’s Office.\n\n“The person, or persons, who did this knew exactly what they were doing,” Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields said during a Sunday news conference. “We don’t have a clue why Moore County.”\n\nFields said bullets were fired at the two substations. “It was targeted, it wasn’t random,” he said.\n\nThe sheriff would not say whether the criminal activity was domestic terrorism but noted “no group has stepped up to acknowledge or accept they’re the ones who (did) it.”\n\nNorth Carolina Gov.

Despite Trump’s ban, “Team Trump,” a page run by Trump’s political group, is still active and has 2.3 million followers.\n\nTuesday’s memo from Meta underscores the challenges social media platforms face in deciding how to handle another Trump presidential campaign. The former president announced Tuesday night that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms.\n\nFacebook’s parent company Meta pays third-party fact-checking organizations to apply fact-check labels to misinformation across Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe carve-out is not exclusive to Trump and applies to all politicians, but given the rate fact-checkers find themselves dealing with claims made by the former president, a manager on Meta’s “news integrity partnership” team emailed fact-checkers on Tuesday ahead of Trump’s announcement.\n\n“Some of you have reached out seeking guidance regarding fact-checking political speech in anticipation of a potential candidacy announcement from former President Trump,” the Meta staffer wrote in the memo.\n\nThe company has long had an exception to its fact-checking policy for politicians.\n\n“It is not our role to intervene when politicians speak,” Meta executive Nick Clegg, a former politician, said in 2019, defending the exemption.\n\nThe Meta memo sent to fact-checkers made clear that if Trump announced a 2024 presidential bid Tuesday night, he could no longer be fact-checked on the platform.\n\nThe memo noted that “political speech is ineligible for fact-checking. This includes the words a politician says as well as photo, video, or other content that is clearly labeled as created by the politician or their campaign.”\n\nMeta’s policy doesn’t stipulate that a candidate formally register with the Federal Election Commission. “We define a ‘politician’ as candidates running for office, current office holders – and, by extension, many of their cabinet appointees – along with political parties and their leaders,” the memo stated.\n\nIt concluded that “if former President Trump makes a clear, public announcement that he is running for office, he would be considered a politician under our program policies.”\n\nAndy Stone, a Meta spokesperson, said the memo was “a reiteration of our long-standing policy should not be news to anyone.”\n\nMeta’s fact-checking program has been criticized by Republicans and Democrats – with many Republicans saying Meta goes too far, while many Democrats say the company doesn’t go far enough.\n\nTrump has not been allowed to post on his Facebook and Instagram accounts since the days following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. However, Meta plans on considering allowing Trump back on the platform as soon as January – two years since his initial ban.\n\nThis headline and story have been updated to reflect Trump’s announced 2024 presidential bid.", "authors": ["Donie O'Sullivan"], "publish_date": "2022/11/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/politics/ashley-biden-white-house/index.html", "title": "Ashley Biden finds her voice: 'I know my worth' | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFirst daughter Ashley Biden has been a regular presence in President Joe Biden’s White House – she quit her job before the 2020 campaign partly to be near the man she calls her “best friend” – but until this fall, she stayed carefully behind the scenes.\n\nNow the normally private social worker, 41, is suddenly doing public appearances and making very personal statements, talking about everything from police reform and mental health to life as “a White woman with White privilege.” She’s also talking about the travails of her brother Hunter, an admitted longtime drug addict now in recovery.\n\nIt’s not clear whether the new openness is part of a grander White House strategy, or if it signals a new attitude within the Biden family about their patriarch’s political plans. Ashley Biden’s public debut is unfolding without the usual tight choreography of a White House production, and she has appeared in public without political staffers in attendance or reaching out eagerly to reporters with the customary spin. The White House declined to comment for this story, as did Ashley Biden.\n\nBut Biden is making it clear she’s ready to tell her own story, no small matter for a person whose personal diary was once stolen and peddled for sale to her father’s political detractors.\n\n“I finally feel like I’m in a place where I really know who I am, I know my worth, I know my family – who are honestly some of the most incredible, kind, compassionate humans, who have given up their life, really, for service to the American people,” said Biden, speaking on the record last week to a small group of invited guests at a question-and-answer event at a hip DC hotel.\n\nThe public confessions come at a moment important for Ashley Biden, whose father and mother, Dr. Jill Biden, continue to weigh a reelection run in a country that remains roiled by political division. The gloves-off campaign style of the last several years has not gone unnoticed by Ashley Biden.\n\n“I grew up with Dad kind of always – I always saw him work with the other side of the aisle,” said Biden last week. “Now, since (former President Donald) Trump, I’m sorry, but this is just a whole disgusting ballgame. It is like nothing I’ve ever seen because he gave air to hate. And it’s always been there, right? But it was not as visible as it is today.”\n\nAshley Biden’s most recent remarks are the most forthcoming, lengthy and personal since her father took office, but her public momentum has been building. Last month, she stepped out at a splashy magazine party in Washington, headlined by supermodel Christy Turlington; several days later, Biden was in San Francisco, hosting a roundtable on mental health and traumatic recovery centers, and participating in an interview with the Bay Area NPR station.\n\nOn October 24, Biden joined her parents at the White House for a reception to celebrate the Indian holiday Diwali, standing beside the first lady as she made remarks. Jill Biden wore a green, printed dress; Ashley Biden wore a three-piece, peach-colored sari.\n\nOctober 24, 2022, Washington, District of Columbia, USA: First lady Dr. Jill Biden introduces her daughter Ashley Biden at a reception to celebrate Diwali in the East Room in the White House in Washington, DC, October 24, 2022 Chris Kleponis/CNP/Zuma Press\n\nShe had previously popped up from time to time – that was her this summer on the beach in Rehoboth, Delaware, pulling her father away from the press during a walk with a sharp, “Nope, like, no more – no more questions.” Biden joked, “That’s my press secretary daughter.”\n\nBut she is not a ubiquitous West Wing presence like her presidential first daughter predecessor, nor is she consistent tabloid fodder, like her older brother, Hunter Biden.\n\n“When I was growing up, kids were off limits, right?” said Biden at last week’s event, discussing an earlier time when campaigns practiced more civility. “You weren’t allowed. It was kind of a mutual understanding that you just didn’t really go after people’s children. You know? … I-I- don’t – that’s not what I signed up for.”\n\nA ‘strategic’ public emergence\n\nFour people familiar with Ashley Biden and her family told CNN it’s not clear to them why she is choosing now to make a more public emergence with politically charged statements.\n\n“She has had periods of being more vocal,” says one person who worked with the Bidens for several years. “But she has also had times of being almost reclusive, and not participating.”\n\nAnother person added that while Ashley Biden’s parents are supportive of her and her convictions, there is always a “bit of stress” when either of their children are in the public eye.\n\nAsked whether the recent comments from Biden are being sanctioned, or even monitored, by the White House – as is the tendency for most administrations when presidential family members make public speaking engagements – another person was doubtful. “She has always been her own person,” said the source.\n\n“I’m authentic, I’m kind, I’m honest. I care, I’m compassionate. And I’m really strategic,” Biden said last week, exaggerating the Ls in “really.”\n\nA third person who has known Ashley Biden and the Biden family for more than a decade said it is typically not like the Biden family to “restrict” or “censor” their children. However, a presidential daughter discussing, for example, the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into her brother’s contacts and financial dealings is not exactly the kind of going rogue an administration would feel comfortable with, said a political strategist who has worked with White House Democrats.\n\nFederal prosecutors are weighing possible charges for Hunter Biden related to tax violations, as well as for making a false statement related to a gun purchase, CNN has previously reported.\n\n“They’re not going to find anything,” she said at the Q&A last week, talking about Hunter Biden, and the investigation. “They’re just trying to do whatever they can, but that’s,” she said, pausing to shrug, “so when that started to happen, when people started to attack me, and I was like, ‘Whoa.’ It just became a widespread thing.”\n\nAshley Biden said the brouhaha over the Hunter Biden allegations of wrongdoing and influence peddling has become little more than a family inside joke. “I still look at my brother and I’m like, ‘do you know you impeached Donald Trump, basically?’”\n\nFrom a ‘humble’ home to embracing the spotlight\n\nAshley Biden was raised, she says, in a “humble” home.\n\n“Growing up, I lived a very normal, down-to-earth life,” she said last week. She was an athlete, excelling at both field hockey and lacrosse during her Wilmington, Delaware, school years.\n\nShe took an interest in her father’s grassroots-style of politicking, often accompanying him at campaign events, parades and on the door-to-door visits that were once a hallmark of gathering votes.\n\n“I would travel with him everywhere and I would always question the inequity. I also went to a Quaker school and learned about racism from a very young age,” said Biden during an October 20 interview with KQED in San Francisco. “And it was my mission to tackle structural violence and institutional racism. Why aren’t people healing? Why are the most marginalized the most harmed, yet the least healed?”\n\nBiden became a social worker, working hands-on with cases, mostly in underserved areas of Delaware and parts of Philadelphia. She got her master’s degree in social work from the University of Pennsylvania – a Biden-family favorite for higher education. She eventually became executive director for the Delaware Center for Justice, where she worked until 2019.\n\nIn 2016, Biden launched a hooded sweatshirt line dubbed “Livelihood,” and marketed as a socially conscious fashion label. The hoodies retailed for $80-$100, and according to Biden, profits went to various charities in support of social justice and minority entrepreneurship.\n\nAs Joe Biden campaigned for the presidency, Ashley would appear from time to time on the campaign trail, stumping beside him, the only daughter of Jill and Joe Biden. When her parents moved into the White House, Ashley Biden sometimes did, too, said two people familiar with the Bidens’ living situation, most recently last winter and early spring.\n\nShe had been scheduled to travel on two foreign trips with the first lady – in May, to Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine, and Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica – but pulled out of the trips last-minute. The East Wing cited Covid-19-related issues for both of the cancellations.\n\n‘We are not letting them win’\n\nBiden admits she has shied from the spotlight, which she says got uglier and uglier during the last presidential campaign, when opponents made a frequent target of her and her brother.\n\n“I have to be honest with you, I started to really have a lot of resentment,” said Biden last week in Washington. “It’s cruel, like, honestly, it’s dehumanizing. And so, I have a lot of anger around that.”\n\nShe paused and added, “I’m also like, screw this, we are not letting them win.”\n\nThe flare of anger is personal for Ashley Biden. She had her own brush with the exposure of her personal life, motivated by political opponents of her father. In August, two people pleaded guilty to stealing her belongings, including her journal, and selling them to a conservative media outlet.\n\nBiden said this month she is now a consultant for the National Alliance of Trauma Recovery Centers, which teaches and assists with building centers around the country with the specific aim of helping victims of traumatic events. Biden recently said she is also “teaching a trauma class for 25 women who are coming out of incarceration.”\n\nWith midterm elections less than a week away, a second run for the White House by her father remains undetermined; the president’s age, approval ratings and performance being hammered regularly by critics.\n\nEven still, Ashley Biden appears willing to test some of her own boundaries of vulnerability. She speaks with a sense of urgency around socio-economic and health care issues – as the daughter of a lifelong politician, she knows first-hand the partisan stakes when funding, congressional support, health care and power all come into play.\n\n“Dad is dedicated,” she said during her public radio interview from San Francisco. “We’re going to have some real issues if we don’t win the House and Senate. I mean, it’s over, right? It’s over in the sense of what’s to come. Our rights. Mental health care. All of it.”\n\nOn the dais last week in Washington, answering the handful of questions with responses that went on for several minutes, Biden sounded almost like a certain politician.\n\n“I believe we can come to the same results, we can work together, but I think it’s the how we kind of go about it. I’m not saying to not scream from the mountaintops of injustice, but I also think if we really want, I mean, you have to work with the other side,” she said.\n\nBiden said she was sorry to the interviewer, and the audience, for her lengthy answers.\n\n“So, really long-winded. I apologize,” she added. “This is why they don’t let me do interviews.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/09/politics/david-perdue-senate-republican-reaction/index.html", "title": "Senate Republicans aghast at Perdue's false election claims in ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt’s a refrain that former Sen. David Perdue has made a centerpiece of his campaign for governor in Georgia.\n\n“The election in 2020 was rigged and stolen,” Perdue asserted at a recent debate.\n\nPerdue’s former Senate GOP colleagues, however, are less than impressed.\n\n“It’s absurd,” said Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, when asked about the remarks of Perdue, his former colleague. “I think the effort to try and overturn an election when there is, at this stage, no evidence of widespread fraud is detrimental to democracy and insulting to the American public.”\n\n“Hell yes,” one of Perdue’s closest Senate friends told CNN when asked if he was surprised by his ex-colleague’s campaign transformation.\n\n“I don’t know whether he believes it or not. I really don’t,” said Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican. “But I’m sure it’s a political strategy.”\n\nIndeed, in his six years in the Senate before losing his reelection bid last year, Perdue was a mainstream Senate Republican member, a business-minded conservative who usually voted with his party.\n\nBut Perdue announced his bid in December challenging Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, blaming Kemp for his and then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler’s losses, which cost Republicans the Senate, by arguing that the governor did not do enough to overturn the results.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, who has relentlessly attacked Kemp for his loss in Georgia, endorsed Perdue, falsely asserting that Kemp “allowed massive election fraud to take place.”\n\nMany of Perdue’s colleagues believe there’s one reason why he has changed his tune.\n\n“My assumption is that when he was persuaded to run, that was part of the conversation,” South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said when asked about Perdue’s claims. “But it doesn’t sound like it’s working very well – at least right now.”\n\nPerdue’s candidacy underscores the dilemma facing Republicans as they try to position themselves for the fall elections. Many candidates like Perdue are eager for the Trump endorsement, willing to repeat his false claims about 2020 in order to get the backing of his fervent supporters. Yet others say harping on the past is a recipe to trip up their chances at a time when the political environment is rich for the GOP.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Abortion and inflation set to be key issues in midterms 04:34 - Source: CNN\n\n“I think it’s better to ask: ‘Do you think voters want to look to the future or look to the past?” Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said in an interview. “And the answer to that is self-evident. They want solutions now.”\n\n“I do know him well,” said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito when asked about Perdue’s claims. “I obviously don’t agree with that.”\n\nOn Thursday, Loeffler was on Capitol Hill, lunching with Senate Republicans and discussing her efforts to engage voters in Georgia. Behind closed doors, Loeffler talked to senators about the Perdue and Kemp race, and told them that it appeared Kemp was on track to easily win outright and avoid a runoff, according to senators who spoke to her.\n\nIn a brief interview, Loeffler dodged a question about whether she agreed with Perdue’s political strategy calling the 2020 election “rigged and stolen,” telling CNN: “I’m totally focused on the voters. We got to make sure voters turn out the vote. So, that’s my number one priority.”\n\nAsked for comment about the Republican senators’ mix of surprise about and criticism of their former colleague’s decision to place the 2020 election at the center of his 2022 campaign, Jenni Sweat, Perdue’s campaign spokeswoman, said, “Nothing to share at this time.”\n\nImmediately after jumping into the race, Perdue filed a lawsuit to shine a spotlight on Trump’s false claims, even though there were three separate counts of the results in Georgia and no evidence that fraud cost Trump or Perdue their elections.\n\nPerdue’s first and latest television ads promote the lie that the elections were stolen. Trump has held rallies for Perdue in Georgia, hosted a fundraiser for him at his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago and aired ads bashing Kemp, saying he can’t beat Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams. Trump called into a “tele-rally” with Perdue last week, as early voting began for the May 24 primary.\n\nKemp’s campaign has spent over $5.3 million on ads, compared to about $1.3 million for Perdue. But other Trump-aligned groups like Take Back Georgia and MAGA, Again! are trying to fill the gap.\n\nPerdue has been hoping that Trump will help propel him to victory. But if he falls short, it would be a major blow to the former President in his campaign to boot out Republicans who don’t align themselves with his 2020 election lies — and his status as a kingmaker. After the primaries last Tuesday, Trump boasted that his candidates went 22-0. But even Trump has appeared to recognize that Perdue could threaten that streak.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Donald Trump 'still the kingmaker' in the Republican Party, says political analyst 14:06 - Source: CNN\n\n“Remember, you know, my record is unblemished,” Trump said in a recent interview with The New York Times. “The real story should be on the endorsements — not the David Perdue one — and, by the way, no race is over.”\n\nIn interviews with more than a dozen Senate Republicans about the Georgia race, most said that their party needs to stop talking about 2020 if they want to win back Congress in 2022 and rack up wins at the state level as well.\n\n“Well, I like David but you know if Kemp wins, it means that people looked at beyond 2020,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally. “That’s the only conclusion you can come to.”\n\nSen. Joni Ernst, a Republican of Iowa, called Perdue a “smart man” and said “people respect him.”\n\nBut when asked if Republicans should be talking about 2020 in this election year, Ernst pushed back, saying it “just makes us look like we’re a party that looks to the past rather than the future.”\n\nMany of her colleagues see it the same way.\n\n“(Perdue) and I would probably agree to disagree on that particular issue, and it’s not the first time that I’ve had to agree to disagree with my friends and colleagues,” said Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican. “We found no evidence that says that the election would have been overturned by what we would have found in terms of problems within the election cycle itself.”\n\nOthers made clear that Republicans should not keep harping on 2020.\n\n“I think we have to look ahead,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican. “You know, the most important election is the next election, in my opinion. I’m only focused on November.”\n\n“The only election I’m worried about is the 2022 election,” said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley when asked about Perdue’s comments. “And then I worry about the 2024 election after that, and I’m looking to the future.”\n\nFlorida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who like Grassley is up for reelection in 2022, said he hasn’t “paid a lot of attention” to Georgia’s governor race, saying “we got our hands full here” in the Senate. Pressed if he would be talking about 2020 on the campaign trail, Rubio said, “I’ll be talking about the stuff I’ve worked on.”\n\nAnd Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of GOP leadership, said he wasn’t going to get involved in the governor’s race when asked about Perdue’s comments.\n\nBut he added: “I will tell you, I don’t think the governor – I think Joe Biden won the electoral college and was correctly confirmed as President.”\n\nAnd when asked if he’s concerned about members of his party still espousing 2020 election lies, Romney deadpanned: “I stopped being concerned about members of my party.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It's head-spinning': Ex-GOP lawmaker reacts to ex-senator's gubernatorial bid 01:51 - Source: CNN\n\nThe reaction by many of Perdue’s former colleagues in the Senate appears to be reflected by the Georgia Republican electorate, according to public polling, which shows Kemp with a double-digit lead over Perdue. Even some of Perdue’s former allies in Georgia have wondered why he decided to run against Kemp.\n\nEric Tanenblatt is supporting Kemp even though he helped raise money for Perdue’s last Senate campaign and served as chief of staff to former Georgia Republican Gov. Sonny Perdue, the former senator’s cousin. He said there is a “very good likelihood” that Kemp will win the primary on May 24 with a majority of the votes, enough to avoid a runoff.\n\n“I think the majority of Republican primary voters think we need to get beyond the 2020 election,” Tanenblatt said.\n\n“I just remain baffled as to why David is doing this,” he added. “He was a senator with a great record, represented the state well, and unfortunately, the thing we’re going to remember about him is now not what he did in the Senate, but that he took on an incumbent Republican governor.”", "authors": ["Manu Raju Alex Rogers", "Manu Raju", "Alex Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/05/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/us/power-outage-moore-county-criminal-investigation/index.html", "title": "NC county announces curfew as nearly 40,000 customers remain ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAuthorities have announced a mandatory curfew in a North Carolina county where around 40,000 customers lost power after two power substations were damaged by gunfire Saturday night.\n\nThe county will implement a mandatory curfew from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m., starting Sunday night, Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields said at a news conference Sunday.\n\nMunicipality and county officials “have formed a plan for the night and the next few nights that we may be out of power.

And for a whole year now, the insurrection itself has been lied about.\n\nDonald Trump supporters’ violent attack on the Capitol has been the subject of a dishonesty campaign that began amid the fog of January 6 and escalated even as the facts became clearer. Trump, some right-wing media figures and some Republican members of Congress have mounted a sustained effort to rewrite the history of that deadly day.\n\nThey have falsely claimed all of the rioters were unarmed. They have falsely claimed the people at the Capitol merely held a “protest” against an election they falsely claimed was fraudulent. They have falsely claimed the rioters were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.\n\nThey have falsely claimed the riot was orchestrated by left-wing groups or the FBI. And they have falsely claimed nonviolent rioters are being jailed as “political prisoners.”\n\nHere is a fact check of five of the most enduring lies about January 6.\n\nLie: The rioters were completely unarmed\n\nTrump and some of his allies continue to claim that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed.\n\nIn a December 21 statement, Trump called January 6 a “completely unarmed protest.” Similarly, in a tweet on December 17, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia wrote, “One of the biggest holes in the lie about J6 being a planned insurrection is that all the people there were unarmed. Anyone with half a brain knows that gun owners only leave their firearms at home when they don’t feel the need to carry a gun or are obeying the law.”\n\nFacts First: It’s not even close to true that all of the people at the Capitol on January 6 were unarmed – and the claim is still false even if it is specifically about guns. People who illegally entered Capitol grounds during the insurrection were armed with a wide variety of weapons, including guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes and chemical sprays. The Department of Justice said in an official update last week that so far “over 75” people charged in connection to the attack “have been charged with entering a restricted area with a dangerous or deadly weapon.”\n\nWe may never get a complete inventory of the concealed weapons the rioters possessed on January 6, since nearly all of the rioters were able to leave the Capitol without being detained and searched. But prosecutors have alleged that some of the people present at the Capitol were armed with guns, as were some other Trump supporters who traveled to Washington for January 6.\n\nMark Mazza of Indiana has been charged with crimes including possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. According to the Capitol Police, Mazza accidentally dropped his loaded revolver during a struggle with police on a Capitol terrace. He allegedly told investigators later that if he had visited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that day, “you’d be here for another reason.”\n\nGuy Reffitt of Texas has been charged with crimes including illegally carrying a semi-automatic handgun on Capitol grounds; he has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors allege Reffitt “specifically targeted at least two lawmakers – the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and then-Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell – whom he sought to physically remove or displace from the Capitol building.” And police allege Christopher Alberts of Maryland was arrested trying to flee Capitol grounds on January 6 with a loaded pistol; he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMark Ibrahim, who was an off-duty special agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration at the time of the riot, has been charged with crimes including carrying a firearm on Capitol grounds. Ibrahim, who has said he was later fired by the DEA (the DEA would confirm to CNN only that he no longer works there), was photographed that day displaying what appeared to be a handgun. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nIn addition, Lonnie Coffman of Alabama, who pleaded guilty to weapons charges in November, admitted that he had carried two loaded pistols in Washington on January 6 and that a truck he had parked blocks from the Capitol contained additional loaded guns, Molotov cocktails and other weapons. Cleveland Meredith Jr., who pleaded guilty to threatening to kill Pelosi and was sentenced to 28 months in prison, drove from Colorado to Washington with a rifle and handgun that were found in his trailer outside a Washington hotel. The FBI said Meredith had told agents he had tried to get to Washington on January 5 but ended up arriving late on January 6.\n\nLie: The rioters were merely protesting a ‘rigged’ election\n\nTrump called on his supporters to come to Washington on January 6 for a “wild” protest against President Joe Biden’s victory, which Trump falsely claimed was fraudulent. During his rally speech on the morning of January 6, Trump pushed that election lie, directed supporters to march to the Capitol and urged them to “fight like hell.”\n\nAfter the insurrection, Trump continued to repeat the election lie for months – and adapted it to minimize what had happened at the Capitol. In an October statement, he claimed that the “real insurrection” was the 2020 election and January 6 was simply a “day of protesting.” (He also made similar claims later in the year.)\n\nFacts First: Both parts of Trump’s claim are obvious lies. The election wasn’t rigged and wasn’t fraudulent; Biden won fair and square; there was a tiny smattering of voter fraud that was nowhere near widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state, let alone to have reversed Biden’s 306-232 victory in the Electoral College. And the insurrection of January 6 – in which approximately 140 police officers were assaulted and the peaceful transfer of power was violently interrupted – involved thousands of alleged crimes; it was, very clearly, no mere protest.\n\n“This was not a peaceful protest. Hundreds of people came to Washington, DC, to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power,” Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court said last January. Howell added in October: “The rioters attacking the US Capitol on January 6th, as part of a large mob, were not mere trespassers engaging in protected First Amendment protests; they were certainly not tourists. And I say that again and again because there still seems, in some areas, to be a debate about that issue.”\n\nLie: The rioters were invited into the Capitol by police\n\nA common refrain from January 6 rioters, and some of their Republican defenders, is that they were welcomed into the Capitol by police officers.\n\nTrump said in a book interview in March that “the Capitol Police were ushering people in” and “the Capitol Police were very friendly. You know, they were hugging and kissing.” The claim has been echoed by Trump supporters. For example, Trump-endorsed Republican Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake declared at a Trump rally in October that the people being held in jail over the Capitol attack “were invited in by Capitol Police.”\n\nFacts First: The claim that the rioters were invited into the Capitol is false. Again, about 140 police officers were assaulted while trying to stop the mob from breaching the Capitol. There were hours-long battles between police and rioters near some entrances. CNN obtained footage from police body-worn cameras showing how dozens of officers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with rioters in a desperate effort to keep them out of the building.\n\nRioters inside the Capitol after breaching barricades on Jan. 6, 2021. Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThere are plenty of instances where rioters waltzed into the Capitol without a fight, but only after they had stormed past barricades and, in some cases, even stepped through broken windows. In some areas, police were so outnumbered by the mob that they retreated, stood aside or tried to politely engage with rioters to de-escalate the situation rather than fighting or making arrests, but that is clearly not the same as welcoming rioters into the building.\n\nSince we don’t have video of every single encounter between police and rioters, it’s theoretically possible that some tiny number of officers did invite rioters in. The Capitol Police announced in September that three officers were facing discipline for unspecified noncriminal “conduct unbecoming” that day, while three others were facing discipline for other policy violations.\n\nBut no evidence has publicly emerged to date of even one officer inviting a rioter into the Capitol. And even if a few isolated incidents emerge in the future, it’s clear that this was not a widespread or systemic occurrence as Trump and others suggested.\n\nCapitol Police Chief Tom Manger said on CNN in September: “The officers that we have investigated and disciplined, the cases that we investigated, they run from minor infractions to officers making very poor judgments for more serious misconduct. But this notion that the Capitol Police were somehow allowing these folks into the Capitol, inviting them in, helping them, just simply not true.”\n\nLie: The jailed rioters are nonviolent political prisoners\n\nOne of the most prevalent counternarratives about January 6 is that a large number of nonviolent people who were present at the Capitol are being unfairly prosecuted by liberal zealots at the Justice Department, and that these nonviolent people have now become “political prisoners” while awaiting trial in jail. Such claims have emerged as a rallying cry among a small but vocal cohort of Trump loyalists in the House Republican conference.\n\nArizona Rep. Paul Gosar claimed in July that jailed rioters who had supposedly spent time in solitary confinement “are not unruly or dangerous, violent criminals” but are “political prisoners who are now being persecuted”; he suggested that there are “nearly 200” nonviolent Capitol participants behind bars. And the pro-Trump group behind September’s “Justice for J6” rally said its event was meant “to bring awareness and attention to the unjust and unethical treatment of nonviolent January 6 political prisoners.”\n\nFacts First: This “political prisoners” narrative is false. The vast majority of the 700-plus people charged in the Capitol riot to date were released shortly after their arrests. Only a few dozen were ordered by judges to remain in jail before trial, and most of those defendants were charged with attacking police or conspiring with far-right militia groups.\n\nIt’s true that the conditions are poor at the Washington jail where incarcerated rioters are being held. And it’s obviously unpleasant for anyone to live behind bars. But the small subset of January 6 defendants who are currently in jail are there only because a federal judge ruled that they are either too dangerous to release or pose a flight risk. The decision to keep them incarcerated was not made by Biden’s political appointees or any other Justice Department officials.\n\nA few rioters have claimed in court that they are the victims of politically motivated prosecution because they support Trump. Federal judges, including those appointed by Trump, have rejected these arguments.\n\nLie: January 6 was a false flag attack\n\nBefore the Capitol was even cleared of rioters on January 6, some prominent Trump supporters started to try to deflect blame – claiming that left-wing Antifa, a loose collection of self-described anti-fascists, was actually behind the violence.\n\nSuch “false flag” theories – that the violence was secretly orchestrated by Trump’s opponents in an attempt to make Trump look bad – never went away. And the theories have expanded to include claims that the violence was orchestrated by the Black Lives Matter movement or even by an arm of the federal government itself, the FBI.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson has promoted false flag theories, focusing on the FBI, both in his own remarks and in his revisionist documentary series on a Fox streaming service in November. Carlson has claimed on his show that government documents showed that “FBI operatives were organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6.” Former Army Capt. Emily Rainey said in the documentary (and in a trailer Carlson tweeted out): “It is my opinion that false flags have happened in this country, one of which may have been January 6.”\n\nAnd Trump himself has given oxygen to the theories, claiming in a December interview with ring-wing commentator Candace Owens, “You have BLM and you had Antifa people, I have very little doubt about that, and they were antagonizing and they were agitating.”\n\nFacts First: The insurrection at the Capitol was not a false flag. Just as it looked on January 6, a mob of diehard Trump supporters stormed the building. They did so after Trump urged supporters to come to Washington and then, as we noted above, made a speech urging them to “fight like hell” and to march to the Capitol. The rioters’ allegiance to Trump has been exhaustively documented in court proceedings and in their social media posts and media interviews.\n\nThough there are thousands of pages of court documents stemming from criminal cases against January 6 rioters, no Capitol riot defendant as of the end of 2021 had any confirmed involvement in Antifa or Black Lives Matter groups. (One defendant who filmed the riot had expressed support for Black Lives Matter but was disavowed in 2020 by BLM activists, some of whom suspected he was a provocateur connected to the political right.) By contrast, hundreds of Capitol riot defendants were confirmed to be Trump supporters – and some were members of far-right extremist groups. Members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys have been charged with conspiracy regarding January 6; some have pleaded guilty.\n\nCarlson wrongly described the court documents he inaccurately claimed were a smoking gun about FBI operatives organizing the attack; you can read more about that claim here. While it is entirely possible that some of the Capitol rioters were secretly serving as informants for the FBI – The New York Times reported in October that a member of the Proud Boys who had entered the Capitol on January 6 was an FBI informant – the presence of a few FBI informants among the estimated 2,000-plus people who illegally breached the Capitol would not make the entire mob assault an FBI-orchestrated “false flag” operation.\n\nRepublican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, vice chair of the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said on Fox News in November that there is no truth to claims that January 6 was a false flag perpetrated by “deep state” liberals trying to set up Trump supporters.\n\n“It’s the same kind of thing that you hear from people who say that 9/11 was an inside job, for example. It’s un-American to be spreading those kinds of lies, and they are lies,” Cheney said.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale Marshall Cohen", "Daniel Dale", "Marshall Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/10/politics/trump-deposition-ny-attorney-general/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump invokes Fifth Amendment rights but swipes at New ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and declined to answer questions from the New York attorney general at a scheduled deposition Wednesday.\n\n“Under the advice of my counsel and for all of the above reasons, I declined to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution,” Trump said in a statement that was released to the public.\n\nTrump was to be deposed by lawyers from New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office as part of a more than three-year civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization misled lenders, insurers and tax authorities by providing them misleading financial statements.\n\nIn a separate two-page statement Trump read during the deposition that was obtained by CNN on Thursday, he criticized James, who was in the room, calling her a “renegade prosecutor” running a “vindictive and self-serving fishing expedition.”\n\nA source familiar with the matter said Trump was angry at the start of the deposition and the mood was tense. But once the questioning began, with the state attorneys saying he could repeat the “same answer,” the atmosphere turned professional and cordial.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social earlier Wednesday morning that he would be “seeing” James “for a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history! My great company, and myself, are being attacked from all sides. Banana Republic!”\n\nThe scheduled deposition comes during an extraordinary legal week for the former President. On Monday, the FBI executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago, his primary residence in Florida, in connection with an investigation into the handling of classified documents. On Tuesday, a federal appeals court denied his long-running effort to block a House committee from obtaining his tax returns.\n\nSome Trump advisers had advocated that the former President answer questions since he previously testified about his financial statements under oath, while others warned him against providing any answers because of the potential legal jeopardy he may face, people familiar with the matter tell CNN. The Manhattan district attorney has a separate ongoing criminal investigation into the Trump Organization.\n\nAnother consideration that had been discussed, the people familiar say, is the political implications of not answering questions as Trump is widely expected to announce that he will run for president in 2024. While campaigning in 2016, Trump suggested not answering questions was a sign of guilt. At a campaign stop in Iowa in 2016, Trump said, “If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?”\n\nIn his statement Wednesday, Trump said, “Now I know the answer to that question” and decried James’ investigation. The former President and the Trump Organization have previously denied any wrongdoing.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'They even broke into my safe': Trump responds to search of his Mar-a-Lago home 02:06 - Source: CNN\n\n“When your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated Witch Hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and the Fake News Media, you have no choice,” the former President stated.\n\nThe Fifth Amendment guarantees that an individual cannot be compelled by the government to provide information that might be incriminating against themselves. When an individual declines to answer a question by “taking the Fifth,” he or she invokes that right. It is not an admission of guilt.\n\n“No person shall … be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,” the Fifth Amendment states.\n\nIn a statement, the attorney general’s office confirmed that Trump took the Fifth and said it will continue to investigate.\n\n“While we will not comment on specific details, we can confirm that today, our office conducted a deposition of former president Donald Trump,” the office said. “Attorney General Letitia James took part in the deposition during which Mr. Trump invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Attorney General James will pursue the facts and the law wherever they may lead. Our investigation continues.”\n\nThe mood was tense at the outset of the deposition, but later turned cordial and professional, Trump attorney Ronald Fischetti told CNN. Fischetti was present along with co-counsel Alina Habba, a New Jersey-based attorney who has taken over many of Trump’s ongoing lawsuits.\n\nJames, a Democrat, attended the first half of the deposition and made a standard statement about the sworn testimony.\n\nAt the outset, Fischetti explained that Trump wanted to testify “very badly,” but that the former President had accepted his advice not to answer questions.\n\nUnder oath, Trump confirmed that he wanted to testify but he would not answer questions, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Much of his statement used similar language to the public statement he released earlier Wednesday, referencing a “witch hunt” and the FBI search of his home at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAssistant New York Attorney General Kevin Wallace squared off against Trump, flanked by 10 assistant attorneys general who handed him notes during the interview. The questions focused on valuations placed on various Trump properties that were included in the financial statements, according to Fischetti.\n\nWhen questioned during the roughly four-hour deposition – not counting breaks – Trump repeatedly said “same answer” when declining to respond by pleading the Fifth.\n\nJames left at the lunch break and Trump shook her hand as she was leaving. At the end of the day, when Trump left, he shook the hands of all of the state attorneys, Fischetti said.\n\nInvestigation and previous depositions\n\nIn January, James’ office said it found “significant” evidence indicating the Trump Organization used false or misleading asset valuations in its financial statements to obtain loans, insurance and tax benefits. The attorney general’s civil investigation is nearing the end and a decision over an enforcement action may come soon.\n\nThe showdown follows Trump’s failed attempt to block subpoenas for depositions from him and his children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump.\n\nIvanka Trump’s deposition took place last week and Trump Jr. had his deposition in late July, people familiar with the matter said.\n\nTrump Jr., who runs the Trump Organization with his brother Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump did not assert their Fifth Amendment rights and answered the state’s questions, the people said. It is not clear what they were specifically asked or what they said.\n\nTheir decision breaks with Eric Trump and former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, who both asserted their Fifth Amendment rights more than 500 times when deposed in 2020.\n\nTrump has testified under oath in civil lawsuits over the past decades and since leaving office he has also been deposed. Last year he provided videotaped testimony for a lawsuit involving an assault outside of Trump Tower. The case is set to go to trial in the fall. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nQuestions about Trump’s net worth\n\nTrump has been questioned about the accuracy of his net worth and financial statements in previous lawsuits, something some advisers say is one reason why he should answer questions in the current investigation.\n\nIn a 2007 deposition in a defamation lawsuit, Trump once said he calculated his net worth, to a degree, on his “feelings,” and that he put the “best spin” on some of the assets. “I think everybody” exaggerates about the value of their properties, he testified, adding: “Who wouldn’t?”\n\nDid he inflate values? “Not beyond reason,” Trump said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Michael Cohen on how Trump would inflate property values 04:12 - Source: CNN\n\nIn the past Trump has tried to push responsibility for his valuation decisions onto Weisselberg, while at the same time, documents and depositions appear to show that, even as Trump claimed that he left those valuation decisions to others, he was also deeply involved in running his business.\n\nTrump said in the 2007 deposition that the only person he dealt with in preparing the statements of financial condition was Weisselberg.\n\n“I would give my opinion,” Trump said in the deposition. “We’ll talk about it,” he said, adding that “ultimately” and “predominately” it was Weisselberg who came up with the final values, which Trump said he viewed as “conservative.”\n\nWhen questioned specifically about swings in values from one year to the next Trump had ready explanations.\n\nDuring the deposition, Trump was questioned over the family compound in Westchester County, New York, called Seven Springs where its value nearly doubled in one year from $80 million in 2005 to $150 million in 2006.\n\n“The property was valued very low, in my opinion, then and it became very – it just has gone up,” Trump said.\n\nHe was asked if he had any basis for that view, other than his own opinion.\n\n“I don’t believe so, no,” he said.\n\nIn addition to Weisselberg, two others involved in the preparation of the financial statements, Jeff McConney, the Trump Organization’s controller, and Donald Bender, the real estate firm’s external accountant, have both been interviewed by the attorney general’s office and Manhattan district attorney.\n\nTrump’s lawyers are likely to argue that the financial statements were not audited so anyone relying on them would be on notice. The financial statements reviewed by CNN show they have numerous disclosures indicating that they did not conform with generally accepted accounting principles. In addition, none of the lenders lost money on the transactions, which could make it harder to allege that they were defrauded or misled.\n\nThe appraisals underlying the property values were in many cases provided by Trump’s longtime appraiser Cushman & Wakefield, which is also under investigation. Cushman, which broke ties with Trump after the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, has denied any wrongdoing and stands by its work.\n\nLegal risks to Trump\n\nThe depositions pose significant legal risks to the Trumps.\n\nIf Trump is sued by James and the case goes to trial, the jury can draw an “adverse inference” against him for not answering questions, which could result in a higher judgment against him if he’s found liable. If he answers questions, it could open the door to potential civil and criminal liability.\n\nThe criminal investigation, led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, has slowed but not stopped. Earlier this year, Bragg would not authorize prosecutors to present evidence before a state grand jury after raising concerns about the strength of the case, CNN has reported. A special grand jury hearing evidence in the case expired in April, but a new one could be seated in the future.\n\nBragg told CNN in an interview in April: “Anytime you have a parallel civil, criminal investigation, if there’s testimony in that proceeding, obviously we will look at it.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell"], "publish_date": "2022/08/10"}]}

And if this is part of the healing process for them, we'll do it one thousand times over.\"\n\nREMEMBERING THE FALLEN:Wilmington still grieving one year after Canby Park fire\n\nWHAT HAPPENED:More details emerge from inside burning Canby Park rowhome\n\nSpeakman survived the fatal fire after experiencing severe burns on 30 percent of his body. He recently returned to work and will help teach the upcoming academy of the department.\n\nThroughout New Castle County, the friends and loved ones of the fallen firefighters, as well as the dozens of others injured both physically and emotionally, sought to remember Leach, Fickes and Hope. Sunday marks the one-year anniversary of what many describe as Wilmington Fire Department's most tragic day.\n\nYet nearly everyone volunteering shared smiles, laughs and memories. In many ways, said Battalion Chief John Looney, this is exactly what the three firefighters would have been doing if they were still alive.\n\n\"Jerry Fickes would have been the first in line to give blood,\" he said inside the gym. \"A day of service to me is a great reflection of who they were.\"\n\nIn just the first 1½ hours of the blood drive, 26 people had donated with many more scheduled throughout the day, said Jamie Ford, with the Blood Bank of Delmarva.\n\nAcross town, vehicles lined up to have red lines placed on the back of their vehicles. Much like the blue line events held in honor of fallen Delaware State Police Cpl. Stephen Ballard, who was gunned down outside a Bear-area Wawa, this was a way for the community to publicly show their support for first responders.\n\n\"We had people at 8:45 this morning lined up to get the lines,\" said Robert Quirk, who helped start the Blue Line Network, aimed at raising awareness of post-traumatic stress disorder in first responders.\n\nAs a team, the volunteers cleaned the back windshields of waiting vehicles, applied the red tape and accepted donations for the Wilmington Firefighters Association.\n\nFIRE NEWS:In Wilmington, controversy over rolling bypasses continues\n\nRELATED:Here's how you can honor fallen Wilmington firefighters\n\nAnd at Lutheran Community Services on Baynard Boulevard, the results of extensive fundraising from the Wilmington Fire Department as well as many other local companies were unloaded from trucks and trailers.\n\nJerry Fickes' wife, Laura, requested that the local community complete a day of service for others in honor of her late husband and the other fallen firefighters. In the process, some companies like Five Points held a school supplies drive, while others tagged along in collecting nonperishable food items and toiletries at nearby fire stations and community centers.\n\n\"This is truly what my husband would have wanted,\" she said, as firefighters hauled huge boxes of food off of trailers. \"The amount of support is amazing.\"\n\nThe donations were a welcome addition for Lutheran Community Services, which typically sees a decline in donations during this time of year, said Director of Development Greg Moore. And the amount collected by local fire companies was overwhelming, with firefighters sorting boxes outside the building because the pantry was filling up so fast.\n\nEntire families together hauled box after box from trailers and trucks, many still wearing tourniquets from giving blood earlier in the morning. A few joked with each other to \"lift with their backs\" in an attempt to save their legs for Sunday's 5K in remembrance of Leach.\n\nA Mass at St. Joseph on the Brandywine at 10:30 a.m. Sunday will also honor the fallen firefighters.\n\n\"It's clear if you want something organized, get a group of firemen,\" Moore said with a laugh.\n\nIn the middle of sorting pasta and canned goods outside Lutheran Community Services, fire radios crackled to life. A dispatcher reported that a fire alarm was going off at a Wilmington home.\n\nA few of the men, still clad in their fire gear in between calls, quickly sat down the full boxes and headed to the truck. Despite wanting to honor their fallen colleagues, duty called.\n\nAnd as they did in the days after the tragic fire, the men and women got back on the truck because, as Wilmington Fire Chief Michael Donohue said, \"that's what we do.\"\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

Ciolpan, who was in the country on a J-1 student visa and working at the Blue Crab that summer, was not wearing a helmet and did not have a light attached to her bike, but the bike did have appropriate reflectors, police said at the time. She died at Christiana Hospital that Friday, less than two days after the crash.\n\nAt the time of the crash, Lowe lived in Frankford, but soon moved to Florida after posting bond.\n\nIt took nearly a year before Lowe was indicted by a grand jury with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death.\n\nOn Thursday, he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of operating a motor vehicle and causing death. Sussex County Superior Court Judge E. Scott Bradley sentenced him to 30 months in prison, which will be suspended after 90 days.\n\nLowe, who was dressed in a dark gray shirt with a striped tie, declined to say anything during the hearing.\n\nAfter three months in prison, Lowe will be placed on probation and be required to continue alcohol counseling and take a defensive driving course. He was not charged with driving under the influence at the time of the crash, but has recently been enrolled in counseling in his home state, said Lowe's attorney Eric Mooney.\n\nIf he violates probation, he faces spending the entire 30 months in prison.\n\nOnce he is released from prison, Lowe will be allowed to return to Florida and finish his probation.\n\nNeither of the charges Lowe faced was a felony, Mooney said. He received the maximum sentence during his plea deal but could have faced more prison time under the mandatory six-month sentence that came with the original charge.\n\nA state prosecutor said during the hearing that a settlement was reached with the family more than a year ago, but declined to comment or provide information about that settlement.\n\nA Department of Justice spokesman said his agency was not involved in that settlement.\n\nMooney said an investigation revealed it was possible that the crash was not Lowe’s fault, but he was charged because he fled the scene.\n\n“I think it was a fair resolution considering the facts and evidence,” Mooney said.\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.\n\nDELAWARE'S DANGEROUS ROADS\n\nBlue Crab owner remembers worker who died cycling\n\nDelaware still top-ranked in pedestrian fatalities\n\nHighway fatalities drop, but Del. still deadlier than most", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/02/02/how-new-law-requiring-corporations-disclose-owners-impacts-delaware/4157070001/", "title": "How Delaware will be affected by new federal law requiring ...", "text": "Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct Gary Kalman's role at the Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency Coalition.

The City Council voted to extend the mask requirement through May 24. The decision came the same day the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Alabama will receive $44 million to expand vaccination efforts. Alabama ranks last in the country for the percentage of people who have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data. Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said the mask ordinance is needed because COVID-19 continues to be a health threat, and most people in the city and the state have not been fully vaccinated. Woodfin said many local businesses also urged the city to keep the mask ordinance in place. “We will continue to make decisions that we believe will save lives. They may not be popular,” Woodfin said. The mayor urged people to “continue to do their part” during the “fourth quarter of this global health pandemic.” Although Gov. Kay Ivey’s statewide mask order expires Friday, health officials are urging people to voluntarily wear masks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A judge has ruled that attorneys must be allowed visits with clients in state Department of Corrections facilities, regardless of the inmates’ vaccination status. The recent ruling by Superior Court Judge Una Gandbhir came in a case brought in January by defense attorneys who argued that a continued ban on attorney-client visits deprived defendants of their right to legal counsel, the Anchorage Daily News reports. In March 2020 amid COVID-19 concerns, the Department of Corrections stopped in-person visits at its facilities. Last month, with the growing availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the department said attorney visits could resume but only with inmates considered fully vaccinated – or at least two weeks after their last vaccine doses. Gandbhir wrote that with criminal trials expected to resume soon in Alaska, delays in allowing lawyers and clients to meet “might prove fatal to the liberty interests of countless currently incarcerated Alaskans.” Sarah Gallagher, a corrections department spokesperson, said the agency will comply with the order. Gallagher said appointments must be scheduled in advance, and face coverings must be worn. She also said there will be health and temperature screenings for attorneys when they arrive. Family and friends still cannot visit, according to the department.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state-run COVID-19 vaccination site at Phoenix Municipal Stadium will move indoors Monday as it relocates to Desert Financial Arena on Arizona State University’s Tempe campus, the Department of Health Services announced Thursday. The relocation of the outdoor site in a parking lot near the Phoenix-Tempe border is the latest change in the state’s mass vaccination program to account for rising temperatures. Free parking is available in a parking lot near the ASU arena, which is close to transit routes, the department said. People who already have second-dose appointments scheduled at Phoenix Municipal Stadium for Monday and later are being informed of the new location, the department said. Arizona health officials say they are seeing demand for vaccinations slowing, particularly at large sites. Appointments at state-run sites opened to anyone 16 and older March 24, and thousands of slots were available at sites in Tucson and Yuma as the week began, KTAR reports. “What I think we’re seeing right now is supply starting to meet demand,” Dr. Cara Christ, Arizona Department of Health Services director, said at a press conference Monday. The state’s death toll related to the coronavirus surpassed 17,000 this week.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 244 new cases of the coronavirus and seven more deaths Wednesday from the illness caused by the virus. The Department of Health said the state’s COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began now total 331,505. The state’s active cases, meaning ones that don’t include people who have died or recovered, increased by 47 to 1,649. The state’s COVID-19 deaths reached 5,660, and hospitalizations decreased by two to 150. More than 27,000 additional COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered, the department said. About 1.3 million of 1.9 million doses allocated to the state have been administered so far. Arkansas last week expanded its vaccine eligibility to everyone age 16 and older. “With COVID-19 cases increasing in other states, we are in a race to get everyone vaccinated,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson said in a statement. “This is the key to victory. If you are over 16, let’s get the dose.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Lawmakers on Thursday advanced what they called commonsense legislation requiring two state agencies to share information aimed at helping stop billions of dollars in pandemic-related unemployment fraud. The measure that cleared its first committee would require the beleaguered Employment Development Department to cross-check unemployment applications with inmate records to identify fraudulent claims. State officials approved at least $810 million in the names of roughly 45,000 inmates, some of them on death row, according to a state audit in January that put the toll at more than double the amount previously reported by the state. Investigators say overall fraud losses will top at least $11 billion. “The notion that this type of fraud occurred simply because two agencies don’t communicate with each other during a global pandemic as we try to figure out how we can help people is actually kind of mind-boggling,” said Democratic Assemblywoman Wendy Carrillo, one of six committee members who advanced the bill without opposition. At least 35 other states were cross-matching unemployment claims against state prisoners as of 2016, and 28 states were checking claims against county jail inmates, the audit noted.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Health officials have reported an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations across the state, while infections also suggest wider spread of the coronavirus. The state Department of Public Health and Environment said 450 people were hospitalized statewide as of Wednesday with confirmed or suspected coronavirus infections, The Denver Post reports. The last time that many people were in the hospital because of COVID-19 was Feb. 19. Larimer, Adams, Douglas and Pueblo counties saw an increase in hospitalizations, while numbers in most parts of the state remained stable or slowly decreased. Hospitalizations in Pueblo increased 11 of the past 14 days. Health officials have said the relatively steep increase can be a sign that vaccines have not yet chased the virus out of Colorado. State data released Wednesday said there was an 8% increase of active coronavirus outbreaks in the past week, bringing numbers back to the level seen last month. Jefferson, Summit and Pitkin counties have increased safety restrictions as a result of rising case counts. “Unfortunately we are slipping in the wrong direction,” Jefferson County Public Health Executive Director Dawn Comstock said. “None of us want to go backwards on the dial after all of the hard work we’ve put in and sacrifices we’ve made.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont signed an executive order Tuesday that will allow people to use the continuing COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to vote by absentee in any election, primary or referendum held before May 20. The Democrat’s latest order related to the public health and civil preparedness emergencies is similar to the order that allowed voters to use absentee ballots during elections in 2020. Lamont’s new order also provides municipalities and regional school boards with additional flexibility in scheduling budget hearings, meetings and votes to account for logistical challenges posed by the pandemic. Meanwhile, the state continues to see new coronavirus cases, with 1,074 confirmed or probable cases added Tuesday. Over the past two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases has increased by 25.1%, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins. The number of hospitalizations for COVID-19 increased by 21 since Monday to 505, while the number of COVID-19-associated deaths increased by seven to 7,930. Lamont on Tuesday visited Hartford’s second walk-up, no-appointment vaccine clinic for Hartford residents 18 and older. The site is located at the Swift Factory, a commercial and community campus. The city held its first no-appointment clinic last week at a Walmart parking lot.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth: Rehoboth Beach’s historic boardwalk amusement park is back to its traditional opening date this year, returning May8, on Mother’s Day weekend. Funland will continue operating under the plan it implemented last year, to include enhanced cleaning and sanitizing, mandatory face masks, and limiting the number of guests in the park through an online booking system. Gone are the days of using those familiar green tickets to access rides. Now, Funland patrons book $20 “ridepasses” online. Each pass offers two hours of unlimited access to 17 rides. A limited number of passes are issued for each two-hour block, so lines are almost nonexistent. “Jungle of Fun” and “SimRider” will remain closed this year, unless and until COVID-19 restrictions are reduced. Ridepasses became available to book online Thursday. There are no refunds, so make sure you check the weather first. Funland’s iconic midway and arcade games are accessible via the boardwalk without a ridepass, and this year, there will be more of them.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A CVS offering vaccinations to D.C. residents has drawn complaints about clutter, crowding and patient privacy concerns, WUSA-TV reports. Fed up with the mess outside the store in the Penn Branch Shopping Center in the Southeast neighborhood, Dr. Jalan Burton pulled out her cellphone and took a video showing sheets of plywood inside the front windows and boxes, crates and other construction material cluttered outside. Burton said her concerns were only magnified by what she saw and heard as soon as she stepped inside, with a vaccination line in the store’s small entryway. “They had a representative sitting there with a table – a card table – and a sign that said COVID vaccines, and she was there doing health screenings,” Burton said. She said she cut through the line but could hear private medical information. “You can hear everything. Not only is it unfair from a privacy standpoint, but also from a safety standpoint, right?” she said. “Because if I can touch the people to the right, and I can touch the people to the left, and I have to walk through that line, that is not socially distanced at all.” A CVS corporate spokesperson said the team is working on rearranging the store’s flow. The plywood on the windows was related to a December car crash, the spokesperson said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis has received a single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, his office confirmed Wednesday. He did so out of the public eye even as governors elsewhere across the political spectrum have been vaccinated publicly to reassure Americans that the shots are safe. A spokesperson for the Republican governor initially declined to provide details, including when exactly DeSantis received the dose. But it was later disclosed that the governor received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine last week. The spokesperson, Meredith Beatrice, acknowledged the governor’s vaccination during an interview. The disclosure came after a DeSantis news conference at the Capitol assailing the TV news program “60 Minutes” for a story airing Sunday that suggested a “pay-to-play” vaccine distribution deal with a supermarket chain that donated to the governor’s political committee. DeSantis had recently said he would be vaccinated soon, but no announcement was made by his office when he received it, and no journalists were on hand. Even some of his top lieutenants said they were unaware the governor had been vaccinated as they continued to urge Floridians to get inoculated against a disease that has killed nearly 34,000 people statewide. More than 2 million people in Florida have been infected.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp is declaring that “Georgia is open for business” as of Thursday, loosening the restrictions he imposed last year to control the spread of the coronavirus by letting people sit closer together at restaurants and gather in larger crowds. The Republican governor changed the state’s rules despite urgings from federal officials that states should keep curbs on unmasked close contact among strangers. They warn that more infectious virus variants now spreading across the U.S. could cause another spike in cases and deaths. Kemp portrays his new executive order as part of an effort to return to “normal,” continuing to emphasize that economic health is as important as freedom from the respiratory illness that has killed more than 19,000 Georgians. “Many small-business owners are still struggling under the impact COVID-19 has had on our economy,” Kemp said in a video message Wednesday. “And we know hard-working Georgians cannot endure another year like the last.” Federal officials acknowledge “COVID-19 fatigue” but say it’s too soon to stop being careful. Under Kemp’s new order, restaurant tables now must be only 3.5 feet apart without partitions, and there’s no longer a 50-person limit on gatherings when people are closer than 6 feet, which could allow larger indoor concerts and conventions.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Oahu will remain in its current tier for coronavirus restrictions despite a rise in cases that could have triggered a rollback. Under an agreement between Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi and Gov. David Ige, the island will remain at the current level of business and social restrictions for at least four weeks, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. That means larger gatherings can continue, and businesses like restaurants and bars can operate at a higher capacity. Oahu’s coronavirus case count averaged more than 50 infections per day for the second week in a row which under the current reopening plan would have meant a return to more a restrictive tier. The mayor asked Ige to loosen the criteria for its current level of restrictions to a seven-day average daily case count of 50 to 100, one of the current triggers for the more restrictive second tier. No formal changes to the tier system have been made, but the governor agreed to allow the island to postpone rollback by a month to see what happens with case counts during that period. Noting the “profound impact on our businesses, families and community,” Blangiardi said in a statement that “we are focused on the broader definition of health and I believe moving back to Tier 2 at this point would have had a tremendous negative impact on the overall health and economic recovery, including the impacts on livelihoods, jobs and mental and emotional health.”\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: Idaho Bureau of Laboratories Director Christopher Ball has said concerning coronavirus variants are likely spreading across the state, despite efforts to vaccinate residents. COVID-19 vaccines currently being distributed are believed to be effective against the strains; however, the continued spread intensifies pressure to speed up the vaccination efforts, the Post Register reports. “We are in a race against the variants with our vaccination program,” said Kathryn Turner, the state’s deputy public health researcher. “Every single time that virus is transmitted, it has a chance to mutate. So the faster we get people vaccinated, the better off we’ll be; the fewer variants we’ll have.” Health officials have said variants accounted for four of the more than 100 residents who tested positive for the virus in the past two weeks after receiving their final vaccines. Turner said cases in which people contract the virus after being fully vaccinated are rare, accounting for less than 0.03% of about 320,000 fully vaccinated residents. Data from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare reveals 95 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been identified as caused by variants of concern. But Ball said official state variant counts don’t show the whole picture.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: With the state poised to open up eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines to residents as young as 16, Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Thursday that Illinois will make 150,000 first-dose appointments available in the Chicago suburbs. The governor said the shots will be available at 11 state-run mass vaccination sites in the suburbs and at area pharmacies. Starting Monday, residents 16 and older will be able to schedule appointments in suburban Cook County as well as the state’s other 101 counties. Chicago officials have said such universal eligibility will be expanded April 19, meeting a goal set this week by President Joe Biden, but Pritzker said Chicago residents are “absolutely welcome” to sign up for appointments at the state-run vaccination sites. Still, he warned not to expect to get an appointment immediately. “Even with all of these new appointments, there will not be enough vaccine in week one to get everyone that wants to be vaccinated a dose,” he said.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: The University of Notre Dame says it will require all students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 for the fall semester. University officials notified the campus community of the requirement in a letter Wednesday, saying the school will accommodate documented medical or religious exemptions to vaccinations. “Requiring students to be vaccinated for COVID-19 is a new and important addition to our health policies, one that we believe will enhance public health at Notre Dame and in our community, while also contributing to our ability to return to a more vibrant campus environment,” university President the Rev. John Jenkins said. The announcement came in advance of Notre Dame opening a clinic Thursday to administer the Pfizer vaccine to any students, faculty and staff who want a shot. Spokesmen for Indiana University and Purdue University said neither institution is requiring the vaccine yet. Nearly a quarter of Indiana residents age 16 and older are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, state health officials said Wednesday. Meanwhile, the state on Thursday reported 1,397 new coronavirus cases and an additional 16 deaths. Even as the pace of vaccinations accelerates, the state has been seeing the number of new cases rise.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state must “take a stand” against so-called vaccine passports, Gov. Kim Reynolds said Wednesday, while pledging to back legislation or use executive action to restrict their use. The idea of using “vaccine passports” for travel or at entry points to venues has sparked a political divide, and Republican lawmakers and governors in several states are working on proposals to ban them. The White House has said the federal government will not roll out its own system requiring Americans to carry vaccine credentials. At the end of March, New York launched the Excelsior Pass, an app that displays a digital code verifying the person is inoculated against COVID-19. It is accepted at dozens of venues statewide, including Madison Square Garden, and allows people to increase the size of catered events, such as weddings, according to USA TODAY. Reynolds said she believes the shots are effective, and she noted she has been vaccinated. But she said vaccination should remain a personal choice. A passport system would create a “two-tiered society” and have privacy implications, she said during a news conference Wednesday. Reynolds later said she is still looking into the wording of a ban and how broad the measure would be, including whether it would cover efforts by the private sector.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Native American tribe in the state is appealing to President Joe Biden’s administration for $7.5million from the first round of coronavirus relief funding distributed last year under the CARES Act. The Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, based near Mayetta, filed a lawsuit last June against the U.S. Treasury Department, claiming the department under former President Donald Trump had used improper data to allocate relief money. The federal government then was using an Indian Housing Block Grant data to allocate and divide the approximately $8 billion set aside altogether for tribes. But the data was flawed and undercounted populations, according to multiple lawsuits, and the Treasury ignored data that tribes submitted themselves. The Prairie Band Nation said that mistake meant $7.5 million lost for them. Other tribes in the nation, such as Oklahoma’s Shawnee Tribe, said that mistake meant it would receive virtually nothing, as the Shawnee didn’t participate in the IHBG program. “The Trump Treasury Department used a wholly inappropriate housing-based formula that cost us and other tribes millions of dollars of needed relief,” Prairie Band Nation Chairman Joseph Rupnick said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A judge has temporarily blocked another attempt by Republican lawmakers to restrict Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd extended a temporary injunction Wednesday to apply to a measure passed over the governor’s veto. It specifies which of Beshear’s pandemic-related orders would remain in place should the Legislature win its legal fight with the governor. House Joint Resolution 77 was a response to Shepherd’s previous order temporarily blocking GOP-backed laws that threatened to invalidate Beshear’s COVID-19-related orders. Shepherd said HJR77 was a mechanism to “terminate a broad range of executive actions in the field of public health that constitute the state’s attempt to prevent the spread of COVID-19.” He said it’s unclear whether the proposed termination of Beshear’s pandemic orders under HJR77 supersedes the governor’s executive authority under public health laws. “Until this issue has been resolved, it would create a great public harm and would undermine effective public health requirements to allow the temporary suspension or termination of the governor’s public health orders,” Shepherd wrote.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Plans for $450 million in upgrades to New Orleans’ iconic Superdome have been disrupted because of financial troubles caused by the pandemic, the stadium’s manager told state lawmakers during a budget hearing Wednesday. The coronavirus outbreak temporarily ended concerts, monster truck shows and many other events at the domed stadium and the neighboring arena. Local hotel tax collections that help fund the facilities’ management district plummeted as the virus obliterated tourist travel. Crowds at the Superdome weren’t allowed or were greatly limited for New Orleans Saints games. In response, ASM Global – the company that oversees the Superdome, arena and other facilities in the Louisiana Stadium and Exposition District – slowed the stadium improvements and may not complete the full project plans as originally envisioned. “We took a step back from the renovation project,” Evan Holmes, business operations director for ASM Global, told the House Appropriations Committee. “We’re taking it year by year, step by step to make sure we’re not overextending ourselves.” The nearly 50-year-old stadium was supposed to see its ramp system removed and replaced with elevators and escalators, club and suite levels expanded, new entry gates erected, concession stands added and access for people with disabilities improved.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state is set to relax attendance restrictions for private events such as weddings and private parties next month. Indoor events have been limited to 50% of permitted occupancy or 50 people, whichever is greater, since late March. The Maine Department of Economic & Community Development said earlier this week that the restrictions will rise to 75% of permitted occupancy or 50 people, whichever is greater, on May 24. The restrictions on outdoor events will rise from 75% to 100% of permitted occupancy May 24. The restrictions are designed to reduce the spread of coronavirus in the state, state officials said. “Group social gatherings such as weddings, celebrations, and similar private events with invited attendees bring people from multiple communities into close contact with each other and have the potential to increase COVID-19 transmission,” the economic development department said in a statement. The number of infections is creeping upward in the state, with the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases up over the past two weeks from 197.29 on March 23 to 310.43 as of Tuesday. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths in Maine did not increase over the past two weeks, going from 0.86 on March 23 to 0.57 on Tuesday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Emergency measures to help struggling businesses pay less in unemployment insurance taxes while simultaneously granting more funding to the unemployed were voted out of the Legislature last week and await a signature from Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. Raising from $50 to $200 the weekly amount of uncounted pay that unemployment insurance claimants can receive is among the measures, which come as the Maryland Department of Labor continues to receive thousands of claims each week as the pandemic’s economic effects drag on. The department reported receiving more than 12,000 new and reclassified claims last week, the lowest mark of the month. While this is a notable improvement from the 50,000 claims recorded in the last week of January, the state’s numbers have seesawed for much of the year. Employers pay unemployment insurance taxes to both federal and state governments – payments to the latter are deposited into a trust fund, from which money is drawn to pay out claims. In Maryland, individuals who lose their job through no fault of their own and who are actively seeking work can receive up to $430 per week in unemployment insurance. The amount that claimants receive is partially based on their current weekly wage total.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Emerson College is temporarily restricting campus activities amid a recent rise in COVID-19 cases. College officials said Wednesday that all in-person student activities and gatherings will be halted, including athletics. The campus fitness center will close, the dining center will offer only to-go meals, and the library will be open for socially distanced study and reserved study spaces only, Erik Muurisepp, the college’s assistant vice president for campus life, said in a message to the campus community. Students are also being asked to leave their residences for a limited number of reasons such as picking up food, seeking medical care, or going to and from employment. Travel is prohibited. The changes will took effect Wednesday evening and will remain in place for at least a week, according to Muurisepp. In-person classes will continue as normal, he said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Officials are putting together plans to knock on doors across the 139-square-mile city to convince residents to get vaccinated for COVID-19. Detroit expects by the end of April to have crews start visiting homes to speak with residents about the importance of protecting themselves from the coronavirus with vaccinations and how to sign up to receive the shots, the Detroit News reports. Despite drive-up vaccinations at a downtown convention center, mass vaccinations at Ford Field and Saturday vaccinations at churches, only 22% of Detroit residents have received at least one vaccine dose compared to 38% for all of Michigan, according to Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services. Ford Field is a federally selected regional mass vaccination site where 6,000 doses a day will be administered for two months. Efforts in Detroit, which is about 80% Black, mirror other parts of the country where African Americans have been more hesitant than white people to get vaccinated. “We’re going to knock on every residential door in the city, making sure every Detroiter knows how to make an appointment,” Victoria Kovari, an executive assistant to Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, told the Detroit News. The initial outreach is expected to last six to seven weeks.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Health officials reported 2,500 new coronavirus infections Thursday as more infectious variants drive case growth across the state. The new cases mark the highest single-day total since January, when the state was coming down from the surge in infections cases late last year. The Minnesota Department of Health reported 14 more people have died due to COVID-19 in addition to the 2,535 new virus cases, bringing the state’s totals to 6,922 deaths and 535,182 cases since the start of the pandemic last year. Hospitalizations have climbed alongside cases, with 565 patients in Minnesota hospitals due to the coronavirus, including 131 in intensive care. Health officials have expressed concern regarding the steady rise in cases and hospitalizations, citing a growing seven-day test positivity rate that indicates community transmission of the virus. Officials have described the state’s vaccination progress as a race against the more contagious virus variants, hoping the state’s efforts to vaccinate populations more susceptible to the virus will prevent a significant spike in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. More than 3 million doses of the vaccine have been administered as of Tuesday. About 1.9 million Minnesotans have received at least one dose, with more than 1.2 million fully inoculated.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Alongside rising COVID-19 vaccinations, the state’s seven-day case average has dwindled from the January peak of 2,400 to 200, Gov. Tate Reeves said during a Tuesday news conference. Hospitalizations have dropped from 1,444 to 163 in the same time span. COVID-19 patients on ventilators have declined from 230 to 35. Within the week, 1,434 new COVID-19 cases were recorded, down by 115 from the previous week. Just 34 people died due to COVID-19, down from 62 the week before. Black residents make up 38% of the state’s population, and total doses administered since vaccines came into the state have gone to 31% of Black Mississippians. As of Thursday, the state had administered more than 1,369,330 shots, nearly 41.5% of which left recipients fully vaccinated. The state reports an overall COVID-19 vaccination rate of 19.1%, similar to the national average of 20%. “Under every circumstance, the vaccine is better than COVID,” State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said during a news conference last Friday.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: The state’s Republican-led Senate on Wednesday voted to ban so-called vaccine passports. Senators voted 26-7 in favor of a wide-ranging bill that includes a ban on requiring such documentation to travel in the state. Vaccine passports show travelers have been vaccinated against COVID-19 or recently tested negative for the coronavirus. Technology companies and travel-related trade groups are developing and testing out vaccine passports to encourage travel. Republican Gov. Mike Parson has said he won’t require vaccine passports, which he emphasized again while speaking on Fox News on Wednesday. “If people want to carry a card, that’s fine. It’s called freedom. It’s called individual rights,” Parson said. “But it’s not government’s place to do that.” The Missouri bill would ban any requirements that travelers show proof of vaccination in order to fly, get a taxi or use public transportation in the state. The bill now goes to the state House for consideration. The state health department on Wednesday reported 2,175 confirmed coronavirus cases over the week of March 29, averaging about 311 per day. Cases are down about 3% from the week prior. Six new deaths were reported in the past week, bringing the total COVID-19 death toll in Missouri to at least 8,509.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state is starting a temporary program to allow 15-year-olds to get a learner’s permit without having to take a driver’s education class. About 22,000 students are waiting to enroll in driver’s education, but courses are limited due to COVID-19-related restrictions and a shortage of driving instructors, Attorney General Austin Knudsen said. “Too many families are having to wait for more than a year until their son or daughter can get into a drivers ed class,” Knudsen said in a statement. ”We’re getting bureaucracy out of the way so Montana teenagers can get back on track, start learning to drive safely and save their families money.” Under current law, teens who don’t complete a driver’s education course have to wait until they are 16 to get a learner’s permit. Under this temporary program, 15-year-olds can take the written exam and receive a learner’s permit. Then, over the next six months, they will have to complete 50 hours of driving with a parent or other responsible adult, including 10 hours of nighttime driving, before taking the driving skills test with the Motor Vehicle Division. Students who pass the driving test will receive a graduated driver’s license, which limits the number of passengers they can have and limits nighttime driving.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A growing number of younger people are being hospitalized with the coronavirus as more contagious variants spread in the state. Nebraska health officials said the average age of people hospitalized with the virus declined to 51 in March from 61 in January. Officials said the age is also shifting lower because a significant number of older people in the state have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The number of people hospitalized is also growing and hit 161 Wednesday as the state reported more cases of the virus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases nearly doubled over the past two weeks, going from 246.43 new cases per day March 23 to 491.29 per day Tuesday. So far the state has confirmed 237 cases of different variants of the virus. Officials said Wednesday that Creighton University and CHI Health have begun testing in more cases to determine if they were caused by variants. That testing will supplement similar work that was already being done at the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory and give the state a more complete picture of which variants are causing most of the infections.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: One rural southern Nevada county could step ahead of the state and approve lifting mask mandates and business capacity limits enacted as coronavirus pandemic prevention measures more than a year ago. The Nye County Commission is scheduled to hold a vote April 20 to let businesses return to 100% occupancy and make face coverings optional. Gov. Steve Sisolak’s spokeswoman, Meghin Delaney, did not immediately respond Thursday to questions about the county’s proposal. Current state rules call for mask and social distancing for people in public places and generally limit occupancy for businesses and gatherings at 50%. Nye County commissioners on Tuesday passed a separate resolution asking the Legislature to rescind the state’s pandemic emergency declaration, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The moves put the county west of Las Vegas in front of the state’s other 16 counties for easing coronavirus precautions. Sisolak’s appointed Nevada COVID-19 Response Task Force is reviewing plans to turn over pandemic mitigation control to local authorities beginning May 1. Several other reliably Republican rural Nevada counties – including Elko, Eureka, Lyon and White Pine – have also chafed at the Democratic governor’s COVID-19 directives.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: More than 20 school districts have asked the state if they can delay returning to full-time, in-person instruction that’s mandated to start April 19. At least one district, Monadnock Regional School District, has decided it’s going to stick with its original target of May 3, WMUR-TV reports. In Manchester, the district applied for a waiver, citing vaccine concerns for staff members and teachers and invoking federal requirements. “A lot of our employees have (Americans with Disabilities Act) accommodations under federal guidelines,” Manchester Superintendent John Goldhardt said. “They are not allowed to come back until they’ve had their vaccination and have full immunity.” Last week, Gov. Chris Sununu said all K-12 schools must return to full-time, in-person learning as of April 19, although a remote option will still available for parents and students who request it. Schools had already returned to offering in-person learning at least two days a week as of March 8.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Supplies of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine to the state will plummet next week, but appointments were still available for this week at vaccine sites in Atlantic City and Gloucester and Camden counties, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. “We’re going to have a couple choppy weeks based on the federal supply,” he said of the state’s effort to vaccinate 4.7 million people by June 30. He urged residents to seize available appointments now, as there will be far fewer openings for the next two weeks. The governor himself, along with his wife, Tammy Murphy, will be vaccinated at the Atlantic City Convention Center vaccination site during a visit Friday, he said. New Jersey will receive 90% fewer doses of the J&J vaccine next week compared with this week – a drop from 131,000 this week to 15,600. That is expected to dwindle further to just 5,200 doses the following week, when all New Jerseyans 16 and older become eligible for vaccination, said state Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli. Manufacturing problems at a Maryland production facility recently made it necessary to throw out 15 million doses of J&J’s vaccine, causing nationwide supply shortages just as eligibility for the vaccine expands.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state that leads the nation in the vaccine rollout is making it easier for senior citizens to get a COVID-19 shot. The Department of Health announced Thursday that people 60 and up can schedule a vaccine appointment without first being offered one by health officials. Since the rollout began, seniors have had priority for the shots. But the system to set appointments was frustrating for them and at times impossible for rural residents. The appointments are offered by text or email on a first-come, first-served basis. They can close within hours of being sent. The locations where shots are offered also could be far from where people live, requiring as much as a four-hour round-trip drive. Under the new policy, New Mexicans 60 and up can register for an appointment online whenever they want. Vaccination sites in their area may be booked, but they don’t have to wait for an invite and can check availability at their convenience. The move effectively gives them first pick at appointments, ending the need for 24/7 access to text messages and emails. It follows a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found New Mexico lagged other states in distributing vaccines to highly vulnerable populations, despite its best-in-the-U.S. inoculation rate, with 31% of residents fully vaccinated.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: In the largest program of its kind, state lawmakers have created a $2.1 billion fund to aid workers who lost jobs or income during the coronavirus pandemic but were excluded from other government relief programs because of their immigration status. The fund, which passed this week as part of the state budget, will give payments of up to $15,600 to workers who were living in the country illegally and weren’t eligible for federal stimulus checks, unemployment aid or other benefits. As many as 300,000 workers might benefit, according to some estimates. Other states have offered aid to unauthorized workers, but nothing on this scale. The creation of New York’s program showed the strength in the state of Democratic Party’s left wing, which has been increasingly emboldened as the state’s leading centrist, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has wrestled with a sexual harassment scandal. The fund will offer much-needed relief to people like Felipe Idrovo, 52, an immigrant from Ecuador who lives in Queens. He lost a job working in food distribution in March 2020 and now owes a year’s rent on his small bedroom. “I cannot jump, but I am really, really happy,” said Idorvo, a board member of Make the Road New York, an immigrant-led advocacy group whose members participated in a 23-day hunger strike in support of the legislation. “My heart is happy but my body is torn down,” he said as he and other activists broke their fast at a rally Wednesday in New York City.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: COVID-19 vaccine supply, eligibility and providers are reaching all-time highs across the state, and the focus is beginning to shift toward making sure there’s enough demand. More than 600,000 doses were headed to providers across the state this week, not including allocations directly from the federal government to retail pharmacies and other providers. And now, since Tuesday, all adults 16 and over, more than 8 million North Carolinians, qualify for COVID-19 vaccines. State allocations for the week are up almost 56,000 from the week prior and up more than 138,000 from the week before that, according to data provided by the state Department of Health and Human Services. As those numbers keep climbing, North Carolina is approaching the point where supply will outpace demand, Gov. Roy Cooper said in a recent update. “We’re going to have plenty of supply to get every person vaccinated who wants a vaccine,” he said. “Pretty soon, we’re going to be pushing, encouraging people to get it because we do know at some point we will hit that peak of supply exceeding demand, and we need to continue to push up the demand so we can get as many people vaccinated as possible.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Republican-led Senate endorsed a measure Wednesday that would prohibit the state from mandating face coverings. Senators approved the bill 30-17 but amended it to give local governments, schools and employers the option of requiring masks. Representatives approved the measure 50-44 in February. It now goes back to the House for review of the Senate amendment. Bill sponsor GOP Rep. Jeff Hoverson and others have argued there was no proof that masks work to slow the spread of the coronavirus and questioned the government’s role in mandating them. The state health officer, backed by Gov. Doug Burgum, imposed a mask mandate in November after months of refraining from such an order, hoping to stem a coronavirus surge that had been among the worst in the U.S. and threatened to overwhelm the state’s hospitals. The Republican governor dropped the statewide mask requirement as well as limits on the number of people who gather in restaurants, bars and event venues about two months later, citing a dramatic drop in active COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations due to the coronavirus.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The 2021 Ohio State Fair will not be open to the general public this summer due to public health concerns, officials said Thursday. Instead, the Ohio Expositions Commission, which runs the annual event, announced the fair will focus this year on agricultural and educational competitions for exhibitors and their families and friends. “While we are hopeful that we will soon be on the other side of this pandemic, the reality is that cases of COVID-19 remain high, and we just don’t know how things will look in July,” the announcement said. The commission outlined concerns for public health and the financial perils of hosting a fair under current pandemic safety protocols. “Although vaccination rates are improving significantly each day, Ohio continues to fight the battle against COVID-19,” General Manager Virgil Strickler said in the release. “This decision will not only help to protect the health and safety of Ohioans, it will also protect the long-term financial viability of the fair.” The fair, which opens to limited capacity July 19, usually provides rides, concerts, numerous food vendors and other entertainment. The commission said it plans to return to that regular programming in 2022.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The number of deaths due to COVID-19 topped 8,000 Thursday in Oklahoma, according to the state health department. The death toll reached 8,023, an increase of 23, and the total number of coronavirus cases rose by 483 to 442,389 since the pandemic began, the Oklahoma State Department of Health said. The rolling average of daily deaths in the state has increased during the past two weeks from 8.9 per day to 245.1, a spike that state epidemiologist Dr. Jared Taylor predicted Tuesday as he said the health department had begun using a new algorithm to confirm some COVID-19 deaths that do not require human review. The rolling average of daily new cases is also rising in the state, from 374.1 daily to 506, after the health department reported about 1,300 additional confirmed cases, most between December and March. Taylor said the additional cases came from one laboratory, which he declined to identify, that thought it was properly reporting cases, but they weren’t recorded in the system the state health department uses to track cases.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Fifteen inmates who contracted the coronavirus while at Multnomah County’s Inverness Jail are suing the county and Sheriff Mike Reese. The inmates say the county and sheriff were negligent by not taking proper safety precautions, denying testing, and mixing infected inmates and guards with those who were healthy in jail dorms, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The county’s response to the pandemic was “woefully inadequate,” the suit alleges, noting that 38% of adults in custody in the Northeast Portland jail tested positive by Feb. 17. The jail houses about 5,126 inmates. Sheriff’s Office spokesman Chris Liedle on Tuesday declined comment on the pending litigation. On March 23, Multnomah County Public Health declared the coronavirus outbreak at Inverness Jail over, calling it one of the “most challenging periods” at the jail. It was the largest and longest outbreak at either of the county’s two detention centers. The plaintiffs are seeking a court order that will require social distancing, proper testing, sanitation and compliance by county jails with federal and state health guidelines issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Oregon Health Authority. It also seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nMcKeesport: The state is “winning” the race to contain a recent spike in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations thanks to its accelerating vaccine rollout, the governor said Wednesday, as officials sought to address what they view as the pandemic’s next big challenge: persuading stragglers to get the shot. The Wolf administration is pushing people to get inoculated as soon as possible, saying vaccines will be what end the pandemic, and has so far shown little appetite for new mitigation measures to address the latest surge in infections and hospitalizations. “It’s a race between the vaccine and the upsurge, this fourth upsurge, and I think the vaccine is winning,” Gov. Tom Wolf said Wednesday outside Bethlehem Baptist Church in McKeesport, near Pittsburgh, which will host a community vaccine clinic operated by the Allegheny County Health Department. Pennsylvania this week eased restrictions on bar seating, restaurant capacity and indoor and outdoor events, even though the state – along with New York, Michigan, Florida and New Jersey – accounted for nearly half of the nation’s reported infections over a recent seven-day reporting period. But Wolf said an increasing vaccine supply has put Pennsylvania in a much different position than it was in November. He predicted anyone who wants a shot will be able to receive at least an initial dose by the second week of May.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: There will be high school proms and graduation ceremonies in the state this spring as more residents get vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Dan McKee said Thursday. “We’re making great progress,” the Democratic governor said, noting Rhode Island is ranked among the highest in the country for how many residents are fully inoculated. “That is good news. I know the schools and all the students are looking forward to that.” McKee said he’s even optimistic the state will enjoy a “real” Fourth of July, complete with parades and fireworks displays. State officials project 70% of Rhode Islanders will have at least one dose of vaccine by mid-May, and 70% will be fully vaccinated by mid-June. Proms and graduations will be allowed as part of new coronavirus safety guidelines state officials detailed Thursday during their weekly coronavirus briefing at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence. Non-catered indoor gatherings such as concerts and commencements are currently limited to 250 people, and similar outdoor gatherings are allowed up to 500 people. After May 15, those limits will double, to 500 people indoors or 1,000 outdoors, state officials said. Dancing will also be allowed at proms, so long as students wear masks and dance only with others at the same table, officials said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Senate has unanimously approved a proposal to prevent employers from mandating COVID-19 vaccines for workers. The resolution advanced by senators Wednesday says employers can’t punish or fire their workers for refusing to get the shots. The measure also says the Department of Health and Environmental Control would not be able to require people who refuse to get vaccinated to quarantine or isolate themselves. The proposal does make some exceptions for hospitals and other employers working with populations who are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus, such as the elderly or people with certain underlying conditions who have a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19. Employers could still require quarantines for workers exposed to the virus and provide incentives for employees to get the vaccine. Senators have also passed a separate bill that would prevent lawsuits against businesses and other groups by people who contract COVID-19 as long as federal and state health guidelines were being followed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A year after pools stayed closed because of coronavirus concerns, cities across the state are finding it harder than usual to hire the necessary lifeguards to see them open this summer. In Sioux Falls, pools are set to open May 28, but they’re still in need of more than 50 lifeguards to make sure they’re fully staffed, city officials said. Kelby Mieras, the city’s park operations manager, said they’ve been struggling to hire for the city’s pools as the opening date approaches. Recruiting efforts for the positions often include reaching out to past employees, but after the pandemic forced pool closures, that group has shrunk. As of Wednesday afternoon, Mieras said the city was looking for 54 lifeguards and 32 short-term maintenance positions, who could work on pools, athletic fields and parks. A full staff of lifeguards would be 82 full-time positions, but many positions will end up being part time, with well beyond 100 lifeguards likely on staff. If the city is unable to fill the needed positions, Mieras said, officials may have to adjust scheduling at local pools. Justin Weiland, city administrator for Dell Rapids, reported running into similar issues. Officials advertised the lifeguard openings, but not one person applied, he said. “Not being open last year, that pipeline was disrupted,” Weiland said.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Knox County families will have more time to decide if they want to do in-person or virtual learning for next school year, Bob Thomas announced Wednesday evening at a school board meeting. He said the state board of education is meeting Monday to discuss virtual programming that would require students to unenroll in their base school and enroll in a separate virtual school. The district is monitoring that discussion and will keep families informed. This could mean virtual learners would be at a separate KCS virtual elementary, middle or high school. Each school would have a capacity of 1,500 students as required by law. Regardless of what the state board of education decides, Knox County will still offer summer learning camps. The deadline to enroll for these camps is April. Knox County Schools has not announced a new enrollment window, district spokeswoman Carly Harrington said. Families were previously told they had to make a decision between April 15 and April 23.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: In a ruling that was divided along party lines, a state appeals court on Thursday dismissed Attorney General Ken Paxton’s challenge to Austin and Travis County pandemic-related orders that placed a curfew on businesses during the New Year’s weekend. The orders, which barred food and beverage service after 10:30 p.m. amid a surge in local COVID-19 cases, were in place for only one night before the Texas Supreme Court blocked enforcement, making the issue moot, the Austin-based 3rd Court of Appeals said in a 2-1 ruling. The court’s lone Republican, Justice Melissa Goodwin, disagreed, arguing that the issue remains live because Austin and Travis County officials continue to “vigorously defend their authority to adopt and enforce the local orders and do not concede that (they) were invalid or unlawful.” The ruling, which can be appealed, thwarted for now Paxton’s hope for a decision affirming Gov. Greg Abbott’s power to issue emergency orders that block local officials from adopting stricter requirements in the name of pandemic safety. Paxton, however, still has a separate appeal pending before the 3rd Court that seeks to block another Austin and Travis County pandemic safety order – this one requiring face coverings in area businesses.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city will continue its mask mandate after a statewide order is lifted Saturday, the mayor said Wednesday, though the rest of the county decided not to require masks, and the city’s rule may violate a new state law. Democratic Mayor Erin Mendenhall said keeping the mandate will protect residents, many of whom have not yet been vaccinated against COVID-19. “We need to keep doing what has worked: wearing masks,” she said. Keeping the rule also prevents front-line workers from confrontations with customers angry about private mask mandates in stores, said Matt Caputo of Caputo’s Market and Deli, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Leaders on the Republican-controlled Salt Lake County Council, meanwhile, decided to lift their mandate Saturday along with the rest of the state. Council Chair Steve DeBry cited public health data indicating that many of the most vulnerable residents are vaccinated and that hospitals won’t be stressed beyond capacity. “There’s mask fatigue. There’s COVID fatigue. People want to get back to normal life,” he told the Deseret News. Mendenhall said her decision doesn’t violate a so-called end game law for pandemic restrictions, but its sponsor disagreed. Republican state Rep. Paul Ray said it would be a waste of time to sue the city, but he predicted political fallout.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Health Department is asking people to submit their stories – including original videos, photos or written thoughts – about getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Select submissions will be featured in a television ad campaign, and one entry will be picked at random to receive a $500 cash card. Details can be found on the health department’s website. The state says it’s seeking the submissions to show why getting vaccinated is important. The move comes as Vermont is continuing its gradual reopening as more people get inoculated. Meanwhile, Gov. Phil Scott wants the state to use some of more than $1 billion in federal COVID-19 assistance money to help improve access to broadband internet services and other wireless connectivity. Scott on Tuesday outlined plans for spending some of the funds the state is due to receive through the American Recovery Plan. The governor would also like to spend money for housing, climate change mitigation, water and sewer infrastructure, and additional economic development and recovery from the pandemic. Scott calls his proposal a starting point for discussions with the Legislature about how the money, part of the $1.9 trillion federal COVID-19 rescue plan approved by Congress last month, should be spent.\n\nVirginia\n\nStaunton: Mount Salem Baptist Church will be hosting a COVID-19 vaccination event for the public from 10a.m. to 3p.m. Saturday. The Rev. Dr. Floyd Miles, pastor of Mount Salem Baptist Church, said it is a great idea for the church to be involved, and he’s excited to help out with the vaccination effort. Miles said the pandemic greatly affected his services, and the church had to go virtual, but he can’t wait to have his services in person and see his community again. Miles said a total of 250 vaccination slots were available. He hoped to fill all the appointments and help people get scheduled for their second doses. “It is a great privilege to be able to offer the church because it is time to get our community, our society and our churches to enjoy life back together,” Miles said. Community members who are interested can contact Margaret Lyle at 540-649-6075. She will be taking vaccine registrations until Friday.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The federal government has lowered vaccine supply allotments for the state because of problems at a facility producing Johnson & Johnson vaccine, state health officials said Wednesday. Comments about the decreased supply Wednesday come as state officials prepare to open vaccine eligibility to everyone age 16 and over April 15, The Seattle Times reports. Health officials had expected the state to receive at least 600,000 doses of vaccine through state and federal programs for each week in April, but now Washington expects deliveries of at least 500,000 doses next week. The federal government maintains the expected supply boost will come, but the timeline is not yet clear. “The three-week forecast is a little bit lower than we hoped for,” said SheAnne Allen, the COVID-19 vaccine director for the Washington State Department of Health. “These are estimates; they do change.” About 15 million doses were ruined after employees for a contract manufacturer to J&J mixed ingredients incorrectly. The problem was discovered before any bad doses were shipped. With more people becoming eligible, State Health Secretary Dr. Umair Shah said he hoped vaccine supply would rise in May, if not later in April, “so we can match that demand.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nInwood: Utilizing life skills learned in their career and technical education program, Musselman High School’s culinary students prepared meals for first responders working local vaccination clinics. Rachel Nauman, the baking and pastry teacher for the career and technical education program, said COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on the world, and her course was no different, as she and her students have spent the past several months trying to find a balance between hands-on learning and safety precautions. “It’s put a different spin on the class, but it’s been a good spin,” Nauman said. “This has allowed us to focus on the minor details, to force the students to do more in-depth thinking on what they are doing and what they are serving.” With the goal of service and hospitality in mind, Nauman said she and her students were more than up to the challenge when the school’s principal suggested the students cook and serve meals to Berkeley County first responders. Nauman said she and her students began preparing a menu they felt would be filling yet manageable and transportable, ultimately deciding to serve homemade BLT sandwiches and pasta salad and chocolate caramel brownies alongside packaged chips and drinks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state recorded its highest number of new coronavirus cases in two months Thursday, leading to new warnings from health officials about the growing spread of more contagious variants and a renewed call for everyone to be vaccinated as soon as possible. The seven-day average of new cases was twice as high as a month ago. “There’s a danger of this pandemic getting out of control,” said Dr. Ryan Westergaard, the state’s chief medical officer. State health officials urged people not only to get vaccinated but also to continue wearing masks, frequently washing hands and maintaining social distance to slow the virus’s spread. “We are not ready to go back to life pre-COVID,” said Julie Willems Van Dijk, deputy secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. “We are not ready for huge mass gatherings yet. We need to be cautious as we move forward.” The Wisconsin Supreme Court last week repealed the statewide mask mandate, but health officials stressed Thursday that face coverings should still be worn even if not required by local ordinances. “The worst thing in the world we can do right now is say no mandate, no mask,” Willems Van Dijk said. Westergaard saying not wearing masks now, just because there is no order, would be a “grave mistake.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The outdoor rodeo Cheyenne Frontier Days will continue as planned this year after being forced to cancel last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon and Cheyenne Mayor Patrick Collins joined Cheyenne Frontier Days CEO Tom Hirsig on Wednesday during a news conference to make the official announcement, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Frontier Days is a rodeo and western festival that draws about 200,000 attendees each July. Its website calls it the world’s largest outdoor rodeo, featuring competing professionals, behind-the-chutes tours, trick riding, a wild-horse race and other activities. Hirsig said the event will take place at maximum capacity and without a mask requirement but will feature a new health and safety protocol focusing on increased sanitization, digital ticketing, cashless payment options and a clear bag policy. The measures are subject to change based on COVID-19 infection rates. Guests are encouraged to cover their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing with sleeves or tissues followed by immediate hand-washing.

The hall was previously named for Bibb Graves, former Alabama governor and member of the Ku Klux Klan. The Board of Trustees voted to change the name in September. Dr. Sheree Finley, a relative of Robinson, called the renaming exciting. “She’s finally being brought to the forefront,” Finley said. Local artist Kevin King painted a portrait of Robinson during the event. The featured speaker of the event was Fred Gray, famed civil rights attorney, who recalled planning the bus boycott in Robinson’s living room. “Little did many know that (many of the) activities that (had an) impact on the civil rights movement in Alabama occurred at Jo Ann Robinson’s house,” Gray said. “She was the person who was interested in having mass participation. We could have desegregated the buses without a protest, but she was interested in getting something done with the community.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A legal challenge has been filed claiming proposed state Senate districts for the capital city area unconstitutionally favor the Eagle River suburb. The motion to reject the amended redistricting plan and to modify it was filed Monday as Anchorage Superior Court Judge Thomas Matthews considers the legality of the map approved last week by the state’s redistricting board, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The new map was drawn after portions of the board’s first proposal were ruled unconstitutional by the Alaska Supreme Court. Each state Senate district is composed of two House districts. The board’s first proposal sought to link Eagle River to the south Muldoon area of Anchorage, which the Alaska Supreme Court called an “unconstitutional political gerrymander.” The court ruled in a lawsuit brought by east Anchorage residents Felisa Wilson, George Martinez and Yarrow Silvers, who also filed Monday’s challenge. The new proposal seeks to link south Eagle River to south Anchorage and north Eagle River to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. The new challenge claims the redistricting board incorrectly interpreted the court’s instructions by keeping Muldoon districts together but again splitting the Eagle River districts. The filing seeks an order requiring the board to keep both House districts in Eagle River together.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: A wildfire nearly tripled in size as relentless winds pushed the flames through neighborhoods on the outskirts of a college and tourist town, keeping hundreds of residents away from their homes and destroying more than two dozen structures. The blaze continued its run Wednesday through dry grass and scattered Ponderosa pines around homes into volcanic cinder fields, where roots underground can combust and send small rocks flying into the air, fire officials said. Persistent spring winds and 50 mph gusts hindered firefighters. “This is a heads-up for everywhere else in the state,” said fire information officer Dick Fleishman. “If you have dry grass up next to your house, it’s time to get that cleaned up.” Fire managers are contending with tight resources as wildfires burn around the Southwest. The U.S. has 16 top-level national fire management teams, and four of those are dedicated to blazes in Arizona and New Mexico – something Fleishman said is rare this early in the wildfire season. Hundreds of people have been evacuated because of the wildfires north of Flagstaff and south of Prescott in Arizona. On the outskirts of Flagstaff – where tourists and locals revel in hiking and horseback riding trails, camping spots, and the vast expanse of cinder fields for off-road vehicle use – flames soared as high as 100 feet. Popular national monuments including Sunset Crater Volcano and Wupatki were closed because of the wildfire.\n\nArkansas\n\nJasper: The Cherokee Nation has signed an agreement with the National Park Service to allow citizens to gather plants within the Buffalo National River to use for purposes including food, crafts and medicine. The river, located in the Ozark Mountains, was established as the country’s first national river in 1972. “This area has a vibrant history of helping sustain our Cherokee people with food, the cane and bushes for our Cherokee crafts, and leaves and roots for traditional medicine,” Deputy Chief Bryan Warner said. The agreement, announced Wednesday, will establish a process for Cherokee citizens to gather plants in parts of the national park including the Lost Valley, Tyler Bend, Buffalo Point and Rush areas. “This i7/ 8 s an important step in the continuing efforts to embrace our tribal partners in the management of public lands at Buffalo National River,” said Mark Foust, National Park Service superintendent at Buffalo National River. “The Cherokee Nation offers invaluable information, ecological knowledge, and a unique perspective that will lead to a better understanding of the benefits of public land.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: City supervisors have approved legislation prohibiting police from storing DNA obtained from rape kits and other crime scene evidence in city-run databases for more than 60 days. Tuesday’s unanimous vote came two months after San Francisco’s district attorney disclosed that police used a sexual assault victim’s DNA against her in 2016 in an unrelated 2021 property crime case. The revelation by DA Chesa Boudin prompted a national outcry among law enforcement, legal experts, lawmakers and advocates of sexual assault victims. Supervisor Hillary Ronen, who introduced the legislation, said there were no local laws regulating the storage or use of DNA profiles in local police databases, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Victim samples cannot be uploaded to state and federal DNA databases, which are more tightly regulated, and the legislation does not apply to those databases. “The fact that the police department’s crime lab has been storing and using victims’ physical evidence against victims came as a shock to most of us in the city,” Ronen said. The department stores DNA information in what it calls a quality control database in order to ensure samples are not contaminated. The department has said it stopped the practice. Police chief Bill Scott told police commissioners in March that he’d discovered 17 crime victim profiles, 11 of them from rape kits, that were matched using a crime victims database during unrelated investigations.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: A “game changing” app will soon be in the hands of local first responders, and officials say it will improve their interactions with those in the community who have mental health issues or intellectual or developmental disabilities. Fort Collins Police Services announced Thursday that its officers will begin using the Vitals app in a first-of-its-kind partnership with UCHealth through the co-responder program and Mental Health Response Team. People and caregivers can download the Vitals app and create a profile that includes an individual’s name, photo, other identifying information and medical information along with their behavioral triggers and de-escalation techniques, which can help officers respond better in a crisis situation, UCHealth Co-Responder Supervisor Stephanie Booco said during a news conference. Fort Collins police officers and UCHealth co-responders who have the app will receive notifications when they are near someone with a profile and can use the information in the profile to better assist or resolve a situation. The technology is a “game changer” for the community, Fort Collins Police Services Chief Jeff Swoboda said. Fort Collins is the first community in Colorado to start using the Vitals app and the first community in the country to use it with a co-responder program, Booco said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State lawmakers advanced legislation Tuesday evening that abortion rights advocates say is needed to protect in-state medical providers from legal action, as well as patients who travel to Connecticut to terminate a pregnancy and those who help them. It comes amid new abortion restrictions being enacted in a growing number of conservative states. The bill cleared the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 87-60. It now awaits action in the Senate. Although Connecticut codified the right to abortion in 1990, proponents said steps need to be taken now to prepare for the U.S. Supreme Court possibly overturning or weakening Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion. However, the socially conservative Family Institute of Connecticut has criticized the legislation, arguing it will create a “safe harbor” for “abortion providers who violate abortion laws in other states.” The bill is considered by some advocates to be one of the most consequential abortion-related proposals to come up for a vote in the Connecticut General Assembly since 1990. Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday that he will sign the legislation in the law if clears the full Democratic-controlled General Assembly.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: State Sen. Darius Brown has regained his high-profile General Assembly committee assignments, following his acquittal of misdemeanor charges earlier this year. A jury in January found the Wilmington Democrat not guilty of misdemeanor offensive touching and disorderly conduct. A woman accused Brown at the time of hitting her in the head and throwing a drink glass that shattered near her while dining at a Talleyville restaurant in May 2021. Following his arrest, Brown was removed from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chaired. In November, months after his arrest, Brown reportedly got into a verbal altercation with Rep. Melissa Minor-Brown, D-New Castle, during a bill-signing press event. That led to Senate leadership stripping Brown of his role on the Bond Committee, a high-profile position that helps write the annual infrastructure spending bill. Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Sokola said in a statement Tuesday he has reinstated Brown to these positions due to his “acquittal in court and my belief that the terms of these sanctions have been appropriate.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden plans to attend the White House Correspondents’ Association’s annual dinner – the first time a sitting president will be at the event since Barack Obama in 2016. The organization said in a tweet that it was pleased to host Biden and first lady Jill Biden at the dinner April 30 that will honor the First Amendment. Donald Trump opted to skip the event when he was president, and it was canceled in 2020 and last year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show,” is serving as the event’s entertainer. In 2018, Michelle Wolf’s biting, after-dinner comedy routine grabbed headlines, even in Trump’s absence. After the Gridiron Club dinner in Washington earlier this month, some of those who attended, including Cabinet members, other administration officials and members of Congress tested positive for COVID-19 amid a surge of cases around the nation’s capital. Capacity for the upcoming dinner is more than 2,600, and the event is fully booked. Ashish Jha, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, suggested last weekend that the correspondents’ dinner should move forward. He told “Fox News Sunday” that “we are at the point in this pandemic” where “I think we can gather safely.” The association is requiring full vaccination and negative same-day coronavirus tests.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: As critics decried a congressional redistricting map submitted by Republican Ron DeSantis as racially motivated and drawn to benefit the GOP, the staff member who crafted the maps told lawmakers Tuesday that he didn’t take race or party politics into consideration in preparing it. Lawmakers were called back to the Capitol for a special session to approve new congressional districts after DeSantis vetoed the maps they approved last month. The GOP House and Senate leadership opted not to try drawing maps again but rather to take up one submitted by DeSantis. His plan would likely add more Republican seats than the maps the Legislature approved and could mean the four districts where Black voters have the best chance of selecting a candidate would be reduced to two. Five of the current 27 U.S. House members from Florida are Black – one a Republican from an overwhelmingly white district. J. Alex Kelly, DeSantis’ deputy chief of staff, said the map is “race neutral.” Democrats reject that argument. Several Black lawmakers have called DeSantis racist for submitting the map. Rep. Angie Nixon said other lawmakers chastised her for previously using that language, but at a rally before session began, she repeated her opinion and said she won’t be silenced. “That’s what he is,” Nixon said in an interview afterward. “It’s all racially and politically driven. And this is the type of systemic racism that they don’t want us to talk about. It’s because it makes them uncomfortable because it shows people who they truly are.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is appealing a federal judge’s ruling allowing a challenge to her eligibility to run for reelection to proceed. A group of voters last month filed the challenge with the secretary of state’s office alleging that Greene helped facilitate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential election victory. They say that violates a part of the 14th Amendment and makes her ineligible to run for reelection. Greene said the law the voters are using to challenge her eligibility is unconstitutional, and she filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge to prohibit state officials from enforcing it. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg on Monday ruled that the challenge can proceed. Greene filed an appeal with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. The provision of the 14th Amendment cited in the challenge says no one can serve in Congress “who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress … to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.” Ratified shortly after the Civil War, it was meant in part to keep representatives who had fought for the Confederacy from returning to Congress. Greene has denied aiding or engaging in an insurrection. The challenge, filed on behalf of the voters by a group called Free Speech for People, is set for a hearing before an administrative law judge Friday.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Images of a Hawaiian monk seal being born on an Oahu beach have been captured on camera. An employee of the state Department of Land and Natural Resources shot video and photos of the pup emerging from the mother onto white sands last week. “As soon as its (amniotic) sac burst, the little one starting wiggling around,” Lesley Macpherson, who works for the department’s Division of State Parks, said in a news release Tuesday. The mother monk seal checked on her pup by barking as the newborn flapped its flippers. Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species. There are only about 1,400 seals in the world. About three-quarters of this total live in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, a remote string of small atolls northwest of Hawaii’s populated islands. The rest, about 300 seals, live in the Main Hawaiian Islands including Oahu and Maui. The pup, named PO5, was one of two baby seals born on Oahu last week. Officials and volunteers will actively monitor the moms and their pups until weaning in about five to six weeks. After weaning, officials will aim to tag the pups and may apply temporary satellite transmitters to the seals to help keep track of them. Three other pups born on Oahu this year died from complications related to birth, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state Supreme Court has allowed lawmakers to intervene in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a law they passed earlier this year that would ban abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. The court on Monday approved a request by Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke, Republican Senate President Pro-Tem Chuck Winder and the Legislature to take part in the case. The law is modeled after a Texas law that is enforced through civil lawsuits to avoid constitutional court challenges. The Idaho law had been scheduled to take effect Friday but was temporarily blocked by the court following a lawsuit by a regional Planned Parenthood organization. Lawmakers said Planned Parenthood’s arguments challenging the constitutionality of the abortion law “directly implicate the Legislature’s authority.” The law allows the father, grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles of a “preborn child” to each sue an abortion provider for a minimum of $20,000 in damages within four years after the abortion. Rapists can’t file a lawsuit under the law, but a rapist’s relatives could. The bill passed the House and Senate with veto-proof majorities. Republican Gov. Brad Little signed the bill into law but said he feared it would “in short order be proven both unconstitutional and unwise.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday signed into law a state budget that aims to soften the blow of inflation with $1.8 billion in tax breaks and direct payments to Illinois consumers – an outline Republicans derided as an election-year ploy. The $46 billion budget plan for the fiscal year that starts July 1 also makes substantial investments in debt and savings backed by tax revenues virtually no one predicted a year ago amid a worldwide coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker, who faces reelection this fall, said in a news release from Chicago that the fiscal outline “brings real improvements to the lives of working families and sets us up for a stronger fiscal future.” He said the funding for schools, updated highways and transportation systems, and paying down obligations in the state pension programs “are the kind of priorities we can invest in when our state is governed responsibly.” Pritzker rolled out his plan in February, when national inflation was at about 7% – the highest in 45 years. The package includes tactical strikes at rising prices: suspending the 1% grocery sales tax, freezing the motor fuel tax increase and offering a one-time $350 property tax refund, totaling $970 million in money consumers could keep or get back.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: There won’t be a balloon release at this year’s Indianapolis 500 in May. For the past two years, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway held off on the pre-race balloon release largely due to COVID-19 protocols limiting the amount of staff on site. But this year, according to vice president of communications Alex Damron, the decision has taken into account the environmental and wildlife impacts – issues critics have raised for years. Speedway officials said they want the pre-race events to bring about unity as a way to honor military heroes, celebrate sporting excellence and build excitement. “We do recognize the release has become more divisive in recent years,” Damron said. “We’ve received significant feedback from groups and individuals opposed to it as well as an increasing number of our fans.” The balloon release has been a yearly staple at the event for more than 70 years. Environmentalists have been calling for the release – one of the few regular large balloon releases that have still been happening across the country – to end for years. Though the balloons are released in Indianapolis, they can travel quite far. In 2018, one woman even found what she believed to be an Indy 500 balloon in Ohio, 100 miles away. When the balloons land, they make their way into the ecosystem and the food chain.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Two years after fourth grade teachers at Andrew Jackson Elementary asked their students to consider whether the school should change its name, five members of the school’s student leadership team presented their arguments for renaming the school to the Des Moines School Board on Tuesday. The renaming project was waylaid when schools closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but following the murder of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in May 2020, teachers began discussing moving forward with the name change. Bettina Bradley, a reading and math interventionist, advocated letting students lead the project. At this week’s Des Moines School Board meeting, the students highlighted Jackson’s ownership of enslaved people and his signing of the Indian Removal Act, the 1830 law that authorized the president to negotiate the removal of Native Americans from their homelands to federal land – a move that led to thousands of deaths on the Trail of Tears. “The name Jackson is important to our school and community, as we are the stars,” student Keren Moran said, referring to the school’s mascot. “So we’re asking the board to rename Andrew Jackson to Mary Jackson Elementary.” Mary Jackson was NASA’s first Black female engineer. Her story was made famous in the 2016 book and film “Hidden Figures.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: One of two former Sedgwick County sheriff’s employees accused of stealing cash, drugs and weapons from the department’s evidence unit has been sentenced to a suspended jail term and one year of probation. Marc Gordon, 47, was sentenced after pleading guilty earlier this month to one count of official misconduct and three counts of theft, all misdemeanors, the Wichita Eagle reported. He was sentenced to a year in jail, which was immediately suspended, and placed on probation for a year. Gordon would be subject to having the jail term reinstated if he fails to abide by the terms of his probation. Prosecutors say Gordon was a property and evidence technician with the agency when he and a property and evidence supervisor, 55-year-old Robert White, stole more than $7,700 in cash, several pounds of cocaine, meth and other drugs and several samurai-style swords. The missing evidence led the Sedgwick County District Attorney’s Office to dismiss or review dozens of drug cases. White pleaded guilty in January to 12 counts, including felony official misconduct, drug distribution and thefts. He is set to be sentenced on April 29.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The last stockpiles of a deadly chemical agent in the U.S. have been safely eliminated, according to Kentucky officials in charge of destroying the Cold War-era weapons. The final M55 rocket containing VX nerve agent was destroyed Tuesday at the Blue Grass Chemical Agent plant. Officials began disassembling about 18,000 of the rockets and draining the VX agent in July, according to a news release from plant officials. Candace Coyle, the plant’s project manager, said Wednesday that the nation’s entire stockpile of VX nerve agent “is now completely destroyed.” VX is considered the deadliest of the chemical agents that were produced by the U.S., much in the 1960s. It has a consistency similar to motor oil, and even a tiny amount causes victims’ bodies to flood with fluids, producing a feeling of drowning before death. Officials in 2017 declared that assassins used VX agent to kill the brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a Malaysian airport. The central Kentucky Army depot still has 277 tons of other chemical agents left to be destroyed, after beginning with more than 520 tons of VX, GB and mustard agent that was in storage for decades. Officials said it all should be gone by next year after it began eliminating its mustard agent stockpiles in 2019.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Legislation to keep transgender athletes from competing on college and K-12 women’s and girls’ sports teams has been approved by the state Senate with little debate. The Advocate reports that the bill by Sen. Beth Mizell, R-Franklinton, passed Tuesday evening on a 29-6 vote. It goes next to the state House. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards vetoed similar legislation last year, saying it was mean-spirited, unnecessary and could result in loss of NCAA events in the state. He has not said what he would do were the bill to pass this year. The measure would apply to K-12 schools, as well as colleges and universities, if they receive state funding. “Athletic teams or sporting events designated for females, girls, or women shall not be open to students who are not biologically female,” the bill says. Opponents say there are no known transgender athletes currently competing in the state, and the legislation adds to discrimination against an already marginalized group. Mizell said the NCAA hasn’t gone through with threats to pull events from states with similar laws.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills on Tuesday signed into law a bill to create a public-private partnership to help grow the state’s aerospace industry. Supporters envision the corporation as a central hub for innovation and economic development in the state’s air and space industry. The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Mattie Daughtry, D-Brunswick, said the effort has been years in the making. “The Maine Space Consortium will bring together business, research and state leaders, to help ensure Maine continues to be at the forefront of this industry,” Daughtry said in a statement. Members of the air and space industry have taken an interest in Maine in recent years, in part because it is home to the former Loring Air Force Base and Brunswick Landing, formerly a naval air station. The state’s geography and existing infrastructure make it a candidate to serve as a site for small launches, industry members have said.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The addition of about 80 acres to the Pocomoke State Forest through legislation makes an elevated walkway connecting Snow Hill directly to the park possible. HB882, signed into law by Gov. Larry Hogan this month, was co-sponsored by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester. According to a statement by Carozza, the project would create a trail network from Snow Hill to Pocomoke City “and has significant social, recreational and economic benefits.” This Maryland Department of Natural Resources project would add the acreage to Pocomoke State Forest as new type of wildlands and would exempt approximately 2 acres for the trail’s construction. She also confirmed in a statement that “the trail will be developed through a collaborative planning process between the Maryland Forest Service, Maryland Park Service and the Town of Snow Hill.” The public hearing on this project was held Oct. 28, 2020, and 98% of the 122 comments were in strong support of the project, including multiple organizations and local government agencies.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A gate separating affordable housing from the new playground at Coes Park was unlocked Friday. Community activists celebrated, having seen the locked gate as a symbol of environmental injustice and racism. “It felt like modern-day segregation,” said Nelly Medina, an organizer with the Tenant and Housing Alliance of Worcester and a Lakeside Apartments resident who spearheaded the fight to unlock the gate. “They got $1.2 million from saying it was in an environmental justice community, and they locked the gate. It put white people on one side and (Black, Indigenous and people of color) people on the other.” But Alex Corrales, director of the WHA, said unlocking the gate was simply a seasonal task. “It’s springtime – that’s all it is,” Corrales said in an interview. “We had been opening it for years, during the summer program for children, and they would do swimming classes, have canoes, but we would not leave it open permanently because we were concerned with safety.” Corrales bristled at the idea of any injustice and said the plan was to open the gate “indefinitely.” “We will obviously monitor the situation in terms of communicating with residents and the community,” he said. “If there are incidents that really put the safety risk of residents involved, we do want to review that very closely.”\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: A judge denied a motion Tuesday to reduce bonds for the jailed parents of a teenager who is charged in a shooting at his high school that left four students dead. Oakland County Circuit Judge Cheryl Matthews said that James and Jennifer Crumbley’s actions before their Dec. 4 arrests in a commercial building in Detroit were meant to conceal their whereabouts. “The defendants indicate they were devastated when they heard about the alleged actions of their son, felt unsafe in their home, felt hounded by the press and found it necessary to leave,” Matthews said. “The chronology of events that occurred subsequent to the defendants leaving their home is not consistent with cooperation with law enforcement.” The Crumbleys had disappeared the day before after they were charged with involuntary manslaughter. The parents are accused of failing to keep a gun secure at home and failing to reasonably care for their son when he showed signs of mental distress. They have pleaded not guilty. “Upon a warrant being issued, law enforcement is not required to make an appointment with a defendant,” Matthews said. “It is the job of the police to ensure a swift, safe and secure arrest. The defendants’ actions were premeditated to conceal their whereabouts.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Supreme Court agreed Tuesday to hear a challenge by environmentalists over portions of a lower court ruling involving a key permit for the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine. The Minnesota Court of Appeals in January reversed a 2018 decision by state regulators to issue PolyMet Mining Corp. a water quality permit for the project. It sent the case back to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for further proceedings. That was a win for environmentalists, but they’re challenging other parts of the ruling. One prong involves the agency’s decision to issue the permit without setting specific effluent limits on mercury and other pollutants. They also faulted the appeals court for not imposing consequences for the agency’s alleged effort to dissuade the federal Environmental Protection Agency from submitting critical written comments during the water permit review process. “It is so important that Minnesota agencies be held accountable when they circumvent laws that were meant to protect the integrity of the regulatory process,” said Paula Maccabee, counsel for WaterLegacy, one of the three parties that asked the Supreme Court to step in. The other petitioners are the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy and the Fond du Lac band of Lake Superior Chippewa.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A state prison violated inmates’ constitutional rights by failing to protect them from violence, failing to meet their mental health needs, failing to take adequate steps for suicide prevention and relying too much on prolonged solitary confinement, the U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday. The department released findings of its two-year investigation of the state’s oldest prison, Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. The probe started after an outburst of violence in late 2019 and early 2020. “The problems at Parchman are severe, systemic, and exacerbated by serious deficiencies in staffing and supervision,” the department said in its report. It said the Mississippi Department of Corrections “has been on notice of these deficiencies for years and failed to take reasonable measures to address the violations, due in part to non-functional accountability or quality assurance measures.” “Years of MDOC’s deliberate indifference has resulted in serious harm and a substantial risk of serious harm to persons confined at Parchman,” the Justice Department said. Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, head of Justice’s civil rights division, said 10 homicides and 12 suicides have occurred among inmates at Parchman since 2019.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: A bill passed by the state House on Tuesday would put restrictions on how race is talked about in public K-12 schools. The GOP-led House on Tuesday voted 85-59 in favor of the bill, with some Republicans opposing the measure. It now goes to the GOP-led Senate. The legislation would ban schools from teaching “that individuals, by virtue of their race, ethnicity, color, or national origin, bear collective guilt and are inherently responsible for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, ethnicity, color, or national origin.” The measure also bans schools from compelling students and teachers to affirm that “individuals of any race, ethnicity, color, or national origin are inherently superior or inferior.” Students, parents or teachers could file complaints alleging violations of those bans with the state education department or Missouri attorney general. Supporters argued that the bill is needed to prevent classrooms from being used to indoctrinate children. But critics said the measure could have a chilling effect and might scare educators away from having difficult discussions about race and American history. “America’s history is not squeaky clean,” Democratic Rep. LaKeySha Bosley said. “We need to be open-minded about that and have the hard conversations and not be scared to talk it through.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The city commission has voted 4-1 to deny an appeal from local marijuana dispensary owners over a Safety Inspection Certificate and to bring forward a proposed referendum package regarding adult-use marijuana sales on the ballot this November. City staff will work with city commissioners to get a referendum on the ballot. Janelle and Dale Yatsko, owners of Green Creek Dispensary in Cascade County, applied for a Safety Inspection Certificate, handled by Great Falls Fire Rescue as an annual inspection for businesses within city limits, for the operation of an adult-use marijuana dispensary within city limits in February. GFFR and the City Attorney’s Office advised that their application likely not be processed, according to the agenda background. Legal counsel for the Yatksos, Attorney Raph Graybill, reached out to the City Attorney Jeff Hindoien to argue that “state law entitles the Yatskos to operate their adult-use marijuana business within City limits; any contrary policy is preempted by state law.” The city responded denying the SIC on the basis of a local ordinance that has been in place for medical marijuana and federal law regarding marijuana but said the Yatskos could appeal the decision, which they did.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts touted the tax cuts lawmakers approved this year as they wrapped up their session Wednesday. Ricketts said the $900 million package of income and property tax cuts that the Legislature approved this year delivered “the most significant tax relief bill we have ever had in the state of Nebraska.” He signed the bill last week. Lawmakers took care of their business quickly Wednesday because Ricketts didn’t veto any of the bills they sent to him this week. Ricketts also praised bills the Legislature passed that will lay the groundwork for a canal project to divert water out of Colorado and study the creation of a major new lake along the Platte River between Lincoln and Omaha. Lawmakers also made plans to spend more than $1 billion in federal pandemic relief money, including a package of $335 million to help economic recovery in parts of Omaha and other high-poverty areas in the state. And Ricketts said the Legislature made important investments in public safety including improvements at the state law enforcement training center and setting aside money for a potential new state prison.\n\nNevada\n\nSparks: The Generator, lauded as a headquarters for Burning Man artists, has a new space and a new mission. The arts and maker space reopened this month after signing a 10-year lease with Foothill Partners, developer of the much anticipated Oddie District – a 187,000-square-foot mixed-use space just east of U.S. 395 in Sparks, next to Goodwill. The Generator currently takes up about 70,000 square feet, about twice the size of its former home on Icehouse Avenue in industrial Sparks. Eventually, about half the space will be given to another tenant. “Any time there’s a lot of people in a space making art, it makes us all feel better, right?” said Jessi “Sprocket” Janusee, communications director for the Generator, also lovingly known as The Genny. Since 2013, local and international artists alike have used the space to assemble colossal sculptures, from temples to whales to ships, before sending the installations into the desert to burn. While it continues to be a magnet for Burning Man creations, staff at the Generator say the goals of the space are now more community-driven. Still run by a cast of established Burners, the team is placing a much heavier emphasis on community outreach year-round.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Theo Martey, a teacher of West African drumming and dance and a songwriter, is the state’s next artist laureate. Martey, nominated by Gov. Chris Sununu, was confirmed by the Executive Council on Wednesday for the two-year, honorary position. He had received the Governor’s Arts Award for Arts Education in 2019. Born in Accra, Ghana, he has more than 33 years’ experience as a performer and arts educator across three continents. He has lived and worked in New Hampshire for 20 years. Martey has taught more than 5,000 workshops to students from first grade through high school, college and university students, and in communities. “For over two decades, I have been invited into dozens of schools across New Hampshire as an artist in residence, working with students so that they may experience West African drumming and dance hands-on,” Martey said in a statement. “To be named artist laureate is an honor, and I look forward to continuing to use music to empower others to discover their best selves and promote the importance of arts across the state and the region.” Martey is the state’s ninth artist laureate since 1997.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A Catholic diocese has agreed to pay $87.5 million to settle claims involving clergy sex abuse with some 300 alleged victims in one of the largest cash settlements involving the Catholic Church in the United States. The agreement between the Diocese of Camden, which encompasses six counties in southern New Jersey on the outskirts of Philadelphia, and plaintiffs was filed with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Camden on Tuesday. The settlement must still go before a U.S. bankruptcy judge. If approved, the settlement would exceed the nearly $85 million settlement in 2003 in the clergy abuse scandal in Boston, although it’s less than other settlements in California and Oregon. “I want to express my sincere apology to all those who have been affected by sexual abuse in our Diocese,” Bishop Dennis Sullivan said in a statement. “My prayers go out to all survivors of abuse and I pledge my continuing commitment to ensure that this terrible chapter in the history of the Diocese of Camden, New Jersey never happens again.” Details about what allegedly happened to the roughly 300 victims were not included in the proposed settlement, according to Jeff Anderson, an attorney for some 70 of the victims, who called it “a powerful advance in accountability.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Officials with a U.S. agency undergoing a multibillion-dollar modernization effort that includes the production of plutonium cores for the nation’s nuclear arsenal celebrated the opening of a massive office complex Tuesday. Jill Hruby, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, joined other officials and members of the state’s congressional delegation for a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Years in the making, the new complex on the edge of Albuquerque will replace a collection of two dozen military barracks and other buildings, some of which date back to the government’s top-secret Manhattan Project during World War II. Officials said some of the old buildings were compromised by asbestos and lead paint and were well past their lifespans. The new building boasts enough space to cover more than five football fields and will end up saving the agency an estimated $40 million in deferred maintenance, officials said. It includes a data center for rows of servers, conference rooms and secure spaces. Construction was supposed to wrap up last year, but officials said pandemic-related labor and material shortages resulted in delays.\n\nNew York\n\nSyracuse: A widely seen video of an 8-year-old Black child sobbing as he’s being led into a police car over a bag of chips was called “heart-wrenching” Wednesday by Gov. Kathy Hochul, who said more needs to be done to build trust with communities of color. The video taken Sunday shows a white officer holding the clearly distraught youth from behind by his elbows, leading him from a sidewalk to the back seat of a police vehicle. Another officer says the situation is about “stealing stuff.” The man recording the video argues with police to let the child go. The video has been widely shared on social media, with many people condemning the officers for treating the child roughly. Hochul, at a COVID-19 briefing in Syracuse, said the video was difficult to watch. “We have more work to do, and I know that the mayor is working closely with the police department to get to the bottom of everything,” said Hochul, a Democrat. “But also make sure that we do protect our children – that they’re handled in a different way when it comes to encounters with law enforcement.” Syracuse police said Tuesday the officers’ actions were being reviewed, along with body-worn camera footage. Police said the incident involved an accusation of youths stealing from a store.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court agreed Wednesday to give a judge another week to work through the latest step in a long-running legal fight over public education spending. The court’s justices granted Special Superior Court Judge Michael Robinson a seven-day extension, which he had requested Tuesday while citing differences between the legal parties over details and numerous documents to review. Robinson was tasked last month with scrutinizing the November order of another judge who had directed that $1.75 billion be moved from state coffers to carry out two years of a remedial plan to address education inequities. In particular, the Supreme Court told Robinson to review Judge David Lee’s order in light of the General Assembly’s passage of a state budget that funds some of the plan’s provisions. Robinson originally had until Wednesday to report his findings to the justices, who afterward will hear appeals that likely would rule on whether the judicial branch has constitutional powers to order taxpayer-funded spending for education on its own. Republican legislative leaders say only the General Assembly can appropriate state money.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican state Sen. Ray Holmberg resigned Wednesday as head of a powerful panel that oversees the Legislature’s business between sessions, just days after a published report that he had exchanged scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Holmberg, 79, the state’s longest-serving senator, stepped down from the legislative management committee, saying in a statement “recent events and discussions have made it clear to me that the interim governing body of the legislature, Legislative Management, does not need to be any part of that discussion.” Holmberg will remain on the panel, but not as its chairman. “No further comments on this announcement will be forthcoming,” his statement said. He had announced in March he would not seek reelection. The Forum of Fargo reports Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages in August with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier as Morgan-Derosier was held in the Grand Forks County Jail. The newspaper cited a jail log it obtained through a records request showing the time and date of the text messages. Morgan-Derosier was held at the time on state child pornography charges. Holmberg first told the Forum that he had read a newspaper story about the charges but in a later interview said he had not, the Forum reports. He also said he no longer has the texts.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A doctor accused of ordering excessive amounts of painkillers that led to multiple patient deaths at a Columbus-area hospital was acquitted of 14 counts of murder Wednesday following a weeks­long trial. Dr. William Husel, 46, was accused of ordering the drugs for patients in the Mount Carmel Health System. He was indicted in cases that involved at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for a nonsurgical situation indicated an intent to end lives. Husel’s attorneys argued he was providing comfort care for dying patients, not trying to kill them. Franklin County Judge Michael Holbrook told jurors before the start of deliberations that they could also consider lesser charges of attempted murder. They deliberated for six days. Husel would have faced a sentence of life in prison with parole eligibility in 15 years had he been found guilty of just one count of murder. Prosecutors presented their case beginning Feb. 22 and put on 53 prosecution witnesses before resting on March 29. Those witnesses included medical experts who testified that Husel ordered up to 20 times as much fentanyl as was necessary to control pain.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Emergency responders, National Guardsmen, children, parents, grandparents, members of Congress, City Council members, students and college professors united Tuesday in their desire to remember the 168 lives lost in the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Building 27 years ago. In spite of the somber reason for the gathering, laughter and joyful conversation were heard among the crowd of nearly 1,000 people filling the pews of Oklahoma City’s First Church ahead of the annual Day of Remembrance Ceremony. The ceremony was moved inside the church east of the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum out of concern for chilly temperatures and wind gusts Tuesday morning, but by the time the crowd followed the bagpipers to the Field of Empty Chairs to place flowers on them, the sun was shining brightly. Speakers partaking in the program included Gov. Kevin Stitt, U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice and Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt. “When you see your fellow human beings as Republicans or Democrats – not as fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters – then you have begun the process of dehumanization. You are paving the path to horror,” Holt said. “That memorial is a symbol of that path’s inevitable conclusion.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Oregon State Treasury has at least $5.3 billion invested in fossil fuel companies, a coalition of environmental groups said in a report Wednesday that blamed the state for adding to global warming and urged divestment. Oregon is considered a “green” state, through its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by state agencies and being the first state to commit to stop using coal-fired power. Yet the state treasury is working at cross-purposes with over $1 billion invested in the coal industry alone, Divest Oregon said in its report. “The state exposes Oregonians to climate and health risks, economic costs, and financial losses” through the investments, the group said. The amount that Oregon has invested in oil, gas and coal companies – whose products are a leading cause of global warming – is probably far higher than $5.3 billion because the numbers that Divest Oregon obtained from the state treasury through a public records request do not include private equity investments, which are not subject to public disclosure. The state treasury did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The agency’s spokesperson was tied up in a meeting Wednesday of the Oregon Investment Council, which makes investment decisions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The federal fraud trial of a City Council member and his wife in what prosecutors alleged was a “widespread corruption conspiracy” has ended in a mistrial following a jury deadlock. Jurors deliberated for about 25 hours over four days but were unable to reach a verdict in the case of Councilman Kenyatta Johnson and his wife, Dawn Chavous, who were charged with honest services wire fraud in a 22-count indictment. Outside the courtroom, Johnson thanked family, friends and supporters “for just praying for us and showing your support during this very stressful time.” The jury told the judge Monday afternoon that they were at an impasse but deliberated all day Tuesday after being instructed by the judge to do so. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney’s office later said “the government is committed to retrying the case.” Johnson, 46, a Democrat who has served on the council since 2012, was accused of engaging in official actions in exchange for payments. Chavous, 40, was accused of having entered into a “sham” consulting agreement with a nonprofit that was used to funnel payments to her husband. Defense attorneys said prosecutors lacked evidence to support their case, defending the work of Chavous as legitimate and saying it had nothing to do with Johnson’s actions on the council.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The downtown arena known as “The Dunk” will keep its name at least through June. Dunkin’ Donuts’ two-decade-old naming rights deal for the building expired Wednesday, but the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority has agreed to a short-term extension through June 30 while it vets new proposals, Executive Director Daniel McConaghy said Tuesday. At the start of this month, the Convention Center Authority went out to bid for new naming rights proposals from companies looking to display their brand to hockey and basketball fans or drivers speeding past on Route 95. Unlike the previous naming rights deal, which included only the arena, this time the authority plans to include the rights for the next door Rhode Island Convention Center, according to the Request For Proposals. While Dunkin’ Donuts – now known as Dunkin’ – may put in a bid to keep the name, it is likely to face competition. And the fact that the doughnut chain didn’t come to an agreement to extend the deal before it went to a formal bidding process may be a sign it has moved on. The arena was built by the City of Providence in 1972 and was originally known as the Providence Civic Center. Dunkin’ first bought the naming rights to the center in a 2001 deal valued at $8.65 million over 10 years.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: A performer who scared a group at a haunted house was shot by a man who said he thought he was grabbing a prop gun as part of the experience, police said. The employee at the Zombie Experience at the Hollywood Wax Museum Haunted House in Myrtle Beach was hit in the shoulder and survived, authorities said. The man told investigators the group fell to the ground after the performer scared them Saturday, and he felt a gun hit his foot, Myrtle Beach Police said in a statement on Facebook. The man thought the gun was not real and was part of the experience and fired twice, police said. The performer spoke at the suspect’s bond hearing and said the man looked at him before firing. He said since the shooting, he is struggling to work and can’t sleep. So far, the man has been charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor because he gave the gun to a 15-year-old after firing it even through he was told it was real, authorities said. Police said they are still trying to determine where the gun came from, and additional charges are likely.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Avera Health has plans to build the state’s largest pickleball facility. The health care provider will construct 12 outdoor courts at its Avera on Louise Health Campus in Sioux Falls at a cost of about $1.5 million. Pickleball is a sport that’s recently grown in popularity, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. Combining elements of tennis, badminton and pingpong, it’s played indoors or outdoors on a badminton-sized court with a slightly modified tennis net. Two or four players can play with simple equipment that involves paddles and a plastic ball with holes. Jason Askew is executive director of Sports Medicine for Avera and said the organization wants to appeal to people of all ages. “Being able to offer something for adults that is growing by leaps and bounds in popularity, both here in Sioux Falls and around the country, is a lot of fun to be able to announce,” Askew said, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Askew said construction will take a few months, and Avera anticipates the free courts will open to the public by early August.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Republican officials have removed three congressional hopefuls from the GOP primary ballot, including one candidate backed by ex-President Donald Trump. The late Tuesday night decision by the Tennessee Republican Party was a long-awaited result of months of debate over Morgan Ortagus, Trump’s former State Department spokesperson, entering Nashville’s open 5th Congressional District race. Even with Trump’s endorsement, some Republicans criticized the selection after pointing out that she had just recently moved to the state and did not know the region or its voters. Tennessee’s GOP-controlled Legislature had sought to nudge Ortagus and others off the ballot by imposing residency requirements on most U.S. House and Senate candidates. However, that attempt fizzled after the state’s election office told the Associated Press the legislation – which Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee allowed to go into effect without his signature earlier this month – would not apply retroactively to candidates who had already met the qualifications. That left the decision up to the state Republican Party, who had received challenges over the voting records of Ortagus, as well as video producer Robby Starbuck and small-business owner Baxter Lee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Former state lawmaker Wendy Davis sued Tuesday over the most restrictive abortion law in effect in the U.S., nearly a decade after her 13-hour filibuster of another anti-abortion measure made her an overnight Democratic star. The lawsuit is the latest attempt to halt the Texas law known as Senate Bill 8, which bans abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Courts have repeatedly turned back multiple other challenges and kept the law in place since September. That includes both the U.S. Supreme Court and the Texas Supreme Court, defeats that left attorneys for Texas abortion clinics acknowledging that their path to stopping the law had effectively shut. Like past challenges, Davis calls the law unconstitutional but a takes a different legal approach, suing a Republican state Rep. Briscoe Cain, who earlier this year accused Citigroup of circumventing the law by offering to pay travel expenses for employees who go out of state to seek an abortion. Cain did not immediately respond to an email sent Tuesday evening. The suit also names three private citizens who Davis accuses of using or threatening to use the law’s unique mechanism that enforces the law only through private lawsuits. Davis’ filibuster propelled a failed run for governor. She also lost a bid for Congress in 2020 and now works with abortion funds.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: As warmer weather draws more people to get out and enjoy the sunshine, officials are urging anyone heading out into the state’s great outdoors with their pets to keep their dogs on leashes. Dogs can have a serious impact on wildlife and on landscapes, and any left off-leash while in nature could act on their instincts to chase deer and other animals, wildlife officials said Tuesday as they issued a statewide request for dog owners to take the issue more seriously. Utah wildlife often struggles to find food during the winter and can be vulnerable and weak come springtime, according to the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “If they get chased, it uses up energy they may need to survive,” said Covy Jones, the Big Game coordinator at UDWR. “These animals are already depleted, and they often can’t afford to waste energy. If you or a pet force them to move away from where they are trying to feed, it could be harmful.” Deer and other big game animals typically move to lower elevations in search of feed during the snowy winter months, which typically brings them closer to roads and to people and pets. Dogs that are off leash can also disturb nesting ground birds and can chase, injure or kill small mammals, deer, elk or moose, according to the DWR. Utah law states that a person may kill or injure a dog that is “attacking, chasing or worrying any species of hoofed protected wildlife.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The second of four men accused in a failed plan to build a biotechnology plant in Vermont using tens of millions of dollars in foreign investors’ money raised through a special visa program was sentenced Wednesday in federal court to 18 months in prison. William Kelly, 73, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, also was sentenced to three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $8.3 million in restitution. He pleaded guilty last June to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of concealment of material information. As part of the plea deal, eight other charges were dropped and he agreed to cooperative with the government. Kelly was indicted in 2019 on multiple fraud charges along with Miami businessman Ariel Quiros, the former owner of Jay Peak and Burke Mountain ski resorts in northern Vermont, and former Jay Peak president William Stenger. Kelly was an adviser to Quiros. The indictment accused the men of conspiring to devise a scheme between 2011 and 2016 to defraud foreign investors in the AnC-Bio project in Newport. The EB-5 visa program encourages foreigners to invest in U.S. projects that create jobs in exchange for a chance to earn permanent U.S. residency.\n\nVirginia\n\nChincoteague: After two years of pandemic-enforced absence, Tom’s Cove Park campground will again welcome hungry seafood lovers as the Chincoteague Seafood Festival – appropriately themed “Long Time ... No Sea!” – returns for its 52nd year May7. The Chincoteague Chamber-sponsored event is held the first Saturday in May to promote the seafood industry on Virginia’s Eastern Shore. The festival offers fresh, local seafood and signature dishes from local restaurants as well as old and new Eastern Shore favorites prepared by festival cooks, volunteers and professionals, according to the chamber. Non-alcoholic beverages are included in the ticket price, with beer available for purchase. Front Page News will provide live entertainment, and festivalgoers can shop an arts and crafts tent featuring handmade creations from area artisans. Ticket sales have been brisk due to the two-year hiatus, according to the chamber.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A citywide “day of service” in May will offer thousands of volunteer opportunities in an event Mayor Bruce Harrell hopes will be a symbol of how his administration plans to beautify the city. Rather than a budget boost or a new devotion of city resources, Harrell is appealing to civic goodwill to help clear litter, weeds, debris and graffiti, The Seattle Times reports. More than 80 city-organized cleanup and volunteer events will take place May 21. Some of the options include picking up litter in Ballard, clearing trails in Jackson Park, working on community gardens in the Chinatown International District, sorting donations at downtown shelters and building tiny homes near the Duwamish River. “This is going to be symbolic of how we’re going to get things done in our city,” Harrell said Monday. “People want to help. Employers want to help; employees want to help.” Everyone who volunteers for the day of service, Harrell said, will a sense of self-fulfillment that they did something about a problem rather than just complaining, along with a T-shirt. The city annually spends about $3.7 million on graffiti removal and has the equivalent of about 15 full-time employees devoted to the problem. Harrell said he’s not yet sure if the city needs to devote more money to it. Volunteers can register at seattle.gov/dayofservice.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A former director at a hospital has filed a lawsuit alleging he was fired after he raised concerns about the safety of patients who were on ventilators and receiving other respiratory care services during a surge of COVID-19 cases. Mark Mustard was fired as director of cardiopulmonary and therapy services at Princeton Community Hospital in September 2021. His departure from the West Virginia University Medicine affiliate came amid the surging delta variant of the coronavirus “at a time when respiratory care was crucial to the community,” according to a lawsuit filed last week in Mercer County Circuit Court. Mustard, then 63, alleges he was terminated after he reported concerns about the quality of medical care being provided as the number of patients requiring respiratory care increased during the pandemic. Mustard was “highly outspoken” about the need for more staff in the respiratory services department “in order to provide an adequate level of care to its patients and the community,” the lawsuit said. He was not warned that his job was in jeopardy or given a reason for the termination, which came less than one month after he received an “exceptional” performance review that included an incentive bonus of more than $6,000, according to the lawsuit.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Communities are encouraging residents to keep their lawnmowers in the garage next month to boost the population of bees and other pollinators. Appleton became the first city to adopt the “No Mow May” initiative a couple of years ago, and others have followed, including Wausau, Oshkosh, Fort Atkinson and Stevens Point. The idea is to give homeowners the option of letting their lawns become a bit overgrown for a few weeks to ensure that bees coming out of hibernation have plenty of options for the nectar and pollen they need, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Cities temporarily waive enforcement of ordinances that require homeowners to maintain their lawns. This year, the initiative has spread even farther, to La Crosse, Wisconsin Rapids, De Pere and other communities. “Bees, and insects in general, are in a bit of a slump right now,” said Israel Del Toro, a biology professor at Appleton’s Lawrence University. Studies have shown steep declines in wild bee populations in the 21st century. The United Nations characterizes it as a threat to the global food supply. Del Toro said many factors are hurting bee populations, including climate change and irresponsible uses of pesticides and herbicides. But in his view, the biggest stressor is habitat loss. Del Toro said there is plenty of room for compromise. People can plant native flowers or allow growth only in parts of their yards.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A utility company estimates a new law requiring carbon-capture systems be added to coal-fired plants could cost the average customer an extra $500 a month, WyoFile reports. Black Hills Corp. said in a filing with the Wyoming Public Service Commission that the measure passed by the Legislature in 2020 could cost it as much as $1 billion per coal unit, according to the news outlet.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/14/bear-crop-circles-corpse-blood-subway-cameras-news-around-states/118819930/", "title": "Bear crop circles, corpse blood: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: A lawsuit has been filed that could decide the fate of a Confederate monument that has stood in a square at the center of a nearly all-Black city for 115 years. WSFA-TV reports the Macon County Commission has filed suit against both the local and state chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, arguing that the county owns the property where the statue is located and wants title to the plot. While records show the county gave the land to the Confederate heritage group for use as a park for white people in 1906, the suit contends the property belongs to the county because the county’s action was illegal. Macon County, which was joined in the suit by three Black residents, said it is willing to negotiate with the Daughters of the Confederacy. If someone comes forward, they could settle and give the statue to the group. The statue has been the subject of periodic demonstrations for decades in Tuskegee, which is almost all Black and the home of Tuskegee University. The nation’s first Black military pilots trained in the city during World War II. Protesters tried and failed to pull down the monument in the 1960s. In July, City Council member Johnny Ford and another man used an electric saw to cut into the statue, but the damage was later repaired by a crew hired by the United Daughters of the Confederacy.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawmaker requested and has received an excusal from the state Senate until mid-January, citing the challenges of traveling to Juneau from Anchorage after she was suspended from flying on Alaska Airlines earlier this year. Republican Sen. Lora Reinbold on Thursday requested the excusal from Saturday through Jan. 15. She said she was unaware of any other airline flying to the state capital during that period. Juneau is accessible by air or water, including via the state-run ferry system. Lawmakers are in their third special session of the year, due to end Tuesday. The Legislature has yet to finalize a dividend amount to pay residents this year. Alaska Airlines said in an April statement that Reinbold was not allowed to fly with the carrier “for her continued refusal to comply with employee instruction regarding the current mask policy.” Reinbold – has been critical of masking rules, including at the Capitol – said she had been in compliance and called the ban political. She said the ferry schedule is limited, and she doesn’t want to hold up legislative proceedings if she cannot reach Juneau “in a timely fashion.” After her suspension, Reinbold drove through part of Canada and took a ferry to reach the capital, a two-day trip. If there is another special session, she said it should be held in a community connected to Alaska’s main road system.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State auditors say public safety may be put at risk by reporting gaps and a backlog in the database that Arizona uses for conducting background checks of people seeking certain jobs or occupational licenses and for helping prosecutors and judges decide whether defendants should get plea bargains or lenient sentences. The problems exist in the state’s central depository of criminal history records, a database maintained by the Arizona Department of Public Safety and updated with case reports from law enforcement agencies and courts, the Auditor General’s Office said in a report released Friday. The auditors said the database didn’t include 17% of a sampling of 103 felony offense records from four Arizona law enforcement agencies, and 40% of a sampling of 30 felony offense records in the database were missing dispositions, such as whether a case was dropped or the defendant was convicted. The database is important because criminal justice agencies use it “when making decisions that could help deter further offenses, such as decisions regarding plea bargains, and sentencing repeat offenders,” and the records also are checked to see whether people seeking jobs in fields such as teaching and child care have criminal histories, the auditors’ report said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A former state senator said Monday that he would run for the Republican nomination for secretary of state, becoming the second to challenge the incumbent in next year’s GOP primary. Former Arkansas Sen. Eddie Joe Williams announced his bid for the seat currently held by Republican Secretary of State John Thurston, who was first elected in 2018. Thurston already faced a primary challenge from state Rep. Mark Lowery. Joshua Price, a former Pulaski County election commissioner, is the only Democrat running for the seat. Williams said he was running to “make sure our elections are fair, honest, and always transparent.” The former Cabot mayor was elected to the state Senate in 2010 and was the chamber’s first Republican majority leader after the GOP won a Senate majority in 2012. Williams left the Legislature after former President Donald Trump appointed him in 2017 to be the federal representative to the Southern States Energy Board. The nonprofit organization focuses on energy issues in 16 Southern states.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America installed its first openly transgender bishop in a service held in San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral on Saturday. The Rev. Megan Rohrer will lead one of the church’s 65 synods, overseeing nearly 200 congregations in Northern California and northern Nevada. “My call is … to be up to the same messy, loving things I was up to before,” Rohrer told worshippers. “But mostly, if you’ll let me, and I think you will, my hope is to love you and, beyond that, to love what you love.” Rohrer was elected in May to serve a six-year term as bishop of the Sierra Pacific Synod. “I step into this role because a diverse community of Lutherans in Northern California and Nevada prayerfully and thoughtfully voted to do a historic thing,” Rohrer said in a statement. “My installation will celebrate all that is possible when we trust God to shepherd us forward.” Rohrer, who uses the pronoun “they,” previously served as pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in San Francisco and a chaplain coordinator for the city’s police department and also helped minister to the city’s homeless and LGTBQ community. Rohrer, married with two children, became one of seven LGBTQ pastors accepted by the progressive Evangelical Lutheran church in 2010. The church is one of the largest Christian denominations in the U.S.\n\nColorado\n\nBrighton: A man convicted of vehicular homicide for hitting a car during a Facebook livestream that showed him speeding on a highway has been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Adams County District Attorney’s Office said 44-year-old Bryan Kirby was sentenced Friday. A jury convicted Kirby of the vehicular homicide charge in July, as well as of reckless manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident causing death. Kirby was accused of driving as fast as 167 mph at night on a highway near Denver in October 2018 while making comments to viewers about his speed. At the end, he rapidly crossed from the left lane to the right and crashed into a sedan from behind at 120 mph, prosecutors said. Kirby fled the crash. The driver of the sedan died at the scene. “Mr. Kirby’s unconscionable and reckless actions took a life and destroyed a family,” District Attorney Brian Mason said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: About 300 refugees from Afghanistan are expected to arrive in the state in the coming weeks and months as immigrant advocacy groups work to find permanent homes for them, U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal and advocates said Monday. Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, and resettlement workers anticipate that refugees will begin arriving in large numbers in communities across the U.S., perhaps as early as next week, after clearing security checks and other vetting. Some 50,000 Afghans are expected to be admitted to the United States under a program called “Operation Allies Welcome,” including translators, drivers and others who helped the U.S. military during the 20-year war and who fear reprisals by the Taliban, who seized power last month. “We owe these Afghan allies the safety and escape they need from murder and torture they face and their families face in Afghanistan,” Blumenthal said at a news conference with advocates in New Haven. “They sided with us. They went into combat with our troops. They protected them and our diplomats. They now have targets on their backs.” Blumenthal said he is pushing Congress to approve financial aid for resettlement services, including housing, job placement, clothing and other needs. He said the cost could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: Three teenagers were hospitalized with injuries incurred at Funland on the the city’s boardwalk Sunday night, according to Sussex County Emergency Medical Services. Two patients were stable and sent to Beebe Healthcare, and one was taken to Christiana Hospital with a head injury, said Glenn Marshall, public information officer for Sussex County EMS. Rehoboth Beach Police Department later reported that the injured were two girls, 14 and 15 years old, and one 16-year-old boy. The two girls were released from Beebe, but Rehoboth Beach police said the boy was still in serious condition at Christiana as of 3 p.m. Monday. The incident happened in the area of the Superflip 360 about 7:45 p.m., according to a statement from Funland Personnel Manager Chris Darr. The injured guest was not riding the attraction, he said. “Initial efforts have determined that the injuries result from the individuals be struck by debris caused by an air storage tank failure,” a Rehoboth Beach police press release said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Foo Fighters’ performance at the 9:30 Club last week came with breaking news: Frontman Dave Grohl told the crowd that an exact replica of the original version of the venue is in the works, WUSA-TV reports. The special surprise show, part of a reopening week celebration at the 9:30 Club, was one of its first in-person shows since the coronavirus pandemic began. Grohl, who grew up in northern Virginia, played some of his earliest shows as a teenager in punk bands at the 9:30 Club. But that was the old 9:30 Club, he said Thursday, reminiscing about the old days and describing its 199-person capacity as intimate. “That was our church,” Grohl said in a video provided by I.M.P., which owns the venue. “That’s where we all played first. That’s where R.E.M. played first; that’s where the Chili Peppers played first; that’s where Nirvana played first ... magic happened in that room.” Grohl said an exact replica of the old club will be coming to 2047 9th Street NW, where The Satellite Room used to be. “For all you people who never got to see the old 9:30 Club, you’ll get to see that ... next door someday,” Grohl said on stage. “And let me tell you, if it’s the same vibe as the old 9:30 Club, you’ll see some real magic.”\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A Miami Beach apartment building owned by the mayor of the adjacent town where a condominium collapsed in June has given his tenants 45 days to vacate the building so extensive repairs can be completed. The lease termination letter from Surfside Mayor Charles Burkett said workers have been waiting for the city of Miami Beach to issue permits to repair the damage caused by Hurricane Irma in 2017. He said he hopes the final permit will be issued imminently so work can be completed to the front of the building as well as the elevator. “We regret that this work will create potentially dangerous conditions for residents,” Burkett’s letter said. In addition, he said the Lois Apartments will also undergo the required 40-year inspection early, due to the Champlain Towers South collapse. That building was in the midst of repairs found during a 40-year inspection when it suddenly collapsed in the middle of the night, drawing new scrutiny of the structural integrity of buildings throughout the region. Burkett informed tenants they will need to leave by Oct. 24 but can return once renovations are completed in several months. Meanwhile, in court Friday, a judge was told that many personal belongings such as jewelry and photos cannot be recovered from the Champlain Towers collapse. “A vast majority of the personal property is completely destroyed,” said Michael Goldberg, an attorney appointed as receiver to handle the Champlain Towers’ finances. Many of the 17 safes found at the site, he said, “are cracked open like an egg.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nDunwoody: An explosion rocked an apartment building in suburban Atlanta on Sunday, causing the three-story structure to partially collapse and leaving four people with minor injuries, authorities said. The cause of the explosion was unknown, but a local utility had received a call from a resident about a strong odor of gas shortly before the midday blast, according to DeKalb County Fire and Rescue Deputy Fire Chief Melvin Carter. He said 90% of the building had been searched, and officials were in the process of shoring up the rest of the complex so rescuers could continue searching for anyone who might be trapped. Fire Capt. Jaeson Daniels had said two people were unaccounted for and may have been in one of three apartments that had completely collapsed. Rescuers hadn’t been able to enter those apartments due to instability of the overall structure. But WSB-TV reports, citing DeKalb fire officials, that the two people were eventually found safe. A helicopter and drones circled above the structure as the local Red Cross began canvassing residents to see who might need help finding accommodations. The partially collapsed building and several others nearby were evacuated. Residents were told that Monday was the earliest they could return to their homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge has given preliminary approval to a settlement in a lawsuit by inmates who allege state officials mishandled the pandemic and failed to protect them from COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons and jails. In a ruling Thursday, U.S. District Judge Jill Otake said the settlement between the state and the inmates is “fair, adequate, and reasonable.” Both sides agreed to the settlement, which establishes a five-person panel to oversee public health in correctional facilities and other measures to improve sanitation, hygiene and medical monitoring. The settlement also directs officials to make vaccines available and to “promote and educate inmates and staff regarding COVID-19 vaccination.” The class-action lawsuit was meant to provide resources to improve safety during the pandemic, said Eric Seitz, an attorney for the inmates. He said Friday that he’ll pursue damages in separate, future legal action. Situations described in court documents included ailing detainees kept near a bathroom flooded with urine and feces. Their requests to use the bathroom were frequently denied, forcing them to urinate in their drinking cups, according to the documents. Other descriptions the judge noted include an inmate with lupus who contracted the coronavirus but received little to no medical care and ended up with serious kidney damage.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: More than 1,000 protesters gathered in the city Monday morning during a visit by President Joe Biden to express their displeasure about his coronavirus plan, the election and other issues. Biden came to Boise as part of a swing through three Western states to promote his administration’s use of a wartime law to aid in wildfire preparedness, survey wildfire damage and push his economic agenda. He arrived at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise late Monday morning to meet with fire officials and Gov. Brad Little, a Republican. Lisa Mitchell, 65, of Middleton, Idaho, said she was protesting because she doesn’t believe the 2020 election was valid. “I’m here to support Trump and stand for freedom,” said Mitchell, who was wearing a “Trump won 2020” sticker. “He is in there illegally.” Though some of former President Donald Trump’s most fervent supporters believe his continued claims that the presidential election was stolen, there is no evidence of widespread fraud, and Republican and Democratic election officials certified the election as valid. Courts have also repeatedly rejected lawsuits claiming the election was tainted. About a half-dozen Boise police officers were stationed at the entrance to the National Interagency Fire Center, with other law enforcement officers patrolling the area on motorcycle.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The Chicago Park District said it plans to put life rings along the Lake Michigan waterfront – but only in areas that are considered safe to swim, upsetting the mother of a college student who drowned off a pier. “I’m infuriated,“ said Maria Diaz, whose son, Miguel Cisneros, drowned last month in the Rogers Park neighborhood. “Don’t they have kids; aren’t they mothers, fathers? And how would they feel if (it were) their son?” Diaz said. “Because, believe me, you never think about this until it hits home. And it can happen to anyone.” Cisneros, 19, drowned Aug. 22, a few weeks before his planned departure for Columbia University in New York. A vigil for him was held Tuesday night. Rogers Park residents have put life rings on the pier near where Cisneros died, but they have been removed by the park district, the Chicago Tribune reports. Instead, the district is discussing ways to restrict access to the piers while installing life rings elsewhere where it’s “safe to swim,” general counsel Timothy King said. At a Wednesday meeting, a law professor said the park district could be exposing itself to liability if life rings are placed in other locations. Water safety specialist Gerry Dworkin said the rings can be hard to throw accurately from a beach, though they can be effective if dropped to a struggling swimmer near a pier.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: About 300 Purdue University students and employees face disciplinary action for failing to comply with the school’s mandatory coronavirus testing for those who haven’t provided proof of COVID-19 vaccination. That includes 84 students on the West Lafayette campus who have been notified a second time that they haven’t completed required surveillance testing three weeks into the fall semester, Purdue officials said. A third violation could result in suspension from the university as soon as this week. About 210 employees have received an initial written warning for not being tested. Those employees face disciplinary action up to and including termination. Purdue is requiring surveillance testing, which could be as frequently as each week, for any students or employees who’ve not submitted documentation of their COVID-19 shots. About 82% of the some 55,000 students and employees on the West Lafayette campus have submitted vaccination proof, according to the university’s tracking. Indiana University has mandated that all students and employees receive COVID-19 vaccinations unless they are granted exemptions or face dismissal from classes or their jobs. The latest figures released by IU show 88% compliance, but school officials haven’t yet released any information about disciplinary actions.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Polk County will purchase Sleepy Hollow Sports Park, county officials and the park’s longtime owners announced in a news release over the weekend. The 76-acre facility opened in 1994 on Des Moines’ east side. Sleepy Hollow is a central Iowa favorite for tubing and sledding in the winter and for Renaissance fairs, festivals, comedy shows and concerts in the summer. Each fall, Sleepy Hollow’s Renaissance Faire Park turns into a Halloween attraction, and the surrounding forest becomes a haunted trail. Taylor Swift once even performed there early in her career. Rick and Mary Flatt will continue to run all operations through the end of 2022. In 2023, Polk County Conservation will operate the winter sports facility. The Flatts will run camping operations and special events, including the Kosmic Kingdom music festival, the Renaissance Faires and the Scream Park. Polk County will run all operations beginning in 2024. With the announcement, the county pledged to raise millions of dollars to fund improvements at the park, including a full-service campground, ski lodge improvements, new cross-country and snowshoe trails, enhanced fishery options, and a conversion of an existing pond to an ice skating rink in the winter.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Kansas State Fair officials judging the 4-H entomology entries last week discovered an invasive insect that prompted quarantines elsewhere. Fair Board member Gregg Hadley the student who caught the spotted lanternfly didn’t know it had prompted quarantines in at least 45 counties in Pennsylvania and New Jersey to try to stop its spread. Hadley, who is director for extension at Kansas State’s Research and Extension, said it’s not clear how the invasive bug made it to Kansas, but it may have hitched a ride on a camper. The insect that was first found in Pennsylvania about 10 years ago feeds on some 70 different plant species and can cause plants to die by depositing excretions on them that can grow mold and block photosynthesis. One of the fair’s entomology judges was familiar with the insect and a requirement that it be reported to the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Federal officials are expected to try to learn how the insect reached Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFort Wright: The city plans to return artifacts on loan after closing the James A. Ramage Civil War Museum forever. The City Council unanimously passed a municipal order Sept. 1 to dissolve the museum’s volunteer board, close the museum and confirm Mayor Dave Hatter’s prior order of closure. The Behringer-Crawford Museum, which focuses on Northern Kentucky history, has been called in by the city to help with what to do with all the artifacts, including Sons of the Union Veterans medals. The closed museum, in a house at Battery Hooper, was named for a retired Northern Kentucky University history professor who led efforts to preserve the key Civil War defensive position. The museum helped tell the story of one of the first Black brigades in the Civil War and the defense of Cincinnati. “We just want to make sure everyone gets the artifacts back if they want them,” said Laurie Risch, executive director of the Behringer-Crawford. Jeannine Kreinbrink, an archaeologist for the Behringer-Crawford and a former James A. Ramage Civil War Museum board member, will be assisting with the review of artifacts, Risch said. “We’re just happy to be able to help,” Risch said. “Nobody is happy to see a museum closed.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The head of the Louisiana State Police says he wants to know why 67% of his agency’s uses of force in recent years have been directed at Black people and would welcome a U.S. Justice Department “pattern and practice” probe into potential racial profiling if that is deemed necessary. “If the community is concerned about that, obviously I am concerned about that,” Col. Lamar Davis said in an interview Friday. “I’m a Black male. I don’t want to feel like I’m going to be stopped and thrown across a car just because of that, and I don’t want anyone else to feel that way.” Davis’ comments came a day after an Associated Press investigation identified at least a dozen cases over the past decade in which state police troopers or their bosses ignored or concealed evidence of beatings, deflected blame and impeded efforts to root out misconduct. It included several newly obtained body camera videos of violent arrests that had been locked away for years. “It challenged me emotionally, not just from a law enforcement perspective but as a citizen,” Davis said of viewing the footage. “But I have to put my emotions in check and understand what my duties are. I don’t want the community thinking we’re going to ‘get them.’ Those are the types of things I’m trying to get to the root of.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Two companies that manufacture coronavirus testing supplies in the state say they’re ready to step up to meet demand following President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine and testing mandates for companies with more than 100 workers. Puritan Medical Products makes swabs used for testing, and Abbott Laboratories makes test kits in Maine. Both furloughed or laid off workers before the surge in virus cases tied to the delta variant. “We are monitoring the situation, and are ready to ramp up based on government orders as we did before,” Puritan said in a statement. Abbott spokeswoman Kim Modory told the Portland Press Herald that the company’s Maine workforce “continues to deliver millions of rapid tests at a time when our country needs testing, particularly rapid testing, to manage this next phase of the pandemic.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Cruise ship passengers left the city’s port for the first time in 18 months Sunday, a celebratory moment after putting in place plenty of COVID-19 safety precautions for guests. As a steel drummer played in the port terminal, the Carnival Pride welcomed 1,500 passengers for a weeklong voyage to the Bahamas, The Baltimore Sun reports. All passengers had to be fully vaccinated, with some exceptions for children under 12 and people with documented medical conditions. Those unvaccinated equal less than 5% of the passenger total, Carnival Cruise Line President Christine Duffy said. All passengers also had to get a negative coronavirus test within three days of boarding, and guests 2 and up must wear face masks in elevators and certain indoor areas. While passenger Donna Ford, 60, of Pittsburgh, wasn’t thrilled with the mask mandate, she was still happy to sail: “I don’t like it, but if that’s what it takes for me to cruise, then I’m OK with it.” The Pride, operating at 70% capacity, is Carnival’s ninth ship to welcome passengers back since the pandemic halted cruise operations in March 2020, Duffy said. Port preparations were extensive, port Executive Director William P. Doyle said. Port officials also contracted with a transportation firm in case sick passengers must be removed from the ship during the trip.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDanvers: A tourist farm called police on a Black couple it accused of stealing six apples and is now apologizing after the family went public in a blog post. Manikka Bowman and Jeff Myers said in the post that they visited Connors Farm in Danvers on Labor Day, spending more than $100 on admission, apple picking, food and drinks. But the couple from Cambridge said they were confronted by farm staff over six apples that did not fit into the prepaid apple-picking bag. They said the overflow fruits were in their child’s stroller, and they intended to pay for them at the farm store, where they also planned to buy cider donuts. Bowman, who is a vice chair of her city’s school committee, said a security guard instead searched her purse, and the manager called police when the couple demanded the farm owner’s contact information. The responding officer, the couple said, accused them of “playing the race card.” “By jumping straight to an assumption of theft, Connors Farm created a scene, harassing us and causing our 7-year-old to burst into tears, anguish that lasted well into the evening,” the couple wrote. “We are left wondering, was it ever about the apples?” The farm, in a Facebook post Thursday, said it apologized to the family and will ensure staffers “undergo diversity, equity and inclusion training.”\n\nMichigan\n\nBenton Harbor: Advocacy groups are urging the Biden administration to help provide safe drinking water in a low-income, predominantly Black city in southwestern Michigan where tests repeatedly have shown excessive lead levels in the water supply. In a petition filed Thursday with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, about 20 organizations said local and state officials have not responded adequately or quickly enough since the contamination was discovered three years ago in Benton Harbor. “It’s urgent that the EPA intervene to give this community access to water that won’t harm our health, especially our children’s health,” said the Rev. Edward Pinkney, president of the Benton Harbor Community Water Council. EPA spokesman Tim Carroll said Friday that the agency was “carefully considering the issues and concerns” raised in the petition. “We are closely monitoring lead-related health issues in Benton Harbor,” Carroll said, adding that the city was among 10 communities that participated in discussions with the EPA as it reviews changes to federal lead and copper regulations made by the Trump administration. The petition was filed one day after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer called for spending $20 million in Benton Harbor to replace nearly 6,000 service lines – most suspected of containing lead – within five years.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Black bear sightings are on the rise, as this summer’s drought has made it harder for the animals to find the food they need to prepare for hibernation. This time of year, Minnesota’s black bears are trying to eat as many as 10,000 to 15,000 calories a day. They start to feed nocturnally and for longer periods of time on nutrition-rich acorns, hazelnuts and berries – food sources that are harder to find because of the drought. Bears are now increasingly seeking out backyard bird feeders and other food sources. “There have been a lot of anecdotal reports of bears all over the place this year,” Andy Tri, acting bear project leader with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, told Minnesota Public Radio News. The state’s bear population has remained stable for nearly a decade at between 12,000 and 15,000 statewide, Tri said. However, their range is expanding, especially into the northern Twin Cities suburbs, he said. “So people who grew up there and didn’t grow up seeing bears are now seeing bears regularly,” Tri said. He said while it’s important to be respectful of bears, there’s no need to be afraid. He advises making sure the bear has a clear path to leave the yard, then watching it from inside the house: “Just take a moment to appreciate it. And then just make sure to give bears their space because they’re wild animals.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Six Black farmworkers say in a lawsuit that their former employer brought white laborers from South Africa to do the same jobs they were doing and that the farm has been violating federal law by paying the white immigrants more for the same type of work. Mississippi Center for Justice and Southern Migrant Legal Services filed the federal lawsuit last week on behalf of the six workers against Pitts Farm Partnership, which grows cotton, soybeans and corn in the Mississippi Delta’s Sunflower County. The lawsuit said the farm violated regulations of a foreign worker visa program, which requires equal treatment of U.S. workers and their immigrant counterparts. It seeks an unspecified amount in damages, including money the U.S. workers say they were shorted because of the uneven pay scale. Four of the plaintiffs – Andrew Johnson, Wesley Reed, Gregory Strong and Richard Strong – said they did agricultural work from February through November, and Pitts Farm Partnership usually paid them the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, with $8.25 an hour for weekend work. Two had been paid $9 an hour since 2018. The farm paid the white workers from South Africa $9.87 an hour in 2014, and that rate increased most years until it reached $11.83 an hour in 2020, the lawsuit said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A member of Washington University’s student government placed nearly 3,000 U.S. flags meant to commemorate victims of the Sept. 11 attacks in trash bags, prompting an investigation by the school. The university’s chapter of College Republicans had placed the 2,977 flags on Mudd Field at the school’s campus in St. Louis to honor Saturday’s 20th anniversary of the attacks. Fadel Alkilani, a vice president of finance for the Student Union, acknowledged he removed the flags Saturday and put them in plastic bags as part of a protest but was interrupted when another student began recording video of him. After a video was posted on social media, Alkilani said in a statement that he intended to leave the bags on Mudd Field along with statistics detailing the human cost of Sept. 11 since the attacks. He said the flag display did not mention Islamophobia in the U.S. or civilian casualties in the Middle East caused by the U.S. military, The Kansas City Star reports. Washington University Chancellor Andrew Martin said in a statement that removing the flags was “reprehensible” and was seen as “a personal affront by many, at WashU and beyond, and as an affront to the ideals of our institution.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Montana Youth Action, Forward Montana Foundation and Montana Public Interest Research Group are suing Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen over state laws they say reduce youth voter turnout. Plaintiffs are challenging Senate Bill 169, which changes voter identification requirements and limits the use of a student ID; House Bill 506, which prohibits ballot distribution to people who will but do not yet meet age and residency requirements; and House Bill 176, which eliminates Election Day voter registration. The complaint was filed in Yellowstone County’s 13th Judicial District Court. “Each of these laws unconstitutionally burdens Montanans’ fundamental right to vote, both subverting the will of Montana voters and upending norms that Montana covers have come to rely on – for no reason, let alone a compelling one,” plaintiffs allege in their complaint. “None of these laws accomplish a compelling state interest and each violates the Montana Constitution.” The Montana Secretary of State’s office released the following response: “The voters of Montana spoke when they elected a Secretary of State that promised improved election integrity with voter ID and voter-registration deadlines, and we will work hard to defend those measures.”\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Four students are suing Creighton University over its requirement to get vaccinated against COVID-19 to remain enrolled, arguing that some of them “feel coerced” to violate their religious beliefs against abortion. The lawsuit filed in Douglas County District Court also alleges that some of the four students have medical conditions that make vaccines not recommended for them. The university in Omaha is affiliated with the Jesuit order of the Catholic Church. It mandated that all students get vaccinated in August, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to a vaccine mandated by Pfizer, according to local news reports. The university had previously allowed medical exemptions to its vaccine requirements but not religious ones. The lawsuit says all four students have “religious objections” to COVID-19 vaccines because “the vaccines were developed and/or tested using abortion derived fetal cell lines.” Attorney Robert Sullivan said in a statement that a Catholic university should not place students in the position of having to violate the church’s teachings. The Vatican declared in December that it is “morally acceptable” for Roman Catholics to receive COVID-19 vaccines based on research that used cells derived from aborted fetuses.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: An analysis of K-12 proficiency exams and state financial reports found Nevada’s students are doing worse on most tests than they did in 2000, when the state spent 79% less on each pupil. Meanwhile, the state continues to land on the wrong end of several nationwide school system rankings, including state-by-state comparisons of per-pupil spending and student-teacher ratios. As recently as 2019, Nevada ranked dead last in at least one test-based survey of K-12 academic achievement. Critics have raised plenty of pointed questions about exactly what such exams measure and how much they really say about the Silver State’s pupils. Yet most politicians and education advocates agree test scores are going to continue to play a key role in shaping, among other things, classroom curriculums, teacher performance evaluations and federal funding opportunities. Annual results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, also known as the Nation’s Report Card, show Nevada’s elementary and middle students have made modest gains in writing and math proficiency over the past two decades. But student performance on three other, better known tests – the SAT, ACT and state-administered SBAC – has trended, sometimes dramatically, in the opposite direction.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: The University of New Hampshire has been awarded a $1.8 million grant to study how and why coastal hazards like excessive flooding are causing roads to crack and crumble. “We’re trying to better understand the causal links of not only the extreme events but also the gradual changes in sea level rise that can increase the rate of damage to pavement and trigger failures that require major road reconstruction,” Jo Sias, professor of civil and environmental engineering, said in a news release. “We’re looking at storm surges and wave action but also factors like the amount of time the pavement is under water.” UNH researchers and their partners at the University of South Alabama and the Rockingham Planning Commission will develop a number of hydrodynamic models that can analyze fluids in motion. The information will be valuable to state and town officials to assess the impact of sea level rise on the longevity of coastal roadways and help implement practical alternatives for communities to protect the infrastructure. The study will focus on the northeast coast of New Hampshire and the southeast coast of Alabama.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHerald: Farmers say they’re fed up with nuisance wildlife and the crop circle-esque damage bears are dealing to their fields. Phil Brodhecker said bears are literally eating his profits, as they tend to roll around and flatten plants when they partake of his corn. The damage in some of his fields adds up to 80% to 90%, Brodhecker said. In others, it’s only about 2% to 5%, but there is damage “in every field.” The situation will only get worse for him and other farmers due to New Jersey’s policy not to have an authorized bear hunting season this year, Brodhecker said. The hunt will be skipped because there is no Comprehensive Black Bear Management Policy in effect, which is required for one to proceed. But the bears aren’t the only ones causing damage, Brodhecker said. The deer are also in on it. The bears leave behind their signature “crop circles,” while the deer “graze” through most fields, munching on blossoms and buds beginning in the spring. Shoulder-high weeds have taken over where sunflowers were stunted by deer biting off buds. The Brodhecker family was one of the first commercial sunflower seed operations in New Jersey, producing birdseed packages for the state Audubon Society. “We have too many bears and deer,” he said following a tour of his Hampton farmland, showing the damage caused.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: As the United States battles COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, a new study co-authored by a New Mexico State University researcher examines how COVID-19 infections in social circles may influence vaccine willingness. In the study, Jagdish Khubchandani, public health sciences professor at NMSU, and a team of researchers conducted a national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine willingness among American adults based on coronavirus infections, hospitalizations and deaths within their friend and family groups. “Education, race and political ideology are the major factors, and we need more efforts to reach sections of our society that remain hesitant about the vaccines,” said Khubchandani, who has conducted multiple studies on the topic since late 2020. The study, published last week in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, included 1,602 participants,about 79% of whom reported receiving at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The remaining participants indicated they planned to get the vaccine (10%) or would not (11%). Overall, participants who did not have a friend or family member infected, hospitalized or die with COVID-19 were at least two times more likely to refuse vaccines, compared to those who had someone in their social networks affected by the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: All of the city’s 472 subway stations are now equipped with security cameras. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced Monday that it had installed the last of thousands of cameras at the G line’s Broadway stop. The installation of the cameras has been accelerated over the past year after crime spiked in the subway system during the pandemic, when ridership dropped. Two hundred stations have been outfitted with cameras in the past year, according to the MTA. Subway ridership fell more than 90% during the height of the pandemic and continues to lag far below pre-pandemic levels. An MTA survey in the spring found that crime and harassment were as big a concern as COVID-19 for riders weighing whether to return to the subways, despite the presence of hundreds of additional city police officers deployed to stations. While crime has continued to be an issue, the MTA said the increased number of cameras has helped increase arrests recently by more than 28%. Some of the cameras broadcast in real time to the subway’s security center, while others record locally and can provide footage that can be used in criminal investigations, according to the MTA.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Certain felons who’ve been released from prison or were never incarcerated and who registered to vote recently in North Carolina will remain eligible as litigation over their right to vote continues, the state’s highest court has ruled. The state Supreme Court, in a lawsuit challenging when North Carolina residents convicted of felonies have their voting rights restored, essentially declined to reinstate a order last month that declared any offender no longer behind bars could register. That order would have affected about 56,000 people who were still serving probation, parole or other supervision, according to court records. On Sept. 3, the state Court of Appeals blocked last month’s trial order amid pending litigation filed by civil rights groups and ex-offenders challenging state law on the restoration of voting rights. Those plaintiffs immediately appealed to the Supreme Court, which late Friday declined to block the Court of Appeals order but also declared it would be implemented only going forward. That means felony offenders who registered between Aug. 23 and Sept. 3 – when the trial judges’ order was in place and based solely on that order – can’t be removed from voting rolls and “are legally registered voters” until told otherwise, the Supreme Court wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Authorities said one person was injured in an explosion during a fireworks display in southeast Bismarck at midday Saturday. It created a dense cloud of black smoke that could be seen throughout the city. Bismarck Rural Fire Chief Dustin Theurer said fireworks or an explosive ordnance was the “likely” cause of the explosion. Authorities didn’t immediately offer other details on what happened or where exactly the incident occurred, saying the investigation was ongoing. Firefighters, police and medical professionals responded to the scene shortly before 11:30 a.m., The Bismarck Tribune reports. Roads in the area were closed, and the public was asked to stay away. One person was taken to a hospital with undisclosed injuries, according to the Bismarck Rural Fire Department. The explosion could be heard around the city, and some people reported that it rattled doors. Joshua Watts, who happened to be in the area, said he witnessed more than one blast. “There was an explosion and then another explosion,” he said. “The first one went off … and I actually saw the fireworks blow up.” The explosions touched off grass fires in the area. No buildings were damaged, Theurer said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A second federal lawsuit filed against six local hospital groups, alleging they conspired against their employees by requiring COVID-19 vaccines, has been voluntarily dismissed. It’s the second time the antitrust lawsuit has been filed and then voluntarily dismissed. Among the allegations was that the hospital groups – Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, the Christ Hospital Health Network, Bon Secours Mercy Health, TriHealth, UC Health and St. Elizabeth Healthcare – are requiring employees to be vaccinated even though, according to the lawsuit, there is no increasing spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus. “The plan was simple,” the lawsuit said. “If the six large systems stuck together, all the employees would be trapped.” The pandemic and the vaccines created to battle it, the lawsuit alleged, are part of a fraud perpetrated by “government, pharmaceutical (companies), social media, mainstream media, corporate America, healthcare and political parties.” According to data from the Health Collaborative, which tracks daily bed counts at more than 40 hospitals, the number of COVID-19 patients in the region’s hospital and intensive care beds remains on an upward trajectory. The number of COVID-19 patients is at its highest point since January and February.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board on Monday recommended the governor commute the death sentence of Julius Jones, who has maintained his innocence in a 1999 killing that has garnered national attention. The five-member board voted 3-1 to recommend Jones’ sentence be commuted to life in prison after board member Scott Williams recused himself because of a professional relationship he had with one of the attorneys who spoke on Jones’ behalf. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt ultimately will decide the fate of Jones, who claims he was framed for the 1999 shooting death of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. “Personally, I believe in death penalty cases there should be no doubts. And put simply, I have doubts about this case,” said Chairman Adam Luck, one of Stitt’s appointees on the board who voted to commute Jones’ sentence. Monday’s vote came after several hours of testimony from members of Howell’s family, prosecutors who tried the case, and attorneys and supporters of Jones. Kelly Doyle, another Stitt appointee who voted in favor of commuting the sentence, said she agreed with Luck and noted there were mitigating factors she considered, including the fact that Jones, now 41, was 19 when Howell was killed during a carjacking. A spokeswoman said Stitt plans to review the recommendation carefully.\n\nOregon\n\nYachats: A man who attempted to jump across a wide cove of frothing water at Cape Perpetua Scenic Area is presumed dead, according to state police. Steve Allen, 67, of Walnut Creek, California, apparently tried to hurdle Devil’s Churn, a narrow boiling inlet just off Highway 101 south of Yachats on the central Oregon coast. Devil’s Churn, a popular stopping point at Cape Perpetua, is a somewhat narrow slice in the coastal basalt rock known for boiling water that kicks up large sprays of waves. “Troopers and emergency personnel responded for a subject who had fallen into the ocean at Devils Churn,” Oregon State Police said in a news release. “Fellow visitors attempted to rescue Allen but were unable to retrieve him from the water.” Allen was last observed by rescue agencies unresponsive prior to losing sight of him, officials said. The U.S. Coast Guard and other responding agencies suspended their search at approximately 6:40 p.m. Allen is presumed to be dead, officials said. OSP was assisted by Lincoln county Sheriff’s Office, Newport Fire Department, Yachats Fire and Rescue and the Coast Guard.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The union that represents corrections officers in Pennsylvania prisons wants a state court to intervene over the governor’s recent mandate that they all get COVID-19 vaccines or submit to weekly coronavirus testing. The six-page Commonwealth Court complaint over a rule Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf announced last month requests that the court issue a preliminary injunction to end mandatory testing unless inmates, visitors and outside vendors are also subject to the requirement. “The entry of a preliminary injunction is necessary in order to maintain the equity” between members of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association “and all other participants in the commonwealth controlled congregate settings, and to further ensure the intent of the order itself,” which is to protect the public from COVID-19, according to the lawsuit filed Friday. “The commonwealth’s failure to apply the ‘vaccinate or weekly test’ rule to all individuals in the congregate setting unnecessarily increases the risk to the health and safety” of union members, the lawsuit claims. Wolf announced a month ago that about 25,000 employees of Pennsylvania’s prisons and state health care and congregate care facilities would have to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 7 or take weekly tests for the virus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: An estate once famously owned by Claus and Martha von Bulow has sold for $30million. Clarendon Court on Newport’s famed Bellevue Avenue mansion row was sold late Thursday. The buyer’s name wasn’t disclosed. The grand estate on more than 7 acres with sweeping ocean views was built in 1904 by the architect Horace Trumbauer. The sale easily tops the $17.75 million paid by singer Taylor Swift in 2013 for her home in Westerly, which is considered the highest price fetched by a home in the state. Clarendon Court was where heiress Martha “Sunny” von Bulow slipped into a coma in 1980 from which she never woke up. Claus Von Bulow, a Danish-born socialite, was convicted but later acquitted of trying to kill her to gain her fortune so he could live with his soap opera actress mistress. His two trials in Rhode Island in the 1980s drew intense international attention with its high society overtones. The story was the subject of the 1990 movie “Reversal of Fortune” starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close. Sunny died in 2008 in New York City; Claus died in 2019 in London.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A large granite monument honoring 9/11 victims was defaced by vandals who spray-painted “Taliban” on it in two places, authorities said. The granite statue is made of two towers, each weighing 4,000 pounds, with a light beam outside a Greenville County business, WYFF-TV reports. Deputies were called to investigate the vandalism Sunday morning, and the damage was cleaned up later that day, said Paul Nichols, founder and CEO of Upstate Granite Solutions. His granite company constructed the memorial, which is surrounded by 1,000 American flags, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terror attacks on the U.S. “This monument is meant to show the community how much we care and to offer our support to our military and our first responders and let people know there’s still something to believe in in America,” said Kelly Nichols of Upstate Granite Solutions. Nichols said hundreds of people visited the memorial Saturday night.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Badlands National Park will build a new visitor center in the southeast section of the park, the National Park Foundation said Monday. The new facility will be located in the Cedar Pass section of the park, where wind and water have carved towering geological rock formations from the prairie. The center is planned to educate park visitors about the region’s paleontological and geological resources, as well as the culture of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and Lakota people. Nearly 917,000 people visited the park last year, according to the National Park Service. The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust donated $3.3 million for the project. Badlands Natural History Association has also pledged $1.8 million, and the Badlands National Park Conservancy has contributed $100,000. “Badlands National Park’s layered rocks formations and stunning buttes offer visitors a breathtaking glimpse into a scenic landscape that began forming millions of years ago,” Helmsley Charitable Trust Trustee Walter Panzirer said in a statement. “We’re excited to lead the funding effort to construct a new, modern visitor center to highlight the park’s splendor and significance.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Some residents affected by last month’s flooding can apply for emergency food benefits. The Department of Human Services announced that the state will begin accepting applications for “disaster SNAP” benefits for people who live or work in Dickson, Hickman, Houston or Humphreys counties. SNAP refers to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. To qualify, individuals must meet income requirements and can’t already be a current SNAP recipient. Individuals also must have experienced a loss of income due to the storm, damage to a residence or place of employment, or some other unreimbursed disaster-related expense. Applications from Humphreys County will be accepted through Friday. Those in Dickson, Hickman and Houston counties can apply from Sept. 20 to Sept. 24. Applications can be filled out on the department’s website or in person by appointment. The Aug. 21 flooding killed 20 people as it took out houses, roads, cellphone towers and telephone lines.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Several Austin-area funeral home embalmers say it’s common practice to pour human blood from corpses down the drain, a procedure that Austin Water officials admit they were unaware was occurring and one that could compromise the treatment of wastewater entering the Colorado River. Death-related issues are often considered taboo, which might be why Texas Funeral Service Commission Executive Director Glenn Bower said it’s been about 20 years since he was asked how funeral homes in the state dispose of human fluids. He said if a family chooses to embalm a loved one, all the blood and body fluids mixed with embalming liquid that come out of the remains – referred to by embalmers as drainage – go down the common sink. “I can honestly say we measure the volume going in, but we don’t measure the volume coming out,” Bower said. “But that does go down the drain.” Of the solution put into the remains, “about half of that solution, give or take, will come out in the drainage,” he said. Disposing of the medical waste and embalming fluid is not dangerous to the public or to the environment, Bower said, as workers dilute the medical waste with water. Austin Water disagreed, saying in a statement that permits must be acquired to drain blood or embalming fluid into local wastewater systems.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: The Utah Shakespeare Festival is partnering with the Iron County Care and Share on a local food drive, offering discounted tickets for participants, starting this week. The food drive runs Sept. 14 to Oct. 9, and by donating at least six items of non-perishable food, playgoers can get half-price tickets to any show Mondays through Thursdays, according to a release from organizers. The deal is good on the day of the performance only and not for advance sales. The offer is limited to four discounted tickets per person. Food donation barrels will be located outside the Eileen and Allen Anes Studio Theatre, near the ticket office. “It’s important every year to support this shelter, but considering the times we’re in and all of the damage caused by the pandemic, food insecurity has only gotten worse. So the festival is very happy to help where we can,” said Donn Jersey, the director of development and communication. Flooding this year in the Cedar City area has made the food drive’s mission that much more important, organizers said, adding to an increase in need brought on by the financial instability the COVID-19 pandemic has caused.\n\nVermont\n\nThetford: Public meetings will be held this month as a plan to commit the state to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years is drafted. The Global Warming Solutions Act was passed last year despite Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto. The legislation set up a council on climate to analyze ways Vermont can reduce emissions. A virtual meeting to gather feedback from farmers will take place Tuesday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. The climate council is then holding in-person public meetings in Elmore on Sept. 21; East Dorset on Sept. 22; Island Pond on Sept. 23; and Colchester on Sept. 26, the Agency of Natural Resources said. The council is in the early stages of drafting the plan that will be presented to the Legislature on Dec. 1, the Valley News reports. There will be extensive feedback and revisions through January 2022, said Administration Secretary Susanne Young, who is chairwoman of the council. Some of the strategies the panel is considering are recommendations for carbon capture and sequestration on farms; programs to encourage Vermonters to buy electric or low-emission vehicles; promoting compact communities to reduce commute distances; and building on Efficiency Vermont’s work to weatherize more homes, the newspaper reports.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: This year’s menhaden catch so far in the Chesapeake Bay is worrying the state’s top fisheries regulator, but the company harvesting most of the oily fish says it won’t exceed a set quota. Virginia Marine Resources Commissioner Steven Bowman wrote that Omega Protein has already caught 75% of the bay’s quota, the Daily Press of Newport News reports. “This is a troubling development, as recent harvest rates mirror those from 2019 when Omega did exceed the Bay harvest cap by 15,000 metric tons,” Bowman wrote to the Virginia-based company, which operates a fish oil and fishmeal plant in Reedville. Omega spokesman Ben Landry said the company has no intention of breaking the law. In 2019, Virginia had a different quota for the Chesapeake Bay than the one set by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that manages several fish species. Omega’s catch was within the state cap, Landry said. The differing quotas led to a federal order closing the menhaden fishery unless Virginia adopted the Atlantic States commission cap and cut the allowable catch for 2020 to make up for what was caught in 2019, the newspaper reports. Virginia complied, and Omega did not exceed the 2020 cap.\n\nWashington\n\nBlaine: Officials say they’ve destroyed a second nest of Asian giant hornets found in northwestern Washington state this year and are preparing to take down a third. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said in a Facebook post that a team eradicated the nest Saturday in northern Whatcom County, near the town of Blaine along the Canadian border. It said a third nest this season has been located, and planning is underway to eradicate it. The nests have been within a few miles of each other. The first nest this year was destroyed in August. The hornets were first detected in the U.S. in 2019 in Whatcom County. Asian giant hornets are an invasive pest not native to the U.S. They are the world’s largest hornet at 2 inches long and a predator of other insects, including honeybees that pollinate many of the crops in Washington’s agriculture industry. While not particularly aggressive toward humans, their sting is extremely painful, and repeated stings, though rare, can kill. They’re sometimes called murder hornets because they prey on other bees.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: This year’s West Virginia Book Festival is going virtual due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases, officials said. The free event will still be held Oct. 22-23 at the Charleston Coliseum & Convention Center, but events will be hosted online, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. “The health and safety of our guests, volunteers, presenters and sponsors is our top priority, and due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Kanawha County, we felt it was prudent to cancel in-person activities this year,” festival co-chair Sarah Mitchell said in a statement. “Instead, book festival presentations will be streamed live online, so book lovers can still engage with our renowned literary guests.” Some of the authors scheduled to appear include Pulitzer Prize winner Colson Whitehead, best-selling author and West Virginia native Homer Hickam, and children’s author Jon Scieszka.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers sought Monday to join the court fight over Wisconsin’s redistricting process, just as Republicans who control the Legislature have. The first-term governor asked a federal court to let him join a lawsuit over the shape of congressional and legislative districts for the next decade. Where the lines go will help determine which political party has the upper hand in elections. Ten years ago, Republicans controlled all of state government and drew maps that helped them. This time, Republicans won’t have as easy of a time because Evers can veto whatever they draw. If Evers and lawmakers can’t reach a deal, it will likely be left to the courts to decide where the lines go. Anticipating that could happen, voters and groups started filing lawsuits last month asking judges to set a timetable for legislators and Evers to act. Three lawsuits have been filed over the map-drawing process, two in federal court and one in state court. Evers, who is represented by Democratic Attorney General Josh Kaul, on Monday asked to join one of the federal cases. A panel of three judges is hearing both federal cases and is considering combining the two cases it is overseeing. The panel gave GOP lawmakers permission to join one of the cases last month and is considering letting them intervene in the other one.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A man accused of choking his girlfriend has pleaded guilty in Laramie County District Court. Joshua Gene Nunn pleaded guilty to felony strangulation of a household member as part of a plea agreement. He originally pleaded not guilty to the charge, along with one count of misdemeanor domestic battery, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. If a judge follows the agreement at sentencing, Nunn could receive three years of probation, with a suspended sentence of three to five years in prison. Early last Sept. 29, a Cheyenne Police officer responded to a report of a domestic incident. The woman said that, during an argument, she had tried to lock Nunn out of their bedroom, but he broke the door and came in, according to court documents. Nunn got on top of her and choked her by pushing his forearm under her throat. The woman said she couldn’t breathe, and “her head got fuzzy,” and then Nunn punched the left side of her face, according to court documents.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/10/13/penitentiary-tours-air-purifiers-agricultural-fairs-news-around-states/114270122/", "title": "Penitentiary tours, air purifiers: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nOpelika: Two state agencies say they’ve launched an investigation after a dead cat in the city tested positive for the coronavirus. The Thompson Bishop Sparks State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory in Auburn detected the initial positive test, according to a release from the state. Veterinary pathologists found lesions in the cat’s nervous system that usually indicate bacterial infections, suggesting the coronavirus was not the primary cause of death. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the positive diagnosis last week. The Alabama Department of Public Health and the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries are now partnering to investigate the case. Nationwide, fewer than 10 animal deaths are thought to have been COVID-19-related, according to the state. State Public Health Veterinarian Dr. Dee Jones said in a release that so far there seems to be no evidence of companion animals infecting people.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Local public health officials said they are investigating a coronavirus outbreak from a youth hockey tournament that drew teams from around the state. More than 300 players, coaches and fans were in attendance at the Termination Dust Invitational over a three-day period the weekend before last, officials said. Teams came from nine cities across Alaska. Local health officials did not provide specific numbers as to how many people tested positive for the virus as a result of the event, but tournament organizers said they first learned of a positive case on one of the teams last Monday. They also said they knew of two teams with a positive case each. “We are barely several weeks into the fall season and there have been multiple positive cases, in several areas of the State, with players, parents and coaches,” Anna Culley, the hockey association’s coronavirus chairman, said in a Facebook post.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State health officials are reporting 475 new confirmed COVID-19 cases but no additional deaths for the second consecutive day. The latest numbers Monday bring the statewide case total to 226,050 since the coronavirus pandemic began, with the death toll remaining at 5,759. On Saturday, state Department of Health Services officials reported 894 new cases. That was the largest daily increase since Sept. 17-18, when those days’ counts ballooned to 1,753 and 1,281, respectively, as the state changed its counting methodology, and each day added hundreds of past antigen test results. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick. Meanwhile, COVID-19 hospitalizations including ventilator usage and intensive care unit beds remained steady or creeped up very, very slightly.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus in the state hit a record high Sunday of 576. The Arkansas Department of Health said the number of people hospitalized rose by 22. Hospitalizations from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, reached records levels Tuesday through Friday before dropping by six Saturday. The health department on Sunday reported 613 new cases for a total of 92,833 confirmed and probable cases. With 17 more deaths, the number of confirmed and probable deaths in the state so far rose to 1,569. Gov. Asa Hutchinson told CNN on Sunday that he was concerned about the increase in hospitalizations. “Right now, we do have capacity,” Hutchinson said, adding that officials are “watching it very carefully and taking it seriously.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nPalm Springs: The California Department of Public Health has issued new guidelines for small, short group gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic, adding formal rules to possible gray areas. Previously, state health officials said gatherings were not permitted “unless otherwise specified” in sector-specific guidelines. But as of Friday, outdoor private gatherings that last two hours or less are allowed as long as attendees are from no more than three separate households. Still, the department is warning people that the risk of transmission of COVID-19 increases when people from different households mix. “It’s best if individuals don’t gather during the ongoing pandemic, but we recognize some people will choose to get together,” Ali Bay, CDPH deputy director of communications, said in an email. “We want to ensure they are informed on how to minimize risk, such as gathering outside only and keeping events small and short.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Alamosa School District is so short on educators that all it might take is the quarantine of a single class to leave many kids without a teacher, as the district is battling a significant K-12 substitute teacher shortage. Coronavirus fears have chased a large percentage of the sub pool away, Interim Superintendent Marsha Cody said. It’s a problem other districts can sympathize with as the state faces a substitute teacher shortage that also reflects a burgeoning teacher shortage. The pandemic is only making it worse. In Denver Public Schools, the largest district in Colorado, a little more than half of the teachers active in the substitute pool said they were willing to take in-person assignments this fall. Now, districts are scrambling to figure out how to cover teacher absences and where to find more subs. And they’re being forced to get creative. In one district, parents are raising their hands to sub to help prevent a shortage.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Sacred Heart University and the University of Saint Joseph are the latest in the state to use the rapid saliva-based coronavirus test developed at Yale. The schools hope adding the testing method to tests already being conducted will help them identify cases earlier and prevent large outbreaks on campus. Both schools also are using the nasal swab form of testing. “Over the last few weeks as we saw upticks of positive cases on other campuses we decided to increase the percentage of students tested each week and we also wanted more rapid results,” University of Saint Joseph President Rhona Free said in a statement. “SalivaDirect was able to complete the new level of testing that we needed with quick results.” Sacred Heart spokesperson Deb Noack said the 900 saliva tests the university plans to perform each week will augment the 1,300 nasal swab tests that had already been conducted.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge on Friday rejected a request by the League of Women Voters to override state election law and allow absentee and mail-in ballots received after the state-mandated deadline in November’s election to be counted. Delaware law has long required that absentee ballots be received by the time polls close at 8 p.m. on Election Day. The same deadline applies to ballots cast under a universal vote-by-mail law enacted by the General Assembly specifically for this year’s elections because of the coronavirus. The League of Women Voters, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and a Wilmington attorney, did not argue that the deadline as applied in past elections was facially unconstitutional. They claimed instead that the new law is unconstitutional as applied to the November election because, even though it makes voting much easier, voting by mail is a burden for some people.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C.’s coronavirus trend has increased sharply over the past week – up 84% since dropping to its lowest levels since July at the beginning of this month, WUSA-TV reports. The city is now averaging nearly 70 new cases of the coronavirus a day.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: A marine magnet school in South Florida on Monday told students not to show up for in-person classes, just days after Miami-Dade schools reopened to brick-and-mortar classes, after two students reported having the coronavirus. Miami-Dade County Public Schools tweeted that physical classes at Mast Academy had been canceled and that students should report to school online. Mast is a maritime and science technology magnet high school. Schools spokeswoman Daisy Gonzalez-Diego said anyone who came into contact with the two students was being notified using contact tracing protocols. “The school has been thoroughly sanitized,” Gonzalez-Diego said. Florida on Monday reported an additional 1,533 cases, raising the state’s total since March to 736,024. Florida also reported four dozen new deaths Monday, raising the death toll in the state from COVID-19 to 15,599 cases.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state’s top judge signed an order Saturday allowing jury trials to resume in the state. When he declared a statewide judicial emergency in mid-March because of the coronavirus pandemic, Georgia Supreme Court Chief Justice Harold Melton suspended jury trials. The order Saturday extends the emergency for an additional 30 days but lifts the suspension on jury trials, Melton announced in a news release. The new order allows the chief judge of each trial court “to resume jury trials, if that can be done safely and in accordance with a final jury trial plan,” the new order says, according to the release. “From the beginning of this emergency – and even earlier – we have been preparing for this day,” Melton said in the release. “We have put into place rigorous safety protocols for grand jury proceedings and jury trials because we understand that the public must have confidence to come and serve on juries.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A billionaire tech entrepreneur with a home on the Big Island has coordinated a donation of 1 million face masks to slow the spread of the coronavirus there. Salesforce CEO and founder Marc Benioff helped arrange the estimated $1.9 million donation to Hawaii County Civil Defense, West Hawaii Today reports. The donation was made by the University of California at San Francisco, home to the Benioff Center for Microbiome Medicine. Benioff, whose fortune was estimated last year at $6 billion, oversees a $130 billion software empire based in San Francisco. The masks are expected to be shipped in weekly installments for public distribution at COVID-19 testing sites and other venues. Mayor Harry Kim has said Benioff is a member of his COVID-19 working group. The philanthropist provided resources, staff and a working plan to make the Big Island a template for getting ahead of the pandemic, Kim said.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: A food bank in the city has announced it will remove letters from President Donald Trump located inside its federal food assistance boxes that address recipient families. Community Food Basket Director Ariel Jackson said in a post on social media that the organization would not be distributing the letter with their Farmers to Families food boxes, the Post Register reports. “It will be incredibly time consuming to remove them before giving the food to families but it is also the right thing to do,” Jackson said, arguing that they are not a political organization and that the letter is inappropriate. The letter, signed by Trump, says that citizen health is his top priority and that he has “prioritized sending nutritious food from our farmers to families in need throughout America” in response to the pandemic. The Community Food Basket receives the food boxes through the government’s Coronavirus Food Assistance Program.\n\nIllinois\n\nNormal: Spring break will remain on the calendar for 2021 at Illinois State University. School officials announced Friday that an “overwhelming number” of faculty, staff and students who responded to a survey wanted the regular break preserved during the coronavirus pandemic. The university’s planning team had recommended canceling the spring break amid concern about travel during the break contributing to spread of the virus on campus. The Bloomington Pantagraph reports, though, that the survey responses showed concern about mental health without the mid-semester break. University spokesman Eric Jome said the school plans to increase testing following the March 6-14 spring break, focused on students who attend in-person or hybrid courses and those who work or live on campus. The majority of classes at Illinois State will be virtual this spring.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s manufacturers have generally weathered the coronavirus pandemic better than other industries, even as some plants have been battered by changes in consumer spending amid the public health crisis, according to some business leaders. Because companies that make up Indiana’s key manufacturing industry are designated as essential businesses, most have remained in operation and haven’t seen nearly as many closures and layoffs as restaurants and hotels. Some Indiana manufacturing plants scaled back production and furloughed workers, but they remained open even as stay-at-home orders forced other industries to pause their operations, the Indianapolis Business Journal reports. “Generally, the manufacturing sector is doing well – not all the way back yet, but doing well as compared with other sectors,” said Brian Burton, president and CEO of the Indiana Manufacturers Association.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Mayor Frank Cownie says he is worried a rally planned by President Donald Trump at the Des Moines International Airport could cause COVID-19 to spread in the city. Though the city has a mask mandate, the rally Wednesday will be held at the airport’s Iowa Air National Guard facility, which is not under city control, Cownie said. Preya Samsundar, the Republican National Committee’s spokesperson in Iowa, did not immediately know how the number of people expected to attend. The campaign encourages attendees to wear masks and socially distance, Samsundar said. They will have their temperatures checked and be given masks, with instructions to wear them, according to an announcement about the rally. But Trump has held other rallies where many of the people in attendance did not maintain social distance and, like him, did not wear masks. “We don’t want a super-spread event here in Des Moines,” Cownie said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Nearly $50 million in funding for COVID-19 testing is still moving through the state’s bidding system more than three weeks after legislators approved the spending, state officials say. At the Legislative Budget Committee meeting this past week, Sen. Carolyn McGinn expressed frustration that Wichita State University, which has completed necessary paperwork and has labs ready to process tests, doesn’t have a go-ahead from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. Marci Nielsen, a special advisor to Gov. Laura Kelly, told lawmakers that state regulations allow time for potential testing organizations to submit proposals for government funding. Decisions on which organizations will receive the money will not be made until later this month, The Kansas City Star and The Wichita Eagle report.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear said Sunday that he will quarantine after a member of his security detail who drove with his family the day before later tested positive for the coronavirus. The Democratic governor said he and his family feel fine and show no coronavirus symptoms. Beshear’s wife and their two children also will quarantine. Beshear’s family will be tested regularly for the virus, his office said. The governor and his wife, first lady Britainy Beshear, were last tested Thursday, Beshear spokeswoman Crystal Staley said. In a social media video posted Sunday, Beshear said he’s committed to “setting an example” by quarantining after receiving a call from a contact tracer to alert his family of the possible exposure. Kentucky reported 7,675 new coronavirus cases in the past week, the highest weekly total during the pandemic. That included a backlog of cases from Fayette County, officials said Sunday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A children’s museum that was shuttered in August over slow ticket sales in the face of the coronavirus is now subbing as a school for some local students. The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports the Louisiana Children’s Museum closed in August as parents concerned about the coronavirus kept kids at home. But in recent weeks, the newspaper reports, students from the Langston Hughes Academy started using the museum as a school. About 60 of the school’s children from kindergarten and pre-K classes were expected to be able to have access to the facility located in City Park during the 2020-21 school year. The 56,000-square-foot building has multiple exhibits including a replica of the Mississippi River designed to give children hands-on learning experiences in a fun manner. There are also extensive outdoor spaces for children to explore. “It’s like Christmas,” Principal Carrie Bevans told the newspaper.\n\nMaine\n\nFryeburg: Summer and fall in Maine are normally a time of pig races, demolition derbies and piles of fried food at the state’s agriculture fairs. This year, the coronavirus pandemic interrupted that, as all 26 fairs canceled – ranging from the Bangor State Fair, which typically attracts about 50,000 people, to the Houlton Fair, which takes place astride the Canadian border. Some of the events have tried to salvage the season with virtual versions. The Fryeburg Fair, which dates to 1851 and employs hundreds of people in western Maine, went online this month. Even the fair’s cow impersonating event, called “Moo-La-Palooza,” moved online. The Common Ground Country Fair, the state’s annual celebration of organic farming and rural living, moved online in September. The fair usually includes in-person seminars about everything from how to wield a scythe to how to raise rare breeds of sheep.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan has announced that state officials will no longer consider plans to close a Maryland State Police helicopter base. Some Eastern Shore lawmakers were concerned one of two bases there would be vulnerable to the cut. But they rejoiced Thursday after the Republican governor’s announcement. The cuts were being made because of the coronavirus pandemic. But the reduction would have meant that state police would have to close one of the agency’s seven helicopter bases. “For more than half a century, the Maryland State Police Aviation Command has been conducting lifesaving medevac flights,” Hogan said. “Our administration is committed to making sure Maryland’s finest have all the resources they need to continue their excellent service to the state and the region.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Two casinos have been cleared by state gambling regulators to start offering roulette games again. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission on Thursday unanimously voted to allow Encore Boston Harbor in Everett and MGM Springfield to offer roulette with modifications, including a limit of three players per table divided by plexiglass shields. The state’s three casinos were closed for about four months because of the coronavirus pandemic but were allowed to reopen in July at limited capacity. Slots, blackjack and smaller poker games are now allowed, but capacity remains limited. The state’s third casino, Plainridge Park in Plainville, offers only electronic games. Casinos in nearby states have already started offering roulette safely, the commission noted. A spokesperson for Encore welcomed the decision.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Snow days may no longer be needed for school districts across the state because many students are learning online amid the coronavirus pandemic. Many people wonder if virtual instruction will take the place of snow days since schools are already offering classes online, MLive.com reports. Bill DiSessa, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Education, said the state’s guidance on snow days remains the same for students attending classes in person. But students learning remotely won’t be as lucky because he said the department does not expect requests for snow days for online classes. Jackson Public Schools Superintendent Jeff Beal said administrators can plan for students to finish schoolwork at home with enough notice. Sandy Maxson, superintendent of the K-12 da Vinci Institute charter school district in Jackson, said virtual school may be used if inclement weather keeps students out of class for many days.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: State health officials on Sunday reported 10 new deaths due to complications from the coronavirus, raising the total number of fatalities to 2,141 since the pandemic began. The update showed 1,450 new cases in the past day, following a record high Saturday of more than 1,500 positive tests. A total of 112,268 people have tested positive for COVID-19, including 11,551 health care workers. It was the fourth straight day the state reported more than 1,000 cases. Active cases remain at a record high of 9,956. The update shows 52 new hospitalizations, compared with 51 on Saturday. There were about 270 new cases per 100,000 people in Minnesota over the past two weeks, which ranks 17th in the country for new cases per capita, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. The death toll is the 25th highest in the country overall and the 31st highest per capita.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Twice as many residents caught COVID-19 at the state’s for-profit nursing homes, and nearly three times more died there, an analysis of health data by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting shows. On average, 4 in 10 residents have been confirmed positive for the coronavirus in these for-profit homes. One possible factor: 80% of Mississippi’s nursing homes had already been cited for infection-control problems before the pandemic hit. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been investigating three nursing homes in the state, all of them for-profit, for workplace catastrophes or fatalities, including Lakeside Health & Rehabilitation Center in Quitman. One of the home’s nursing assistants, Carole Faye Doby of Stonewall, died of COVID-19 on May 15, and two residents also died of the disease.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A “database extract error” resulted in an incorrect inflation of the number of reported COVID-19 cases in the state going back over several days, health officials said Sunday. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said in a news release that it is in the process of migrating all COVID-19 testing and case data into one new consolidated system. The state launched a new version of its coronavirus dashboard Sept. 28 to integrate pandemic response across public health, economic, employment and social impact indicators. Missouri incorrectly reported Saturday on its coronavirus website more than 5,000 new COVID-19 cases, more than double the previous single-day record. The agency said Sunday that it is working urgently to resolve the issue and will update its website with the correct numbers once that is done.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Steve Daines and his Democratic opponent, Gov. Steve Bullock, clashed over the response to the pandemic in the last debate of their U.S. Senate race. Bullock accused Daines of stalling on a second federal coronavirus relief package. Bullock said he would not implement stricter measures to limit the spread of the virus, despite a high infection rate in the state, because there was no federal safety net for workers and businesses. The freshman senator rejected Bullock’s view that Americans must learn to live with the virus, instead hanging the solution to the rampant spread of the virus on therapeutic drugs and vaccinations, which he promised would be distributed free of charge once approved. The governor was praised for his swift response in the spring, which included a shutdown order that helped keep the virus at bay. But as the state reopened in early summer, the case tally began to climb.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state kicked off the week by registering nearly 500 new cases of the coronavirus as Nebraska continues to see its number of cases climb, state health statistics showed. The state’s online virus tracking site showed 495 new cases of the virus were confirmed Sunday in the state, and more than 2,320 cases were confirmed Friday through Sunday. That brought the state total to 52,382 confirmed cases and 519 deaths since the pandemic began. The site also showed the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 – the disease caused by the virus – continued to grow. On Saturday, a new record of 305 people in Nebraska were hospitalized with the virus, which broke the previous day’s record of 293 on Friday and was well above the spring peak of 232 set May 27. On Sunday, the number of hospitalizations dropped by one, to 304. Even with the rise in cases, 28% of the state’s intensive care beds and 76% of ventilators are available.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: With negotiations over another package of federal coronavirus relief dollars stuck in congressional gridlock, state and local officials are scrambling to spend their allocations before the end-of-year deadline by which all funds must be spent. Nevada lawmakers – who in July slashed hundreds of millions from state spending on health care and education – convened Friday to assess how recipients of the state’s $1.25 billion coronavirus relief fund have used their shares of the money. County officials, city managers and officials leading programs offering relief to renters and small businesses all assured lawmakers that they would have no problem spending their funds by Dec. 31, indicating little need to devise alternative plans to direct the money to pay for other pandemic-related services.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A person who tested positive for the coronavirus may have exposed patrons seated at the bar at a restaurant in the city, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services said. Anyone who visited the Jumpin’ Jay’s Fish Cafe and sat at the bar between Sept. 30 and Oct. 4 may have been exposed, the department said in a news release Sunday. The department said it conducted a contact investigation and notified known close contacts. It decided to notify the public, saying there may be additional people who were exposed. The restaurant had announced Oct. 7 that it was voluntarily closing temporarily as a precaution. “Please know that we have met or exceeded state and CDC guidelines in our quick and independent decision to close, test and quarantine as the safety of our staff and guests is our top priority,” the restaurant said in a statement.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nGlen Ridge: It will be a disappointing Halloween for children who hoped to go trick-or-treating in the township after the borough council announced going door-to-door for candy won’t be allowed. In a notice on the borough website, officials said people come from all over to trick or treat in town, and a homeowner can give out more than 1,000 pieces of candy in the night, causing some streets to be extremely crowded. Statewide, Gov. Phil Murphy has said Halloween won’t be canceled this year despite coronavirus concerns, but he and the state Department of Health have offered guidelines for the holiday, such as trick-or-treaters wearing a mask that covers their mouth and nose and parties being held outdoors or online, using programs such as Zoom. “You may wish to dress as a knucklehead this Halloween, but we don’t want anyone to act like one,” Murphy said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Officials are confirming more COVID-19 infections at the city’s homeless shelter as cases statewide are on the rise. The city reported an additional 72 cases at the shelter Sunday, bringing the total to 93 confirmed infections since the pandemic began. Overall, state health officials have reported nearly 33,000 cases. The shelter is not taking new residents. Anyone already there who’s experiencing symptoms or has been exposed to someone with COVID-19 is being isolated and tested, officials said. Some hotels are being used to house those who test positive. The city said in a statement that it has established protocols for identifying vulnerable people such as seniors and those with chronic medical conditions that put them at risk. New Mexico has had some of the most restrictive health orders in place since the pandemic began but has been reporting near-record highs in recent days.\n\nNew York\n\nPoughkeepsie: Two colleges north of New York City were holding classes remotely, suspending in-person activities and barring visitors Monday after detecting multiple cases of the coronavirus. Iona College in Westchester County said it was moving classes online for two weeks starting Monday after identifying 58 cases. The 4,000-student Catholic college said in an online posting that the uptick was among some athletic teams and that the virus was transmitted through a “single, isolated event.” Marist College in Poughkeepsie announced its initial lockdown Thursday after learning of coronavirus cases stemming from a weekend off-campus gathering held without masks or social distancing. The college of more than 6,000 students said it was conducting multiple rounds of targeted coronavirus testing for students and had instituted “a precautionary temporary quarantine” at its Fulton Townhouses.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: The number of people in the state who’ve applied for unemployment benefits since the coronavirus pandemic began has hit 1.31 million. The Winston-Salem Journal reports the figure was released last week in a report from the N.C. Division of Employment Security. The agency said some people have reached the end of one unemployment benefit program and had to switch to another. For instance, they may have exhausted their 12 weeks of regular state benefits and begun a 13-week federal extended pandemic program. That means the actual number of claims is even higher because some people have had to file for more than one unemployment insurance program. Since the middle of March, people in North Carolina have filed a combined 2.49 million state and federal jobless claims. The total amount that’s been paid out is about $8.2 billion.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Many students at the state’s public and nonpublic schools will be receiving cloth masks to help slow the spread of COVID-19, state School Superintendent Kirsten Baesler said. North Dakota is receiving almost 160,000 masks, an allocation based on the number of students from low-income families. The emphasis is on first providing masks to students who come from low-income households or are at higher risk, Baesler said. Gov. Doug Burgum announced recently that students and adults in schools who have been in close contact with a person infected with COVID-19 do not have to quarantine, if both the close contact and the infected person were both wearing masks properly when they were in contact. North Dakota for several weeks has been among the leaders in the country for the number of virus cases per capita. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will help cover the costs of the masks, Baesler said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Hitting a grim pandemic milestone, the state has surpassed 5,000 deaths from the new coronavirus, a pathogen that emerged in humans only late last year and now is a leading killer in the Buckeye State and the nation. The six deaths announced Monday afternoon pushed the state’s death toll to 5,005. Public health experts also have cautioned that any count of the coronavirus dead will be lower than the actual number of fatalities because it’s likely people have died with the virus but were not tested for it or treated for COVID-19, the illness that develops from infection of the coronavirus. Ohio ranks 13th in the country in COVID-19 deaths and 24th in deaths per capita. The 5,005 Ohio deaths from COVID-19 so far are more than the combined total of the state’s military service deaths in the Vietnam War, 2,997, and the Korean War, 1,777.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state on Sunday reported 766 new cases of the coronavirus and three additional deaths. The Oklahoma State Department of Health said the state’s total number of reported cases is now 99,387. The state’s death toll from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, is 1,098. Meanwhile, Oklahoma last week reported record hospitalizations, with numbers topping 750 one day. The state releases hospitalization numbers on weekdays. Dr. Jared Taylor, the state epidemiologist, said Friday that it looks like the record hospitalizations are a trend. “While hospitalization counts are always fluid and change regularly, the numbers certainly indicate that the hospitalization counts are indicative of a trend rather than outliers,” Taylor told the Tulsa World. “This is reinforced by the consistent to slow increase we’ve seen in other parameters that we follow, including weekly case counts and even fatality rates.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The Oregon Health Authority on Sunday reported 337 new confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in the state, including the first case in Wheeler County. Wheeler County in Eastern Oregon was one of the last counties in the United States to see confirmation of the coronavirus. Its 1,300 inhabitants are spread over 1,700 square miles. The three remaining counties without a case in the contiguous U.S. are Esmeralda County in Nevada and King and Loving counties in Texas, with populations of 873, 272 and 169, respectively, according to 2019 Census Bureau data. OHA on Sunday reported 50 new cases in Marion County and five in Polk County. The state total has reached 37,262 cases. OHA announced the state’s death toll remains unchanged from Saturday, at 599.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Spooky season is here, but fictional terror has been watered down by an actual scare – COVID-19. Some of the region and state’s largest attractions are operating a little differently this Halloween. Sean Kelly, senior vice president at the Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia, said the seasonal “Terror Behind the Walls” attraction has been modified this year. The penitentiary, the nation’s oldest prison dating back to 1821, will be offering night tours for the first time. The experience can still be described as “eerie,” according to Kelly, who said that due to the nature of the site, there’s a sense of suspense walking through Death Row in particular. Guests can listen to an audio tour narrated by actor Steve Buscemi and former inmates and guards. Other ventures, such as Field of Screams in Lancaster County, are sticking closer to tradition, tweaking their scares for the coronavirus era to keep guests safe.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo does not anticipate relaxing any of the state’s coronavirus restrictions until a vaccine becomes available. Rhode Island has been in Phase 3 of its economic recovery plane since June and will likely stay there for several more months, the Democratic governor told WPRI-TV on Thursday. “As much as I would love to relax these regulations, I am confident that’s not the right thing to do,” she said. She also expressed concern about rising numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases and virus-related hospitalizations, even though the state’s positivity rate remains lower than 2%. She said most of the new cases appear to be connected to small gatherings, not large public events, and urged Rhode Islanders to “try to be a little more careful.” In other news, Raimondo said the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer over her pandemic-related orders was “terrible” but said she herself feels safe.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Department of Corrections will spend nearly $1 million on air purifiers to combat the spread of COVID-19 in its prisons. The agency told lawmakers last week about its plans to install the air ionizers into heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems at correctional facilities by December. Officials say the ionizers work by making the coronavirus particles heavier and easier to filter, thus more likely to be knocked to the ground. The Joint Bond Review Committee reviewed the proposal, estimated to cost $926,000, last Tuesday. Director Bryan Stirling told WIS-TV “internal canteen funds” would pay for the equipment. The announced upgrades come after more than 30 inmates who contracted the disease have died since the start of the outbreak. The department has confirmed more than 2,000 COVID-19 cases among inmates and 496 cases among staff members across its facilities.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Active coronavirus cases in the state surpassed 6,000 for the first time Monday as officials continued to struggle to contain the virus. The Department of Health reported 359 new cases Monday. That’s a downturn from recent days, but fewer tests were processed over the weekend. The new cases bring the state’s tally of people with active infections to 6,062, a new high during the pandemic. Health officials reported two more deaths, bringing the death toll to 288. October is already the deadliest month of the pandemic, with the state so far reporting 65 deaths. Hospitalizations from the virus have also surged during October. There are currently 278 people in hospitals with COVID-19. The Department of Health reports 43% of hospital beds and 28% of Intensive Care Units statewide remain open for patients.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: City officials are investigating a worship event outside the historic courthouse Sunday that packed together a big, largely unmasked crowd, despite rising new case counts of COVID-19 in Tennessee. Nashville Health Department spokesperson Brian Todd said “appropriate penalties” will be pursued against the organizer, saying that person didn’t submit an application to health officials or permit application to any Nashville department. Event leader Sean Feucht posted videos of the gathering on social media, calling it a protest. Feucht has been associated with similar gatherings elsewhere. “We had THREE venue changes and so much resistance BUT THE CHURCH WILL NOT BE SILENCED!” Feucht tweeted Sunday about the Nashville event. Nashville is limiting gatherings without city approval to 25 people. Approved events can occur at 30% capacity, with 500 people maximum and masks required.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state on Sunday reported 2,262 new cases of the coronavirus as the state’s total since the pandemic began nears 800,000. The Texas Department of State Health Services said the state’s total number of cases so far is at 792,478. The state on Sunday reported 31 new deaths, bringing the death toll to 16,557. The actual number of cases in Texas is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Last week Gov. Greg Abbott lifted the shutdown order on bars that has been in place since June, though he made the reopenings conditional on the approval of county leaders. New cases in Texas have dramatically fallen since summer, and the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations has leveled off since days in July when the state was reached daily counts of more than 10,000 in hospitals. On Sunday, there were about 3,600 hospitalizations.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Southern Utah University had the highest enrollment growth by percentage among the state’s public universities between 2019 and 2020, according to new numbers from the Utah System of Higher Education. The Fall 2020 3rd-Week Enrollments report shows SUU’s headcount rose from 11,224 in 2019 to 12,582, a 12.1% increase. David Bishop, director of public relations for Southern Utah University, called the growth “remarkable” and said SUU most likely leads both the state and the nation for enrollment growth by percentage. Overall, Utah’s public universities saw a 0.2% decrease in enrollment between 2019 and 2020, according to a press release from the Utah System of Higher Education. “I am optimistic that college enrollments across the System have held steady despite the coronavirus pandemic,” Commissioner of Higher Education Dave R. Woolstenhulme said in a press release. “These future graduates will have a positive ripple effect across the state and country as we recover from the impacts of COVID-19.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Champlain Orchards in Addison County has reopened after an outbreak of the coronavirus infected more than two dozen of its seasonal apple pickers. The orchards were back to regular hours for pick-your-own apples this past weekend. A total of 28 of the orchards’ migrant apple pickers have tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine has said the virus is contained to the site and emphasized there was no known risk to the public. He also said there is no risk from eating apples or any other products that were grown or produced from the orchards. Champlain Orchards said Saturday that staff had undergone a third round of testing with no new positive cases.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Dominion Energy says it won’t start cutting off power to people behind on their electric bills. State regulators recently said utilities may now do so. The Virginian-Pilot reports the company said its aim is to help customers trying to cope financially during the coronavirus pandemic. The State Corporation Commission had ordered a freeze in March on disconnections. But it expired last week because the commission said a moratorium isn’t sustainable in the long term. Meanwhile, the General Assembly is considering requiring utilities to develop emergency repayment plans for bills that weren’t paid. Dominion is giving customers up to 12 months to pay down unpaid charges. No minimum payment is required. The utility said it has also expanded assistance and eligibility for its bill assistance program.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: State regulators have fined Yakima Speedway operator Doug Bettarel $2,500 after fans were allowed to attend an auto racing event earlier this month that officials say violated state coronavirus prevention rules. The state Liquor and Cannabis Board delivered the public-safety violation notice last week to Bettarel’s company B and B Speedway Promotions, the Yakima Herald-Republic reports. Yakima County does not allow gatherings of more than five people. County businesses also are prohibited from allowing customers inside their establishments without masks. Bettarel estimated about 500 people attended the Fall Classic’s preliminary races Oct. 3, and up to 2,000 people attended the final races Oct. 4. There was also a rally for a Republican gubernatorial candidate after Sunday’s events, which drew several hundred more people to the speedway.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has opted not to quarantine or take other precautions after attending a White House meeting last month hosted by President Donald Trump, Morrisey’s spokesman told a newspaper. Morrisey attended the Sept. 23 roundtable discussion on “Protecting Consumers from Social Media Abuses,” the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. Nine days later, Trump was hospitalized for treatment of COVID-19. His doctors indicated he began experiencing symptoms of the disease earlier in the day. Morrisey “was not in close proximity of the president during that meeting fifteen days ago,” the Republican attorney general’s press secretary, Curtis Johnson, said in a statement. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the incubation period for COVID-19 may range from two to 14 days. That makes it possible Trump was infected when Morrisey attended the meeting.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said Monday that he never had any symptoms after testing positive Oct. 2 for the coronavirus, declaring that COVID-19 “is not a death sentence.” As of Monday, more than 152,000 people in Wisconsin had tested positive for the virus, with 1,474 deaths, according to the state Department of Health Services. The seven-day average of new confirmed cases reached a new record high of 2,547, up from 2,395 a week ago. Wisconsin has seen a spike in cases in recent months and has been one of the top five states in the country for new cases per capita. Johnson, a Republican, said that while there have been “so many tragedies” for those who test positive, “at the same time, COVID is not a death sentence.” Johnson said he was last tested for the virus Oct. 5 and again tested positive, but “I have never had a symptom, ever.” Johnson, who said he was shocked that he tested positive, was quarantining at his home in Oshkosh.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Officials have opened the first national cemetery in the state, a place where veterans can be laid to rest alongside fellow service members and honored with their families for their sacrifices. The Cheyenne National Cemetery is designed to serve more than 55,000 veterans, their spouses and eligible children who live within a 75-mile radius of Cheyenne, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Previously, Wyoming was one of a handful of states that did not have its own national cemetery, and the closest place for veterans in Cheyenne to receive a military burial was Fort Logan National Cemetery, 114 miles away in Colorado. The cemetery was created as part of the Veteran Affairs National Cemetery Administration’s Rural Initiative, which aims to provide burial benefits to those in underserved areas.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/14/malcolm-airport-cat-caught-island-park-expansion-news-around-states/50489503/", "title": "Malcolm X, airport cat caught: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state on Tuesday closed a $509 million bond deal to help build two supersize prisons amid lawsuits by inmates bidding to block the project. The Alabama Finance Department confirmed that the bond sale, which had been approved last month, was finalized. The deal closure comes after criminal justice reform activists had strived for more than a year to disrupt the sale. But legal wrangling over the project is continuing through ongoing litigation. Gov. Kay Ivey and lawmakers approved the construction as a solution to Alabama’s ongoing prison woes. Critics of the plan argue that the state is ignoring the bigger issues – prison staffing levels and leadership – to focus on building projects. “The construction of new and modern correctional facilities is absolutely and undeniably necessary to support the safety of both inmates and staff, to improve mental health care, to provide space for vocational and rehabilitative programs, and ultimately to protect public safety,” Alabama officials said in a statement. “No eleventh-hour lawsuits by inmates or activists will halt these efforts, and the state intends to move to dismiss the lawsuits and to vigorously defend against the claims as being without merit.” Activists had tried to discourage the deal, calling it a cruel investment in mass incarceration.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Some rain helped firefighters battling a wildfire that prompted evacuations. About a half-inch fell into early Monday, allowing crews to build more fire breaks to help control the wildfire started by lightning June 21. “It’s not really like a season-ending type of rain; it’s more like a slowing,” said Mark Enty, a spokesperson for a state firefighting team. The fire has been burning near the community of Anderson. Evacuation orders were place for all properties accessed by roads, trails or driveways on the west side of the Parks Highway from mileposts 269 to 275. The city of Anderson, located about 80 miles southwest of Fairbanks, is not under an evacuation order. At least one home has been confirmed to have been lost, and Enty said Denali Borough officials will make an official assessment of other structures. The fire was estimated to be 110 square miles.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Evictions in the greater Phoenix area have returned to pre-pandemic levels. The latest data from the Maricopa County Justice Court shows that landlords filed 5,792 evictions in June, compared with 5,669 in June 2019, before the pandemic began. Maricopa County had among the highest levels of evictions in the United States before state and federal eviction moratoriums that slowed lockouts during the coronavirus pandemic. Those eviction bans have long since ended. June also saw the highest number of monthly eviction filings since the pandemic began in spring 2020. A court spokesman emphasized that applications for rental assistance are still being accepted and encouraged tenants in need to apply.\n\nArkansas\n\nParagould: Jimmie Lou Fisher, who served as Arkansas’ state treasurer for more than two decades and was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002, has died, a funeral home said. She was 80. Fisher died Monday at Arkansas Methodist Medical Center in Paragould, Mitchell Funeral Home said. A cause of death was not released. Then-Gov. Bill Clinton appointed Fisher as state auditor in 1979. She later served as treasurer from 1981 to 2002. “I will always remember that early October morning in 1991, when Jimmie Lou introduced me as I kicked off my presidential campaign on the steps of the Old State House,” Clinton said in a statement Tuesday. “As always, she was enthusiastic, caring and kind, saying just the words we all needed to hear.” He added: “She loved Arkansas and Arkansas loved her back. And she did a fine job as state treasurer.” Fisher ran for governor in 2002 and lost to Republican Mike Huckabee, capturing 47% of the vote. “She loved politics and was a faithful and fierce warrior for her party throughout her adult life,” Huckabee said Tuesday. A funeral service is scheduled for Thursday in Paragould.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Former U.S. Rep. Katie Hill, who was ordered to pay attorneys’ fees to a British tabloid and two conservative journalists she sued after the publication of intimate photos without her consent, has filed for bankruptcy protection. If successful, the move could allow Hill to avoid paying about $220,000 in fees to the defendants, the Los Angeles Times reports. The Democrat who briefly represented a district north of Los Angeles had accused multiple parties in a revenge-porn lawsuit of violating the law by publishing or distributing the compromising photos. The lawsuit was thrown out, and a judge later rendered the financial judgments. Hill did not immediately respond to a request for comment. She resigned in 2019 after the publication of the photos and amid a House ethics probe into allegations of an inappropriate sexual relationship with one of her congressional staffers, which she denied. Hill, 34, gained national attention in 2018 when she was elected to Congress in a district long under Republican control. She was celebrated as the face of millennial change and was close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a fellow California Democrat.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man who allegedly made a threatening phone call against the state’s top elections official has been charged with retaliating against an elected official. Kirk Wertz, 52, was arrested June 6 in suburban Denver over the June 30 phone call to the office of Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold after investigators tracked his cellphone moving from Goodland, Kansas, to Colorado, according to a court document. Authorities have not revealed what the alleged threat was. His alleged statements to the person who answered the phone at Griswold’s office and to a state trooper who called the number back later were redacted from a document explaining why he was arrested. A spokeswoman for the Denver District Attorney’s Office, Carolyn Tyler, confirmed that Wertz had been charged but declined to elaborate beyond what was included in the document. Wertz was being held in jail Friday after making his first appearance in court Thursday. There was no attorney listed as representing him yet in court records. In a statement, Griswold thanked law enforcement for taking action against Wertz and said threats would not deter her from carrying out her election duties. “The wave of violent threats directed at election officials and workers across the county is extremely concerning,” she said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The wife of a former state lawmaker pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with her role in the alleged theft of more than $600,000 in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven. Lauren DiMassa, one of several people including her husband who were arrested in the investigation, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy in U.S. District Court in Hartford. Sentencing has not been scheduled. She remains free on bail. Federal prosecutors said West Haven paid DiMassa, formerly known as Lauren Knox, nearly $148,000 for services she never provided to the city. She and her husband were accused of submitting fraudulent invoices to the city for coronavirus-related services including youth violence prevention, but instead they used the money for their own benefit, prosecutors said. DiMassa’s lawyer, Francis O’Reilly, said in court that it was important to note that DiMassa turned over most of the money she received from the city to her husband. O’Reilly declined to comment after the hearing. DiMassa’s husband is former state Rep. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat who also served as an aide to the West Haven City Council. He resigned from both positions after his arrest in October. He has pleaded not guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: While the First State saw a slight decline in fatalities in 2020, a report released Tuesday still ranks Delaware among the deadliest states for pedestrians. Smart Growth America’s Dangerous by Design 2022 report analyzed federal crash and fatality data from 2016 to 2020 – the latest statistics publicly available – finding Delaware’s pedestrian fatalities declined slightly during the pandemic, averaging 2.89 deaths per 100,000 people from 2016-20. That represented a 0.42 decline in deaths per 100,000 people from 2016 to 2019, but long-term comparisons between rates from 2011-15 and 2016-20 show little change, keeping Delaware the fifth most dangerous state for pedestrians, the report shows. New Mexico was at the top with 3.76 pedestrian deaths per 100,000 people annually, followed by Florida with 3.22 deaths, South Carolina with 3.19 deaths and Arizona with 2.98 deaths, according to the report. Delaware has consistently ranked among the deadliest states for pedestrian safety, and over the past decade, the number of pedestrian and bicyclist fatalities on the state’s roadways has nearly doubled. The First State saw non-motorized fatalities increase from 21 in 2009 to 28 in 2020, according to the latest statistics available through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s online database.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: D.C. residents can now preregister for monkeypox vaccination appointments, WUSA-TV reports, citing a Tuesday announcement by DC Health. Once appointments become available, starting Thursday, people who preregistered will receive an email invitation to make an appointment. Residents will then have 48 hours to claim their appointment. About 3,000 appointments are expected to become available this week. Currently, eligibility for the vaccination is limited to adults in certain sexual circumstances that would increase their risk, based on where the virus has been circulating most heavily in the U.S. But residents who do not meet the current vaccine eligibility criteria are still encouraged to preregister. The monkeypox vaccinations are free and based on availability. At the appointment, confirmation of an appointment and proof of residency will be required.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: U.S. immigration officials say 25 Cuban migrants landed in South Florida on Tuesday – the latest arrival amid a mass migration from the island to escape political and economic troubles. The group was seen sitting off the side of the road by a beachside park in Key Biscayne in the early morning and included women and a few children, who were all taken into custody. Chief Patrol Agent Walter Slosar of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said via Twitter it was a smuggling incident that was being investigated. Between last October and May, Customs and Border Protection officials have found and detained about 1,000 Cubans arriving in Florida. Meanwhile, as of Sunday, the U.S. Coast Guard said it had stopped more than 3,000 Cubans at sea since last October. The majority of Cubans continue to migrate by crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, with about 140,000 arriving since last October – a number that exceeds the Mariel boatlift of 1980, when more than 124,700 Cubans came to the U.S. Cuba is seeing its worst economic crisis in decades due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the tightening of U.S. sanctions. Last summer, people staged massive protests, which ended in hundreds of arrests, according to nongovernmental groups.\n\nGeorgia\n\nLithonia: A man became trapped while trying to crawl down through a vent from a strip mall roof into a pizza restaurant Tuesday, forcing firefighters to slice open the vent to free him, police said. The man was taken to a hospital, and the extent of his injuries was unclear. Police told local news outlets that emergency responders cut open the vent where it extended upward from a pizza oven at a Little Caesars outlet in suburban Lithonia, about 15 miles east of downtown Atlanta. Brittany Davis, a U.S. Army recruiter, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution she could hear the man yelling for help when she arrived for work at a neighboring recruiting office. “I looked on the roof but couldn’t see anybody,” Davis said. She called 911. Davis said a Little Caesars employee told her he could hear the man’s voice coming from inside the oven. Davis said she went inside the pizza restaurant and spoke to the man, who reported he was in pain and having a panic attack. “I’m not sure what time the restaurant closes at night, but the oven still gives off heat after they close, I imagine,” DeKalb County Fire Cpt. Jason Daniels told WXIA-TV. “For him to get down into the pipe … he had to do it in a certain window of time when the oven was cool enough, and obviously nobody was there.” The man walked to an ambulance shortly after being removed and was taken to a hospital. Police did not identify him or announce any criminal charges.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island was given new land Tuesday in a deal that will protect and manage a pristine white sand beach and ocean bay area that is home to endangered and endemic species and to rare, culturally significant Native Hawaiian artifacts. Trust for Public Land, a national nonprofit land preservation group, transferred its ownership of Pohue Bay and surrounding land to the National Park Service. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has the world’s largest and most active volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kilauea. Most of the coastline where the bay is located is made of ancient lava flows, black rock and sea cliffs that dart out into the ocean. Pohue Bay, a rare and idyllic oasis in an otherwise rugged landscape, is home to endangered hawksbill sea turtles, green sea turtles, endangered Hawaiian monk seals and other species found only in Hawaii. The area houses anchialine ponds – landlocked pools with a mix of fresh and salt water – where rare Hawaiian red shrimp called ʻōpaeʻula live. The area is also culturally significant because it has remains of ancient Hawaiian villages, petroglyphs, burial sites and the largest known abrader tool quarry in the state, according to the Trust for Public Lands. Abraders are ancient tools used for sanding, smoothing and grinding.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lame-duck Republican Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has given a big pay boost to an administrative assistant who is also a top state Republican Party official in a move that could hinder the ability of the next lieutenant governor by significantly depleting the office’s budget before January’s power transition. In an email Monday, McGeachin informed the Idaho Division of Financial Management that Machele Hamilton would go from part time to full time and jump from $20,000 to $77,000 annually. Her hourly pay is an increase from $20 an hour to about $37 an hour. Her title in the new role is director of strategy and constituent services. She is also the first vice-chair of the Idaho Republican Party. Hamilton is making about $30,000 more than McGeachin’s former chief of staff, Jordan Watters, who resigned in March when McGeachin couldn’t stay within last year’s budget. It’s not clear why Hamilton is being paid so much more than Watters, whose chief of staff duties would likely have included everything in the title Hamilton was given. Hamilton answered the phone for McGeachin’s office Tuesday afternoon but said McGeachin wasn’t available. Hamilton declined to comment about her employment in the office, and McGeachin didn’t respond to a message left with Hamilton by the Associated Press concerning Hamilton’s employment.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A Wisconsin doctor has purchased two clinical buildings in northern Illinois where he plans to offer abortion pills as early as Friday at one location and surgical abortions within six months at the other site. The move comes after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights last month. That led abortion providers in Wisconsin to stop the procedures while the courts determine whether the state’s 1849 law banning most abortions stands. Abortion remains legal in Illinois, making it a likely draw for residents of many other states in the Midwest and even the South. Dr. Dennis Christensen said he’s part of a group trying to revive abortion services in Rockford, in part to accommodate Wisconsin patients. Christensen is an obstetrician-gynecologist who has provided abortions in Madison and Milwaukee and is now mostly retired, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. He recently purchased a former acupuncture office for $75,000 and the former Animal Emergency Clinic of Rockford for $350,000, according to the Winnebago County records. The newly formed Rockford Family Planning Foundation is fundraising and is preparing the second site for surgical abortions, birth control and related care. “We feel like it’s absolutely essential for us to get open as quickly as possible,” said Jeanne Bissell, the group’s president.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Students across the state had small improvements in their English and math scores, with standardized test results released Wednesday indicating a tentative bright spot following years of pandemic-disrupted learning. Results for the spring 2022 ILEARN exam from the Indiana Department of Education show the statewide percentage of students meeting their grade expectations for math climbing to 39.4% from 2021’s 36.9%. The English proficiency levels rose to 41.2%, up from last year’s 40.5%. ILEARN was first implemented in 2019 to replace the state’s ISTEP exam for students from third to eighth grade. The state did not test students in 2020 because of COVID-19-related school shutdowns. Students with passing scores remain about 7 or 8 percentage points below 2019’s pre-pandemic pass rates. The 2022 report also says most grades saw slight increases in passing scores, with the exception of sixth and eighth graders, who saw minor decreases in English scores. All grade levels’ math proficiency increased at least 2 percentage points since 2021. Charity Flores, chief academic officer at the Department of Education, presented the findings to the Board of Education on Wednesday. This year marks the second year of recovery, she said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds declined Tuesday to say whether she would get behind a so-called red flag law in Iowa after a new bipartisan federal gun safety law would offer funding to states that enact them. Reynolds, a Republican, said she wouldn’t rule it out and plans to “take a look at everything.” But she also said that she believes red flag laws have not stopped some shootings in other states and that Iowa needs to have a “balance” that recognizes the rights of gun owners as it moves forward. “When we focus on one solution to the issues that we see with active shooters, we tend to, I think, not think about what other solutions are,” she said. “And we eliminate potential things that we can do right away.” Extreme risk protection orders, also known as red flag laws, allow police or family members to get a court order that temporarily confiscates firearms from a person who may present a danger to others or themselves. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia currently have red flag laws in place. Many of those states are clustered in regions of the U.S. largely governed by Democrats, but some states run by Republicans such as Florida and Indiana also have them. Such laws have gained some bipartisan support, including among U.S. lawmakers as 29 Republicans joined Democrats to pass the federal gun safety law in late June.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The Kansas State Board of Education is looking to veteran teachers to help mitigate staff shortages this fall. The board on Tuesday passed a measure giving any retired educator who previously held a Kansas teaching license an easier pathway back into the classroom during the 2022-23 school year. The new transitional license option, intended for retired educators whose prior teaching credentials have been lapsed for at least six months, streamlines the process and eliminates application fees and professional development requirements needed for typical license renewals. Applicants will still have to pay $50 for a background check, since the state education department outsources that work. Over the past five years, teacher retirements ebbed, but they ticked back up in the past five years, according to Kansas State Department of Education data. In 2020, the agency recorded 785 educators as having retired, but in 2022, KSDE has reported a record-high 986 teacher retirements, said Shane Carter, director of teacher licensure. However, the department in the past few years has also seen a surge in the number of retired teachers who have renewed their teaching license, Carter said, more than doubling from 368 retired teacher renewals in 2020 to 766 in 2022.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A medical marijuana advisory team formed by Gov. Andy Beshear will hold a town hall on the issue Thursday evening in northern Kentucky. The Medical Cannabis Advisory Committee is traveling around the state to gather views on the issue and provide feedback to the governor’s office. The next town hall is set for 5:30 p.m. Thursday at Northern Kentucky University’s student union ballroom in Highland Heights, a statement from the Justice & Public Safety Cabinet said. Other meetings are set for Tuesday at the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet in Frankfort and July 25 at Hopkinsville Community College. The first meeting was held July 6 in Pikeville. Justice and Public Safety Secretary Kerry Harvey and Public Protection Secretary Ray Perry serve as co-chairs of the 17-member panel. It includes health care professionals, members of law enforcement and advocates for medical marijuana.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State authorities have once again been blocked from enforcing a near-total ban on abortion, this time under a judge’s order released Tuesday by a state court in Baton Rouge. Judge Donald Johnson’s order halts enforcement temporarily while lawyers for a north Louisiana clinic and other supporters of abortion rights pursue a lawsuit challenging the legislation. Johnson set a hearing for next Monday. State Attorney General Jeff Landry criticized the ruling in a series of posts on Twitter. “To have the judiciary create a legal circus is disappointing,” Landry wrote in one post. “The rule of law must be followed, and I will not rest until it is. Unfortunately, we will have to wait a little bit longer for that to happen.” Kathaleen Pittman, director of the north Louisiana clinic that was the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, expressed relief in a phone interview. Pittman said the Hope Medical Group for Women clinic in Shreveport is ready to resume counseling and abortions. Louisiana’s two other clinics are in the capital, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. “We look forward to arguing for a preliminary injunction before Judge Johnson next Monday and, in the meantime, we take solace in the fact that crucial healthcare for women has been restored in the state of Louisiana,” Joanna Wright, an attorney for the clinic, said in an email.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal circuit court has reinstated a ban on lobster fishing gear in a nearly 1,000-square-mile area off New England to try to protect endangered whales. The National Marine Fisheries Service issued new regulations last year that prohibited lobster fishing with vertical buoy lines in part of the fall and winter in the area, which is in federal waters off Maine’s coast. The ruling was intended to prevent North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340, from becoming entangled in the lines. The U.S. District Court for the District of Maine issued a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the rules. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston vacated that ruling Tuesday. The circuit court sent the case back to the district court level but noted in its ruling that it does not think the lobster fishing groups that sued to stop the regulations are likely to succeed because Congress has clearly instructed the fisheries service to protect the whales. “Although this does not mean the balance will always come out on the side of an endangered marine mammal, it does leave plaintiffs beating against the tide, with no more success than they had before,” the court ruled.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Commercial and recreational fishermen woke up Sunday to new mako shark regulations from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to boost the number of the migratory predator. Michael Luisi, acting director of the department’s Fishing and Boating Services, said a zero retention limit was established for shortfin mako sharks in both commercial and recreational fishing. Prior to that, a very limited number of the species could be retained. Luisi said penalties for doing so would include “severe and hefty” fines for violators. “Most shark fishermen are going to be up on the regulations because they have to just go fishing,” said Mark Sampson, captain of the charter boat Fish Finder, based in Ocean City. “But your average guy that goes out to catch tuna or black sea bass might not have taken the time to learn shark regulations. So if he accidently catches one on his line, he won’t know if it’s a keeper or not. Those anglers are the ones that are the most frustrated with regulations.” After 40 years of being at the helm of a charter boat, Sampson remains busy with clients that do not always plan on coming back with a shark. For some, the experience is enough. The average season for shark fishing runs from mid-May to October, with mako sharks caught to mid-June.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A family’s beloved pet cat that’s been dodging airport personnel, airline employees and animal experts since escaping from a pet carrier at Logan International Airport about three weeks ago was finally caught Wednesday. “Whether out of fatigue or hunger we’ll never know, but this morning she finally let herself be caught,” an airport spokesperson said in a statement. The cat, named Rowdy, was given a health check and will be returned to her family. “I’m kind of in disbelief,” said her owner, Patty Sahli. “I thought, ‘What are the odds we’re actually going to get her back?’ But I got a call this morning, and I am just so shocked.” Rowdy’s time on the lam began June 24, as Sahli and her husband, Rich, returned to the U.S. from 15 years in Germany with the Army. When their Lufthansa flight landed, the 4-year-old black cat with green eyes escaped her cage, in pursuit of some birds. Soon Rowdy herself was on the receiving end of a chase, as her getaway set off a massive search involving airport and Lufthansa personnel, construction workers, and animal welfare advocates, as well as the use of wildlife cameras and safe-release traps. Despite numerous sightings, Rowdy always eluded her pursuers – but now, a little calm has been restored. “It was such a community effort,” Sahli said.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: An effort to lock certain voting rights into the Michigan Constitution has taken a major step toward the fall ballot, eclipsing a rival campaign led by Republicans to limit absentee voting and add other restrictions. Promote the Vote, a coalition of 27 groups, submitted nearly 670,000 signatures Monday. While the signatures still must be validated by election officials, the petitions contain about 245,000 more names than necessary to qualify for the Nov. 8 election. The ballot question would expand voter rights by allowing nine days of in-person early voting, state-funded absentee ballot postage and drop boxes in every community. Promote the Vote is the same coalition that helped pass no-reason absentee voting and same-day voter registration in 2018. Khalilah Spencer, president of Promote the Vote, said the campaign “observed the 2020 election, and even the 2018 election, and we see where there could be improvements.” In addition to increased access to early voting, the constitutional amendment would require 24-hour absentee ballot drop boxes in every community. Voters could also join a permanent list to have absentee ballots sent for every election. And it would require election audits to be conducted in public by state and county officials and certified based only on the official records of votes cast. Some portions are already in Michigan law, but the state has seen attempts at “manipulating the language in that law, and we want to make sure we close those loopholes,” Spencer said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Local governments in the state are trying to find creative solutions to managing the cost of fueling their fleets of vehicles as gas prices remain high. With gas prices recently near $5 a gallon in the Twin Cities, municipal leaders are looking to keep police squad cars, fire engines, dump trucks and park equipment fueled, yet stay on budget. The city of Buffalo is urging carpooling and checking tire pressure on its vehicles to stretch a tank of gas. “We’re projecting we will be coming in over our fuel budget,” said Taylor Gronau, Buffalo’s assistant city administrator. “However, a lot of those trips are necessary and needed.” Several communities are trying to add more electric and hybrid vehicles to their fleets – only to find huge backlogs, the Star Tribune reports. Earlier this summer, Minneapolis started a program that gave home inspectors the option of taking e-bikes to job sites. It saved wear and tear on the vehicle fleet and cut the city’s gas consumption. Several other city agencies, including IT and public works staff, are also looking into e-bikes. While dozens of local governments are under state fuel contacts, which cover a majority of fuel purchases in bulk and at a fixed rate, many other communities don’t participate, including Buffalo, which relies on retail gas stations to fuel its fleet.\n\nMississippi\n\nPearl River County: A volunteer fire department lost the use of three trucks when its own station went up in flames. WLOX TV reports the fire happened Monday night at the Nicholson Volunteer Fire Department station. Nicholson is a community in Pearl River County, near the Gulf Coast and the Louisiana state line. Five neighboring firefighting agencies assisted in fighting the blaze. Three trucks were heavily damaged, according to the TV station. And a county press release said several other pieces of key firefighting equipment were destroyed in the fire. Former Nicholson fire Chief Bobby Robbins estimated the damage at $1 million and said it could take roughly 100 days to have the equipment replaced. There were no injuries. The cause of the fire was not immediately known. Robbins said the trucks were donated by Deep South, a company from which the team is now considering renting. The Pearl River County Fire Marshal said officials are working with other agencies in the meantime to borrow equipment. Authorities must determine how the fire started as well as how to provide immediate protection in Nicholson without the fire trucks, equipment and a usable firehouse.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Developers announced plans Monday to expand the capacity of a controversial wind power transmission line so much that it would match that of four new nuclear power plants. Invenergy Transmission, the Chicago-based company attempting to build the Grain Belt Express, now says the project will be able to deliver 5,000 megawatts of power, about 25% more than originally planned, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Investment in the project, which would stretch about 800 miles from Kansas to Indiana on a route crossing Missouri and Illinois, also would soar to about $7 billion, Invenergy said. Various municipal utilities in Missouri have long intended to buy power from the project, but now five times as much electricity will be delivered to the state – rising from 500 to 2,500 megawatts, compared to earlier plans. The project will help unlock $7.5 billion in energy cost savings in Missouri and Illinois, according to its developers. The Grain Belt Express has the support of several area advocacy groups, including the Illinois Manufacturers’ Association and the Associated Industries of Missouri. But some farmers who don’t want high-power transmission lines on their land have fought the project.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: The scenic Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park opened for the 2022 summer season Wednesday after a spring marked by heavy snow and cool temperatures delayed plowing and maintenance work, park officials said. The July 13 opening matches the road’s latest opening dates since it first opened to the public on July 15, 1933. The alpine highway also opened July 13 in 2011 due to a late snowpack and in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Vehicle reservations are needed to travel on Going-to-the-Sun Road and can be obtained at the recreation.gov website. The $2 timed entry reservation fee is in addition to the $35-per-vehicle park entry fee. Timed reservations are also needed to enter the North Fork area, but they are not needed to enter other parts of the park such as Many Glacier, Two Medicine, St. Mary or the Chief Mountain Highway. The park’s free shuttle service along Going-to-the-Sun Road operates on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Supporters of the late Malcolm X are making a new push to get him in the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The Omaha native was nominated 15 years ago but rejected amid concerns of controversy, the Omaha World-Herald reports. A Malcolm X Memorial Foundation board member submitted a nomination for the next class of honorees – selected every five years – for the human rights activist, who was born as Malcolm Little in 1925 and was assassinated in 1965. JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike called him “one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history,” according to the World-Herald, and putting him in the Nebraska Hall of Fame would push “the rest of the state to know about the true civil rights history of Omaha.” Malcolm X is one of eight Nebraskans nominated this year. New members may only be named at least 35 years after their deaths.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The University of Nevada, Reno is expecting fall enrollment to match numbers from a year ago – still down from pre-pandemic levels, when the campus saw record enrollment of 21,000 in the fall of 2019. “We are all least even where we were last year,” UNR President Brian Sandoval said. At UNR, fall 2020 enrollment, including non-degree-seeking students, was 19,961. It climbed to 20,129 in fall 2021. The state’s seven colleges – including Truckee Meadows Community College and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas – have all felt the effects of closing campuses and moving classes online. Enrollment systemwide topped 112,427 in the fall of 2019, according to data from the Nevada System of Higher Education. In 2021, enrollment was 106,259. Spring 2022 enrollment was estimated at 95,446 across the seven institutions. Among the factors affecting enrollment, Sandoval said, are the hardships students experienced from COVID-19, travel restrictions including for foreign students, and fewer Californians enrolling as the neighboring state has dramatically increased its admissions. “Students are challenged on a lot of levels,” Sandoval said, adding that housing prices and inflation are also affecting how many can afford higher education.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A judge has consolidated hundreds of lawsuits alleging physical and sexual abuse at the state’s youth detention center, more than two years after the first case was filed. David Meehan sued the state, the youth center, agencies that oversee it and multiple former employees in January 2020, alleging he endured near-daily rapes and beatings at the Youth Development Center in Manchester in the 1990s. At the time, he was one of about three dozen men and women who had come forward, but since then, about 450 have filed lawsuits alleging abuse by 150 staffers over six decades. The civil litigation has largely been on hold since 11 former youth workers were arrested last year, but a judge last week kicked it into high gear with an order setting out the consolidation process. While consolidation brings the “the risk of cookie-cutter dispositions,” proceeding with individual cases would present a “backbreaking clerical burden” for the court, said Merrimack County Superior Court Judge Andrew Schulman. The state is expected to produce more than 3 million pages of documents in the initial discovery phase. Discovery likely will take several months, and groups of cases will be combined for joint trials, lawyers said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A new “strike force” within the state attorney general’s office will aim to enforce New Jersey laws that protect the right to an abortion, working to make sure that patient confidentiality and personal health information are secure and that patients and providers are not threatened or intimidated by protesters. The Reproductive Rights Task Force announced Monday by acting Attorney General Matt Platkin is intended to ensure the full implementation of laws that give New Jersey some of the strongest protections for abortion rights in the United States. As other states ban or severely restrict abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the 49-year constitutional right to an abortion in the United States, New Jersey is expected to become a haven for people from those states who are seeking the procedures. Two laws signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on July 1 bar the extradition of people who receive or perform an abortion in New Jersey to those states that restrict or criminalize the procedure and prohibit public agencies from aiding investigations conducted by those states into abortions provided in the Garden State. The new group of attorneys and law enforcement officers within New Jersey’s Department of Law and Public Safety “will ensure that these laws are enforced to the full extent possible, and that we use every available resource to protect access to abortion care in New Jersey,” Platkin said in a statement.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Physicians and researchers are urging state lawmakers to allow the use of psychedelic mushrooms in mental health therapy aimed at overcoming depression, anxiety, psychological trauma and alcoholism. A legislative panel on Tuesday listened to advocates who hope to broaden the scope of medical treatment and research assisted by psilocybin, the psychedelic active ingredient in certain mushrooms. Oregon is so far the only state to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin. Recent studies indicate psilocybin could be useful in the treatment of major depression, including mental suffering among terminally ill patients, and for substance abuse including alcoholism, with low risks of addiction or overdose under medical supervision. Physician Lawrence Leeman, a medicine professor at the University of New Mexico, urged legislators to move forward without waiting for federal decriminalization or regulatory approval to expand responsible therapies using doses of psilocybin. Leeman and other advocates outlined emerging psilocybin protocols, involving six-hour supervised sessions and extensive discussions about the experience in subsequent counseling. He warned legislators that public interest is spawning illicit, underground experimentation without safeguards.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Soaring demand for the monkeypox vaccine caused the appointment system to crash in New York City, one of many places where supplies have been running out almost as soon as they arrive. City health officials acknowledged the frustration over the limited supply of the vaccine and vowed to build a “stable appointment infrastructure” as the vaccine supply increases. U.S. infections now exceed 1,000 from the growing outbreak. Most patients experience only fever, body aches, chills and fatigue. People with more serious illness may develop a rash and lesions on the face and hands that can spread to other parts of the body. Vaccine shortages have added to anxiety around the virus. Health officials say anyone can get monkeypox, but most cases in the U.S. have been men who have sex with men. Scientists warn that anyone who is in close physical contact with someone who has monkeypox or their clothing or bedsheets is at risk of infection, regardless of their sexual orientation. “After COVID, this should have been easy,” said Daniel Ross, 25, a Harlem man who was one of the many who sought to make an appointment Tuesday. “I kept refreshing and refreshing. … I was frustrated.” Ross soon gave up on the appointment portal, which went down minutes after it went live. “It’s going to haunt me,” he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWinston-Salem: Local Republicans are planning a 30-day raffle of guns and ammunition, a move that’s drawing criticism in light of recent mass shootings across the U.S. The Forsyth County Republican Party will offer semi-automatic weapons, among other guns, in the raffle, the Winston-Salem Journal reports. Organizer Vernon Robinson said each raffle ticket will bear a three-digit number the purchaser can check each day against one of the games in the North Carolina Education Lottery from Sept. 9 through Oct. 8 to determine the winner. “The biggest problem with raffles is that the buyers can’t be sure the folks who are conducting it are playing it straight with the numbers,” Robinson said. “The way we solve that problem is to use the N.C. Education Lottery’s daily Pick 3 numbers.” A lottery spokesman said the agency does not know of any law that prevents other groups from using publicly released drawing numbers to decide their own raffles. Robinson said he hopes the fundraiser will net the party some $9,000 to $10,000 to “beat Democrats.” “The only people who are upset about gun raffles are people who are hostile to guns and gun owners,” he said. Kevin Farmer, chairman of the Forsyth County Democratic Party, said the move was “disappointing but, given the extremist nature of the Republican Party, not at all surprising.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: State Attorney General Drew Wrigley on Tuesday rejected calls to release body camera footage of a fatal police shooting in Fargo and said he will personally oversee the case himself. Wrigley’s announcement came a day after family members and their supporters demanded to see video in the death of 28-year-old Shane Netterville, of Jamestown. About 50 people gathered Monday evening outside Fargo City Hall in a protest organized by a Native American group. Wrigley said the footage will be made public once all the proceedings are complete. “As a matter of course, law enforcement does not release evidence to the media for public consumption,” he said, noting there are only limited exceptions. Officer Adam O’Brien, an 11-year veteran of the department, shot Netterville on Friday after police responded to a report of people slumped over in a van. A police report said when officers arrived and tried to make contact with the occupants, the vehicle began to travel directly toward officers, and O’Brien fired. Netterville was driving the van, which police said had been reported stolen. Another man was arrested at the scene after he reportedly ignored commands of officers and was found to have methamphetamine. A third person who fled the scene was apprehended Tuesday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The Columbus Division of Police will refer for internal review only one of 24 alleged misconduct cases during the 2020 racial injustice protests presented by an investigative team, police said Tuesday. Columbus Police Chief Elaine Bryant said in a statement that she would only be referring one sergeant to the Internal Affairs Bureau for an administrative investigation. The referrals came after an investigation by retired FBI agent Richard Wozniak and Columbus Special Prosecutor Kathleen Garber, who were tasked in 2020 with looking into alleged criminal misconduct by officers during protests in May and June following the murder of George Floyd Jr. by then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin. In the statement, Bryant said she “immediately put together a team” to see which, if any, of the cases could be investigated further. Bryant noted that any administrative investigation must also comply with the contract with Fraternal Order of Police Capital City Lodge #9, which mandates that all investigations occur within 90 days of the receipt of the complaint. Only one case fell within the 90-day time frame because the clock was stopped while the sergeant’s conduct was under a criminal investigation, Bryant said in the statement. The criminal investigation concluded May 27.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: People who believe they are descendants of victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre can now provide genetic material to help scientists when they begin trying to identify remains of possible victims. Danny Hellwig, laboratory director with Intermountain Forensics, said Wednesday that researchers are not ready to begin trying to match DNA for identification, but an outpouring of requests from local residents on how to provide genetic material led them to begin the process of accepting donations. “That’s what prompted this,” Hellwig said. “We didn’t expect the amount of support and willingness to help … people have jumped out of the woodwork” to offer their DNA for testing. Black people who had ancestors in Tulsa in 1921 are sought, Hellwig said. “What we need is to populate these databases with family lines” of direct descendants, making identifications of the remains possible within days, Hellwig said. “If we’re only matched with very distant relatives, it can take much longer,” with previous efforts to make such matches taking four years or more, he said. The Salt Lake City nonprofit foundation is examining 14 sets of remains removed from a Tulsa cemetery a year ago and has said at least two of the remains contains enough usable DNA for testing for possible identification.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Far-right Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson’s trial started this week on one count of felony riot in connection with a brawl outside a Portland bar in 2019. Jury selection began Monday and is scheduled to continue through Thursday, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. Prosecutors allege Gibson instigated a street fight between Patriot Prayer and anti-fascists May 1, 2019, at the now-closed bar Cider Riot. In an arrest warrant affidavit, Deputy District Attorney Brad Kalbaugh said video of the brawl shows Gibson and his two co-defendants “taunting and physically threatening members of the Antifa group in an effort clearly designed to provoke a physical altercation.” Three other brawl participants with the Patriot Prayer group, Chris Ponte, Ian Kramer and Matthew Cooper, were indicted and pleaded guilty. Kramer, who knocked a woman unconscious and fractured her vertebrae with a baton, pleaded guilty to riot, assault and unlawful use of a weapon. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison and five years of probation. Ponte, who prosecutors said threw a rock and hurt a woman, pleaded guilty to a riot charge in a plea deal. He was sentenced to three years probation and 10 days in jail. Cooper pleaded guilty to riot and was sentenced to three years’ probation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The governor tweeted he had “big news” Tuesday, announcing the state budget passed in recent days includes funding for three new state parks. Gov. Tom Wolf’s press secretary, Beth Rementer, subsequently said the park sites haven’t been chosen, but work to identify and purchase the land is underway by the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The state’s 2022-23 spending plan includes $56 million to add the new state parks to what is currently a 121-park system. The three will be the first new state parks in Pennsylvania since 2005, not counting Washington Crossing, which was transferred from the state Historical and Museum Commission. The money will also help develop the state’s first park for the use of all-terrain vehicles and similar motorized recreational vehicles. “Our beautiful state parks are among the finest in the nation,” Wolf tweeted. “I’m proud that we secured funding in this year’s budget to make this investment in our park system.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A woman who authorities say pretended to be a decorated Marine Corps veteran with cancer to fraudulently collect about $250,000 in veterans benefits and charitable contributions has agreed to plead guilty, federal prosecutors said Tuesday. Sarah Jane Cavanaugh, 31, of East Greenwich, signed an agreement in U.S. District Court in Providence under which she will admit to wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, forgery, and fraudulent use of medals, U.S. Attorney Zachary Cunha said in a statement. She has also agreed to pay more than $82,000 in restitution. She faces more than 20 years in prison, but prosecutors have agreed to recommend a sentence on the low end of sentencing guidelines, according to court documents. Cavanaugh’s attorney, Kensley Barrett, said Tuesday that while he appreciates the interest that the case has garnered, he has no comment at this time. There is no record of Cavanaugh ever serving in the U.S. military, according to authorities. However, she did work as a licensed social worker for the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Providence. Through her job, she gained access to documents, personal information and medical records belonging to a real veteran with cancer, which she used to create fraudulent documents and medical records in her name, prosecutors said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawyer for disgraced attorney Alex Murdaugh said Tuesday that investigators have indicated they intend to pursue murder charges against him for the deaths of his wife and son, who were fatally shot outside their home more than a year ago. Lawyer Jim Griffin said in a statement that the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division told Murdaugh family members they plan to seek indictments from a grand jury later this week. “We won’t have any comment until charges are actually brought against Alex,” Griffin said. Officials with both state police and the attorney general’s office would not comment on whether authorities were pursuing the indictments, which were first reported by news and opinion website FITSNews. Murdaugh already faces dozens of criminal charges that have piled up in the months since his wife Maggie, 52, and their 22-year-old son, Paul, were killed. But until now he has not been charged in connection with their deaths; he’s repeatedly denied any role in those killings. The deaths led to at least a half-dozen investigations into Murdaugh and his finances resulting in charges that he stole $8.5 million from people who hired him and that he lied to police in saying he was shot by a stranger on a roadside when – officials say – he really asked a friend to kill him so his surviving son could collect a $10 million life insurance policy.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Citizens who called the National Weather Service concerned about some “silvery objects” in the sky around the city this week prompted the agency to tweet that the objects were not aliens but rather test balloons launched by a South Dakota aerospace subsidiary. “Sorry, not aliens,” the NWS tweeted in response to the calls it received. The high-altitude balloons were launched by Raven Aerostar, a subsidiary of Raven Industries. “As a South Dakota company and the world leader in stratospheric balloon technology, our team conducts stratospheric balloon flights throughout the year, and many of them are launched from our dedicated hangar near Baltic,” Aerostar president Jim Nelson said. “Two of our Thunderhead Balloon Systems are currently over Sioux Falls.” The balloons, which look like hot air balloons, operate miles above the surface of the earth. Once a balloon reaches the stratosphere, it changes from a teardrop to a pumpkin shape, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Aerostar said the balloons have a variety of uses, including monitoring wildfires, expanding cellular networks and military reconnaissance. They navigate by autonomously changing altitude to take advantage of wind currents in the atmosphere.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is increasing its investment by $1.4 billion for a strategic plan that includes programs advancing the study and treatment of pediatric cancer and other catastrophic diseases, the hospital said Wednesday. The additional funding is part of a six-year expansion plan that launched last year, and it will raise the six-year operating and capital budget to $12.9 billion, the Memphis-based hospital said in a news release. New funding will affect scientific operations, clinical care, global medicine and infrastructure. The number of new jobs will increase from from 1,400 to 2,300, while funds for construction, renovation and capital needs will rise from from $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion, the hospital said. As part of the expansion plan, more investment will be seen in areas including structural biology, advanced microscopy, data sciences, global childhood cancer care, and collaborative projects involving St. Jude and scientists across the U.S. and the world, the hospital said. Additional funds also will be used on construction projects including Domino’s Village, a 140-unit housing facility; the Family Commons, a treatment-free zone for patients and their families to rest and enjoy themselves; and two 15-story towers dedicated to patient care and clinical research, St. Jude said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: University of Texas student leaders are advocating for campus officials to “protect reproductive rights” and take action in response to the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade last month and the state’s ban on abortions. A statement released by the student-run UT Coalition for Reproductive Justice and Rights on Tuesday includes a series of demands, including calling for UT leadership to expand sex education and reproductive health care resources, support adding an emergency contraceptive vending machine on campus, and advocate for reproductive health care access. “We unequivocally support reproductive rights, justice, and autonomy for all. The right to control our bodies and the ability to make healthcare decisions that should be private should not belong to any government or anyone other than ourselves,” the statement said. “We stand in solidarity with all abortion-seekers affected by this decision.” Sameeha Rizvi, vice president of the student-run UT Senate, said the coalition published the statement to emphasize “the lack of response from the university” to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She said students believed that collective action would help persuade UT to potentially take action on the demands.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man is in custody after police say he admitted attempting to hang one man and killing another as part of a “purge” that he claimed was directed by a higher power. Christian Francis Taele, 28, was arrested after police responding to a report of an assault found the 23-year-old victim strung from a piece of gym equipment at an apartment complex in Ogden on Saturday evening. It was unclear if Taele had an attorney who can speak on his behalf. KSL-TV reports he is being held for investigation of attempted murder. Witnesses said Taele, of Lake Shore, approached the victim, strangled him with a rope or strap, and kicked him numerous times before dragging him into the gym. The man was hospitalized and had no signs of brain activity. “The attack was unprovoked, and there is no indication that either the suspect or victim have ever spoken prior to the attack,” police wrote in an affidavit. While Ogden police were interviewing Taele, investigators say he confessed to a homicide in Spanish Fork and provided details of the slaying and the crime scene that had not been publicized. In that case, the body of 49-year-old Ryan Hooley was found next to a trash bin Friday.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: Leaders of the Vermont Army National Guard are investigating allegations of misconduct in recent months following a report made public last year on the Guard’s culture and policies. Vermont Adj. Gen. Greg Knight said in a statement Monday that he could not elaborate on the investigations but that it’s critical for members to know that “all members are, and will continue to be held accountable regardless of rank or position.” “I am disappointed that poor decisions and behavior continue to happen, but am glad to see our members report bad behavior when they see it,” he said. In November 2019, Knight requested an assessment by the National Guard Bureau Office of Complex Investigations. The 113-page report released last year found the Vermont National Guard’s sexual assault polices lacked specifics to ensure compliance, a prevention program had inadequate resources, and many personnel perceived favoritism and a “good old boy” network. The investigation concluded that “the command climate and culture within the VTNG is generally sound, though there is room for improvement,” and made 35 recommendations. “Our people are by far the most important part of our organization,” Knight said in the statement. “These investigations are a result of our people trusting the process, and reporting aberrant behavior to the chain of command.”\n\nVirginia\n\nWhitewood: Flooding in a remote pocket of southwest Virginia has damaged more than 100 homes and left some 40 people unaccounted for, but there are no confirmed deaths or injuries, authorities said Wednesday. First responders in Buchanan County began receiving reports of rising water and damage Tuesday night, authorities said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. After daybreak, crews conducted aerial surveys to examine the extent of the disaster. Several small communities in the Virginia county that borders West Virginia and Kentucky were affected, according to the sheriff’s office. About 40 people – a mix of adults and children – were reported unaccounted for, but that number was expected to decrease as swift-water rescue teams continued to survey the area, authorities said. A shelter was established at a local school. Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Eric Breeding said the number of persons unaccounted for was based on relatives trying to contact a resident in an area where there may be limited or no phone service. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that they are in trouble or in danger. They’re just letting us know that we need to check on these people,” Breeding said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A man was arrested on suspicion of threatening to kill U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, prosecutors said. According to King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office spokesperson Casey McNerthney, a judge on Monday ordered the 48-year-old man to remain jailed in lieu of $500,000 bail but denied prosecutors’ request for an anti-harassment order protecting Jayapal, The Seattle Times reports. In 2016, Jayapal became the first Indian American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She is a Democrat who heads the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Seattle police arrested the man outside Jayapal’s house at 11:25 p.m. Saturday after she called 911 and reported an unknown person or people were in a vehicle using obscene language, a probable cause statement said. She told a dispatcher her husband thought someone may have fired a pellet gun, the statement said. Officers arrested a man who was standing in the middle of the street with his hands in the air and a .40-caliber handgun holstered on his waist, the probable cause statement said. A neighbor told police she heard the man yell something to the effect of “go back to India, I’m going to kill you,” the statement said. The neighbor also said the man drove by Jayapal’s residence at least three times, yelling profanities.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A helicopter crash last month that killed six people occurred when the aircraft hit a rock face 15 minutes after takeoff from a local airport, federal investigators said in a preliminary report Tuesday. The Vietnam-era Bell UH-1B “Huey” helicopter struck the rock face in an area about 4 miles from Logan County Airport in Amherstdale, National Transportation Safety Board investigators said in the report. The cockpit and cabin then crashed into a roadway and a guardrail and were consumed by fire. Investigators have not yet released any information about the cause of the accident. A final report could take a year or two to complete, they said. The June 22 flight was the last scheduled for the day during a multiday reunion for helicopter enthusiasts where visitors could sign up to ride or fly the historic Huey helicopter, described by organizers as one of the last of its kind still flying. The helicopter was flown by the 114th Assault Helicopter Company, “The Knights of the Sky,” in Vinh Long, Vietnam, throughout much of the 1960s, according to the website for MARPAT Aviation, a Logan County flight school that operated the helicopter. After the Huey returned to the U.S. in 1971, the website says, it was featured in movies such as “Die Hard, “The Rock” and “Under Siege: Dark Territory.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A federal judge is siding with the Sun Prairie School District in a lawsuit filed by two Black parents who objected to their children’s middle school assignment that asked students how they would punish a slave in ancient Mesopotamia. Dazrrea Ervins and Priscilla Jones claimed the Black History Month assignment in February 2021 violated their civil rights as well as those of their children. The question was not part of the school district’s curriculum on ancient Mesopotamia. Three teachers came up with the assignment on their own, according to an internal investigation. The teachers were placed on administrative leave and later resigned, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Along with complaints about the assignment, the lawsuit also accused the district of discriminating against one of the children for his learning disability and failing to protect him from racist bullying. U.S. District Judge James Peterson, in Wisconsin’s Western District, said the parents failed to show evidence that their civil rights or those of their children were violated by the assignment. “A reasonable jury certainly could find that its content and timing were offensive, insensitive and justifiably upset students and their families,” Peterson wrote. “But a hostile environment claim requires much more than a single upsetting episode.”\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Local search and rescue responders are hoping to raise donations for a helicopter and secure county support to cover operational costs, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Teton County Sheriff Matt Carr announced the campaign Monday, saying the county’s search and rescue team responded to a record number of calls for service last year, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/14"}]}
