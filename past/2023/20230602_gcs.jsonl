The recommendations are virtually unchanged from prior guidance but are now supported by additional research, the group said.\n\nThe recommendations are a little more conservative than guidelines put out by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, and some doctors wonder if they should be more aggressive.\n\nHeart disease is the number one killer for men and women in the world. One person dies every 34 seconds in the US from cardiovascular disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Task Force’s guidance\n\nSpecifically, the USPSTF guidance published Tuesday in JAMA recommends statins for adults ages 40 to 75 who have one or more risk factors of cardiovascular disease and a 10% or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years. Those risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking or high cholesterol. To calculate a person’s risk score, doctors also take into account factors like a person’s age, sex, race, blood pressure, cholesterol numbers and family history.\n\nFor people who have a slightly lower 7.5% to 10% risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years, the latest guidance recommends that they talk to their doctor and then decide if they should take statins.\n\nBecause the risk is slightly lower with this group, the benefits are smaller, even though they are still effective. In this case, the patient should talk to their doctor to determine if, based on individual factors, they need to take one. “There are other factors at the individual level that a healthcare professional and a patient can together decide what might be best for that patient because there are other ways of lowering your risk for having a stroke or first heart attack,” according to task force member Dr. John Wong, a professor of medicine at Tufts University. That includes things like diet and exercise.\n\nFor adults 76 and older, there was not enough research to make a recommendation about taking a statin for the first time.\n\nThe last time USPSTF revised its statin guidelines was in 2016. Since then, there have been several new studies that determine how effective statins are, Wong said.\n\nThe bottom line, Wong said, is that 40 years of science have shown that statins are safe and a good primary prevention that can reduce a person’s risk of developing or dying from heart problems.\n\nTo make these recommendations, USPSTF reviewed 26 studies to compare the results from people who took statins and those who didn’t. The studies involved more than half a million patients.\n\n“Statins were significantly associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality,” the study said. This was true for all demographics.\n\nThe risk of taking statins, based on these studies, seemed small. In the past there had been some concern that statins may elevate a person’s risk for muscle problems or diabetes, but other than one study that involved high-intensity statin therapy, on the balance, these latest studies used to create these guidelines did not show real increase in either problem, experts said.\n\nWhat other guidelines recommend\n\nAn editorial that accompanied the recommendations in JAMA suggested that these guidelines should have been more aggressive and better matched to cholesterol guidelines recommended by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. Those guidelines recommend statins for adults ages 40 to 75 who have a 7.5% or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years, as opposed to a 10% risk. The ACC/AHA guidelines also recommend statins for patients with diabetes without having to also calculate a person’s 10-year risk score and recommend statins for those patients with extremely high levels of cholesterol.\n\n“Individuals with higher baseline risks have greater absolute benefits from intervention than the lower-risk population. Were statins either risky or expensive, such a tailored treatment strategy would be reasonable. However, statins are now available as generic drugs and are both safe and affordable,” wrote the doctors at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas in an editorial.\n\nDr. Edward Fry, the president of the ACC, said it is important to keep in mind that the USPSTF guidelines are statements that are to be applied to a broad group or population of patients, whereas the ACC/AHA guidelines are directed more toward the individual. Neither make statins an automatic decision for a patient.\n\n“Any medical decision needs to be made in an individual context and these guidelines give a sort of roadmap. There may be several different routes to get to where you want to go, but this is a roadmap,” Fry said. “The distinctions between the guidelines are relatively small.”\n\nOne area not touched on in the USPSTF guidelines, for instance, is a person’s coronary calcium score. A heart scan can look for calcium in the coronary arteries. There’s a relationship between calcium and plaque. For a patient that is borderline between a high or intermediate risk, that score could be used as another determining factor.\n\nOther factors ACC/AHA’s guidelines take into account that are not a part of the USPSTF calculus, are what doctors call “risk enhancers” that could also help with decisions about those borderline cases. For example, a 35-year-old who has a family history of heart disease and high cholesterol would not be included in these guidelines, but may be a good candidate for a statin, according to Dr. Salim Virani, a professor of medicine in the section of cardiovascular research at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\n“The risk enhancers may increase a patient’s short-term, 10-year risk, or in some cases, their lifetime risk of having a cardiovascular event, then those guidelines recommend that clinicians should err on the side of early treatment, something not considered in the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations,” Virani said. “But I do want to emphasize, even if clinicians were to take the more conservative US Preventive Service Task Force recommendations and follow them very, very aggressively, we definitely will see a population-level impact because of the statin therapy. It’s really been studied for a very, very long time and now we know it works.”\n\nDr. Ian Neeland, a cardiologist at the University Hospitals Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute and the Director of UH Center for Cardiovascular Prevention, who did not work on either guidelines, said the other big takeaway from the USPSTF is a “reaffirmation” of their earlier guidelines and that the science they used clearly show that statins are safe.\n\n“Overall, the serious risk for serious, adverse events is very low and so the risk benefit will usually be in favor of a statin for individuals at risk,” Neeland said.\n\n“Statins can be very helpful for long-term risk reduction and with very minimal side effects and great benefits. It’s one of those key medications that have changed the face of medicine,” Neeland added.\n\nAlso he said it’s important to keep in mind that guidelines are just guidelines. “They need to be used in clinical context and within the art and science of medicine,” Neeland said.\n\nVirani said more has to be done to prevent heart problems.\n\n“We are definitely facing a big wave of cardiovascular disease in our nation and we really need to treat it by both lifestyle therapies as well as medications when indicated,” Virani said.\n\nWhat patients can do\n\nVirani said it’s important for patients to ask their providers what their 10-year risk of having a heart attack or stroke is. It’s a calculation that needs the knowledge of an expert and cannot be done on one’s own.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“Having this conversation does not mean you need to be put on a therapy, but it will lead to a lot of important discussions even related to your lifestyle,” Virani said.\n\nAnd statins, of course, aren’t the only way to help a person prevent a heart attack or stroke.\n\nBoth USPSTF and ACC/AHA recommend patients should stop smoking, be physically active and eat a healthy diet to lower their risk.\n\n“Statins are one piece of the prevention wheel. They are not the only piece,” Neeland said. “There’s diet, physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, blood pressure control, making sure you control diabetes or a risk for diabetes. All those aspects play into heart health. Statin medication is one way to reduce risk.”", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/health/juul-taken-off-market-fda/index.html", "title": "FDA orders Juul Labs to remove products from US market | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has ordered Juul Labs Inc. products to be removed from the US market as the agency issued marketing denial orders for its vaping devices and pods.\n\n“As a result, the company must stop selling and distributing these products. In addition, those currently on the U.S. market must be removed, or risk enforcement action,” the FDA said on Thursday.\n\nIn a separate statement on Thursday, Juul said it is seeking a stay and will consider appealing the decision.\n\nAfter reviewing Juul’s applications seeking marketing authorization for its products, the FDA said it determined that the applications lacked “sufficient evidence” regarding the toxicological profile of the products in order to demonstrate that marketing of the products would be appropriate for the protection of the public health.\n\n“This action by FDA reflects the agency’s steadfast commitment to carefully evaluating the science to ensure that only those products meeting its rigorous public health standards are granted marketing authorization. FDA has taken the proper steps to protect the health of all Americans,” US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement Thursday.\n\nJuul devices and four types of pods – tobacco and menthol-flavored – cannot be sold or distributed, the FDA said, and “retailers should contact JUUL with any questions about products in their inventory.” In 2019, the company announced it would stop selling several flavored products and only tobacco and menthol flavors remained for sale.\n\nThe FDA added that it reviewed the company’s premarket tobacco product applications and determined some of Juul Labs’ study findings had “insufficient and conflicting data – including regarding genotoxicity and potentially harmful chemicals leaching from the company’s proprietary e-liquid pods – that have not been adequately addressed.”\n\n“The FDA is tasked with ensuring that tobacco products sold in this country meet the standard set by the law, but the responsibility to demonstrate that a product meets those standards ultimately falls on the shoulders of the company,” said Michele Mital, acting director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, in the agency’s news release. “As with all manufacturers, JUUL had the opportunity to provide evidence demonstrating that the marketing of their products meets these standards. However, the company did not provide that evidence and instead left us with significant questions. Without the data needed to determine relevant health risks, the FDA is issuing these marketing denial orders.”\n\nThe FDA action focuses on importation, distribution and sales, not individual use, and it “cannot and will not enforce against individual consumer possession or use of JUUL products or any other tobacco products.”\n\nJuul considering an appeal\n\n“We respectfully disagree with the FDA’s findings and decision and continue to believe we have provided sufficient information and data based on high-quality research to address all issues raised by the agency,” Joe Murillo, the company’s chief regulatory officer at Juul Labs, said in a statement.\n\n“In our applications, which we submitted over two years ago, we believe that we appropriately characterized the toxicological profile of JUUL products, including comparisons to combustible cigarettes and other vapor products, and believe this data, along with the totality of the evidence, meets the statutory standard of being ‘appropriate for the protection of the public health,’ ” Murillo said. “We intend to seek a stay and are exploring all of our options under the FDA’s regulations and the law, including appealing the decision and engaging with our regulator.”\n\nIn other words, the company could sue the FDA, and if a stay is issued, that would allow Juul products to remain on the market while the company appeals the FDA’s decision.\n\n“Predictions of doom and gloom for Juul are understandable, but may be proven to be premature,” Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association wrote in an email to CNN.\n\n‘The most significant step’\n\nIn the past, Juul Labs Inc. has sold some of the most popular vaping products in the United States, especially its flavored products.\n\nWhile e-cigarette products have been on the market without authorization, they have grown in popularity among young people, leading to a vaping epidemic in high schools nationwide.\n\nIn a national survey from last year, more than 2 million US teens said they use e-cigarettes, with a quarter of them saying they vape daily.\n\nEven with many middle and high school students spending more time at home because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the survey found that they still reported using e-cigarettes and other vape devices.\n\n“FDA’s decision to turn down Juul’s application represents the most significant step FDA has taken to reverse the youth e-cigarette epidemic,” said Matthew Myers, the president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n\n“Juul more than any other company has been responsible for creating and fueling the youth e-cigarette epidemic,” Myers told CNN. “Denying Juul both impacts a product that is currently widely used among kids, and hopefully sends a message to the entire industry that FDA is now serious about preventing them from marketing to kids.”\n\nMany public health experts now say that the FDA’s decision on the marketing of Juul products has been a long time coming.\n\n“This is long overdue, and most welcome,” Erika Sward, the assistant vice president of national advocacy for the American Lung Association, told CNN. “But we also have to recognize that what the FDA needs to do now is enforce it and make sure these products get off the market entirely.”\n\nWhat led to the FDA’s decision\n\nE-cigarette products have been sold for years and some argue they can work as a tool to help adults quit smoking traditional cigarettes. But until recently, none have officially been authorized by the FDA.\n\nPrior to August 8, 2016, e-cigarettes, cigars and hookah products were not regulated by FDA. That’s because, as the FDA notes, “the original grant of authority from Congress in 2009 only covered cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigarette tobacco, and roll-your-own tobacco.”\n\nThen, e-cigarettes and other vape products became subject to the FDA’s tobacco authority and have been somewhat in regulatory limbo since August 2016, according to the FDA. The products on the market at that time needed to have FDA authorization to be legally marketed, but the agency had deferred enforcement of the authorization requirements – as, what it has called “an exercise of its enforcement discretion” – and no products were authorized.\n\nA July 2019 court decision placed a 10-month deadline on e-cigarette companies to apply to the FDA for public health review. Any products that missed that application deadline of May 2020 could have been pulled from the market by the FDA, while those that did apply could stay on the market for up to a year while under review.\n\nThen came the Covid-19 pandemic – and, as a result, a four-month extension of that deadline to September 9, 2020.\n\nSo for e-cigarette products and others deemed as a “new tobacco product,” the FDA issued a policy allowing manufacturers to submit applications for authorization by the new deadline of September 9, 2020. Since then, the FDA has been reviewing applications for products and deciding to approve or reject the sale of each product.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nLast year, in October, the FDA for the first time authorized e-cigarette products – giving permission to R.J. Reynolds to sell three of its Vuse vape products. The agency emphasized that the action allowed the products to be sold, but it didn’t meant they were safe.\n\n“All tobacco products are harmful and addictive and those who do not use tobacco products should not start,” the FDA said in a statement at the time.\n\nIn March, the agency said it had taken action on 99% of the nearly 6.7 million e-cigarette products that were submitted for premarket authorization. The agency said it had denied authorization to more than 1 million e-cigarette products.\n\nBut pending review, many products – including Juul’s – have stayed on the market.", "authors": ["Carma Hassan Jacqueline Howard Jen Christensen", "Carma Hassan", "Jacqueline Howard", "Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/13/asia/new-zealand-tobacco-ban-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "New Zealand bans tobacco sales for next generation | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nNew Zealand passed a historic anti-smoking bill in Parliament on Tuesday, banning the sale of tobacco to anyone born on or after January 1, 2009.\n\nThe ban is aimed at preventing future generations from taking up smoking and is part of a wider government push to make the country “smoke free” by 2025.\n\nThe new law will also slash the number of retailers licensed to sell tobacco, from 6,000 to 600 by the end of 2023.\n\nViolations of the new law are punishable by fines of up to NZ$150,000 (about $96,000).\n\n“Thousands of people will live longer, healthier lives and the health system will be $5 billion better off from not needing to treat the illnesses caused by smoking, such as numerous types of cancer, heart attacks, strokes, amputations,” Associate Health Minister Ayesha Verrall said in a statement.\n\nSmoking rates in New Zealand – already among the world’s lowest – are falling, having decreased from 9.4% to 8% in the past 12 months, according to Verrall.\n\nVerrall said the legislation would help close the life expectancy gap between Maori and non-Maori citizens, which can be as high as 25% for women.\n\nThe legislation – the Smokefree Environments and Regulated Products (Smoked Tobacco) Amendment Bill – will also reduce the amount of nicotine allowed in tobacco products, aiming to make them less addictive.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, New Zealand’s smoking rate is now the lowest since records began, with 56,000 smokers quitting in the past year.\n\nHowever, vaping – which the new legislation does not cover – remains popular among young New Zealanders.

Flu activity in the United States often starts to increase in October and usually peaks between December and February.\n\n“We can confirm that there is a high number of absences at Henry High School due to probable Influenza,” Samer Naji, a spokesperson for the San Diego Unified School District, said in an email to CNN on Thursday. There were about 1,000 absences Wednesday, out of 2,600 students.\n\n“So far COVID tests have been negative but several students have tested positive for flu,” Naji said. “Typical signs and symptoms include cough, sore throat, runny nose, fever, and other upper respiratory infection symptoms. We are in close contact with San Diego County Public Health.”\n\nSan Diego County Public Health Services confirmed to CNN that it is investigating the large outbreak of respiratory and flu-like symptoms among students at Patrick Henry High School – as well as Del Norte High School in Poway, California.\n\n“Del Norte High School (in the Poway Unified School District) had nearly 400 students absent yesterday and Tuesday with cold and flu like symptoms,” Christine Paik, spokesperson at Poway Unified School District, told CNN on Wednesday. “Health officials have told us that the cold/flu season is definitely here and it’s hitting schools harder now that COVID restrictions are no longer in place.”\n\nSan Diego County Public Health Services announced Wednesday that “it is too early” to determine the cause of the outbreaks and that the county is evaluating.\n\n“We are coordinating with local school districts and are checking with other school campuses to try and figure out why so many students have been affected so suddenly,” Dr. Cameron Kaiser, the county’s deputy public health officer, said in an announcement Wednesday.\n\n“Unfortunately, we anticipated this would be a rough influenza season, and alongside COVID-19 other respiratory viruses are also making a rapid comeback,” Kaiser said. “If you haven’t already, now is the time to get your flu and COVID-19 shots to gain the extra protections afforded by the vaccines.”\n\nEarly increases in flu activity sweep the US\n\nAn early increase in seasonal flu activity has been reported in most of the United States, with the nation’s southeast and south-central areas reporting the highest levels of flu, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than a thousand patients have been hospitalized with flu this week, the agency said.\n\n“Nationally, the percentage of specimens testing positive for influenza in clinical laboratories is increasing; however, activity varies by region,” CDC researchers wrote in the agency’s latest weekly flu report, published Friday.\n\nWhile current influenza activity is still overall low, the CDC’s report finds that activity is increasing in most of the country, with three jurisdictions experiencing moderate activity and six jurisdictions experiencing high or very high activity.\n\nThis week, 3.3% of respiratory specimens sent to clinical labs tested positive for influenza, according to the new report. That is a jump from the 0.1% of specimens that tested positive this time last year, and the 0.2% of specimens that tested positive this time in 2020.\n\nHowever, the new data suggest the nation might be returning to pre-Covid levels of flu, as around this time in 2019, 3.1% of specimens were reported as testing positive for flu.\n\nThe new CDC report also said that 1,322 patients were admitted to hospitals with influenza this week and there were three deaths in children this week associated with influenza.\n\nOverall, the most frequently reported flu viruses this week were influenza A (H3N2), according to the report, and 2.6% of outpatient visits to health care providers were for respiratory illnesses that included symptoms such as fever plus a cough or sore throat. That is above the national baseline, which is 2.5%.\n\n“An annual flu vaccine is the best way to protect against flu. Vaccination helps prevent infection and can also prevent serious outcomes in people who get vaccinated but still get sick with flu,” according to the report.\n\n“CDC recommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get a flu vaccine, ideally by the end of October. There are also prescription flu antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness; those need to be started as early as possible.”\n\n‘It’s gathering speed already … about a month early’\n\nPredicting what influenza activity might look like in a particular year can be tricky, but doctors are bracing for “a very substantial” flu season, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\n“I’m concerned that we will have a very substantial influenza season coming up this year, very different from our two previous seasons,” he said.\n\nSigns of increased flu activity were first seen in the Southern Hemisphere this summer, and as more people in the Northern Hemisphere relax Covid-19 restrictions and return to socializing without masks and in large crowds, cases of flu are being reported. The widespread number of cases so early in the flu season is unusual.\n\n“Here we are in the middle of October – not the middle of November – we’re already seeing scattered influenza cases, even hospitalized influenza cases, around the country,” Schaffner, whose medical center at Vanderbilt University is part of a surveillance network that tracks hospitalized flu cases.\n\n“So we know that this virus is now spreading out in the community already. It’s gathering speed already. It looks to me to be about a month early,” Schaffner said.\n\nWhen people began isolating, social distancing and masking to slow the spread of Covid-19 in early 2020, flu all but disappeared in the US. As a result, most people haven’t been exposed to influenza for a few years, meaning immunity against flu viruses could be low and underscoring the need to get vaccinated.\n\nUS health officials are encouraging people to get their flu shots as soon as possible, said Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n“There’s definitely a push now to get flu vaccination to the top of people’s priority lists. We’re all concerned, having seen what’s going on in the Southern Hemisphere, in Australia, that this year’s flu season could be really, really rough, frankly,” Casalotti said.\n\nConcern has grown as officials also brace for possible surges this winter in Covid-19 and other common respiratory viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus or RSV, a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children.\n\nCasalotti said that the spread of influenza can have a significant effects on communities, especially since it can be hard to distinguish flu symptoms from those of Covid-19, common colds or allergies.\n\n“We’re already starting to see in some areas that flu is circulating,” Casalotti said. “Overall, flu activity is low nationwide, but it’s starting to tick up in the Southeast in particular.”\n\nA higher-dose flu shot for older adults\n\nIn August, as concern about the coming flu season grew, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices released a report updating its recommendations for the seasonal flu shot for this year.\n\nTypically, older adults get a higher dose of flu vaccine than younger adults, but in the latest update, ACIP recommended that adults 65 and older “preferentially receive” a higher dose or an adjuvanted flu vaccine.\n\n“There are three of the influenza vaccines that have been shown to work better in people aged 65 and older,” said Schaffner, who is a liaison representative to ACIP. “There is the high-dose vaccine, there’s another that has an adjuvant in it – an immune stimulant – and the third is a recombinant vaccine.” Recombinant flu vaccines do not involve the flu virus or chicken eggs in the manufacturing process.\n\n“If you look back at people aged 65 and older in previous seasons, already 80% of them were receiving one of these three vaccines,” he said. “What’s new this year is that the ACIP has made a distinctively preferential recommendation. They actually said if you’re vaccinating people aged 65 and older, preferentially use one of these three vaccines, and only if one of them is not available use the regular vaccine.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOverall, the CDC recommends that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccine, especially people who could be pregnant – as the vaccine offers protection not only to them but to their baby, Schaffner said.\n\n“There’s an additional benefit,” he said. “Namely, the antibodies created in response to the vaccine, some of it crosses the placenta and goes into the newborn baby. So the newborn baby gets some of that protection during the first four to six months of its life, before we can actively vaccinate the baby.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/26/health/aspirin-heart-health-recommendations-wellness/index.html", "title": "Task force's updated guidelines do not recommend daily aspirin for ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter years of recommending regular aspirin to prevent heart attack and stroke, scientists now see little benefit for most healthy people, and say it may contribute to a risk of bleeding in your stomach or brain that goes up as you get older.\n\nThe US Preventive Service Task Force has finalized its latest recommendations on low-dose aspirin regimens and now says people over 60 should not start taking a daily aspirin for primary prevention of heart problems, in most cases.\n\nIf you are between 40 and 59 years old, the USPSTF leaves it up to you and your doctor to decide whether you should take a daily aspirin in specific circumstances.\n\n“If you are really healthy, if you’re a healthy 40-year-old with no major risk factors, you will do more harm than good with daily aspirin. Your risk of bleeding will exceed the benefits,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at Cleveland Clinic, who was not involved in the new guidelines. “People need to understand that aspirin is not a completely benign or innocent therapy.”\n\nBut if you’ve had a heart attack, a stroke or other heart or circulation problems and your doctor has put you on daily aspirin, don’t stop taking it – instead, talk with them about what the new recommendations mean for you.\n\n“In secondary prevention, aspirin is important. If you have a stent, if you’ve had a myocardial infarction or a stroke, for all of those people, aspirin works. It provides a modest but definite benefit,” Nissen said.\n\nThe USPSTF is a group of independent disease prevention and medical experts from across the country who make recommendations that help guide doctors’ decisions. Their recommendations also affect insurance companies’ reimbursement decisions.\n\nAspirin works by keeping your body from making certain natural substances that cause pain and swelling. It can also keep your blood from clotting, and that’s why doctors recommended it for years to prevent cardiovascular problems like heart attack or stroke.\n\nAccording to the recommendations, published Tuesday in JAMA, your doctor might want to consider an aspirin regimen if you are in the 40-to-59 age range and you have a 10% or higher 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\nThis means your chance of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years is higher than normal, based on a calculation that includes factors like age, sex, race, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, medication use, diabetic status and smoking status. According to the task force, a daily aspirin only “has a small net benefit,” for this group specifically.\n\nStudies drove shift in guidance\n\nThe basis for the updated recommendations is the task force’s review of several significant randomized clinical trials on low-dose aspirin use, which found an association with a lower risk of myocardial infarction and stroke but not a reduction in mortality. Low-dose aspirin was also associated with increases in the risk of bleeding.\n\nThe last time the task force updated these recommendations, in 2016, it suggested that daily aspirin could be of benefit in colorectal cancer prevention. But the updated guidelines say there is limited evidence that it reduces the risk of colorectal cancer risks or mortality from that cancer.\n\nThe 2016 guidelines said there was some merit in daily aspirin use for those 50 to 59 who had a 10-year risk of cardiovascular problems higher than 10%, who were expected to live longer than 10 years and who were not at higher risk of bleeding.\n\nThe 2016 guidelines also suggested that people 60 to 69 with a 10% or higher cardiovascular risk should make an individual decision about taking a daily aspirin.\n\nBleeding problems in people without high-risk conditions like peptic ulcer disease, NSAID use or corticosteroid use are rare, the task force notes, but the risk goes up with age. “Modeling data suggest that it may be reasonable to consider stopping aspirin use around age 75 years.”\n\nCardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer in the US, accounting for more than 1 in 4 deaths, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“The more data we get, the more we’re seeing that even though the risk of coronary disease and heart attack goes up as you get older, the risk of bleeding seems to be going up even faster,” said Dr. James Cireddu, medical director of the Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute at University Hospitals Bedford Medical Center, who did not work on the guidelines.\n\nEarlier changes to heart guidelines\n\nThese are not the only recommendations about daily aspirin use. The new USPSTF guidelines are now more in line with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines and its recommendations for the average person who has never had a cardiac event, according to Dr. Roger Blumenthal, who co-chaired the committee behind the ACC/AHA guidelines.\n\n“When you look at all the studies that have been done recently, it seems that the modest benefit of aspirin and otherwise low-risk individuals is generally negated by the increase in long-term GI problems, bleeding with aspirin,” Blumenthal said. “While we said it could be considered to give aspirin to someone who never had a heart attack or stroke, that should probably be the last of the things on the priority list.”\n\nAspirin still could have some place in heart health, said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, president of the American Heart Association.\n\n“Aspirin might still make sense in some situations, where we’re not doing as good a job controlling cholesterol, blood pressure, for whatever reason,” Lloyd-Jones said. “Maybe the medications are too expensive or a health system in a country can’t distribute those things, aspirin might continue to make sense, but I think in many situations in this country, where if people have good access to health care and they are taking care of other risk factors, aspirin now makes a lot less sense.”\n\nYou can take other steps to help your heart health with just a little effort, said Dr. Roy Buchinsky, director of wellness at University Hospitals in Ohio, who was not involved in the new USPSTF guidelines.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We always preach that DNA is not your destiny, meaning there are so many things we can do from a lifestyle perspective that can reduce chronic illness and your risk for a heart disease and stroke,” Buchinsky said.\n\nHe suggests a good diet with “real food” 90% of the time and 10% “fun food.” Aim for at least 150 minutes of physical activity a week, get plenty of sleep and target stress. Don’t smoke, and keep drinking to a minimum. Medications for cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure can also help if needed, but he said it’s even better if a patient doesn’t need them.\n\n“It’s a lot easier to prevent than cure,” Buchinsky said.", "authors": ["Jen Christensen"], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/health/alcohol-by-age-study-wellness/index.html", "title": "No amount of alcohol is healthy if you're under 40, study says | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.

For all other causes, it’s harmful at all levels of consumption.”\n\nIndeed, the study found no protective effect for diseases such as tuberculosis, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, liver disease, epilepsy, pancreatitis and many cancers.\n\n“Alcohol guidelines, both global ones and national ones, have typically emphasized the difference between consumption level for men compared to women,” Gakidou said. “What our work suggests is that global guidelines, national guidelines and local guidelines would be more effective if they emphasize age as opposed to sex.”\n\nThe findings underscore “the importance of alcohol recommendations that are tailored to specific regions and populations,” Amanda Berger, vice president of science and health for the trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, told CNN in an email.\n\n“Importantly, no one should drink alcohol to obtain potential health benefits, and some individuals should not drink at all.”\n\nYounger than 40 found at highest risk\n\nThe report, released Thursday in the journal Lancet, is the first to report alcohol risk by global geographical region, age, sex and year, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which prepared the study.\n\nThe analysis looked at 30 years of data on people ages 15 to 95 from 204 countries and territories gathered by the institute’s Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, which tracks premature death and disability from over 300 diseases.\n\nThe analysis estimated that 1.34 billion people around the world consumed harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020. More than 59% of the people who drank unsafe amounts of alcohol were between 15 and 39. Over two-thirds were men.\n\nIn every geographic region, the study found drinking alcohol does not provide any health benefits to people under age 40 but does raise the risk of injury, such as motor vehicle accidents, suicides and homicides.\n\nThe study defined a standard drink as 10 grams of pure alcohol, which might be a small 3.4-fluid ounce (100 milliliters) glass of red wine, a 12-fluid ounce (355 milliliters) standard can or bottle of beer (3.5% alcohol) or a 1-fluid ounce shot of spirits (30 milliliters) that is 40% alcohol by volume.\n\nConclusions criticized\n\nWhile praising the analysis as well-conducted, some experts not involved with the research expressed concern about the study’s conclusions.\n\nStatistics show there are “over 14 times as many alcohol-attributable deaths in the UK among 70-74 year-olds than 20-24 year olds,” said Colin Angus, a senior research fellow at the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the UK’s University of Sheffield, in a statement. The data “contradicts the assertion in this new study that we should focus on the drinking of younger age groups,” Angus said.\n\n“The elephant in the room with this study is the interpretation of risk based on outcomes for cardiovascular disease – particularly in older people,” said Dr. Tony Rao, visiting clinical research fellow at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King’s College London.\n\n“We know that any purported health benefits from alcohol on the heart and circulation are balanced out by the increased risk from other conditions such as cancer, liver disease and mental disorders such as depression and dementia,” Rao said in a statement.\n\nA study published in March found just one pint of beer or glass of wine a day can shrink the overall volume of the brain, with the damage increasing as the number of daily drinks rises. On average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank half of a beer.\n\nResearch in the US has shown drinking among adults rose during pandemic, particularly among women, with “a 41% increase in heavy drinking days,” said Dr. Sarah Wakeman, medical director of the Substance Use Disorders Initiative at Massachusetts General Hospital, in an earlier CNN interview.\n\nA study published in June found many moderate drinkers over age 30 binge on the weekend – defined as five or more drinks in a row or within a short period of time. Drinking an average of more than one drink a day for women and two drinks a day for men – or five or more drinks on the same occasion – was linked to alcohol problems nine years later.\n\nWomen are especially sensitive to the effects of alcohol, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, or NIAA. Alcohol-related problems appear sooner and at lower drinking levels than in men, it said.\n\nWomen are more susceptible to alcohol-related brain damage and heart disease than men, and studies show women who have one drink a day increase their risk of breast cancer by 5% to 9% compared with those who abstain.\n\n“The recommendation that those under 40 should not drink at all is totally unrealistic,” Matt Lambert, CEO of the Portman Group, an industry-funded group that regulates alcohol marketing in the UK, said in an email.\n\nGakidou, the study’s senior author, admitted that “it’s not realistic to think young adults will stop drinking. Still, we think it’s important to communicate the latest evidence so that everyone can make informed decisions about their health.”\n\nFor those over age 65, any increase in drinking is worrisome because many older adults “use medications that can interact with alcohol, have health conditions that can be exacerbated by alcohol, and may be more susceptible to alcohol-related falls and other accidental injuries,” the NIAA said.\n\n“There is a high threshold for being able to say that alcohol is an effective prevention therapy, and the studies so far do not reach that threshold. If they did, then you can be sure that the drinks industry would be applying to the FDA for a license,” said Dr. Nick Sheron, a professor in the hepatology department at the UK’s University of Southampton.\n\n‘A more detailed and nuanced analysis’\n\nThe Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation last published a report on alcohol four years ago when it analyzed 2016 Global Burden of Disease data on people 15 to 49, finding no amount of liquor, wine or beer was safe for overall health.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“What we have done in this new study is a more detailed and nuanced analysis of 21 different world regions,” Gakidou said. “What we’ve been able to do now is break it down: Who is alcohol harmful for? Who is alcohol beneficial to? That’s why the message is coming across as different, but it is actually consistent with what we said before.\n\n“If you ask me, ‘Will the message be different in 10 years?’ Maybe.

The data included a total of 151,573 survey respondents, all in middle or high school in the United States.\n\nThe data showed that, between 2014 and 2021, the age at which adolescents first started using e-cigarettes decreased and the intensity of their use increased – rising from using e-cigarettes about nine or fewer days a month to 10 or more days a month.\n\nThe researchers found that the average age at first use got younger over time, by about 1.9 months per calendar year, for e-cigarettes but remained stable for other tobacco products. The mean age of survey respondents was 14.5 years old.\n\nAmong adolescents who currently use any type of tobacco product, the proportion whose first-ever use of a product at a young age was an e-cigarette increased from 27.2% in 2014 to 78.3% in 2019, and remained at 77% in 2021, according to the data.\n\n‘Concerning’ trends in the intensity of use\n\nThe overall prevalence of e-cigarette use peaked in 2019 and then declined. But by 2019, more e-cigarette users were using within the first five minutes of waking up each day compared with traditional cigarette users.\n\n“The changes detected in this survey study may reflect the higher levels of nicotine delivery and addiction liability of modern e-cigarettes that use protonated nicotine to make nicotine easier to inhale,” the researchers wrote.\n\n“The increasing intensity of use of modern e-cigarettes highlights the clinical need to address youth addiction to these new high-nicotine products over the course of many clinical encounters. In addition, stronger regulation, including comprehensive bans on the sale of flavored tobacco products, should be implemented.”\n\nThis study’s findings suggest that e-cigarettes may be putting a new generation of adolescents at risk for nicotine addiction, and research has shown that many adolescents are unaware that most e-cigarettes contain nicotine, said Ashley Merianos, a research affiliate member of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center and the Thirdhand Smoke Research Consortium, who was not involved in the new study.\n\n“It is encouraging that the prevalence of e-cigarette use has declined among U.S. adolescents from 2019 to 2021. However, the addiction and intensity of use trends reported in this study are concerning, especially since tobacco use is typically established during adolescence,” Merianos, who is also a faculty researcher at the University of Cincinnati, said in an email.\n\n“Unfortunately, early nicotine addiction could overturn the significant tobacco control progress made over many decades,” she said. “Currently, cigarette smoking is at a record low among U.S. adolescents, but the continued initiation and use of e-cigarettes among adolescents could halt this progress.”\n\nIn 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration banned flavored cartridge-based e-cigarettes, other than tobacco or menthol, from the market. But the researchers noted in their study that after the ban, disposable flavored e-cigarettes rapidly gained popularity among adolescents, and they are calling for clinicians to be on alert for possible cases of nicotine addiction among young people.\n\n“Because tobacco addiction is a chronic disease, clinicians should be ready to address youth addiction to these new high-nicotine products during the course of many clinical encounters,” the researchers wrote in their study. “The increasing intensity of use of modern e-cigarettes highlights the need for local, state, and federal comprehensive bans on the sale of flavored tobacco products and consideration of ending the sale of these products on the open retail market, as has been done in 47 countries as of 2021.”\n\nConcern over ‘more severe nicotine addiction’\n\nThe new study is among the first to examine nicotine use among adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic, said Dr. Scott Hadland, chief of adolescent and young adult medicine at Mass General for Children and Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the new research.\n\n“Most of us pediatricians haven’t been certain about what to expect with regard to teen nicotine use amid these upheavals – but had been worried. This study fills a big knowledge gap,” Hadland said in an email.\n\n“National data suggest that adolescent vaping may have declined during the Covid pandemic – we suspect because substance use often occurs when teens are among their peers, and Covid socially isolated many teens,” he said. “But in my clinic, I have been seeing that the teens that ‘do’ vape are showing more severe nicotine addiction now than in all my years of practice.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHadland added that the new study findings match what he has seen on the front lines in his own practice, including the earlier age at which youth start to use e-cigarettes, higher frequency of use, and greater symptoms of addiction, such as vaping first thing in the morning.\n\n“Teens who vape often receive high levels of nicotine consistently throughout the day, which leads to greater nicotine dependence and risk for addiction. As a result, I routinely see teens who experience uncomfortable nicotine withdrawal if they try to stop vaping, as well as strong cravings to use,” Hadland said in the email.\n\n“I increasingly have needed to use medications (e.g., varenicline pills, nicotine patches, and nicotine gum or lozanges—and often a combination of these) to manage withdrawal symptoms and cravings in teens to help them quit,” he said. “This is all a phenomenon of recent years.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/health/cdc-covid-guidance-update/index.html", "title": "CDC loosens recommendations for some Covid-19 control ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the nation should move away from restrictive measures such as quarantines and social distancing and focus on reducing severe disease from Covid-19.\n\nIn new guidelines released Thursday, the agency no longer recommends staying at least 6 feet away from other people to reduce the risk of exposure – a shift from guidance that had been in place since the early days of the pandemic.\n\nThe shift is a sign of how much has changed since the beginning of the pandemic more than two years ago. Nearly the entire US population has at least some immunity through vaccination, previous infection or, in some cases, both.\n\n“The current conditions of this pandemic are very different from those of the last two years,” Greta Massetti, who leads the Field Epidemiology and Prevention Branch at the CDC, said Thursday.\n\n“High levels of population immunity due to vaccination and previous infection and the many available tools to protect the general population, and protect people at higher risk, allow us to focus on protecting people from serious illness from Covid-19.”\n\nThe new CDC guidelines say contact tracing, another hallmark during the pandemic, should be limited to hospitals and certain high-risk group-living situations such as nursing homes, and the guidelines de-emphasize the use of regular testing to screen for Covid-19, except in certain high-risk settings like nursing homes and prisons.\n\nThe new guidance also does not advise quarantining people who’ve been exposed to Covid-19 but are not infected.\n\nBut the guidance does keep some measures the same. It encourages testing for people with symptoms and their close contacts. It also says people who test positive should stay home for at least five days and wear a mask around others for 10 days. It also continues to recommend that people wear masks indoors in about half the country.\n\nThe new guidelines also tailor advice on isolation for people who became very sick from Covid-19. People with moderate symptoms – such as shortness of breath – and those who were hospitalized should stay home for at least 10 days. People with compromised immune systems should now talk to their doctor about ending their isolation after an infection.\n\nThere’s new advice on what to do if your Covid-19 symptoms rebound, too. If you end isolation and your Covid-19 symptoms get worse, you should start isolation over again and see your doctor.\n\nTrying to meet people where they are\n\nThe changes are an acknowledgment that SARS-CoV-2 may be with us for the long haul. They aim to help people live their lives around Covid-19 with minimal disruptions to work and school. They are also more risk-based, advising people who are at higher risk for severe illness to take more personal precautions than others.\n\n“I think they just overall come into alignment with what people are doing anyway,” says Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California at San Francisco.\n\nChin-Hong thinks some states, like California, will continue to go beyond the CDC’s guidance in their own recommendations, but by and large, he thinks these reflect the prevailing attitudes toward the pandemic. He sees it as a move by the CDC to try to regain the public’s trust.\n\nA recent survey from the Annenberg Public Policy Center shows that most Americans (54%) are no longer masking indoors, and about 4 in 10 say they’ve fully returned to their pre-pandemic routines – up from 16% in January.\n\n“What the CDC is, in my opinion, trying to do, they are trying to still be relevant, and maybe when they say something, people will listen to them instead of being completely 180 degrees away from what behavior is anyway,” Chin-Hong said.\n\nBill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees that the new guidance shows that the CDC is trying to meet people where they are.\n\n“I think that this is a point where you actually have to sort of get real and start giving people tools they can use to do something or not. Because otherwise, people will just will not take you seriously,” Hanage said.\n\nOther experts, however, feel that the new guidelines don’t go far enough to correct scientific missteps in previous guidance.\n\n“This revision does not go anywhere near enough to correct the problems of flawed recommendations and lack of evidence,” said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, said in an email to CNN. Topol has been critical of the CDC for months, saying it wasn’t strict enough with its isolation policies for people with Covid.\n\nLatest advice to stay safe from Covid\n\nThe CDC recommends that Covid-19 prevention practices continue to depend on a person’s risk of becoming severely ill and on its Covid-19 community levels. Community levels reflect cases in a community as well as hospitalization rates and hospital capacity.\n\nWhen the Covid community level is high – as it currently is in 41% of counties – the CDC continues to recommend that everyone wear high-quality masks indoors. High-risk people should also wear quality masks when the community level is medium, as it now is in 39% of counties.\n\nThe agency also puts more emphasis on improving ventilation. Aerosol scientists have long complained that the 6-foot social distancing guidance was arbitrary and unhelpful because the virus that causes Covid-19 can float through the air for greater distances.\n\nThe CDC continues to stress the use of vaccines and therapeutics to reduce “medically significant illness” in Covid-19. For the general population, the agency noted that being vaccinated and boosted is highly protective against severe illness and death. It urges everyone to stay up to date on their shots.\n\nIn addition to vaccination, the CDC urges additional measures for people with suppressed immune function, including the use of Evusheld, a kind of passive immunity that’s given before a person gets sick. It’s especially helpful for people who can’t mount an immune response, and experts say it has been underutilized in this country.\n\nThe agency also stresses the use of antiviral medications in people who catch Covid-19 and are at higher risk for severe outcomes. This group includes people who are older or unvaccinated or those who have certain medical conditions that put them at higher risk. Conditions that increase risk include overweight and obesity, pregnancy, smoking, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and mental health conditions, including depression.\n\n“These recent changes recognize the importance of protecting those most at risk of severe illness, while also standardizing some basic good public health hygiene for the long-term for those less at risk,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n\n“It’s important that we make it as easy as possible for people to continue to protect themselves and others around them as we live with Covid,” Freeman said in an email to CNN.\n\nCovid guidance for schools\n\nSome of the changes in the guidelines will apply to schools.\n\nThe agency removed the recommendation that kids in different classrooms avoid mixing, a practice known as cohorting. It also removed advice that kids who are contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid-19 take regular tests – and test negative – to remain in the classroom, which was known as test-to-stay.\n\nSome educators said they didn’t expect the updated CDC guidelines to change much, at least for this school year.\n\n“We welcome clear, concise and actionable guidance from the CDC. Specific to this latest round, we don’t expect it to be particularly disrupting or impactful in schools,” said Noelle Ellerson Ng, associate executive director of advocacy and governance at AASA, The School Superintendents Association.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMany districts have finalized their opening plans and mitigation strategies and are sticking to what worked the prior school year to keep kids in schools learning.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the nation’s largest teachers unions, said the new guidelines were welcome news for schools.\n\n“COVID-19 and other viruses are still with us, but with multiple prevention and treatment options available, now is not the time for new mandates.

(AP) — The U.S. government is asking a federal appeals court to rehear a challenge to a Food and Drug Administration requirement that tobacco companies put large graphic health warnings on cigarette packages to show that smoking can disfigure and even kill people.\n\nThe Justice Department filed a petition Tuesday asking for the full court to rehear the case after a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington affirmed in August a lower court ruling blocking the mandate, saying it ran afoul of the First Amendment's free speech protections. However, the court rarely grants such appeals.\n\nSome of the nation's largest tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., sued to block the mandate to include warnings to show the dangers of smoking and encouraging smokers to quit lighting up. They argued that the proposed warnings went beyond factual information into anti-smoking advocacy. The government argued the photos of dead and diseased smokers are factual.\n\nThe nine graphic warnings proposed by the FDA include color images of a man exhaling cigarette smoke through a tracheotomy hole in his throat, and a plume of cigarette smoke enveloping an infant receiving a mother's kiss. These are accompanied by language that says smoking causes cancer and can harm fetuses. The warnings were to cover the entire top half of cigarette packs, front and back, and include the phone number for a stop-smoking hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW.\n\nTobacco companies increasingly rely on their packaging to build brand loyalty and grab consumers — one of the few advertising levers left to them after the government curbed their presence in magazines, billboards and TV.\n\nIn a 2-1 decision, the appeals court panel wrote that the case raises \"novel questions about the scope of the government's authority to force the manufacturer of a product to go beyond making purely factual and accurate commercial disclosures and undermine its own economic interest — in this case, by making 'every single pack of cigarettes in the country (a) mini billboard' for the government's anti-smoking message.\"\n\nThe court also wrote that the FDA \"has not provided a shred of evidence\" showing that the warnings will \"directly advance\" its interest in reducing the number of Americans who smoke.\n\nBut in its appeal seeking a full court rehearing, the government argued that the text of the new warnings are \"indisputably accurate\" and the format, including the use of graphics, is tailored to the demand of a \"market in which the vast majority of users become addicted to a lethal product before age 18.\"\n\nIt also argued that the First Amendment does not require the government to show how one part of a multi-faceted anti-smoking public health campaign directly reduces smoking rates.\n\nWarning labels first appeared on U.S. cigarette packs in 1965, and current warning labels that feature a small box with text were put on cigarette packs in the mid-1980s. Changes to more graphic warning labels that feature color images of the negative effects of tobacco use were mandated in a law passed in 2009 that, for the first time, gave the federal government authority to regulate tobacco.\n\nThe share of Americans who smoke has fallen dramatically since 1970, from nearly 40% to about 20%. But the rate has stalled since about 2004, with about 46 million adults in the U.S. smoking cigarettes. It's unclear why it hasn't budged, but some experts have cited tobacco company discount coupons on cigarettes and lack of funding for programs to discourage smoking or to help smokers quit.\n\nIn recent years, more than 40 countries or jurisdictions have introduced labels similar to those created by the FDA. The World Health Organization said in a survey done in countries with graphic labels that a majority of smokers noticed the warnings and more than 25 percent said the warnings led them to consider quitting.\n\nJoining North Carolina-based R.J. Reynolds, owned by Reynolds American Inc., and Lorillard Tobacco, owned by Lorillard Inc., in the lawsuit are Commonwealth Brands Inc., Liggett Group LLC and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company Inc.\n\nRichmond, Va.-based Altria Group Inc., parent company of the nation's largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris USA, which makes the top-selling Marlboro brand, is not a part of the lawsuit.\n\nThe case is separate from a lawsuit by several of the same tobacco companies over the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which cleared the way for the more graphic warning labels and other marketing restrictions. The law also allowed the FDA to limit nicotine and banned tobacco companies from sponsoring athletic or social events or giving away free samples or branded merchandise.\n\nIn March, a federal appeals court in Cincinnati ruled that the law was constitutional. The contradiction of the decisions could mean the case would be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2012/10/09"}]}

Emig and Paskaly, who have lived on Sanibel for the last two years, said they did not expect it to be unrecognizable.\n\n“I can’t believe the destruction,” Emig told CNN through tears as she and her wife looked at the field of debris in front of them. “It’s incomprehensible that a storm, a hurricane, can wipe us all out like this in just a few hours.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly returned to Sanibel Island by boat to check on their home.

Ron DeSantis and other Florida officials on the response to the storm and recovery efforts.\n\n“Today we have one job and only one job,” Biden said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon. “That’s to make sure the people of Florida get everything that they need to fully, thoroughly recover.”\n\nEvery single home on Sanibel Island is damaged in one way or another, and people have lost everything in some cases, Vice Mayor Richard Johnson told CNN’s Pamela Brown Wednesday. Ninety-five percent of homes on Sanibel Island have been visited by urban search and rescue teams, Johnson said, adding that the city is now looking forward to rebuilding, which brings its own concerns.\n\n“We’re absolutely concerned about rebuilding. This could happen again, and it will happen again,” Johnson said. “However, we will be prepared. We will rebuild, and we will rebuild stronger and better than we were before.”\n\nAt least 125 people have been reported killed as a result of the storm – 120 of them in Florida and five in North Carolina. As of Tuesday night, Florida data provided to CNN reflected at least partial information for 72 of the state’s storm victims. Of those 72 deaths, drowning was listed as a “possible” or known “circumstance” in the deaths of 40 people.\n\nMore than 1,000 search and rescue personnel have combed through 79,000 structures across the Sunshine State, DeSantis told reporters Tuesday, with more than 2,300 rescues logged.\n\nSearch and Rescue teams will begin secondary searches of damaged and destroyed homes on Sanibel Island Thursday, according to city manager Dana Souza. Teams will not enter homes unless they have reason to believe that someone needs assistance.\n\nBut it’s still unclear how many people remain missing.\n\nOfficials are compiling a list of those who remain unaccounted for, Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie said Monday.\n\nFOLLOW LIVE UPDATES\n\nPeople load supplies Tuesday onto a boat in Matlacha, Florida, to be taken to Sanibel Island.

Many schools also remain shuttered, some hospitals are still struggling to provide care and boil-water notices remain in place in some areas.\n\nHurricane Ian hit the area just before tourist season. Johnson said Sanibel will feel an economic impact.\n\n“Unfortunately, this tourist season will be nonexistent,” Johnson said. “We are not going to be prepared to accept our tourists at this time.”\n\n‘How do you even start with this?’\n\nWhen Emig and Paskaly finally made it to their house on Sanibel, they were in awe of the damage.\n\nTheir “dream home” was still standing, but the lower level was “unlivable.”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly's pool was covered with metal and wood debris when they returned for the first time a week after Hurricane Ian hit Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nAs Paskaly walked around the debris that was their front yard, Emig looked over the couple’s pool, now covered with warped metal and trees.\n\n“It’s gonna be a long time before we swim in it, huh?” Emig said, adding they need to be careful of displaced alligators.\n\nThe chaotic scene left Paskaly in a trance. She had only expected parts of their screen enclosure to have fallen, she said, covering her mouth – “How do you ever start with this?”\n\nJulie Emig and Vicki Paskaly look at their displaced mailbox amid the destruction outside of their home one week after Hurricane Ian pummeled Sanibel Island. CNN\n\nIn their garage, the couple found an item on top of a shelf filled with water, leading them to believe the surge reached at least 5 feet. The floor was slippery from being covered in sludge. Their Mini Cooper – filled with mold and water – was ruined.\n\n“I knew I was going to lose it, but you just look at all of this and it’s like 5 or 6 feet of water in here and it’s like where do we start?” Emig said through tears.\n\nInside, they discovered their refrigerator in their lower level apartment was on top of the counter and their kitchen island was on its side.\n\nOthers also felt the wrath of Ian. Anddy Garcia, owner of property management company Sanibel Home Concierge, had to tell several clients what they had been dreading to hear: Their homes were beyond saving.\n\n“It’s totally devastating to hear them on the other end of the phone, just gasping for air, and you’re telling them their home was destroyed,” Garcia said. “It’s totally heart-wrenching for me.”\n\nSteve and Lori Schulz rode out the storm at their friends’ house on the island. They were securing homes for neighbors who weren’t on the island, and by the time they finished, they no longer felt like they had time to leave, the couple told CNN.\n\nThe Schulz’s home took on several feet of storm surge and “pretty much everything” in the house is ruined.\n\nDespite all the destruction, Emig told CNN she remained hopeful her community would rebuild. “Sanibel’s full of a lot of working people who care about the island and we’ll be back,” she said. “Sanibel will be back.”\n\nFor now, many homes in that once-tranquil island community “are not livable,” Sanibel Fire Chief William Briscoe said previously, also noting many homes are off their foundations and alligators and snakes are present across the island.\n\nIn addition to the devastation on the island itself, Ian ripped away several parts of the causeway that was Sanibel’s only access to Florida’s mainland, leaving dozens of people stranded and hindering recovery efforts.\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis also toured the damage on Sanibel Wednesday for the first time.\n\n“You can go over it in a helicopter and you see damage, but it does not do it justice until you are actually on the ground, and you see concrete utility poles sawed off right in half, massive power lines everywhere, massive amounts of debris,” he said.\n\nOfficials said most electrical poles, transmission lines and wastewater systems remain down, meaning a return to normal is still a while away.\n\nIan damaged the Sanibel Causeway that connects Fort Myers to the island community. Joe Cavaretta/South Florida Sun-Sentinel/AP\n\nIt could take a month or longer just to restore power to some areas of Sanibel and Pine islands, Lee County Electric Cooperative spokesperson Karen Ryan told CNN. “It will be much easier to restore power once we can gain access to the island,” she said.\n\nAn estimated 6,400 people lived in the City of Sanibel as of April 2021, according to the US Census Bureau. The island is also home to a number of hotels and resorts and sees a significant amount of tourists each year.\n\nDeSantis has directed transportation authorities to prioritize the repair of the Sanibel Causeway.\n\nNeighboring Pine Island residents should be able to access their community by car later Wednesday, DeSantis announced, when crews are expected to complete a temporary fix for a part of a damaged bridge washed away in the storm.\n\nResidents lost both their homes and their jobs\n\nAt Salty Sam’s Marina in Fort Myers, owner Darrell Hanson and many of his employees – about 120 at this time of year and up to 200 at the height of tourist season – are working to salvage what they can, some of them dealing with the loss of their livelihoods and personal property.\n\n“In the parking lot, we must have had about 12 feet of water. Everything on the first floor was … destroyed,” said Hanson, who has so far been unable to access his own home on Sanibel Island. “All our gift stores and restaurants and everything, they’ve lost all their inventory. It’s hundreds of thousands of dollars that each business lost.”\n\n“But the employees have all come together,” he said, choking back tears. “They’re all out there working their butt off.”\n\nEmployee Ty Landers, who works on a pirate cruise at the marina, rode out the storm at his family’s home in Fort Myers. Fortunately the home and his family are safe, he said.\n\nBut some of his coworkers weren’t so lucky.\n\n“Many of our employees, even on the pirate ships, my crewmates, they lost their houses, they lost everything,” Landers told CNN. “Hopefully when the time’s right they’ll come back. But right now their lives fell apart, and they’re putting it back together.”\n\nSalty Sam's Marina, which employs about 120 people this time of year, was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ian. CNN\n\nDespite ongoing struggles, ‘there’s hope to rebuild’\n\nMany areas remain under boil water notices since the storm made landfall, damaging critical infrastructure, as well as homes.\n\nResidents of Lee and Charlotte counties – the two counties with the highest death tolls from the hurricane – will be able to get temporary blue coverings with fiber-reinforced sheeting at no cost for their roofs to help reduce further damage, according to a Charlotte County news release.\n\nIn Charlotte County, which is north of Fort Myers, public schools will be closed until further notice after several of its 22 schools were damaged by Ian. “The storm lasted here for over 12 hours, just hammering away. Nothing is safe right now,” Charlotte County public schools spokesperson Mike Riley said.\n\nPublic schools in Collier County are set to open Thursday, according to district spokesperson Chad Oliver, who added he did not know how many kids will show up for classes. More than than 22% of the district’s teachers live in hard-hit Lee County, but Oliver says the district is confident it is ready to reopen with the help of more than 800 substitute teachers.\n\nFlorida hospitals have also been struggling. Emergency departments sustained damage, staffing is impacted as hospital workers were displaced or lost their vehicles, and some facilities lost reliable access to water.\n\n“We were ready, we had our generators all ready. We had plenty of fuel. What we couldn’t anticipate and didn’t anticipate was the loss of water from our utility companies,” said Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and CEO of Lee Health.\n\nMembers of the Miami-Dade Task Force 1 Search and Rescue team look Tuesday through debris for victims in Matlacha, Florida. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nJessica Hernstadt, a resident of Fort Myers Beach in Lee County, said the community “looked like an apocalyptic disaster” when she made her way there after Ian slammed the shore, with cars, pots, pans and clothing littering the area.\n\nHomes the storm tore from their foundations blocked the streets leading to her house, which she found ablaze when she arrived, she told CNN in an interview Wednesday.\n\nLater, combing through the ashes, Hernstadt found just one item unscathed: a candlestick holder her great-grandmother carried in her pockets as she emigrated from Poland to the US.\n\n“It was the simplest, most prized possession that I had, and it gave me a sense of hope, especially today being Yom Kippur,” she said Wednesday. Yom Kippur is the holiest day of the year in Judaism.\n\n“We will survive. Our town will survive, and there’s hope to rebuild,” she said.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Randi Kaye Laura Dolan", "Amir Vera", "Randi Kaye", "Laura Dolan"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/arizona-history/2019/05/24/uss-arizona-men-who-survived-attack-pearl-harbor-world-war-ii/1226226001/", "title": "USS Arizona: The men who survived the attack on Pearl Harbor", "text": "GRASS VALLEY, Calif.\n\nLou Conter is telling the story of the night his patrol bomber was shot down seven miles off the coast of New Guinea, dumping the seaplane's 10-man crew into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe crew was not alone in the water.\n\n\"We had 10 or 12 sharks around us all the time,\" Conter says. \"I told the men, 'If a shark comes close, hit it in the nose with your fist as hard as you can.'\"\n\nThe men stayed afloat until another plane saw the burning wreckage and tossed out a life raft. The exhausted crew dragged ashore an hour later and hid in the jungle, fearful they would be captured by Japanese soldiers. The next night, an American PT boat retrieved all 10 men.\n\nAs Conter told it, the story wasn't about punching sharks, or skulking in the jungle or chasing shadows to the waiting rescue boat. Conter was talking about survival, about coming back alive.\n\nHis time in the war started that way.\n\nHe was 20 when he escaped the burning wreckage of the USS Arizona in Pearl Harbor. He tried to save as many injured crewmen as he could, but when the sun set on Dec. 7, 1941, he was one of just 335 sailors who did not perish.\n\nConter fought on through World War II, scraped past a lot of close calls, then went to Korea. After that, he started teaching U.S. troops the skills of survival, evasion, resistance and escape. He wrote a training manual whose precepts the Navy still follows. Today, he tries to pass on what he knows to students of history.\n\nAt 93, he is one of the last survivors of the attack on the Arizona. He endured what he did, he says, because that was his job. And that's what he told every soldier and airman who took his courses.*\n\nWhatever happens, find a way to survive.\n\nConter was stationed on the Arizona at Pearl Harbor in September 1941, when he turned 20. He and a buddy had been talking about their future in the Navy.\n\n\"Lou, let's go to flight school,\" Conter's buddy said one day.\n\n\"We won't get in,\" Conter said. \"We're right-arm rates.\" At the time, sailors wore patches designating their rates, the enlisted expression of rank, on the right or left sleeve, depending on their assignment. Aviators most often arose from left-arm rates.\n\nConter had made friends with a young lady in Honolulu. Her father was an engineer and a top executive for a dredging company with a big Navy contract. Conter was at the young lady's house one day when her father received an important visitor: Admiral William Calhoun, the commander of base force for the Pacific Fleet.\n\nCalhoun quizzed Conter about his posting, his job on the ship. Conter told the admiral he was interested in flight school, but doubted he would earn admission.\n\nCalhoun told Conter to put in for the assignment. A few weeks later, Conter and his buddy passed a flight test at sea and on Nov. 1, they got their orders: Report to Navy flight school in Pensacola, Fla.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Arizona's captain called the two sailors in and told them the ship was headed back to Long Beach in early December. They could ride to the mainland then and leave for Florida.\n\nTheir orders were lost on the Arizona when the battleship sank on Dec. 7. Conter and his buddy waited for new instructions, but heard nothing.\n\nIn early January, Conter visited his young lady friend again and again, Admiral Calhoun was there.\n\n\"I thought you'd be in flight school,\" he said.\n\nConter told him about the lost orders. Three days later, he and his buddy were on a ship to San Francisco and then a train to Pensacola.\n\nConter got his wings in November 1942. He was soon flying one of the Navy's Black Cats, a squadron of long-range patrol bombers painted black for night missions.\n\nThe Black Cats flew surveillance, search and rescue, sea patrol, but they proved especially valuable for nighttime assaults and nuisance raids on Japanese submarines and ships. The planes could fly at low altitudes, then buzz upward for a bombing run, confounding enemy gunners trying to calculate speed and distance.\n\nThe crews were based on tender ships moored in secluded harbors. Conter served on the San Pablo and Half Moon. The planes took off and landed on the water; the pilots tied up to buoys near the ship.\n\n\"We'd leave at 5:30 in the evening and stay out 12 or 14 hours, then return in the morning,\" Conter said. \"Sometimes, we'd come back, eat, then sleep on the beach.\"\n\nConter's crews flew missions across the South Pacific: New Guinea, Borneo, New Britain, the coast off Perth, Australia.\n\nThe crews learned the routines of the Japanese ships. The best time for a bombing raid was after 1 a.m., when the ship was quiet.\n\n\"We wouldn't get much fire back and by the time they sounded general quarters, we were on our way,\" Conter said. \"Sometimes they'd get shooting at you and you'd look at the shells and they looked like they were going to hit you. Then they'd go by.\"\n\nConter's plane hadn't been out long in September 1943 when enemy bullets pierced one of their rear hatches and hit a parachute flare. The flare exploded and started a fire, which forced the plane into the water.\n\n\"Say your prayers, men, we're seven miles off shore and we're in 10, 15-foot swells,\" one of the officers said as the crew abandoned the plane. \"I don't think we'll ever be able to swim to shore.\"\n\n\"Baloney,\" Conter replied. \"Knock it off. Just stay together, hold hands and kick slowly 'cause there'll be sharks around. If a shark comes too close, hit it in the nose with your fist as hard as you can.\"\n\nThe men helped one another, holding up anyone who weakened. Not long after, a second plane dropped a life raft and all 10 of the crew made to shore and, the next night, back to the base.\n\nIn late 1943, Conter flew a mission to rescue more than 200 coast watchers in New Guinea. Coast watchers were military intelligence operatives who gathered information about enemy activities on islands across the South Pacific.\n\nThe planes flew up the Sepik River from the northern coast of New Guinea. The river wound through dense vegetation, leaving 15 or 20 feet of clearance on each side of the plane. If a plane crashed, crocodiles awaited in the river.\n\n\"In three days, we rescued 219 coast watchers without losing anybody,\" Conter said. \"The Japanese were only a mile away. It was one of the biggest rescues in World War II, but no one knew about it because everything was top secret in those days.\"\n\nIn Korea, Conter flew 29 missions, but his work in Naval intelligence left him vulnerable if the North Koreans captured him, so he was shipped to Washington, D.C.\n\nHe was promoted to Lieutenant Commander in February 1954, the rank he held until he retired. His work turned toward survival training in a new military program called SERE, for Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape.\n\nConter helped establish training bases in Florida and California and in 1965, he returned to Pearl Harbor to write training materials for troops headed to Vietnam.\n\nHe had stopped at Pearl Harbor more than a decade earlier, on his way to a posting in Korea. A platform marked the wreckage of the USS Arizona. Conter and others in his group boarded a boat to go out to the platform and see his old ship.\n\n\"We got halfway there and I told them to turn around,\" Conter said. \"I wasn't going out there. I couldn't.\"\n\nIn 1967, Conter retired from the Navy. More than 20 years earlier, he had earned his real estate license in California and had maintained it. He settled in Palm Springs and built a career as a real estate developer, buying up land for commercial and residential projects.\n\nThat same year, he met his wife, Valerie, in Palm Springs. Her sister knew Jack Warner, the film studio mogul, and invited Valerie to a movie premiere party Warner was hosting in Palm Springs for his latest project, \"Camelot\".\n\nConter attended the same event and was seated next to Valerie. They struck up a conversation and, after a brief courtship, married.\n\nToday, Lou and Valerie Conter live in a two-level house at the end of a winding road on a golf course in Grass Valley, a mountain town about 60 miles outside Sacramento.\n\nTall pines tower over the house. Deer and rabbits wander the hillside. Golfers play through 50 yards from Conter's driveway.\n\n\"I'm going to be back out there one of these days,\" Conter said, his voice wistful as he watches a foursome trying to stay on the greens. Conter's doctor has sidelined him for now for health reasons, but he is certain he will return soon.\n\nHe took up golf seriously in Palm Springs and played in the Bob Hope Classic six times, once on a team with crooner Johnny Mathis. He keeps a photo from that tournament on a bookshelf in an alcove off the kitchen.\n\nOn the same bookshelf sit mementos from his time on the Arizona. Medals. Photographs. A painting of the Arizona hangs on the wall of a sitting room. He keeps a folder of newspaper clippings, magazine stories and copies of a telegram.\n\n\"Here's the one that told my mother I was missing in action on the Arizona,\" he says. It is dated Dec. 21, 1941.\n\n\"The Navy Department deeply regrets to inform you that your son Louis Anthony Counter quartermaster third class US Navy is missing following action in the performance of his duty.\"\n\nThe telegram, which misspelled Conter's last name, promises further information and asks his family not to divulge Conter's posting.\n\nA second telegram, dated Jan. 6 reported that Conter was alive and would contact his family.\n\n\"I'd already sent word, even before the first one got there,\" he says. \"So they knew.\"\n\nThough Conter turned around the first time he ventured toward the sunken Arizona, he has been back since, to see it with other survivors.\n\nHe joined the USS Arizona Reunion Association and stays in touch with a few of the remaining survivors. One, Joe Langdell, lives about 40 miles away in Yuba City.\n\nHe keeps up with what the military does, and some of it irritates him. Discipline seems less important than it was in his day. Too many strategic decisions come down from Washington instead of from the commanders on the ground.\n\nAnd he has watched with dismay the changes in survival training. He once helped design programs that sent soldiers into the wilds for days or weeks at a time. Now, some courses require less than a week of field time.\n\n\"You can't get a guy hungry in three or four days,\" Conter says.\n\nBut there are moments when he knows what he did meant something. His old co-pilot in the New Guinea days was asked once if he'd had survival training for the war.\n\n\"He said, 'I had survival training in the ocean. We had survival training on the job. And my co-pilot, Lou Conter, saved my life.'\"\n\nConter stares at his hands.\n\n\"Some things,\" he says, \"you don't know about what they'll mean until years later.\"\n\nLAS VEGAS\n\nOnce a month or so, Clarendon Hetrick's phone rings with a call from Utah. On the other end of the line is an old shipmate from the USS Saratoga, the aircraft carrier where Hetrick worked as a mechanic through most of World War II.\n\nFor an hour or so, the two men talk. They catch up. They trade stories. Not war stories, usually, not unless one of them has had it out with a doctor or a pushy clerk. Just stories, the kind buddies tell each other.\n\n\"He's there anytime I call him,\" Hetrick says. \"He's there for me. I guess he'd do anything he could for me. He's more like family than just a friend.\"\n\nHetrick, who is 91, has outlived most of the men he knew on the Saratoga. He is one of nine living survivors from the attack on the USS Arizona, the battleship he boarded in 1941 when he was 17.\n\nHe will answer questions about that December day when he escaped the burning wreckage of the Arizona, reciting as many of the details as he can remember. The new shoes he left on the deck of the sinking ship, the ones he intended to retrieve later. The shock of jumping into a harbor knowing he couldn't swim.\n\nBut he kept most of it to himself until he started meeting up with other survivors, years after he retired from the military.\n\n\"I was always wanting to learn more when I was younger,\" says Hetrick's younger son, Robert, who lives not far from his dad in Las Vegas. \"But I had a brother in Vietnam who didn't want to talk about it at all, so I guess I realized if they want to talk, they'll talk. That was the way it was.\"\n\nHetrick shrugs, trying to get comfortable in the recliner. \"It just didn't appeal to me to bring it up,\" he says.\n\nFires still burned on the broken USS Arizona the morning after the Japanese ambush. Hetrick slept on the battleship USS Tennessee, which had been moored just ahead of the Arizona along Ford Island.\n\nThe Tennessee took hits in the attack, but two of the armor piercing bombs, the kind that sunk the Arizona, failed to detonate. Debris from the Arizona showered the Tennessee's stern and started fires, but the vessel stayed afloat.\n\nHetrick took a motor launch to the receiving station on shore, where he and other survivors were allowed to shower and given a change of clothes. The men followed orders in a fog of wonderment and confusion.\n\n\"We didn't hear much from the outside at first,\" Hetrick said. \"It hadn't really sunk in what had happened.\"\n\nThe Navy began assigning sailors to new postings. Hetrick was sent to the USS Lexington, an aircraft carrier. The ship remained anchored outside Pearl Harbor for most of a month as U.S. commanders planned their next move against the Japanese in the South Pacific.\n\nOne day, a Navy officer came on board and asked if anyone wanted to volunteer for an assignment in the aviation section. Hetrick thought about it. He liked the idea of working as an aircraft mechanic, so he volunteered.\n\n\"They gave me 30 minutes to get off the ship and catch a transport to San Diego for training,\" he said. \"It didn't take me that long. I had one pair of dungarees and that was it, that and a towel and shaving gear.\"\n\nThe Lexington sailed out of Pearl Harbor not long after. It never returned, crippled in the Battle of the Coral Sea and scuttled by the Navy to keep the enemy from salvaging her.\n\nAfter about six months of training in San Diego, Hetrick returned to Honolulu and joined the USS Saratoga, the sister ship of the Lexington. He worked on board as a mechanic for a torpedo squadron and ended up in charge of the hydraulic shop.\n\nThe Saratoga sailed across the South Pacific, to Guam, the Philippines, around New Guinea. Hetrick was on board during battles at Midway and Wake Island and for the U.S. invasion of Iwo Jima early in 1945. The Saratoga was attacked by six Japanese suicide bombers within about 24 hours.\n\n\"I put on two life jackets,\" Hetrick said. \"I told another kid if they come back again tonight, I'm leaving.\"\n\nHetrick earned a Purple Heart for wounds during one of the bombing raids.\n\nThe Saratoga had returned to Pearl Harbor by the time the Japanese surrendered. The Navy loaded 5,000 bunks on board, along with a row of portable latrines, and the Saratoga sailed to San Francisco, passing under the Golden Gate Bridge with toilet paper streamers and thousands of sailors who needed something to do.\n\nHetrick was still just 21 by then, but a seasoned sailor who shared little in common with the 17-year-old kid who left high school and joined the Navy on his parents' signature.\n\n\"I didn't have the slightest idea what would happen when I signed up,\" he said. \"I decided I'd do whatever they told me to. When they said, 'grab your sea bags and let's go,' I did.\"\n\nWhen he first arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hetrick wasn't even old enough to buy a beer until he found a place where they didn't ask questions if a guy was in a service uniform.\n\nNow, stateside again, Hetrick reported to a Navy station in San Diego, where he met the woman who would become his wife, Jeanne. As his stint was about to end, the Navy decided to transfer him back to Pearl Harbor. He asked if Jeanne could come with him.\n\n\"They said, 'If you re-enlist, we'll send her over.' I said, 'You send her over, I'll re-enlist.' I'd been told things like that before. They wouldn't send her over so I didn't re-enlist.\"\n\nBut Hetrick couldn't find work, so inside of six months, he signed up for the Navy Reserve. He was sent to the Los Alamitos Naval Air Station up the coast in Orange County.\n\nIn 1949, the newly created U.S. Air Force was trying to fill it out its ranks with experienced support crews, almost begging for mechanics who knew the aircraft. Hetrick saw a new opportunity and joined.\n\n\"On the day I swore into the Air Force, I was still in my Navy uniform,\" he said. \"Three months later, I was in Korea.\"\n\nHe worked his way up to crew chief on a squadron of B-26 bombers,\n\nAfter 18 months overseas, he returned to Langley Field in Virginia. (\"Two of us with the same rank were up for the same kind of job,\" he said. \"He wanted the east coast, I wanted the west coast. He got the west coast and I got the east coast. So you see how that works.\")\n\nFrom Virginia, he went to Utah, to France and then to Albuquerque, where he retired in November 1961.\n\nHe was on his own once again, he and his young family. They moved to Modesto, Calif., where he got a job driving a produce truck in the fruit orchards.\n\n\"They paid me by the day,\" he said. \"After 36 hours, I still hadn't put in a day. I asked the boss, 'how many hours is in a day for you?' He said, 'whatever I can get out of you.' I quit. I wasn't working for nothing.\"\n\nHe hired on with a farm labor contractor and within a year, he and a guy he worked with started their own business, contracting with the orchard owners to harvest crops. They covered the growing seasons: cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots, grapes.\n\nThe venture was working out well. Until his partner ran off with all the money.\n\nHetrick recovered. He built a reputation as a guy who could bring in the harvest on time.\n\nAround 2005, he and Jeanne moved to Bullhead City. A few years after that, they left for Las Vegas, where their son, Bob, and his family help them get around.\n\nLas Vegas seems to like Hetrick. He was at a restaurant last summer and someone noticed his USS Arizona cap. He didn't have to pay for dinner.\n\nHetrick turns a rusted chunk of metal over in his hands, running his fingers along the curves and edges. It is a piece of rigging used to secure a mooring line from a ship.\n\nFrom the USS Arizona.\n\nHe first visited the Arizona memorial in Pearl Harbor on the 50th anniversary of the attack and has returned since.\n\n\"It gets your breath when you first see it,\" he says. \"It's hard to explain.\" He thinks back. \"You know, you can see where I came out of, the hatchway. There's a little air bubble. It's the same place where the oil is leaking\" — oil stores aboard the ship that, even today, still seep to the surface — \"that's where I got out from below.\"\n\nIn 2006, Hetrick returned to Pearl Harbor for the 65thanniversary of the Japanese attack. He had visited before, but this trip meant more. He brought all of his family: his wife Jeanne, his three sons and their families. And he was allowed to visit a part of the Arizona few people ever see.\n\nDuring construction of the memorial, the Navy sliced off pieces of the Arizona's wreckage to make room for the structure that sits above the sunken ship today. The pieces – the largest is about as long as a bus – sit in a salvage yard on the Waipi'o Peninsula on Oahu. The Navy occasionally cuts away small bits of the wreckage for memorials.\n\nFor Hetrick, the section of mooring line links him to those final moments of the Arizona. He will tell his story if he's asked and he will remember details along the way.\n\n\"I remember hearing explosions at first,\" he says. \"It sounded like someone shooting guns. You don't fire guns in port, so I ran out real quick to see what was happening. I saw one airplane, with a big red meatball on the side. Nobody could debate what that was, no question about it.\"\n\nHe remembers the crewman trying to climb a ladder to escape through a hatchway on the deck. The man told him later he had broken both his hips in one of the explosions and had survived only because Hetrick was there to urge him on.\n\nHetrick still likes to talk about the new shoes he bought the day before the attack in Honolulu. As he prepared to jump off the burning ship, he took the shoes off and set them on the quarterdeck.\n\n\"I left them there and hoped to get them back,\" he says. \"I ain't seen 'em since.\"\n\nHe remembers when the order was given to abandon ship. He jumped into the harbor, even though he had never passed his swimming test.\n\n\"When somebody says get out of here and you're on a hundred tons of ammunition, well, you don't question it,\" he says. \"If somebody in authority said do something back then, you didn't question it. I think that's what kept me living to this day.\"\n\nHe's not sure he'd have learned that lesson if he hadn't enlisted in the Navy. He says that decision was the best thing he could have done.\n\n\"I'd do it a hundred times more,\" he says.\n\nUPDATE: Clare Hetrick died in 2016.\n\nPROVO, Utah\n\nKen Potts eases around the side of the pool table, waving toward items like a museum tour guide in a back room.\n\n\"This shows where all the ships were,\" he says, pointing at a map depicting Pearl Harbor on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. \"There's the battleships … there's the Nevada, the Arizona, the Tennessee, the West Virginia, Maryland, the Oklahoma. The California was way down here.\"\n\nHe stops in front of a newspaper, the front page of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin with the headline: \"WAR! OAHU BOMBED BY JAPANESE PLANES\"\n\n\"That's one of the first extras that was put out that day,\" Potts says. \"I bought it at the receiving station in Pearl Harbor. It's in good shape for a paper.\"\n\nFarther down the paneled wall hangs a painting of the USS Arizona, the battleship Navy recruit Potts boarded in December 1939. By 1941, he worked the cranes on the ship, a job that entailed retrieving the Arizona's small seaplanes after they landed on the water.\n\nHe points out the cranes and the locations along the ship where he would tie up the motor boats he piloted to fetch supplies and ferry sailors to and from shore. He gazes at the picture.\n\n\"They were saying, when it first started, some of the ones whose station was up here – \"\n\nHe traces his finger up onto the main forward mast, to the crow's nest and the bridge. He clears his throat. \"They tried to jump off. Some of 'em made it, some of 'em landed on the deck. That was the end of it.\"\n\nA moment passes. He returns his attention to the cranes and the catapults that flung the seaplanes into flight.\n\n\"Once after we crossed the equator, one of the planes came back,\" he says. \"The sea was real rough when it came in and the sharks started gathering around. They called the Marines out with rifles to protect the plane and the guys while we hauled it in.\"\n\nPotts was returning to the Arizona with fresh produce when the first Japanese bombers dove into Pearl Harbor. He climbed aboard the ship, ducking to avoid bullets from the gunner planes. He helped rescue some of his shipmates. Seventy-three years later, he is one of just nine survivors of the attack on the Arizona.\n\nHe keeps the mementos from his experience – the maps, the photos, the clippings, the medals, the painting – in a room behind a door on the side wall of the living room in the house where he has lived for 54 years. He doesn't like to talk about the attack. Sometimes he can't control his emotions, so he declines speaking requests.\n\nBut he is proud of his service, of the other sailors on the Arizona. And there's a trophy in the corner the paneled room that means as much as anything else there.\n\nA few weeks after the war started, sometime in early 1942, Potts opened a letter from his mother. Why is the FBI checking up on you, she wanted to know. Someone from the bureau had been asking questions. He heard the same stories from his grandmother and his aunts.\n\nHe didn't know what to tell them. It scared him a little. Potts was working aboard an oil tanker, making short runs out of the harbor to refuel ships anchored off the coast. In the chaotic days following the Dec. 7 ambush, the Navy wasn't letting ships into the harbor, fearful the Japanese might send in more bombers.\n\nFinally, after a few weeks on the tanker, Potts was handed a new assignment. He would work in the port director's office, delivering sealed packets to the captains of Navy ships. Inside the packets were the captains' new orders, military secrets, classified information that required clearance to handle.\n\nThat's why the FBI was nosing around me, Potts thought.\n\n\"These captains of the ships, when they left the states, they had no idea where they were going, just that they're going via Pearl Harbor,\" Potts said.\n\nHe resumed one of his old jobs from the Arizona, piloting motor launches from the receiving station out to the Navy ships.\n\nPotts was based out of the port director's office – there were two, one at the harbor, one on the ninth floor of the Aloha Tower in downtown Honolulu – but he logged most of his hours at the controls of the motor boat, a Jeep or a station wagon.\n\n\"The station wagon was for the captains of some of the ships that would come in,\" he said. \"Not Navy ships, other ships. The Navy captain who lived on Waikiki Beach gave a lot of parties and invited these guys. I had to take them to the parties and sit there until it was over.\"\n\nThe parties sometimes dragged into the early morning hours.\n\n\"It was boring,\" Potts says. \"But it was a lot better than being shot at.\"\n\nHe tried to keep his thoughts on the work in the office. He tried not to remember the days after the attack. The day when they assigned him and a crew of divers to a motor launch and sent them to the Arizona to remove bodies of dead sailors.\n\n\"When they dropped that bomb that made our ammunition explode, it dang near broke the ship in two, so we couldn't go anywhere forward of that,\" he says. \"We took all the bodies we could find.\"\n\nWhen he reaches that part of his story, he stops. He can't relive those images anymore. He describes the store of booze they pulled out of safe and the money.\n\n\"One day our boat was stacked with two dollar bills,\" he said. \"They paid everybody in two dollar bills back then. We hauled it all back in.\"\n\nPotts stayed in Honolulu until the end of the war. He finally received his orders to return to the states. He would sail to San Francisco on one of the cruise ships refitted to move troops, the Lurline, or maybe the Matsonia.\n\nAs he was packing, a buddy warned him that his possessions would be searched at the port in San Francisco. If they found anything that belonged to the Navy or hadn't been approved, they'd take it.\n\nPotts picked up the Colt 45 he'd found on Ford Island on Dec. 7, 1941. The gun took away some of the terror he had felt from the moment he saw the first bomber, the panic he felt when he found the armories on board the ship locked. With a gun, he could defend himself. He had held on to it through the war.\n\nBut he didn't want to start his civilian life in the brig, so he left it in Honolulu.\n\n\"We got into San Francisco,\" he says, \"and they never even opened my bags. Never would've found it.\"\n\nHe bought another gun in the states and he is never far from it. A pistol sits on top of his television at home. He keeps it with him when he travels. And he keeps it loaded.\n\n\"It ain't worth a damn if it ain't loaded,\" he says.\n\nPotts returned to Illinois in late 1945 to await his formal discharge, hanging out in Chicago. He was still active, so would report to the Navy Pier each morning to check a list for the names of sailors who had been given duties for the day. His name never appeared and he would leave for the day.\n\n\"I came back to the pier one morning and my name was on the list to do KP work,\" he says. Kitchen patrol. Mess hall duty. Peeling potatoes.\n\n\"I went and found the head guy and by the time I got through explaining things to him,\" Potts says, \"my name was never on that list again.\"\n\nHis mother had moved to Decatur, Ill., by then, so he followed and took a job at a hardware store. He started chatting up a regular customer, a contractor, and got a job building houses.\n\n\"What houses they built!\" Potts says, shaking his head. \"That lumber was so damn green then, we used to kid we had to shoot the squirrels out of it.\"\n\nHe wasn't happy where he was, so he loaded up his big 12-cylinder Lincoln Zephyr and headed west. He stopped in the small town of Payson, Utah.\n\n\"They said what a wonderful place it was to live, with jobs and everything, so I bought a little place up in Spanish Fork,\" he says, \"I'm still looking for that easy money.\"\n\nWith his experience running cranes on the Arizona, Potts figures he could have landed a decent job at the Geneva Steel operation, but he didn't want to work shifts, so he worked as a carpenter again and eventually went into the used car business with a friend.\n\nHe moved to Provo and sold cars until 1990. He and his wife, Doris, have lived in the same house for 54 years.\n\nThe paneled room behind the door in the living room of the Provo house is filled with trophies of almost any imaginable sort. Two deer racks (his wife shot one, his son the other). Guns. Knives. A bow. An impressive collection of restaurant menus from 30 years of cross-country searches for used cars.\n\nAnd in the back corner, a real trophy. It sits a little higher than most items, but not necessarily on a platform. It fit in that location. And it holds deep meaning for Potts, even though he did nothing to win it.\n\nPotts had not returned to Honolulu in the decades since he left for San Francisco in 1945. He wasn't ready to see it all again, to sharpen the memories he'd tried to dull.\n\nIn 2006, one of his sons offered to take Potts to Hawaii for the 65th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack. He stayed on the 17th floor of a hotel on Waikiki Beach. He visited the memorial and was relieved to see the builders got it right.\n\n\"It's one of the best actual memorials I've seen,\" he says. \"It's where the war started.\"\n\nFive years later, in 2011, he got a call from the band director at Timpview High School in Provo. The marching band had been invited to fly to Pearl Harbor and perform at activities commemorating the 70th anniversary of the attack.\n\nThe band members had decided they wanted to honor survivors from that day. Would Ken be willing to go as a guest of honor? The band would cover all expenses for him and Doris.\n\nPotts was touched. He could see the band was sincere. To prepare for the trip, they were studying World War II history, attending lectures, writing research papers. They offered to perform at a gathering of Utah survivors. How could he say no?\n\n\"Talk about treating you like royalty,\" he says. He was able to visit the national cemetery at an area called the Punch Bowl. He watched the band perform and stood as a survivor of the Arizona, one of the sailors who lived. He went out to the floating memorial.\n\n\"I got the lay a wreath in front of the names of the fallen,\" he says quietly.\n\nWhen he returned home, he got another call from the band director. The band had won a trophy in one of the competitions during their stay in Honolulu. They had voted. They were dedicating it to Potts and wanted him to have it.\n\nHe squeezes past the pool table, past the photos and the maps and the medals. Here is a story he will tell, a memory he will keep.\n\nThe trophy sits on a small white base that raises it above other items on a shelf. It is about three feet tall, with a carved island figure on top and the silhouette of a Hawaiian warrior on a plaque. The inscription reads \"Spirit of Aloha Award, Timpview High School Marching Band.\"\n\nHe touches the trophy.\n\n\"It's my pride and joy.\"\n\nLA MIRADA, Calif.\n\nFor 30 years, Lauren Bruner punched a clock at a manufacturing plant south of Los Angeles, a World War II veteran in a landscape crawling with them.\n\nNo one knew much about Bruner's years in the Navy, not the early years anyway. The easy stories he'd tell. The ones that gave him nightmares, the stories from the day he nearly burned to death, he kept to himself.\n\nYet in a place where you couldn't cross the street without running into a war vet, Bruner was not just another ex-sailor who made it home. Only 335 men survived the bombing of the USS Arizona, the mighty battleship whose loss at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, inspired a nation to go to war.\n\nBruner was one of them.\n\nBy 1991, the 50th anniversary of the attack, the number of living Arizona crewmen had shrunk. Survivors' groups wanted to find all of them so their stories would not be lost.\n\nA woman from Illinois drew Bruner's name. No one among the groups knew where he was or what he was doing, but the woman persisted. She tracked him to the Los Angeles area, then started a phone search.\n\nFinally, she located some of Bruner's tax records and found his address and telephone number.\n\n\"No one knew where the hell I was,\" Bruner says. \"I was here all the time. When they sent me my discharge, I just stayed here.\"\n\nThe woman helped connect Bruner with other survivors from the Arizona and Pearl Harbor. He finally found people who understood his experience.\n\n\"I never talked about it much then,\" he says. \"I just didn't want to. I still get to the point when I'm talking about it, first thing you know, I go to bed at night, wake up and can't sleep for a week.\"\n\nBruner, who turned 94 in November, is now one of nine living USS Arizona crewmen who survived the ship's sinking. He has been telling his story to an author, Ed McGrath, who is working on a book and a film about Bruner's escape from a collapsing tower on the ship.\n\nThe survivors' group that found him was right, he has concluded: The stories of the Arizona should not die with the men who lived them.\n\n\"The kids coming up now have never heard of it,\" he says, his voice tinged with sadness and dismay. \"Never heard of it.\"\n\nBruner was at his battle station in an anti-aircraft gun director, a metal box on the forward mast of the Arizona, when an armor-piercing bomb ignited the ship's powder magazine. The fireball from the explosion engulfed the six men in the box and trapped them.\n\nA sailor on the deck of the repair ship Vestal spotted the men and threw a line across. Their skin charred and falling off, the men crawled down the line to the Vestal. Bruner was the second-to-last man to leave the sinking ship.\n\nHe won't talk much about the escape, or about the men who didn't make it across. Nightmares invade his sleep when he remembers those final moments.\n\nFrom the Vestal, Bruner was taken to the USS Solace, a hospital ship in the harbor. The Solace dispatched motor boats to the Arizona to rescue wounded sailors and her crew pulled others from the water.\n\nBruner was burned over more than two-thirds of his body. He had taken a bullet to the back of his leg as he was climbing the tower, but the burns were far worse. He stayed aboard the Solace about a month. In January, another ship took him to San Francisco to the Navy hospital on Treasure Island.\n\nHe was treated there for four months. Before the war started, a hospital stay that long would have earned a sailor a discharge, but not anymore. He knew he was near release the day an officer came by and launched into a pep talk about the war and the Navy's role in it.\n\n\"I got another ship for you,\" the officer said at last.\n\n\"OK,\" Bruner said. \"What's up with this one?\"\n\n\"It's a brand new destroyer, the Coghlan, DD-606,\" he said, \"built right here in 'Frisco.\"\n\nAs the war with Japan intensified, the Navy was building new warships as fast as it could. And the ships needed experienced sailors.\n\nBruner was put in charge of the gun batteries. The ship carried four 5-inch anti-aircraft guns and six half-inch machine guns, and, initially, five 21-inch torpedo tubes. The guns used the same type of control mechanisms Bruner had mastered on the Arizona. Sight-setters and pointers would locate targets visually and determine their distance and range. An electro-mechanical computer would aim the guns.\n\n\"I had to start training the new recruits on every machine,\" Bruner said. \"The new ones, they didn't know beans.\"\n\nBruner looked each recruit in the eyes to determine the right job, but he wasn't testing their mettle, not yet. He wanted men with eyes set in the right place on their face. He looked for what he called medium spacing. With eyes too close or two far apart, a crewman could deliver faulty readings.\n\nThe Coghlan left San Francisco in September 1942 and sailed toward Pearl Harbor for an assignment. The ship was still a day away from Honolulu when the captain received new orders. The ship was to turn around and steam toward Alaska.\n\nThe Japanese military had established strategic outposts in the Aleutian Islands and had its eye on Alaska. Japan wanted the northern Pacific to control its shipping routes and block U.S. attacks from that direction.\n\nThe Coghlan approached the Aleutians in October, as winter was pushing fall aside. The sea turned rough, tossing the ship with 40-foot swells, bouncing the vessel like a rubber ball in a washing machine.\n\n\"When we got up into the Aleutians, we started banging on the Japanese that had already landed,\" Bruner said. \"We'd patrol at night. They were trying to replenish submarines or send smaller ships in. We'd go out and blow them up.\"\n\nBy winter, temperatures plunged below zero. The Coghlan's crew battled just to keep the guns free of ice as they headed toward their next target.\n\n\"We had to have two crews, a regular crew and a stand-by crew lined up waiting,\" Bruner said. \"We'd send two guys out to knock the icicles off the guns, then they'd high-tail it back in. By the time they were back, the icicles were forming again and two more guys would go out.\"\n\nThe Coghlan supported Army landings and Navy bombing runs. In March, the crew turned back Japanese forces in the Battle of Komandorski.\n\nLate in the year, after an overhaul in San Francisco, the Coghlan returned to patrol duty off the Aleutians with a half dozen other U.S. vessels. The ships encountered a Japanese fleet, two big cruisers, six destroyers, some troop ships, and engaged.\n\n\"We lit into them, started firing on them,\" Bruner said. \"This went on for four straight hours. We got into a run-and-gun battle. One of our cruisers, the heavy cruiser, got hit and water got into the oil. They were dead in the water.\"\n\nFinally, the four U.S. destroyers were ordered to mount a torpedo run.\n\n\"We took off,\" Bruner said, \"firing just as fast as we could. We got as close as 5,000 yards, which was point-blank for those ships. We cut the torpedoes loose.\"\n\nThe Americans stopped the Japanese ships and wiped out some of the top officers. The Coghlan turned back, almost spent. Another five minutes, Bruner figured, and they'd have run out of ammunition.\n\nBruner and the Coghlan returned to Honolulu and finished out the war in the South Pacific. The ship accompanied General Douglas MacArthur to the Philippines and was anchored in the harbor off Nagasaki, Japan, when the second atomic bomb exploded.\n\nBruner toured Nagasaki in a Jeep with other Navy officers and chief mates. A few days later, the drove through the crumbling streets of Hiroshima. The cities were in ruins. But the war was over.\n\n\"When I got back home, my doctors here wanted to know about my medical background,\" Bruner said. \"I would tell them. They said, 'You should have been dead a long time ago.'\"\n\nHe finished his stint in the Navy in Shanghai, working shore patrol the way he did back in Honolulu. He was cut loose in San Francisco and returned to Los Angeles, where he had married a girl back in late 1942.\n\nOne day, a young fellow knocked on his door.\n\n\"Hi,\" he said, introducing himself. \"I'm planning to marry your wife's sister, but I've got to have somebody take my place at work. I wanted to know if you could do it for a couple of weeks.\"\n\nBruner thought it an odd request. He asked what the fellow did.\n\n\"I'm a painter,\" he said. \"A brush painter.\"\n\nBruner laughs as he remembers the conversation.\n\n\"Well, I'd brushed enough paint on that damn ship, I figured I could do it,\" he says. \"I said, 'sure, I'll take it.' I still had to wait 29 years for that guy to come back and take his brush back.\"\n\nHis new employer manufactured industrial refrigeration units. Bruner started as a painter, trained as a carpenter, then helped start a new sheet-metal department. Almost three decades later, he was the plant manager, second-in-command.\n\nThree months before he would mark 30 years with the company, he was let go, bought out like a lot other older workers in those days.\n\nBy the time the woman from Illinois found him, he was ready to face his past.\n\nBruner lives alone, in a post-war neighborhood in the far northern edges of Orange County. Trains run close enough to hear the horns during the day, but not close enough to make them a nuisance.\n\nAn avocado tree grows in the backyard. Bruner's neighbor, who has become a close friend and a source of transportation, picks the fruit to keep it from rotting on the ground. Long a bachelor again, Bruner has also entertained lady friends from time to time.\n\nBruner keeps mementos of his time on the Arizona in the sitting room. Framed medals. Photos of the ship and other survivors at reunions in Honolulu. A sign over the arched door marks the room as \"Captain's Quarters.\"\n\nFor a long time, he didn't think he would ever return to Pearl Harbor.\n\nNow, Bruner prepares for his next trip in the Captain's Quarters. He will meet three other survivors in Hawaii for their last reunion. He looks forward to his time with the guys from his years in the Navy.\n\nThe first couple of trips back to Hawaii were difficult. The ones after that were, too.\n\n\"It never gets easy to go back,\" he says.\n\nSo why go back?\n\n\"To see the people I knew back in those days,\" he says. \"They were very good days before the war. I even had a couple of dates with girls.\"\n\nHis mouth quirks into a smile.\n\n\"I was on a date on that Saturday night with a gal I'd been running around with,\" he says. He doesn't need to say which Saturday night by now. \"We're were out and around. We were going to have a date the next day.\n\n\"The next day never came.\"\n\nUPDATE: Bruner died in 2019. He would become the final survivor to be interred in the ship.\n\nMORRIS, Okla.\n\nLonnie Cook was born in this rural town south of Tulsa, not long after it was founded as a stop on the Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway. Only a few hundred people lived there then. Today, the population can almost reach 1,500 when everyone is home.\n\nCook enlisted in the Navy in 1940 and was assigned to the USS Arizona, one of the largest battleships in the fleet with a crew that, at full complement, numbered more than 1,500.\n\nAbout a year after he boarded the ship, he ran into a young recruit named Clyde Williams, a fellow from Okmulgee, Okla., a few miles down the road from Morris. All those sailors from all those places and here was a guy who was practically a neighbor.\n\n\"I was back here on leave before the war started and he was here too,\" Cook says. \"We picked up a couple of girls and made the rounds. Then we had to go back.\"\n\nCook was a gunner's mate on the Arizona. Williams was in the Arizona's band.\n\nOn the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, Cook was changing clothes at his locker, savoring the thought of a day in Honolulu with the $60 he'd won in a craps game the night before. Williams was on deck, tuning up to play for colors, an early call after the previous day's fleet Battle of the Bands on shore.\n\nMinutes later, the Japanese attacked and the Arizona was on fire, sinking beneath the surface.\n\nCook made it off alive. He returned after the war to his home along the railway in eastern Oklahoma. By then, he'd seen the world, witnessed history before it was history. His ships steamed across the Pacific, through the Panama Canal to Africa. He fought with other sailors in the Battle of Midway and watched the Marines raising the flag on Iwo Jima.\n\nBack on land, Cook followed welding jobs from Kentucky and Pennsylvania to New Jersey and Long Island, west to North Dakota and Wisconsin and finally to a ranch house in Salinas, Calif., where he raised a family and stayed put for almost 30 years.\n\nBut one day and one place in Cook's 94 years seem to embody all the rest, the day in December 1941 when the young sailor from Oklahoma escaped the ship that sent America to war.\n\nSeven decades later, he is one of nine living survivors from the Arizona. His story is always in demand, though he'd just as soon not tell it in front of a lot of people. He remembers all the details and most of what happened later.\n\nAnd he still likes to talk about that other young fellow from Oklahoma, the one who didn't make it home.\n\nWhen he left Morris the first time in 1939 after high school, Cook wasn't sure where he'd end up. Jobs were few, so he set off for Warner, Okla, with the idea of playing football at Connors State Agricultural College.\n\n\"They told me the team was already picked,\" he said. \"I said goodbye and left.\"\n\nHis mother suggested Hills Business College in Oklahoma City. He enrolled, but after a couple of weeks, the noisy streetcars and the police sirens kept him up all night.\n\n\"I went back and told my mother I wasn't going up there anymore,\" he said.\n\nBy April 1940, the Navy seemed like a good idea and by summer, he was on board the Arizona, stationed at Pearl Harbor on the Hawaiian island of Oahu.\n\nHe was assigned a battle station in the No. 3 gun turret. His job was to put the primer in the big 14-inch gun. Other crewmen would roll out the shell, use a mechanical device to ram it in, then load four bags of powder behind it. The primer went in last, before the end of the gun was sealed shut.\n\n\"From down inside, it wasn't too bad when they fired it,\" Cook said. \"It was like a hard jolt.\"\n\nCook made it to his battle station on Dec. 7, 1941, but the Arizona was moored in a cramped harbor and couldn't have fired the big guns even in a prolonged assault. Cook and the other men stayed below deck until the smoke from a fire forced them to leave.\n\nThe bomb that shattered the Arizona's bow exploded as Cook and the others climbed out of the turret. He stepped off the deck into a motor launch as the ship was sinking.\n\nThe next morning, the Arizona was still burning as oil flowed out of her full tanks. No one seemed to be in charge on Ford Island, where Cook had spent the night. He met up with some of the guys from the turret crew and they hopped a boat to shore, where there was a call for volunteers to join the Navy's destroyers.\n\n\"We said we'd volunteer if they'd put two or three of us together on the same ship,\" he said. \"They agreed.\"\n\nCook was assigned to the USS Patterson, then two months later, transferred to the Aylwin, a destroyer that had been moored at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 and engaged the bombers as the attack began.\n\nIn February, the Aylwin was part of a U.S. task force preparing for a raid on a Japanese base at Raubal, on the island of New Britain near Australia. Enemy patrol planes spotted the ships and the raid was canceled. As the ships turned around, a squadron of enemy bombers appeared. The ships sent up their own planes and turned back the assault.\n\nIn May 1942, the Aylwin joined a task force in the Coral Sea with the USS Lexington, one of the Navy's early aircraft carriers. On the morning of May 8, the fighting intensified as American aircraft tried to turn back the enemy planes.\n\nJapanese torpedo bombers hit the Lexington and crippled the big ship. Explosions rocked the vessel and fires burned into the evening. The crew was evacuated and another U.S. destroyer scuttled the Lexington to keep the Japanese from capturing her.\n\nYears later, at a reunion in Tucson, Cook learned that one of his buddies from the Arizona had been sent to the Lexington and was in the Coral Sea when the carrier was attacked. He had settled in New Mexico with his family.\n\nCook got the buddy's telephone number and tried to call him. The buddy wasn't home, but his son-in-law answered.\n\n\"Can you tell me what ship did he go on after the Arizona?\" Cook asked.\n\n\"The Lexington,\" the son-in-law said.\n\n\"Was he on it when it sunk?\" Cook asked.\n\n\"Yes, sir, he was.\"\n\nCook never got a chance to catch up with his buddy, but marveled at the connections he seemed to make from his short stint aboard the Arizona.\n\nA month after the Coral Sea battle, Cook's ship was part of the American forces in the critical Battle of Midway. After that, he steamed north to Kodiak, Alaska, where other Navy ships were trying to turn back Japanese inroads throughout the strategically important Aleutian Islands.\n\nBefore the year was out, Cook was sent to gunnery school in Washington, D.C., and to the South Boston Navy Yard, where he joined the new destroyer Pringle on its shakedown cruise.\n\nAbout halfway through the cruise, the Pringle was ordered to accompany the battleship Iowa to Africa, where President Roosevelt was to attend a conference with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in Morocco.\n\nDuring the conference, the Pringle sailed into the Mediterranean Sea and anchored in a river. One day, some smaller boats sailed past. One of the men started yelling.\n\n\"Is there anybody there from Oklahoma?\"\n\nThere were: Cook and another crewman. The man in the boat was from Muskogee, a town about 40 miles east of Morris.\n\nLonnie and Marietta Cook met in Morris after the war, but the road to their home here today winds thousands of miles across the country.\n\nCook was discharged in 1948 in San Diego and stuck around California, where he worked as a metal finisher at Van Nuys manufacturing plant. That didn't last long and he headed back to Morris, where he met Marietta.\n\nShe likes the story of how they tied the knot. He tries to abbreviate it: \"We went to California and got married.\"\n\n\"Tell them the rest,\" Marietta prompts.\n\n\"She went to California and I followed her,\" Lonnie says.\n\nMarietta shakes her head. \"He called me one night and said if you won't let me come to California, I found a lady who's got a new black Buick and I'm going to move to Texas.\"\n\n\"It was a new Mercury,\" Lonnie says.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, come on, then,'\" Marietta says, and in 1950, they wed.\n\nThat's where the cross-country adventures begin. Cook worked in California, mostly welding jobs, until the union he belonged to called a strike. He headed east and landed in Paducah, Ky. From there, he worked jobs in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and back to New York, where he welded 20-inch gas lines going through Brooklyn.\n\nHe returned to Oklahoma again and started his own business, outfitting a one-ton Ford pickup with a winch and other equipment that let him work the oil fields. A while later, he and Marietta were on the road again, to a missile base in Sturgess, S.D., to gas lines in Wisconsin and North Dakota.\n\nFinally, they made their way to Salinas, Calif., just inland from Monterey on the central coast. They bought a small ranch and, while Lonnie continued to work welding jobs, they grew walnuts, almonds, peaches, apples, nectarines, cherries and grapes.\n\n\"I canned 500 quarts of fruit one year,\" Marietta says. \"I really miss it.\"\n\nLonnie finally retired from welding in 1982 and in 1994, the Cooks moved back to Morris. Lonnie had taken up trap shooting and hoped to do a little hunting back home. It turned out little was the right word. He hasn't hunted in a while, though he still reloads his own ammunition on a garage workbench.\n\nAfter so many years of travel, the Cooks have settled into a more tranquil pace. They spoil their granddaughters and can now move on to a new great-granddaughter. Once a week, they motor on into Tulsa, where Marietta takes a china painting class and Lonnie wanders the aisles of sporting-goods stores.\n\nOccasionally, they head into Okmulgee for an evening out at the One Fire, a casino operated by the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\n\nCook has returned to Pearl Harbor three times and he likes the Arizona memorial. It is respectful. He's not so fond of the crowds around Honolulu and doesn't plan to go back.\n\nAs he talks about Pearl Harbor again, other memories surface.\n\nCook was the gun captain on the Pringle at the battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. The ship provided fire support for the Marines going ashore. Cook stood on a shelf in the gun mount with his big binoculars and watched the Marines raise the flag to mark the U.S. victory.\n\nAbout a month later, Japanese suicide bombers sunk the Pringle near Okinawa.\n\nDuring his voyage to Alaska, Cook remembers the flying fish, which stirred up the water like a torpedo wake. That was enough to rattle nerves on board the ship, which was at general quarters every day an hour before sundown and an hour before sunrise.\n\n\"The nights up there were already short, so I didn't get much sleep,\" Cook says. \"That's what I'm catching up now. When she says anything, I tell her I'm catching up from the war.\"\n\nA few years ago, the Cooks attended a fund-raising dinner at a local American Legion post. Cook is invited to such events occasionally and sometimes introduced as an Arizona survivor.\n\nAt this one, he was looking around the room and he saw a picture of a sailor way back in the back, in a setting arranged like a memorial. He squinted and thought about where he was.\n\n\"That must be old Clyde Williams,\" he thought, the Arizona band member killed at Pearl Harbor.\n\nHe walked back there. Sure enough.\n\nIt was Clyde.\n\nUPDATE: Cook died in 2019.\n\nROSWELL, N.M.\n\nHis name was Cactus Jack and to his fans in southeastern New Mexico, he was the dulcet-voiced host of Sagebrush Serenade, a program of country music on KSWS radio.\n\nHe was in the studio on Valentine's Day 1955 when a nervous young man walked in. He was the opening act for country superstar Hank Snow that night at the North High School auditorium. He had a record, a new song he was trying out.\n\n\"Would you like to listen to it?\" the young man asked.\n\nJack shrugged. \"Sure, let's see it.\" He put the disc on a turntable and dropped the needle.\n\nWhat he heard wasn't quite country music, but he liked it and he told the kid. Song's got some zip to it, he said. He agreed to play it on his show.\n\nThe song, \"Hound Dog\" and the singer, Elvis Presley, both went over pretty well, the way Cactus Jack remembers it.\n\nFor a lot of people, meeting Elvis and playing one of his first records on the air might sound like one of life's truly unforgettable days. But John Anderson, the Navy chief petty officer who called himself Cactus Jack on the air, had a good head start already.\n\nHe had chased Japanese soldiers along the coast of China three years before America declared war on Japan. In World War II, he fought at Guadalcanal, in the battle of the Coral Sea, at Okinawa and Iwo Jima. He fought cold and hunger on a ship nearly dead in the ocean off Alaska.\n\nAfter the war, he worked as a stuntman for Orson Welles and John Wayne and helped build Alan Ladd's house in the hills outside Hollywood.\n\nAnd he was aboard on Dec. 7, 1941, when the Japanese bombed the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, a pivotal moment in history, but one that struck Anderson to his core. There, he lost his twin brother\n\n\"It was a bloody catastrophe, a bloody mess,\" he says. \"I don't think I'll ever forget what I saw that day.\"\n\nAnderson always talks about his brother, Delbert \"Jake\" Anderson, when he tells the story of his own escape from the burning ship.\n\nHe is one of nine living survivors of the Arizona and, at 97, he has amassed a lifetime of unforgettable days.\n\nAnderson grew up in the Red River Valley of northern Minnesota, the son of a prominent local judge. He had five brothers, including Jake, and four sisters, all grouped so close in age that paying for college wasn't practical for their folks.\n\nAs a youngster, Anderson heard stories about the Navy from his uncle, a man named Ray Stokes. Uncle Ray was nearing the end of his career in 1937 when John and Jake both decided to enlist.\n\nJohn was sent from training camp in Illinois to Bremerton, Wash. He was assigned briefly to the Arizona, then to the Saratoga, an aircraft carrier, then, as the Navy tinkered once more with its troop alignment, back to the Arizona.\n\nBefore the big battleship could leave Puget Sound, Anderson volunteered for another mission, joining the small Asiatic Fleet along the coast of China.\n\nAnderson went aboard the USS Edsall, a destroyer that supported various military action at sea and ashore. Japan and China were at war again and America was trying to protect its interests without getting involved in the conflict.\n\n\"We saved people on commercial ships on the seas, we rescued missionaries in the interior of China, we shot up a bunch of pirates,\" Anderson said.\n\nAt Kulangsu, an international settlement on an island off the southern Chinese coast, Anderson's unit ran into the French Foreign Legion, who had been cornered by Japanese soldiers on a high ridge.\n\n\"I'd never seen so many guys with so much guts,\" he said. \"They were holed up behind sandbags, but they never got hit.\"\n\nThe Edsall sailed farther north, then headed to the Philippines, where they played baseball with a group of indigenous Moros, who had fought the United States more than 20 years earlier.\n\n\"We were told to watch out for them, these guys were assassins,\" Anderson said. \"We made friends. We left and never fired a shot at them.\"\n\nIn 1940, Anderson reported to the Arizona once more, joining his brother for the first time since they had enlisted. They would serve together for a little over a year.\n\nThe day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Anderson volunteered for duty on the Macdonough, a destroyer that downed at least one of the Japanese attack planes on Dec. 7.\n\nThe ship steamed toward the Asiatic Pacific and soon Anderson was chasing Japanese forces again, only this time the United States was at war. This time the objective was clear.\n\nThat summer, the ship joined others for the invasion at Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands, one of the first major assaults against Japan by the Americans. The Macdonough stayed until September, then sailed back on patrol in the Pacific.\n\nIn the spring of 1943, the Macdonough headed north toward the Aleutian Islands, where Japan was trying to establish strategic strongholds that could control shipping lanes and thwart allied attacks on the Japanese islands.\n\n\"It was rough weather, foggy, raining cold,\" Anderson said. \"Here we are, we can't see the enemy. We can't see our own ships. Then we got hit.\"\n\nThe Macdonough had collided with another destroyer, the Sicard. The ship was dead in the water. The crew unloaded anything they could do without, to keep the damaged hull above the water line. They knew the oil tanker Tippecanoe was out there, but couldn't see her.\n\nFinally, the tanker spotted the destroyer. Anderson spoke to one of the tanker's crew about towing the Macdonough. The fellow he was talking with recognized Anderson's voice and they realized they had served together on the Yangtze Patrol before Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe tanker towed them to Adak, Alaska, and from there, another ship took the crippled destroyer to San Francisco for repairs.\n\nOver the next year, Anderson would sail across the South Pacific, joining other ships in the American assault on the Marshall Islands, Parry Island and the Palau Islands. The Macdonough pulled picket patrol often, protecting other troops and guarding against kamikaze attacks by Japanese planes.\n\n\"We made so many landings,\" Anderson said. \"We would go in with a landing party or we furnished artillery for the landing force. Sometimes we never landed, but we kept the line, always watching out for kamikazes.\"\n\nOn a fall day in 1945, John Anderson teetered on the base of a church steeple 110 feet above the ground. The steeple clock chimed and a statue of an angel wielding a sword emerged from an alcove and knocked Anderson off the steeple.\n\n\"Cut!\" a director yelled. A stunt coordinator helped pull Anderson from the pile of cigarette crates that had broken his fall. Anderson had finished his first day as a Hollywood stunt man.\n\nThe job wasn't what he expected in September, when he was discharged from the Navy. He had a ticket home to Minnesota, but decided to find a place to stay and come up with a plan.\n\nAs he walked past a bar, still in his Navy uniform, a fellow popped out the door and looked Anderson up and down, checking him out more closely someone would ordinarily.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Anderson demanded to know.\n\n\"You,\" the fellow said. \"Are you in the Navy?\"\n\n\"I was,\" Anderson said. \"I just got discharged. The war's over.\"\n\n\"Would you like a job?\" The fellow told him to report to the front gate of Sam Goldwyn's studio in Hollywood on Monday morning. He gave Anderson the name of a contact there.\n\nAnderson decided he had nothing to lose. After an initial run-in with the guard at the gate (\"Three weeks ago, I was shooting at people and killing them and I didn't even know who they were,\" he growled at the guard. \"You I know.\") he met his contact and not long after, he was standing in for Orson Welles in a scene from the movie \"The Stranger.\"\n\nIt turned out most of the regular stuntmen were still in the military. The studios needed tough men who could handle dangerous situations. The job paid $700.\n\n\"Next thing you know, I'm in a movie with John Wayne,\" Anderson says years later. \"I didn't have any speaking parts, but I was working for the studio and they paid me.\"\n\nHe got to know Alan Ladd, who had starred in a series of war movies. When the regular stuntmen returned and the studio cut loose the subs, Ladd hired some of them to work on his house in the Holmby Hills above Los Angeles.\n\nAt nights, Anderson was taking classes in meteorology and electronics, trying to learn skills that could help him stand out among all the returning servicemen and women.\n\nOne day, he stopped for coffee at the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood. He felt a tap on his shoulder. He saw Gene LaRocque, a man he'd served with aboard the Macdonough.\n\n\"Are you out of the Navy, Andy?\" LaRocque asked. When Anderson said he was, his old friend was incredulous. \"Andy, you had 12 years of the damnedest fighting I ever saw. You're the bravest man I ever know. You can't leave the Navy.\"\n\nLaRocque took Anderson to San Pedro, where his current ship was anchored. He introduced him to other officers. By the end of the day, had persuaded Anderson to sign up for the Navy Reserve. Put in eight years at least and you'll have a pension, he promised.\n\nAnderson would serve another 23 years before finally retiring once more.\n\nAnderson's road to the radio booth started in Hollywood, with a screen test at a studio where he had worked. He waited for the result. You have a great voice, he was told. Why not try radio?\n\nSo he did. He started on a small station, playing organ music. An administrator at Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, N.M., heard Anderson and talked him into joining the school to help improve its radio station and start a television station.\n\nAnderson picked up and moved to New Mexico. He clashed with the station manager of the radio station and finally quit. Or got fired. Or both. That led to a job in Roswell, the Sagebrush Serenade and Elvis Presley.\n\n\"They played country music because the people here loved that,\" Anderson says. \"Some of the ships I was on had guys who liked to play the guitar, so I knew something about it. The owner said, 'give it a name and say who are. Anything you choose is fine. You're on your own, every day.'\"\n\nAs Cactus Jack, Anderson made a few concessions to his seagoing past.\n\n\"I cleaned up my language,\" he says, admitting he deployed a salty vocabulary, even after leaving active duty. \"In the service, if you didn't use nasty words, you weren't a good sailor.\"\n\nA few years later, a new station owner showed Anderson his plans to start a TV station. He said he wanted Anderson to join the on-air staff. Did he know anything about meteorology?\n\nAnderson smiled. Did he ever. Soon, he became one of the earliest TV weathermen and an evening fixture in Roswell homes, or at least those with televisions.\n\nNot long after he returned to Pearl Harbor near the end of the war, Anderson searched out some of the battle reports from Dec. 7, 1941. He knew his brother hadn't made it off the Arizona alive, but he didn't know much else.\n\nHe found a report by a gunner's mate. The report said most of the guys in the anti-aircraft batteries, where Jake fought, were shot down early in the assault. When the fourth bomb detonated in the powder magazine, anyone left was blown over the side.\n\nAnderson has returned to the Arizona memorial often and has taken his family there. He has met many of his old friends and shipmates. Many have since died.\n\n\"It's always a great thing for me to see them,\" he says. \"That's what I want to remember. The things I don't want to remember was the blood.\"\n\nAlthough he is 97, he decided he couldn't miss a final reunion this year and he bought his tickets early. He wanted one last unforgettable day.\n\nUPDATE: John Anderson died in November 2015, less than a year after this report.\n\nPhotographing survivors of the battleship USS Arizona\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.\n\nDonald Stratton completed the paperwork for a concealed weapons permit at the El Paso County Sheriff's Office and approached the counter to submit fingerprints.\n\nHe was still adjusting to his new life in Colorado, hundreds of miles inland from his old home in coastal California and more than a mile higher in elevation. He had turned 90 and was starting over again.\n\nAs he waited, he had a feeling he knew what would happen, but he didn't say anything. A clerk tried to complete the process, normally a routine, if messy, step to secure the permit. She returned, puzzled.\n\nThey were having trouble reading his prints, she told Stratton. It was as if he had none.\n\nStratton hesitated, then confirmed her suspicion. His fingers were almost smooth, lacking all but a few of the swirls that create an identity.\n\nStratton told her why: He had been aboard the USS Arizona when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec 7, 1941. He survived, but was burned badly over two-thirds of his body. Doctors treated him and he recovered, but the his fingers never healed properly.\n\nThe clerks decided they could not send Stratton away without his permit. They found a way to take prints from the edges of his fingers, enough to satisfy the law.\n\nAs he recounts the experience, he rubs his hands together, then holds them out, turning them over. He pushes his shirtsleeves up to show his arms. He motions toward his gnarled ear. He catalogs the scars and their origin.\n\nThey are the marks of a survivor, 73 years on. They are reminders of a moment in time he can never escape, a moment he sees again and again.\n\n\"Through all that, I never did lose consciousness,\" he says. \"I knew everything that was going on.\"\n\nAs the USS Arizona burned and sunk into the harbor, Stratton and five other men had been trapped on an anti-aircraft gun control platform on the ship's foremast, burned in a fireball when below-deck ammunition exploded.\n\nA sailor on the repair ship Vestal, tied up nearby, spotted them and threw them a line. The men, their charred skin peeling away, climbed hand-over-hand across the line to safety.\n\nStratton and other men climbed into a small boat that took them ashore. They still had to climb onto the dock and then into a truck for a short ride to a Navy hospital. The burn ward filled with the injured. The smell of burned skin filled the air. Doctors and nurses wove among gurneys, administering morphine shots and looking for the victims most in need.\n\nWithin a day or two, someone came into the ward and said a few of the wounded would be sent to California. He asked for volunteers.\n\n\"I'll go,\" Stratton said.\n\n\"No,\" the worker said. \"We don't think you'd make it. Maybe next time.\"\n\n\"I want to go anyway,\" Stratton said.\n\n\"Fine,\" the worker said. \"If you can stand up and stay up while we change the linen on this bed, we'll see about it.\"\n\nStratton climbed to his feet and, biting back the pain, he stood and when his bed was ready, he collapsed back into it. By Christmas, he was in a hospital at Mare Island near San Francisco. He stayed there for months. He weighed 92 pounds by the time he was sent to rehabilitation in Corona, Calif. Finally, the Navy gave him a medical discharge.\n\nA year later, he felt better, so he re-enlisted. The Navy wanted to keep him in Idaho, working with new recruits at a boot camp, but he pushed for a seagoing assignment and wound up on the destroyer USS Stack as a gunner's mate.\n\nHe saw action across the South Pacific, patrolled areas where suicide bombers were attacking American destroyers. Once he was awakened by a loud noise and a flash and thought his ship was under attack.\n\nIt wasn't, but the flash was a reminder, as if he needed anything more.\n\nBefore the end of the war, he went to San Diego for gunner's mate school. He finished his training and was discharged in December 1945.\n\nStratton grew up in the tiny prairie town of Red Cloud, Neb., about as far away from an ocean as any place in the country. He joined the Navy because it seemed like a better environment.\n\n\"You either had a nice place aboard a ship and were high and dry or you didn't have anything,\" he reasoned. \"In the Army you were crawling around in the mud and everything else and I didn't want to do that.\"\n\nAfter his second discharge, he knocked around Nebraska again, working in his dad's tavern, then on a beer truck, but he grew bored. He decided to head back to the water. In California, he earned his naval seaman's license and went to work on a drilling rig offshore near Santa Barbara.\n\nHe made bargemaster on a huge drilling rig, but yearned for something more interesting, so he got a job as a tender with a commercial deep sea diving business. As a tender, he stayed on the surface, monitoring the divers working on rigs, piers, pipelines, any piece of seaside or seagoing equipment.\n\nStratton logged thousands of miles of travel. Nicaragua. Chile. Colombia. Kuwait. In Alaska, he helped set up platforms that could keep up with tides that rose and fell as much as 32 feet.\n\nIn his dining room in Colorado Springs, he keeps a replica of a hard diving helmet, the kind his divers used. The face plate is glass and around the bottom are screws that would secure it to the diving suit. Stratton falls easily into the memories of his years on diving boats.\n\n\"We worked with a crane barge capable of lifting 700 tons,\" he sys. \"I motioned to crane operator what we needed, what tools to send down.\" He touches the diving helmet. \"I ran the decompression chamber on jobs. Once, I made a dive in a two-man submarine, down in over 1,200 feet of water off Santa Barbara coast. One of the first people to do that.\"\n\nFor years, Stratton wore the scars from the Arizona without talking about them much. Lots of men brought home scars from World War II and Korea. The offshore diving business could leave its own kind of scars.\n\nIn 1966, 25 years after the attack, Stratton returned to Pearl Harbor with his family. In the waters off Honolulu, he confronted his memories. It was the first time Randy, his son, had seen his father cry.\n\nIn the years after, he became active in survivors' groups and started going back to Pearl Harbor more often. At the USS Arizona memorial, he became friends with a National Park Service historian and inspired a Pearl Harbor action figure that the service sold at the gift shop.\n\nIn time, he felt no anger toward the Japanese, but he couldn't forget what they did. Sometimes, Japanese pilots attended memorial ceremonies and some of the other survivors would shake their hands. Stratton could not.\n\n\"Listen, all those men down there on that ship, a thousand of them, they wouldn't do it and I don't think they'd want me to do it,\" he says. \"We can't forget what happened there that day. We can't let it happen again.\"\n\nA while back, Stratton and his wife Velma retired to Yuma and lived there about 15 years. He played a lot of golf, but missed California. They moved to Santa Maria, not far from Santa Barbara, to be near their oldest son, then to Colorado Springs to be near Randy. They will celebrate 65 years of marriage in April.\n\nThe Stratton men have taken up a more personal cause. He wants to secure a proper medal for Joe George, the sailor from the Vestal who helped rescue the six men from the gunner's control tower.\n\nA lot of people agree that what George did was heroic, but the Navy balks at every step, in part because George disobeyed a direct order.\n\n\"He should have the Navy Cross,\" Stratton says. \"He saved six people's lives. Joe saved six lives and he didn't get crap. He refused to cut the line no matter what. As far he was concerned he was saving lives.\"\n\nIn 1971, Stratton was working long hours with a diving outfit on a nuclear power plant project not far from Santa Barbara. He needed a truck to carry equipment back and forth, so he scouted out a car lot and bought a 1965 Chevrolet pickup.\n\nHe kept the truck, held on to it through repairs, engine overhauls, new paint jobs. It sits today in the carport outside his home. He still tools around town in the truck, but it's a classic now, so he drives it almost as often to car shows.\n\nHe can tell stories about his years with the diving crews, but the truck has evolved into a reminder of another time. The license plate reads USS ARIZ. A mural on a white bed cover depicts the USS Arizona and the memorial that floats above it in Pearl Harbor. It identifies Stratton as a survivor of the attack that sank the ship.\n\nWherever he goes on the pickup, people ask him about his experience. Yes, he'll say, he was on the Arizona and he survived. Yes, a lot of brave men died. Yes, some of them were his friends.\n\nHe still remembers the day he saw the Arizona in dry dock at Bremerton, Wash.\n\n\"It was quite a sight for an old flatlander like me to see a 35,000-ton battleship out of the water,\" he says. \"It was a big ship with a lot of metal, I'll tell you.\" He owns a chunk of the ship's burned deck, a reminder he keeps in a box with a few other items.\n\nOn a recent fall afternoon, Stratton ambles down the driveway and fires up the engine. He eases the truck out of the carport, far enough to show it off. He fiddles with the radio.\n\n\"Randy, come and turn on the music box.\" His son reaches in the cab and queues up one of the hundreds of songs he and his daughter downloaded onto the new MP3 player.\n\n\"Lots of big band songs,\" Randy says, as the first bars of a brass line pour from the speakers. \"The stuff he likes.\"\n\nHow lucky can one guy be?\n\nI kissed her and she kissed me\n\nStratton's eyes brighten. A smile spreads across his face as Dean Martin's voice fills the cab.\n\nLike a fella once said\n\nAin't that a kick in the head?\n\nThe smile widens. Almost imperceptibly, he sways.\n\nUPDATE: Donald Stratton died in 2020.\n\nWEST WARWICK, R.I.\n\nThe six men stared straight ahead, almost as if they were back in line, at attention. They listened for their names and their service branch. They stayed composed as their stories were told, stories of bravery, of quick thinking. Stories of survival.\n\nEach of the six men were at Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, when Japanese planes swarmed the Navy fleet in an ambush that would provoke war. On the 70th anniversary of the attack, the men had been brought to the state capitol to receive new honors.\n\nAs each name was read, Rhode Island National Guard Maj. Gen. Kevin McBride presented the man with the Rhode Island Star, one of the state's highest military honors.\n\nWorld War II veterans are a special breed, Lt. Col. Denis Riel said as the men accepted the medals. Without them, Riel said, who knows where we'd be today.\n\nMcBride reached the last man, Raymond Haerry, a 20-year-old coxswain on the day of the assault. Haerry straightened in his seat as his story was told. He had escaped the USS Arizona, the battleship whose losses surpassed any other.\n\nFor Haerry, McBride had a the state's highest military honor, the Rhode Island Cross. Haerry accepted the medal, but found he could not speak. He handed the microphone to his son, Raymond Haerry, Jr., who spoke of his father's courage and resilience.\n\nThree years later, Ray Haerry Jr. holds the cross in his hand, fighting back tears.\n\n\"I hadn't told him he was going to be individually honored that day,\" he says. \"I had to help my father out of his seat. He stood strong and tall right in front of this general. I heard the general say, 'You're a remarkable guy.' I think it was one of the proudest days of my father's life.\"\n\nHis dad has never sought recognition for his service on the Arizona and barely talks about the day of the attack. He will tell his story to people he knows well and trusts, but he is 93 and the details are fading from his memory.\n\nIn 2011, he was one of six Rhode Islanders who had lived through the attack on Pearl Harbor, the only one from the Arizona. Today, he is one of nine remaining survivors from the mighty battleship.\n\n\"I do as much as I can to keep his story alive,\" his son says. \"It's always been my fear that people are going to forget that day, that people are going to forget the sacrifice that was made that day.\"\n\nHaerry ran away from home to join the Navy. He grew up in New Jersey and after high school, enrolled at MIT in Boston. He was smart enough to excel, but started cutting classes not long after the start of his first semester.\n\nHe and a buddy would sneak off campus and hop freight trains to see how far they could get. He missed enough of his classes that he was finally asked to leave. As soon as he turned 18, he enlisted in the Navy.\n\nOn the Arizona, he worked on the deck crew. He cleaned and painted day after day, but he also operated the motor boats used to ferry crew members to shore, a job that let him leave the ship periodically.\n\nHaerry had made two runs to shore on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941. It was Sunday and some of the crewmen with liberty wanted an early start. He was eating breakfast when he heard the first pops of the attack planes strafing Battleship Row.\n\nHe ran to the anti-aircraft battery, his battle station, but there was no ammunition ready. He could see the planes were flying too low for his guns anyway, but before his crew could figure out their next move, an armor-piercing bomb detonated near the powder magazine beneath the No. 2 gun turret.\n\nHaerry felt the entire ship life out of the water. As it fell, he was thrown from the ship into the harbor. He half-swam, half-walked the 70 yards to Ford Island and manned a mounted machine gun. He spent the rest of the day retrieving bodies from the harbor.\n\n\"He remembers body parts in the water, charred burned bodies that he swam by,\" his son Ray, Jr., says. \"Something had happened that no one could comprehend.\"\n\nHaerry sailed on Navy ships through World War II and again during the Korean conflict. He spent long months on a tender, a vessel that carries equipment, parts and other supplies for ships at sea.\n\nOn one mission, Haerry's tender was tied to a larger ship as the crew delivered supplies and completed maintenance tasks. The sky began to darken and the wind grew. A storm was approaching, a big one by the looks of it.\n\nThe tender didn't want to be tied to the larger ship when the worst of the storm blew through. High winds could slam one ship into the other and sink one or both of the vessels.\n\nHaerry held the rope that connected the ships as another crewman swung an ax to cut it. As the boat heaved, the man with the ax missed and hit Haerry's hand, nearly severing it from his wrist. He did not reach a hospital for several days, but doctors still saved his hand.\n\nA year after World War II ended, Haerry went home for a while and married a girl he'd met not long before. He and Evelyn had their first son, Ray, Jr., in 1947.\n\nFor a while, the young family lived in Puerto Rico as Haerry, now a chief boatswain's mate, drew new assignments aboard his tender.\n\n\"He was out to sea nine months out of the year, only home for three months,\" Ray Jr. says. \"He was very military by then, very disciplined.\"\n\nAfter he returned from Korea, Haerry was promoted to master chief petty officer, signifying his experience and level of service. He had turned down a promotion to ensign, preferring the camaraderie of the enlisted ranks.\n\nAt his request, he was assigned to the officer candidate school in Newport, R.I. He left home at 5 every morning and took a ferry from Jamestown to the Navy base. He liked teaching and liked the chance to instill discipline.\n\n\"I've gotten letters from some of the officer candidates who had my father as an instructor,\" Ray Jr. says. \"They said he was a tough bastard, but that's exactly what they needed.\"\n\nHis service on the Arizona also seemed to give him added credibility among the young sailors. They respected a guy who survived such a horrific attack.\n\nThere was a tradition at the end of training that the graduates would give the chief a silver dollar. Haerry would come home on those days with cigar boxes full of the coins.\n\nFor a long time, Haerry never talked about his experiences at Pearl Harbor. He displayed no pictures, kept no mementos that his family knew about. He would answer questions, but in short bursts of description, with no emotion.\n\n\"The only people he would talk to were either very close friends or relatives,\" his son says. \"He'd always have to be prompted.\"\n\nIt took Ray Jr. years, decades to piece together his father's story. He would draw out snippets and stash them away, collecting them until he would weave the barest narrative.\n\nAs anniversaries of the attack passed, Ray Jr. would asked his dad if he wanted to visit the USS Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor.\n\nNope. He wanted to part of it. He's never been back.\n\n\"I can understand that,\" Ray Jr. says. \"To go through that to me is incomprehensible. Nobody was expecting anything like that.\"\n\nHis dad will return finally at his death. Ray Jr. has arranged for his father's remains to be interred in the sunken Arizona, an honor accorded any of the sailors or Marines who survived the attack.\n\nThree years ago, Ray Jr. received a call from a lieutenant colonel in the Rhode Island National Guard. He told Ray about the plans to honor Pearl Harbor survivors at the statehouse. One of the survivors would receive the Rhode Island Cross.\n\nAs they talked, Ray mentioned that his dad had been aboard the Arizona. That caught the lieutenant colonel's interest. He called back a few days later.\n\n\"We found our guy,\" he told Ray Jr.\n\nFive years ago, Haerry moved into a nursing home, He stays in a room on the second floor. Thickets of tangled shrubs and rows of trees are visible from his window.\n\nThe nurse who checks in on him regularly likes Haerry. She prods him to move around more and to leave the room for meals. He has told her about his escape from the Arizona.\n\nRay Jr. seems surprised. \"He told you the story?\" She nods and smiles.\n\nHaerry accepts the chocolate bars his son has brought him. He likes chocolate and is disappointed if Ray Jr. forgets it. There are a few personal photos on the table, but nothing from his years in the Navy.\n\nExcept the cap. The USS Arizona ballcap that almost every survivor owns and wears.\n\nHe doesn't want to answer questions about his war service, shrugging them off or insisting he can't remember the details anymore. But he clutches the cap and puts it on as he sits in an easy chair by the window.\n\n\"These guys were the first heroes of the war, even though the war hasn't been declared,\" Ray Jr. says. \"I think my dad was one of the first American heroes of World War II.\"\n\nHe and his father chat a little. Haerry says he wants lunch delivered to his room, but the nurse says no. You need the exercise. Haerry nods and like a good sailor taking orders from the chief, he pulls himself up with a walker and shuffles off to lunch.\n\nUPDATE: Raymond Haerry died in 2016.\n\nYUBA CITY, Calif.\n\nJoe Langdell found a table in the wardroom of one of the ships moored in Pearl Harbor and sat down with his breakfast.\n\nThree days had passed since Japanese bombers had punched a fiery hole in the Navy's Pacific fleet. Three days since the war started.\n\nCrippled ships still floated around the mooring posts along Ford Island. Repair crews were already at work on the battleships that had survived. Salvage work would begin soon on others. Sailors found food and shelter wherever they could.\n\nLangdell's ship, the USS Arizona, lay dead in the water where she sank 14 minutes into the attack. The mast and towers near the bow tilted at a sickening angle. Fire had blackened much of the structure still visible.\n\nLangdell heard someone enter the room.\n\n\"Are there any officers from the Arizona here?\" he said.\n\nLangdell was an ensign, an entry-level officer, not yet a year in the Navy. He was nervous about volunteering for anything, but he raised his hand.\n\nThe man walked over and looked at Langdell's name tag.\n\n\"Mr. Langdell,\" he said, \"when you're done with your breakfast, you'll report to the pier and you'll be met by a motor whale boat and a party of 20 enlisted men with sheets and pillow cases.\"\n\nWhat is this? Langdell thought.\n\n\"You will go to the Arizona and you will take off all the bodies and body parts above the water line,\" the man said. \"Cover the decks, anywhere you can find them up to the top of the masts.\"\n\n\"So that's what we did,\" he says, staring out at the harbor nearly seven decades later.\n\nLangdell is one of the last nine survivors from the Arizona. At 100, he is the oldest.\n\nHe was on Ford Island when the Japanese attacked, training for new assignment. His own battle station was beneath the gun turret shattered by the last bomb to hit the Arizona. From the shore, he helped wounded men from the water, men whose bodies had been torn apart by bombs and bullets and fire.\n\nBut he could not be prepared for what he found on the charred hulk of the battleship. He still will not talk about it. His younger son believes the experience changed his dad forever.\n\n\"How could it not?\" the son wonders.\n\nLangdell says only this: \"It took two days to take all the bodies. We carefully wrapped them in sheets. The body parts we put in pillow cases. We swept the decks and took the small bones. Everything was taken ashore and properly taken care of.\"\n\nLangdell arrived at Pearl Harbor along a different path than many of the young sailors, who signed up for the service because they were unable to find work as civilians.\n\nBorn in 1914, seven months after the first bolts were tightened on a new battleship in Brooklyn, Langdell grew up wooded agricultural area along the Souhegan River in southern New Hampshire.\n\nHis dad operated a livery stable and a small dairy and later earned money as an auctioneer. The family sold maple syrup distilled from the trees on their farm.\n\nAfter high school, Langdell enrolled at Boston University, working nights to pay for his classes, and in 1938, he earned a degree in business administration. He went to work as a junior accountant for a prominent Boston firm.\n\nBut he became restless. He signed up for a Navy program that allowed college graduates to attend officer candidate school and emerge as ensigns within three months. By early 1941, Langdell was one of the \"90-day wonders\" and drew his first assignment: The USS Arizona.\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Langdell asked for a posting on one of the new destroyers the Navy was set to launch. He was soon aboard the USS Frazier, which left the shipyard at San Francisco in July 1942.\n\nThe Frazier patrolled the South Pacific at first, but in early 1943, steamed northward toward Alaska, where Japan was trying to secure positions in the Aleutian Islands.\n\nOne day in May, crewmen spotted two periscopes in the water and the Frazier opened fire. The guns hit the periscope. Using its sonar equipment, the ship fired depth charges and eventually sank the enemy submarine.\n\nToward the end the war, Langdell was stationed in the Philippines, at a base in Manila. Among his responsibilities was overseeing the naval officers' clubs in the area.\n\nOne morning, he was at his desk, catching up on paperwork, when he heard a vehicle screech to a halt outside. A young sailor ran in, out of breath.\n\n\"Mr. Langdell, Mr. Langdell, you've got to come here quick,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it?\" Langdell asked.\n\n\"It's easier if you come see it,\" the sailor said.\n\nThey hopped in a Jeep and head up the hill toward one of the Quonset huts, the one where liquor for the officers' clubs was stored. As they walked toward it, Langdell reeled at an odor. Alcohol.\n\nInside, he found broken bottles scattered in a soggy soup of booze and cardboard. Someone had stacked the boxes too high and in the humid environment of the island, the cardboard had grown damp and weak.\n\nThe boxes had collapsed.\n\nLangdell was discharged at the war's end and returned to Massachusetts, where his wife, Libby, waited.\n\nJoe had met Elizabeth McGauhy in Chicago half a decade earlier. He was attending midshipman's school at Northwestern University. She was attending an art academy to learn dress designing. They met at a dance at the YWCA on North State Street.\n\nThey danced. They went out for coffee afterward. They continued to see each other and, when Langdell left for Hawaii, they corresponded, often.\n\nAs he prepared for his new posting on the Frazier, Langdell decided to make a move. He asked his brother, Ted, to visit Libby and see if she could cook. The report: Oh, yes, she can cook.\n\nJoe proposed and Libby accepted. They would be married in San Francisco, before the Frazier set sail. The only question was how Langdell would send Libby word about his arrival from Pearl Harbor. The Navy censors would never allow such information in a letter.\n\nLangdell knew Libby was friends with a skater in the Ice Follies, which was summering in San Francisco. He wrote Libby a letter and suggested it would be a good idea if Libby visited her friend on or about a particular date. Libby got the message.\n\nThey were married in an Episcopal Church on Van Ness Avenue. Langdell had borrowed a car, a Dusenburg, for the honeymoon. Libby had arranged stays north of the city. Friends told them when the left the church, keep the water on their left.\n\nWhat they didn't count on was the side-street parking. Langdell took a right turn instead of a left and the newlyweds didn't realize their mistake until they stopped for gas in Gilroy, about 80 miles south of San Francisco.\n\nThe Langdells ended up honeymooning in Monterey and Carmel on the central California coast.\n\nAfter the war, Langdell returned to the family auction business in Massachusetts, but after all those years in Hawaii, the Philippines and in the tropical South Seas, he couldn't readjust to the cold. He and Libby moved west to Walnut Creek east of San Francisco.\n\nThey eventually bought a home-furnishings outlet farther inland and finally built their own store in Yuba City, north of Sacramento. They ran Joe and Libby Langdell's Village Mart for more than 20 years until they retired.\n\nOccasionally, they would close the store and hook a 33-foot trailer to a pick-up truck. They traveled around the country, meeting up with other USS Arizona survivors, with shipmates from the Frazier. Keeping the memories alive.\n\nLangdell returned to Pearl Harbor in 1976. His oldest son had joined the Navy and his first posting was aboard the USS Ouellet, a frigate. The family visited the Arizona memorial and toured other sites near the harbor.\n\nBefore the trip, Langdell hadn't talked much about his years in the war, about his time on the Arizona. Afterward, Langdell sought out other survivors who had formed reunion organizations. He was active in those groups for many years, serving as president of one devoted to the Arizona.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of the attack neared, Langdell got a call from a documentary filmmaker. He wanted to interview Langdell for his project. He was also interviewing a Japanese pilot named Zenji Abe, a pilot who had taken part in the raid on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Would Langdell agree to meet Abe on film?\n\nThe two men not only met, they took a boat to the USS Arizona memorial and laid a wreath in front of the wall with the names of the crewmen who died on the ship.\n\nIn the documentary, \"The Life and Death of a Lady,\" Langdell and Abe speak, side by side on the memorial. Abe offered condolences and said he prayed that all their souls were at peace.\n\nLangdell said much more.\n\n\"It is only by the grace of God that I stand here today,\" he said. \"I witnessed your attack from Ford Island. Helpless, I watched your bomb sink the Arizona in nine minutes.\"\n\nSentiment ran high against the Japanese, he said, but also against U.S. leaders whose decisions many questioned in the aftermath. He acknowledged the wreath.\n\n\"I appreciate your thoughtfulness. It took more courage on your part to present this wreath than it did for me to accept it.\"\n\nIn 2006, Langdell walked along the steep shoreline of Ford Island, the Arizona memorial in the background. He told his story as his son, Ted, recorded it on video.\n\n\"The lesson I've learned from that experience is that the 1,177 men entombed on the ship right now will never know the love of a wife or the joy of grandchildren,\" he said. \"It's just not going to happen. We all have to remember that they did not die in vain.\"\n\nOn Oct. 12, Langdell celebrated his 100th birthday with with his older son, John, who flew in from Spearfish, S.D. On Veteran's Day, he participated once more in a parade through Marysville, the next town over from Yuba City. But he doesn't tell his story anymore, not on his own.\n\nLangdell lives now in a skilled nursing center. He has trouble remembering the past. He struggles to speak at times (though when he's feeling good, he likes to flirt with the nurses). He sits in his wheelchair as his son recites the narrative, keeping his father's story alive.\n\nPhotographs hang on the walls of his room. His wife, Libby, who died two years ago. His kids and grandkids. Pictures of past parades. A framed painting of the Arizona, the repair ship Vestal next to it.\n\nHe likes to wear a cap that identifies him as a veteran of the Arizona.\n\n\"Why do you like the hat, dad?\" Ted asks.\n\n\"It acknowledges to people that I'm a survivor,\" Joe replies, his voice soft. \"The hat represents the Arizona.\n\nTed asks him about the ship.\n\n\"The Arizona was a fighting battleship,\" Joe says. \"One of the last ones…\" He talks about going aboard the Frazier.\n\nLangdell will return to the Arizona once more. When he dies, his remains will be interred under the No. 4 gun turret, with the men who died there and survivors who had died since.\n\nA final tribute.\n\nUPDATE: Joe Langdell died in February 2015, months after this report.\n\n1914-1941: The mightiest ship at sea | Dec. 7, 1941: The attack that changed the world | Documentary: 'Witness to Infamy' | 2014: The final toast", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/history/2017/04/28/hindenburg-80th-anniversary/100564104/", "title": "Hindenburg at 80: An interactive look into the tragic, fateful voyage", "text": "Erik Larsen\n\n@Erik_Larsen\n\nA drizzle fell as the 36 passengers stepped off the bus at the city's international airport from the Frankfurter Hof Hotel. Looming before them was the largest airship ever built: LZ-129 — the Hindenburg.\n\nNJ, share your Hindenburg memories with APP\n\nIn the midst of the Great Depression, the Hindenburg's passengers were the 1 percenters of their day. A one-way ticket on the Zeppelin airship between Nazi Germany and the United States in 1937 cost $450 – the equivalent of $7,619 today.\n\nIts 63rd and final flight had one destination: Lakehurst, New Jersey.\n\nBeginning in the 1920s, this small town in the scrub pines of South Jersey sat adjacent to Naval Air Station Lakehurst, home of the Navy's lighter-than-air program. Its immense Hangar One was built after World War I to shelter Zeppelins that Germany had been required to surrender as part of its war reparations.\n\nThe Navy base was one of the few places in the United States that had the facilities, equipment and trained personnel necessary to accommodate and service Hindenburg, as well as its sister ship, Graf Zeppelin. That made the Lakehurst station the first international airport in America.\n\nThe passengers who climbed up the gangway stairs in Frankfurt into Hindenburg's 803.8-foot-long superstructure included business executive Hermann Doehner, 50. The manager of a pharmaceutical company in Mexico City, Doehner was returning to North America with his wife, Matilde, 41, and three of their children – Irene, Walter and Werner, ages 14, 10 and 8, respectively — after a spring vacation to their native fatherland.\n\nMORE: Hindenburg crash site to be opened to public Saturday\n\nMORE: Is Hindenburg haunted by a Nazi legacy?\n\nMORE: 6 things you didn't know about the Hindenburg\n\nOthers preparing to embark that day included writers, exporters and importers, a tea merchant, a fashion designer, an heiress, senior Reich military officers, and one celebrity German-American acrobat and stage performer — Joseph Späh, 32, who was making the transatlantic crossing home with his German shepherd, Ulla.\n\nIt would become the final voyage of the Hindenburg. Three days later after flying 4,000 miles, the ship burst into flames as it tried to dock in Lakehurst.\n\nThirteen of the 36 passengers and 22 of the 61 flight crew would not survive. The May 6 inferno that would devour the Hindenburg in 32 seconds became the first disaster ever captured on film and the first motion picture to go viral: the footage was distributed in newsreels and played in movie theaters across the globe.\n\nThe tragedy, soon to be remembered this May 6 in 80th-anniversary observances on both sides of the Atlantic, became seared into our history.\n\nHindenburg's ill-fated journey marked the end of the age of airships and one of the last times that Americans would gaze up into the sky and see Nazi swastikas flying over their cities and farms.\n\nThis was the eve of World War II and the Hindenburg, a floating Titanic in both size and hubris, was about to foreshadow that greater human catastrophe in the years ahead.\n\nThe embers of the First World War were about to set fire again to the world.\n\nFor some time, Germany had been brazenly rebuilding its war machine despite strict prohibitions against it in the 17-year-old Versailles Treaty. Within a year, Germany would invade and annex Austria.\n\nTwo weeks before the Hindenburg disaster, in Berlin, U.S. Ambassador William E. Dodd met with Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath to protest increasing anti-American animus in the state-controlled German press.\n\nIn the United States, anti-Nazi sentiment was also on the rise. In March 1937, two months before the disaster, about 25,000 people filled Madison Square Garden in New York to demand a U.S. boycott of Germany.\n\nNew York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia had previously drawn protests from Washington and Berlin after he told an organization of Jewish women that when the 1939 World's Fair came to the city in two years, Hitler ought to be included in \"a chamber of horrors.\"\n\nSpeaking before the rally at Madison Square Garden, LaGuardia doubled down. He called Hitler \"a brown-shirted fanatic\" and promised to continue saying so.\n\nSecurity for the Hindenburg was beefed up after the Zeppelin offices in Germany received threats against the airship ahead of its first flight of the 1937 season – the one from Frankfurt to Lakehurst.\n\n\"There were Gestapo agents at Lakehurst,\" Carl S. Jablonski, president of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, told the Asbury Park Press in a recent interview, as he recounted the historical context. \"There had been threats to blow up the Hindenburg.\"\n\nColossal, beautiful and extraordinarily expensive to build, operate and maintain, Hindenburg had its silver tail fins festooned with the red, white and black swastika flag — which since 1935 was the single national flag of Germany.\n\nThe Hitler regime had heavily subsidized the $3 million construction cost of Hindenburg, its value to the Nazis immeasurable as a propaganda tool. Yet no one but the most dedicated airship enthusiasts thought that the future of commercial aviation was in dirigibles or blimps.\n\n\"The historical truth about the Hindenburg was that it was obsolete before it ever flew,\" said Dan Grossman, co-author of the book, \"Zeppelin Hindenburg: An Illustrated History of LZ-129,\" which is scheduled for release on Monday by The History Press in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"The first Pan Am 'clipper' had already flown in 1935 and it was a lot cheaper,\" Grossman said.\n\nThat transpacific flight, made between San Francisco and Manila – while Hindenburg was still under construction in Germany – was operated by a fixed-wing, four-engine M-130, which had a cruising speed 83 percent faster than the Zeppelins and could operate 10,000 feet higher.\n\nGrossman, who is also the publisher of the website airships.net, which has served as a source for many of the technical details about Hindenburg in this article, said commercial airship travel would have been eclipsed by the airplane even if the Hindenburg had not gone up in flames 80 years ago.\n\nThe tragedy in Lakehurst and World War II simply hastened its demise.\n\nAs the passengers arrived at the Frankfurt airport, the flight crew under the command of Capt. Max Pruss, was already aboard or outside inspecting the exterior of the ship, readying Hindenburg for departure.\n\nClick for a full-screen i nteractive 360-degree photosphere inside the control car of the Hindenburg replica at Lakehurst, created by Universal Studios. (360-degree image by Thomas P. Costello)\n\nOwing to the 7 million cubic feet of flammable hydrogen in 16 cells above the two passenger decks within the rocket-shaped, rigid dirigible, everyone was instructed to surrender any lighters or matches before boarding.\n\nSmoking was permitted in flight, but only inside an airtight, pressurized lounge accessed through an airlock and equipped with an electric lighter. It was one of the most popular places on the ship, where cocktails could also be ordered with one's smoke, according to Grossman.\n\nThere are only two gases that weigh less than air used in airships 80 years ago: one was hydrogen and the other was helium. Hydrogen is highly combustible. When mixed with air, the slightest spark will cause it to violently combine with oxygen, a reaction that produces H2O - water. Helium is inert and cannot be ignited.\n\nIn the 1930s, the United States had a monopoly on the world's supply of helium and was using it in its own airships operated by the Navy. In 1927, the U.S. passed the Helium Control Act, which generally banned the exportation of helium.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the statute was not adopted because America feared another war with Germany. The federal government had simply concluded there was not enough helium to share, the author Grossman said.\n\n\"The German attitude about hydrogen in airships was the same as our attitude about gasoline in our cars,\" Grossman said. \"When you go to work, you've got 10 to 12 gallons of gasoline in your fuel tank, which is far more explosive than hydrogen. You don't think about it because everything is operating as it is supposed to.\"\n\nClick for a full-screen interactive 36-degree photosphere inside the control car of the Hindenburg replica at Lakehurst, created by Universal Studios. (360-degree image by Thomas P. Costello)\n\n\"The Zeppelin Co. had an excellent safety record,\" Jablonski said. \"In 1936, the Hindenburg had made 10 flights to Lakehurst successfully without any incidents.\"\n\nOn May 3, 1937, the Hindenburg was a little more than a year old when – about a quarter after 7 p.m. – the 242-ton floating ocean liner, with its Nazi swastika flags emblazoned to its tail, lifted off from Frankfurt with 97 souls aboard to the command of \"Up ship!\"\n\nA band performed the German national anthem as passengers waved from the windows of the observation lounge to a sea of onlookers and loved ones on the ground below.\n\nPassengers on the Hindenburg received assurance after another that the technology upon which their lives depended was safe, sound and predictable.\n\n\"To all our passengers, the safety, comfort, freedom from sickness, and tranquility in motion are a revelation, and these features no doubt are the reason for the increasing popularity of travel by Airship. The one regret expressed by our passengers – with which we are familiar – is that the voyage is over so soon.\"\n\n— \"Airship Voyages Made Easy,\" a passenger manual printed by the Deutche Zeppelin-Reedere airline for its airship passengers on the Hindenburg.\n\nPassenger life aboard the Hindenburg was mostly spent gazing out at the landscape or seascape, looking for icebergs to awe over and steamships to wave at. A few people brought their home movie cameras.\n\nThere was a writing room — a quiet area where passengers could pen letters or postcards to loved ones and friends. Mail could be posted aboard with a Hindenburg postmark. Additionally, the radio room in the aft compartment of the control car beneath the ship could send a telegram to anyone in the world.\n\nTours could be arranged by crew members to show passengers the parts of the Zeppelin that were otherwise off limits to all but authorized personnel, such as the bowels of the rigid airship, which unlike an ocean liner were located above the passenger decks, not below.\n\nLewis P. Lochner, an Associated Press reporter who flew on Hindenburg's first voyage to Lakehurst, one year earlier, described the experience to readers in 1936:\n\n\"It was hard sometimes to realize during the trip that one was not on an ocean liner but instead high in the air,\" Lochner wrote. \"The spacious social hall, dining hall, writing saloon, and even the diminutive bar and smoking room – all conveyed the illusion of a seafaring craft. This illusion was heightened by the fact that the passenger space was distributed over two decks, an upper and a lower.\"\n\nBreakfast was served from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and was typically light fare; mostly rolls, hard-boiled and soft-boiled eggs, sausage and ham, with coffee, tea and milk. Dinner was served mid-day and full-course meals — from Rhine salmon and brook trout, roast gosling and venison — were prepared and cooked on board.\n\nA bar was well-stocked and the Hindenburg even boasted its own inventory of fine wines and champagne, which could be delivered to individual compartments at the press of a button.\n\nThe cabins, however, were not exactly luxurious. They were narrow and windowless, with bunk beds. There were folding wash basins in each compartment with running hot and cold water, and a small closet. Lavatories and showers were communal.\n\nSlanted windows ran along promenades in the dining room and observation lounge, which were located on opposite sides of the upper deck, which was \"A Deck.\"\n\n\"What a magnificent view!\" Lochner wrote. \"At times, these clouds looked like an endless stretch of glaciers, then again like fluffybales of wool spread out as far as the eye could see.\"\n\nAfter leaving Frankfurt airport, the Hindenburg's flight path had taken it over the Netherlands and the English Channel, before sailing west-southwest after 1 a.m. on May 4 over the North Atlantic at a cruising speed of 76 mph and at an altitude of 650 feet.\n\nAt that height, passengers could wave to the passengers on the ocean liners below them. Their ships steamed at less than half the Zeppelin's speed.\n\nHindenburg could get from Frankfurt to Lakehurst in about two and half days, whereas the R.M.S. Queen Mary took about four days to cross the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nOn this trip, however, the Hindenburg was encountering strong headwinds at sea that had reduced its velocity to 37 mph. Its four Daimler-Benz engines were fighting the jet stream, but none of the passengers aboard Hindenburg would have noticed – there was no turbulence on the Zeppelin.\n\nPassengers heard only \"the distant quiet murmur\" of the engines, according to the passenger manual.\n\nThe only time there would have been any shudder is if the airship hit a squall line, which happened on occasion over the sea. Although the weather-forecasting of the period obviously lacked the satellite technology of the late 20th century, oceans were far more crowded with merchant marine traffic back then than they are today, Grossman said.\n\nA network of ships reported in observations at various locations, keeping the Zeppelin Co. apprised of any meteorological issues that might be problematic for Hindenburg and its sister ship, the Graf Zeppelin, he said.\n\nHindenburg's outer hull fabric had been designed to absorb rainwater, which would be conveyed into the ship's ballast tanks.\n\n\"The Hindenburg had frequently been struck by lightning, it even burned chunks of fabric,\" Grossman said. \"They were very strict that you never valved or released hydrogen in a thunderstorm. … So long as the hydrogen is in its gas cells, it is contained.\"\n\nLightning posed the greatest danger to hydrogen-filled airships when in physical contact with the ground. Zeppelin flight manuals were emphatic about this point: its airships should not attempt landings in the presence of thunderstorms, Grossman said.\n\nThe admonition would echo for the next 80 years.\n\n\"Hindenburg Is 12 Hours Late; Fighting Winds. Dirigible Won't Land At Lakehurst Until 6 P.M. – Starts Return Trip At Once. Zeppelin To Make Profit This Year.\"\n\n— Asbury Park Press front page headline; May 6, 1937\n\nThe Hindenburg had been scheduled to arrive at Naval Air Station Lakehurst at about 6 a.m. on May 6. Strong headwinds over the Atlantic had reduced its velocity by half.\n\n\"The Hindenburg was over Nova Scotia when it was supposed to be landing at Lakehurst,\" Grossman said.\n\nMoreover, conditions in New Jersey were not helping.\n\nThunderstorms were expected over the Pine Barrens later in the day, just as Hindenburg would be arriving. There had been four major forest fires that emergency crews in Ocean County had been battling all week that had for a brief time seemed to threaten the naval air station itself.\n\nAt the Biltmore Hotel in New York, there was a full complement of passengers waiting to be bused to Newark Airport where they would be ushered onto an American Airlines Douglas DC-3 for the 15-minute flight to the Navy base. The DC-3 would leave Newark when the crew of the Hindenburg was ready to receive the new passengers.\n\nThere was an exceedingly tight timeline.\n\nSome of the German-bound passengers had plans to attend the coronation of Great Britain's King George VI on May 12 in London.\n\nCapt. Max Pruss planned to have his ship ready for the return trip to Frankfurt by midnight in what would be the fastest turnaround for a passenger Zeppelin.\n\nIn 1936, the Hindenburg had made a total of 34 trips across the Atlantic Ocean and the Graf Zeppelin had made a total of 590 flights since its maiden voyage in 1928, logging more than a million miles and carrying a total of 34,000 passengers without a single injury, Grossman said.\n\nAlthough Pruss was in command of Hindenburg on this trip, Capt. Ernst A. Lehmann was the senior officer aboard and had been criticized in the past by his own bosses for cutting corners when it came to safety protocols.\n\n\"Captain Lehmann crashed the tail (of the Hindenburg) in March 1936,\" Grossman said. \"He was a risky, ham-handed pilot who was over-accommodating to the Nazis and allowed those concerns to outweigh his sense of caution.\"\n\nBy noon May 6, the Hindenburg was over Boston. By 3:10 p.m., the Zeppelin was over Manhattan, where it circled the Empire State Building.\n\nOver Brooklyn, the Hindenburg cast its long shadow over a game at Ebbets Field between the Dodgers and the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was briefly halted so the players and fans could look up and watch the airship sail over the stadium.\n\nFrom New York, the Hindenburg flew south over the Raritan Bay, passing what is now Aberdeen by 3:30 p.m., over Freehold at 3:45 p.m., and Lakehurst at 4:20 p.m.\n\nAnimated GIF - Find & Share on GIPHY\n\nThe station's weather logs showed that a thunderstorm had started 3:43 p.m. and ended at 4:45 p.m.\n\nAt that time, Pruss, who was in the control car, could see flashes of lightning on the horizon over the Pinelands. He sent a message to the station that he would cruise for two hours and return at about 6 p.m.\n\nTurning east, the Zeppelin flew over the Toms River and Seaside Heights, and then north over the coastline. At 5 p.m., the Hindenburg was over Asbury Park.\n\nLibby Magness Weisberg, 89, Cherry Hill, lived in South Philadelphia as a child and remembered when the Hindenburg appeared over her neighborhood on a cloudless day. At some point or another between 1936 and 1937, the Hindenburg had cruised over every region of the Tri-State area.\n\n\"I was 9-years-old and I remember it as if it happened yesterday,\" Weisberg said. \"I happened to be in the house and was called outside to look up in the sky. … It was very, very low and we could almost see inside. We were able to see how beautiful it was, absolutely gorgeous against the blue sky.\"\n\nThen the Hindenburg turned at such an angle so that its swastikas came into full view, which filled Weisberg with a sense of dread.\n\n\"I lived in a mixed neighborhood – there was a lot of Italian and Jewish – and when we saw these great big swastikas on the tail of the Hindenburg, it was a sort of a contradictory thing,\" she said. \"How could something so beautiful be so ugly?\"\n\nWeisberg recalled that some of her Italian neighbors made an insult — the sign of the horns - as they gazed up at the airship's tail, while her fellow Jewish neighbors made what she called \"a hex\" at the Hindenburg.\n\n\"We knew the Germans were our enemies, we knew about Hitler's politics, but we were not aware of the death camps at that point,\" she said.\n\nOver Asbury Park, the Hindenburg made a 360-degree turn. In Press Plaza, an Asbury Park Press photographer rushed outside of the newspaper's office to take photos of the Zeppelin as it adjusted course on a southerly heading over Cookman Avenue.\n\nSupervising flight operations in the control car or gondola, Pruss ordered the Hindenburg back down the Jersey Shore coastline – to near the southern end of Long Beach Island.\n\nJust before 6 p.m., Hindenburg was soaring above Beach Haven where it made a starboard turn over Barnegat Bay and into the sky above Tuckerton. The ship then made another starboard turn, essentially following Route 9 north to the Forked River section of Lacey by 6:55 p.m.\n\nFrom there, Pruss turned the Hindenburg northwest toward the outline of Naval Lakehurst Station's Hangar One, an unmistakable landmark from the air over the Pine Barrens of Ocean County.\n\nHindenburg was 20 minutes out. Its gauges in the control car below the massive gray vessel would have indicated there was a problem. Hydrogen was leaking, Grossman said.\n\n\"They should not have landed,\" Grossman said. \"You do have to valve (release) hydrogen to land, and when you release hydrogen it mixes with the air.\"\n\nThe flight operations manual did not permit landings during thunderstorms, he said.\n\n\"Most likely, but not necessarily, it could have been a stuck valve,\" Grossman said. \"Most likely, one of the cells was breached in some way.\"\n\nYet, there was pressure to get Hindenburg on the ground, get the current passengers to their next destination, and board the new passengers as quickly as possible.\n\n\"There were political pressures and financial pressures,\" Grossman said. \"They were worried about the return flight.\"\n\nPruss performed a slow approach and circled the landing site at Lakehurst, reducing and reversing the engines, Grossman said.\n\nThe airship was heavy in the tail and when it was not correcting through normal procedures, six crewmen were ordered to the bow, or front, of the ship to add their weight.\n\nAs the Hindenburg approached the mooring mast some distance from the front of Hangar One, the forward landing line was dropped and the water ballast was released.\n\nIt was about 7:25 p.m. and it was the moment that all hell broke loose.\n\nJohn Syarto, 84, Jackson, was just 4 years old and living in Linden when his parents took him to Lakehurst in the family car to see the Hindenburg arrive that night.\n\nA guard at the main gate would not let the family get too close, but suggested an unobstructed view from a wooden fence a few hundred feet away from the landing site.\n\n\"The ship comes in parallel to us and I said to my father, 'what are those strings coming down from the ship?' And he said, 'that's how they're going to pull it down.' … Then there was the fire and the same guy who told us where to stand ran over to us and told us to leave because he didn't know how bad the fire was going to get and of course we got into the car and left.\"\n\nSyarto paused, his voice cracking with emotion.\n\n\"No one said anything on the way home,\" he said. \"I think my parents were praying for the people on the Hindenburg.\"\n\nWhat seemed to be instantaneous was the creation of a spark and then a fireball near the tail that within seconds would reach all 7 million cubic feet of hydrogen. It turned the giant Zeppelin into a raging inferno.\n\nThe ship lurched forward, its tail pitching skyward and going near vertical before structural failure occurred and the Hindenburg began to break into multiple sections. The control car slammed into the earth and anything that was not secure, including people, were tossed about the interior of the ship.\n\nWerner Franz, the 14-year-old cabin boy, was securing dishes and silverware in the crew mess when the nose began to tilt upwards and fire appeared over him. A water tank above him burst, dousing him so that it jolted him out of a shock.\n\nFranz kicked open a service hatch that was used to load materials into the mess and managed to escape the burning wreckage unscathed, running as fast as he could.\n\nIn half a minute, the disintegration of the Hindenburg would be complete. The charred remains of its warped duralumin girders would be all that would remain in the days ahead.\n\n\"We felt a shock through the ship and we assumed it was a landing cable that had parted,\" German Zettel, the chief mechanic, told the Asbury Park Press in an interview for the 50th anniversary of the disaster in 1987.\n\n\"Then we looked forward and found out that was not the case. When we looked the other way, to the rear, to the stern of the ship, we saw that the stern was already burning. We were ordered to stop engines which we did at once, and in the meantime, in very short order, our motor gondola hit the ground, enabling us to jump out and run. All this only took seconds,\" Zettel said.\n\n\"As the large gas cells caught fire, it created a wind storm, sucking the air to the gas cells, without which, of course, the hydrogen could not burn. In a very short time, rescue personnel appeared on the scene with doctors and ambulances. The lift gas was rapidly consumed but the diesel fuel continued to burn fiercely. It was only about 30 seconds for the hydrogen to burn off but the engine operating fuel continued to burn for quite a long time,\" he said.\n\nMost experts believe that the cause of the tragedy was innocent enough: a rope line from Hindenburg reached the field, soaked from rainstorms earlier in the day, and grounded the airship; it produced a static electrical discharge that raced up the line and made contact with the leaking hydrogen.\n\nAlthough it may be an issue of semantics, the ship did not explode, there was no shockwave. The hydrogen simply ignited, like a candle being lit.\n\n\"A small flame became a big flame, went through the 16 cells and 7 million cubic feet of hydrogen and in 34 seconds it was on the ground,\" Jablonski said.\n\nLike most of the other passengers, young Walter and Werner Doehner jumped to safety from the portside promenade windows with the help of their mother, Matilde Doehner. She then followed her sons over. But when it was daughter Irene's turn to jump, either in panic or shock, she fled into the interior of the burning ship to ostensibly go look for her father. Hermann Doehner, the pharmaceutical magnate, was in the family's compartment when the disaster struck and would have been unable to escape in time.\n\nMatilde and sons Walter and Werner survived, but Irene died that night from burns while being treated at an area hospital. Hermann's body was recovered from the wreckage.\n\nPassenger Joseph Späh used his acrobatic skills to leap from one of the windows in the observation lounge, breaking his ankle in the process. Ulla, his German shepherd, was in the cargo hold of the ship and perished in the disaster.\n\nClick for a full-screen i nteractive 360-degree photosphere of the Hindenburg crash site and memorial. (360-degree image by Thomas P. Costello)\n\nIn 1967, for the 30th anniversary of the disaster, the Asbury Park Press interviewed three civilian ground crewmen who shared their recollections from that night.\n\n\"The sight of people burning inside (Hindenburg), … you could see them, but you couldn't get at them,\" said James Thomas of Lakehurst who was still employed at the base as an electrician. \"You could hear them screaming.\"\n\n\"We were right under the ship,\" said Frank Wilsey of Toms River, who also still worked at the base as an electrician. \"I'd say it was about 100 feet off the ground. You would never forget it.\"\n\nWilliam A. Wiseman of Ocean Township, who went onto to become a real estate agent, said he did not dwell on the disaster, but he remembered that he believed he was about as close to death as one could be.\n\n\"It was perhaps, the most frightening experience I've ever been through; when I looked up, I thought, well, this is the end, I just won't make it,\" Wiseman said.\n\nWhen it was over, 36 people were dead, including Allen Hagaman, a 51-year-old ground crew member, who was underneath Hindenburg at the time of the crash. He was from Lakehurst.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt had been vacationing on the Gulf of Mexico in Texas when he was briefed about what had happened in Lakehurst.\n\nRoosevelt immediately sent a telegram to Hitler who was at Berchtesgaden, his mountaintop retreat in the Bavarian Alps, with an expression of sympathy.\n\n\"I thank your excellency sincerely for the words of sympathy you express to me and the German people on the occasion of the disaster of which the airship Hindenburg was the victim,\" Hitler replied.\n\nAlthough static electricity was immediately reported in newspapers as the likely cause of the disaster, sabotage as a credible theory gained traction when Hugo Eckener, the airship pioneer and principal figure in the Zeppelin Company, raised the suggestion to reporters.\n\n\"I cannot grasp that flames have turned 'our pride' into a smashed skeleton,\" Eckener said. \"It might have been sabotage.\"\n\nRealizing the weight his words would carry, Eckener offered an addendum to his remarks.\n\n\"Mind, I did not say sabotage was responsible but that it must be considered as a possibility, especially in view of many threatening letters received by our firm,\" he said.\n\nNavy Vice Admiral Charles E. Rosendahl, who commanded Navy Air Station Lakehurst at the time of the disaster, went to his grave in 1977 absolutely convinced that the Hindenburg had been brought down by sabotage.\n\nRosendahl claimed he had evidence that snipers on the base fired rounds into the airship as it was making its landing. He was planning to write a book about it when he died at the age of 85.\n\nThe notion of sabotage would become the plot of the 1976 film, \"The Hindenburg,\" starring George C. Scott and Anne Bancroft, which is set on the Hindenburg during its final, three-day trip to Lakehurst. After the movie was filmed, Universal Studios donated one of the life-sized control car replicas it built for the movie to the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society and is a permanent exhibit at its museum in Hangar No. 1, where the Hindenburg was once berthed.\n\nInteractive photosphere inside Hangar One at the Lakehurst base. (360-degree image by Thomas P. Costello)\n\nThe sabotage theory did not gain wide acceptance.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce – empowered to conduct a formal inquiry into the fire and crash – concluded in August 1937 that the cause of the accident was the ignition of a mixture of free hydrogen and air, probably as the result of a brush discharge.\n\nGrossman said regardless of the what caused the leak that led to the massive conflagration, the captain bears responsibility for losing the ship.\n\n\"Fatal mistake,\" he said. \"They landed an airship in a thunderstorm.\"\n\nDesign and development by Felecia Wellington Radel", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/23/mariachi-mass-water-cutbacks-maine-bicentennial-news-around-states/118462240/", "title": "Mariachi Mass, water cutbacks: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey is urging college football fans to get vaccinated before heading to stadiums this season. The first games kick off in a few weeks, raising concerns that crowded stadiums could help spread COVID-19. Asked about those concerns last week, the Republican governor said the remedy is for more people to get inoculated. “If everybody would just get the vaccine, we wouldn’t have a problem. Simply get the shot, then go enjoy your football game,” Ivey said after participating in an event with college mascots on the steps of the state Capitol. Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama’s state health officer, said the state Department of Public Health has issued guidance on sporting events including recommending spacing and emphasizing the importance of vaccinations. “Outdoor events are safer in general than indoor events, but having hundreds of thousands of people getting together during a pandemic is going to result in some disease transmission,” Harris said. “We hope people are vaccinated enough that that can be minimized.” Alabama coach Nick Saban has also been an outspoken advocate for getting vaccinated and participated in a public service announcement over the summer encouraging Alabamians to get the shots. The state has one of the nation’s lowest rates of fully vaccinated residents.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The city could see nearly a half-million cruise ship visitors next year after a new docking agreement was announced with Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. The deal between the cruise line and Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal came last week as one of the world’s largest cruise ships arrived, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. “It ensures they have a place to bring their ships and additional ships to Sitka for the future,” said Chris McGraw, manager of Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal. Halibut Point Marine, owned by McGraw’s family, is majority owner of the cruise terminal. The Royal Caribbean ship Ovation of the Seas, which is 1,138 feet long – or nearly the length of four football fields placed end-to-end – arrived Tuesday. Officials said the visit got off to a great Alaska start, with a bear walking along the dock as the ship pulled in. The ship’s arrival marked the formal completion of a cruise terminal dock expansion that McGraw called “phase one” of plans intended to position Sitka as a premier port in Alaska. The Ovation of the Seas, which can hold up to 4,900 guests, brought about 1,500 passengers to Sitka. There were fewer travelers aboard because of COVID-19 mitigation measures.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: After more than a year of silence due to the pandemic, mariachis are back playing Sunday services at Tucson’s St. Augustine Cathedral, where the colorful and sonorous tradition dates back a half-century and fuses Roman Catholicism with Mexican American pride. For the hundreds of worshippers gathered in this Spanish colonial church and other congregations across the Southwest, the unique sound of mariachi liturgy evokes a borderlands identity where spirituality and folk music have blended for centuries. “Syncretism is the reality of this land, the ‘ambos’ reality,” said the Rev. Alan Valencia, the cathedral’s rector, who grew up attending mariachi Mass in “ambos Nogales,” or “both Nogales,” as locals refer to the two cities of the same name straddling the U.S.-Mexican border about 60 miles to the south. “And that’s what we see in these mariachi Masses,” he said. “Faith and culture come together and grow.” The first canon of mariachi Mass was composed in Cuernavaca, Mexico, after the Vatican encouraged the incorporation of regional musical traditions into services in the 1960s. Called the Misa Panamericana, or Pan-American Mass, it features a specific order of instrumental arrangements, sung prayers and hymns, according to Dan Sheehy, director and curator of the Smithsonian Folkways Recordings.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state reported 33 new COVID-19 deaths and more than 2,400 new coronavirus cases Friday as Arkansas reached a new high for virus patients on ventilators. The Department of Health said the state’s COVID-19 deaths since the pandemic began rose to 6,614, while coronavirus cases increased by 2,407 to 431,507 total. The number of COVID-19 patients in the state’s hospitals dropped by 13 to 1,397, but only 19 intensive care unit beds were available across the entire state, the department said. There were 343 COVID-19 patients on ventilators, a new high for the state, while 533 were in ICUs. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins University research data. The state’s cases and hospitalizations have surged in recent weeks due to the ultra-contagious delta variant and the state’s low vaccination rate. Only about 39% of the state’s population is fully vaccinated against the disease. The state on Thursday reported 9,143 additional doses of COVID-19 vaccines were given. “We must continue to work to increase vaccinations,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted. “Our children under 12 cannot get the vaccine and need our help to stay healthy.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Golden City became the first major city in the nation to require proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 on Friday for people dining inside restaurants, working out in gyms or attending indoor concerts. Restaurants and bars posted signs and added extra staff to begin verifying people’s proof of vaccination before allowing them in. “There’s definitely some anxiety around how it’s all going to work,” said Pete Sittnick, a managing partner of Waterbar and EPIC Steak restaurants on the city’s waterfront. He anticipates a slowdown in checking in diners, possible pushback from guests who disagree with the requirement and awkward scenarios where someone shows up without proper documentation. “The good thing is, if somebody doesn’t have their verification of vaccination, they can still eat outside,” he said. Mayor London Breed announced the requirement more than a week ago in an attempt to stem rising COVID-19 cases, saying she was worried the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus could disrupt the city’s economic rebound. The mandate goes further than New York City, which requires people to be at least partially inoculated for a variety of high-risk indoor activities, and New Orleans, which requires proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test for indoor dining or drinking.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper announced Thursday that he has a “breakthrough” case of COVID-19. The first-term Democrat issued a statement saying he tested positive for the coronavirus after experiencing mild symptoms and was self-isolating at the direction of Congress’ attending physician, Dr. Brian P. Monahan. Hickenlooper said he was “feeling much better.” “I’m grateful for the vaccine (and the scientists behind it) for limiting my symptoms and allowing us to continue our work for Colorado,” Hickenlooper said. “If you haven’t been vaccinated, don’t wait for the virus – get the shot today, and a booster when it’s available too!” Infections and illnesses can happen even after being vaccinated. Experts say inoculation could help make any illnesses less severe. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that newer variants of the coronavirus could be a factor in “breakthrough” cases. Hickenlooper, 69, is a former brewpub entrepreneur, Denver mayor and two-term governor who defeated incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner in the 2020 election.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A year after receiving a huge influx of federal aid for the mailing of absentee ballot applications, town clerks across the state are facing the prospect of not having enough money to do the same for Nov. 2 local elections. They told the Connecticut Post local budgets were set months ago, and there may not be additional money for printing, postage and office workers. Absentee ballots are supposed to be ready for the public by Oct. 1. “With cities and towns finalizing their annual budgets in the spring, town clerks do not have the necessary funds built into their current budget to cover the costs of postage and staff to process the possible increase in applications,” Kate Wall, president of the Connecticut Town Clerks Association, told the newspaper. The secretary of state’s office said a provision in the state budget allows people to continue to cite pandemic-related concerns to request using voting by mail or drop-off ballots this year. The $15 million in federal support for state elections last year, which also included cybersecurity measures, was a one-time event and is not available this year, the Post reports. A spokesperson for Secretary of the State Denise Merrill blamed the lack of funding this year on Republicans in the Legislature who oppose mail-in balloting.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Current and former students of the University of Delaware can pursue claims that the school breached contractual obligations and unjustly enriched itself by halting in-person classes and shutting down the campus last spring because of the coronavirus pandemic, a federal judge ruled Friday. Judge Stephanos Bibas said the students have plausibly alleged that the school promised them in-person classes, activities and services. “True, the school never promised them expressly. But promises need not be express to be enforceable,” Bibas wrote. “By its statements and history of offering classes in person, the school may have implied a promise to stay in person.” Bibas also said that, even if the university was justified in breaking any such promise because of COVID-19, it should not be unjustly enriched in doing so and may have to return the money it saved, if any, when it went online. The judge rejected the university’s arguments that it expressly reserved the right to go online and that the case involves claims of “educational malpractice,” which many states prohibit. Bibas also rejected the university’s argument that parents who paid their children’s tuition and fees do not have standing in the lawsuit because they had no duty to shoulder those costs and were not personally deprived of campus services or in-person classes.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In a flash notice sent to all officers and members of the agency Thursday, the Metropolitan Police Department activated the entire force and postponed vacation days in anticipation of a Sept. 18 protest organized by supporters of Jan. 6 insurrection defendants, WUSA-TV reports. The rally, known as “Justice for J6,” is planned for the Union Square area of the Capitol grounds, the section of the west front encompassing the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial and Capitol reflecting pool. Matt Braynard, the head of data for the 2016 Trump campaign, announced the September gathering on Steve Bannon’s podcast, issuing a clarion call for his followers to seek justice for those charged in the riots two weeks before the inauguration of President Joe Biden. “As we continue to raise the profile of these individuals, it makes it harder and harder for the left’s phony narrative about an insurrection to stick,” Braynard said on Bannon’s podcast released July 30. “What’s going to define (the rally) is where it’s going to take place: We’re going back to the Capitol.” In a YouTube video, Braynard specifically asked rally attendees not to bring signs relitigating the 2020 election, including visible markers of support for specific political candidates.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The mayor asked residents Friday to stop watering their lawns and washing their cars immediately, saying water usage needed to be cut back because of the recent surge of COVID-19 hospitalizations. The Orlando Utility Commission treats the city’s water with liquid oxygen, and supplies that ordinarily go toward water treatment have been diverted to hospitals for patients suffering from the coronavirus, Mayor Buddy Dyer said. “We acknowledge that the No. 1 priority for the liquid oxygen should be for hospitals,” Dyer said at a news conference. Since the 1990s, the utility has used liquid oxygen to remove the slight discoloration and rotten-egg smell that is found naturally in Florida’s water supply. The city-owned utility typically goes through 10 trucks of liquid oxygen a week, but its supplier recently said it would be cut back to five to seven trucks a week to accommodate hospitals, said Linda Ferrone, OUC’s chief customer and marketing officer. About 40% of the utility commission’s potable water is used for irrigation, so any strains on the water supply will be greatly reduced if residents stop watering their lawns, washing their cars or using pressure washers, she said. On its website, the utility said residents should prepare to follow the conservation measures for at least two weeks.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The mayors of some of the state’s largest cities on Friday slammed Gov. Brian Kemp’s new order that aims to limit local efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic. In an open letter, the mayors of Atlanta, Savannah, Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County suggested the Republican governor was putting politics above public health, and they defended mask requirements. “While Governor Kemp may find it politically necessary to hew to the course of others who live in the shadow of the former president, we are more concerned with the health and livelihood of friends we see in the grocery store, at the schools where we bring our children each morning, and who we encounter as we head into work,” the four mayors – all Democrats – wrote in the letter. “They overwhelmingly articulate support for the smart, tested public health measures that we have promoted for the past eighteen months.” An email to the governor’s office was not immediately returned. Amid a new surge of coronavirus cases that is straining hospitals, Kemp signed an executive order Thursday that says cities cannot require businesses and sports teams to enforce local pandemic restrictions. The governor presented the move as a way to protect businesses, saying some people in the state wanted to return to “lockdown mode” and close businesses.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state’s surging COVID-19 cases have overwhelmed its contact tracing efforts. Hawaii News Now reports the Department of Health recently expanded its contact tracing team to 313 people from 269 but still struggles to keep up with the hundreds of people newly infected each day with the coronavirus. In the middle of July, department data showed contact tracers were able to reach about 90% of people who were infected. The latest data for the first week of August showed they were only able to reach 62%. “One thing we’re seeing is there are a lot more people not picking up the phone,” said Dr. Sarah Kemble, the Hawaii state epidemiologist. “That aside, we are seeing a record number of case counts in the state. Of course, that is a challenge to try to reach everyone.” A West Oahu hospital filled up Friday as the community faces a surge of COVID-19 cases. Jason Chang, CEO of The Queen’s Health Systems, said the Ewa Beach hospital has sent some patients to its sibling facility in downtown Honolulu. It has also asked staff from other parts of the Queen’s system to come help. The city has set up a triage tent outside the hospital with 25 cots. Chang said the hospital had 63 patients in its emergency room at one time, which is a crisis given the hospital only has 24 ER beds.\n\nIdaho\n\nNampa: Gov. Brad Little is directing $30 million to expand coronavirus testing in K-12 schools. The money is coming from emergency funds set aside by the Legislature to deal with unforeseen events, Little said. “It’s critical now,” the Republican governor said this month. “These school districts have got to have some resources.” House Republicans earlier this year killed a bill to use $40 million in federal coronavirus relief funds for voluntary testing in public and private schools. Little urged residents who haven’t been vaccinated to get their COVID-19 shots to help avoid disruptions at schools and the potential to overrun hospitals with coronavirus patients. He also said workers getting sick and schools shutting down because of coronavirus outbreaks and parents forced to stay home to care for kids and miss work could slow the state’s economic rebound. “Our workforce cannot afford to stay home because schools and day cares shut down due to outbreaks,” he said. “This threatens Idaho’s phenomenal economic success.” The Gem State has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation, with just over half of people ages 12 and up fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Masks will be required indoors throughout Cook County beginning Monday, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. The Cook County Department of Public Health issued the order Friday, saying it’s needed as new coronavirus cases continue to increase due to the more contagious delta variant. “We are in a dangerous period, with the delta variant surging, during which we must return to previous remediation measures,” said Dr. Rachel Rubin, co-lead and senior medical officer of Cook County Department of Public Health. “We have no choice but to mandate that people wear masks indoors to help contain this spread of the virus.” Illinois reported 4,904 new confirmed and probable coronavirus cases Friday. That pushed the state’s seven-day average of new cases above the peak of a COVID-19 surge this spring. The health department order applies to all multi-unit residential buildings and public places such as restaurants, stores, fitness clubs and public transportation in suburban Cook County. Chicago reinstated its indoor mask mandate effective Friday, and Gov. J.B. Pritzker has already said masks are required in all schools. The mandate applies to anyone over age 2. Businesses also are required to post signs saying masks are required.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Health officials have counted about 62,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines being tossed out in recent months across the state as the number of people seeking the shots has fallen drastically. That is about 1% of the some 6 million shots that have been given in Indiana since they first became available in December, but it’s a sign of the struggle that officials face in raising the vaccination rate. The state health department said doses can go unused by reaching their expiration date or a vial breaking, and officials knew eventually vaccine supply would outstrip demand. “We are taking every action possible to minimize wastage, including urging providers to use doses with the nearest expiration dates first and encouraging Hoosiers to get vaccinated if they are eligible,” the agency said in a statement. “In addition, we have been working with healthcare providers to allow them to order small batches of vaccine to have in their offices for patients and have increased the number of mobile vaccination clinics we are deploying across the state.” About 45% of Indiana residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, the 16th-lowest rate among the states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The city’s new mask mandate would impose the requirement on the University of Iowa’s campus, but the school will continue to strongly encourage but not require masks per guidance handed down from its own governing body, the state’s Board of Regents. Iowa City’s mandate announced Thursday evening goes against state law, said a spokesperson for Gov. Kim Reynolds, calling it “not enforceable.” May 2 guidance from the state’s Board of Regents says face masks are not required at the University of Iowa, Iowa State University or the University of Northern Iowa. Legally speaking, the regents could choose to make them required. The Board of Regents, as well as University of Iowa leadership, have not changed course on COVID-19 protocols ahead of the school year despite pressure from students and faculty to make them stronger, including mask and vaccine requirements or stronger incentivization. This month faculty and students sent a petition to the state’s board of Regents, and three faculty senate leaders sent a letter directly to President Barbara Wilson. Iowa City Mayor Bruce Teague declared a civil emergency and ordered a mask mandate late Thursday night. It applies to everyone within the limits of Iowa City when in public spaces where maintaining 6 feet of distance is not possible.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: Gov. Laura Kelly on Friday called for school districts to require masks and said she was contemplating an emergency declaration as hospitals buckle under the strain of increasingly young COVID-19 patients and as hundreds of students and staff become infected. “We really want people to understand that this is no fooling around,” Kelly lamented while speaking at Saint Luke’s South Hospital in Overland Park, which is brimming with patients. “This is an emergency.” The latest health department data shows 154 school clusters, with 1,889 cases. Kansas City, Kansas, Public Schools reported that 82 students and staff were infected in just the first nine days of the academic year, with 220 quarantined. The Turner school district began requiring masks after more than two dozen students were infected. The Wichita district, which is the state’s largest and isn’t requiring masks, has had “a few” COVID-19 cases since classes started last week, said spokeswoman Susan Arensman. She said the district won’t provide weekly updates on cases until next month. The school board for Perry-Lecompton public schools, where 16 students are quarantining, imposed a mask mandate Thursday night. “These are students that are not in school right now and cannot learn because of COVID,” Superintendent J.B. Elliott said.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Top Republican lawmakers are promising to work with Gov. Andy Beshear to fight COVID-19 after a court ruling cleared the way for new limits on the Democratic governor’s emergency powers. Beshear’s allies said they’ll be watching to see if his critics follow through. Kentucky Republicans cheered the state Supreme Court ruling Saturday that ordered a lower court to dissolve an injunction that for months had blocked the GOP-backed laws. It comes as the highly contagious delta variant drives up coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the state. The court’s decision “signals it is time for the Republican leadership to publicly put forth their plan to protect the commonwealth from this pandemic and the deadly delta variant,” said Rep. Joni Jenkins and Sen. Morgan McGarvey, the top Democrats in the Kentucky House and Senate. “We know what they don’t support; show us your plan.” The top legislative Republicans – House Speaker David Osborne and Senate President Robert Stivers – said lawmakers are “ready to work with the governor, as we have for nearly a year and a half, and address what is a very real public health crisis.” The GOP holds supermajorities in both chambers, and Republicans accused Beshear of taking a go-it-alone approach in dealing with the pandemic.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Stressed with too little staff and too many patients in an unrelenting COVID-19 resurgence, some hospitals are pressing insurance companies to ease up on requirements that can slow the transfer of recuperating patients to other facilities. At issue are “Medicare Advantage” plans that supplement government-funded Medicare coverage. These insurance policies require extensive reviews and sometimes consultations with other doctors before transfers to inpatient facilities providing skilled nursing care, rehabilitation or long-term care. Some of these patients are clearly ready to be moved to a non-hospital setting, but the bureaucracy has them stuck in badly needed beds, said Dr. Leslie Dean, of the Willis-Knighton system in northwest Louisiana. “It’s almost impossible for them to move these people along in a timely manner right now because of these delays with some of these insurance plans, unfortunately,” she said. The delays are critical as COVID-19 numbers grow, but the issue doesn’t just involve coronavirus patients. The paperwork also can slow transfers of Medicare Advantage-covered patients recuperating from a stroke, a heart attack, or some other illness or injury that will need post-hospital attention. Statewide hospitalizations have set records almost daily through most of August.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: The pandemic put the kibosh on most of the state’s bicentennial celebrations last year, but Maine proved Saturday that it’s never too late for an old-fashioned parade. Riding in a 3D-printed boat created at the University of Maine, Gov. Janet Mills served as grand marshal of the pandemic-delayed State of Maine Bicentennial Parade that snaked its way through the cities of Lewiston and Auburn. Mills said the state has persevered in the pandemic “with the grit and grace that have shaped our state for generations.” “The Bicentennial Parade is another opportunity to honor the resilience of Maine people, to remember our history and to recommit to creating a better and brighter future for us all,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. The parade was held against a backdrop of a surge in coronavirus infections caused by the delta variant and an ongoing debate over rules put in place by the Mills administration to protect residents. Protesters opposed to the governor’s vaccination mandate for health care workers gathered on a bridge between the cities before the parade started to make their point. Some exchanged words with the governor’s supporters. Later, dozens of protesters followed the boat in which the governor was riding and shouted at her. Mills ignored them and waved to the crowd.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan, a cancer survivor, said Sunday that he’s received a third shot of COVID-19 vaccine, and he’s urging the federal government to make booster shots available earlier than currently planned. Hogan appeared on CBS’ “Face the Nation” and said he received the additional dose this past week on the recommendation of his doctors. Asked if he wanted Marylanders to get the booster shot as soon as possible or wait the eight months that is currently recommended under federal guidelines, he said: “No, we can’t wait that long.” He said he’s pushing the federal government to speed up the time frame for providing booster shots, and he’s pushing for full FDA approval of the vaccines. He said many of those who have refused to get the shots have cited the fact that the available vaccines do not have full approval but are being administered under an emergency use authorization. Federal officials announced last week a plan to start administering booster shots to the general public beginning the week of Sept. 20. The recommendations call for people to wait eight months from their second dose, which they said was a judgment call about when vaccine protection against severe illness might fall. Some public health experts have said a booster shot administered too early won’t be as effective.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Masks will be required for all indoor public places starting this Friday as the city moves to contain rising coronavirus infections blamed on the highly contagious delta variant, acting Mayor Kim Janey said late last week. Janey’s office issued a statement saying the mandate will apply to everyone age 2 and older who enters a business, retail shop, club, government office or any other public venue. Janey said the mask mandate was being imposed ahead of the arrival of more than 50,000 college students from across the nation and a return to classes for more than 50,000 Boston Public School students. “There is nothing more important than Boston’s safe recovery, reopening, and renewal from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” she said. “We know that masks work best when everyone wears one. Requiring masks indoors is a proactive public health measure to limit transmission of the delta variant, boost the public confidence in our businesses and venues, and protect the residents of our city who are too young for vaccination.” On Thursday, Gov. Charlie Baker said tens of thousands of state workers will need to prove they’re fully inoculated against COVID-19 by October or risk losing their jobs. Massachusetts remains one of the most vaccinated states in the nation, with more than 64% of residents fully inoculated against COVID-19.\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: The Michigan Court of Appeals has granted a new hearing to a man who claimed his rights were violated when he was sentenced for a crime by video, a common practice during the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Christian participated and spoke during a hearing last fall in Oakland County court and had a lawyer present. But the appeals court still found problems. “At no point during the hearing did the trial court obtain a waiver of defendant’s right to be physically present in the courtroom for sentencing,” judges Jane Markey and Brock Swartzle said in a 2-1 opinion Thursday. Christian, 38, was convicted of uttering and publishing, a crime typically related to forging documents, and sentenced to a minimum of a year in prison. Judge Michael Riordan disagreed with the majority, saying Christian failed to show that the error “affected substantial rights.” “He has not shown or even argued, for example, that he would have received a lighter sentence if he was physically present,” Riordan said. Christian remains in prison for other unrelated crimes in Macomb County.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: St. Cloud State University and St. Cloud Technical & Community College, alongside all Minnesota state colleges and universities, will mandate COVID-19 vaccination or frequent coronavirus testing for certain student groups, according to a memo from Chancellor Devinder Malhotra. The memo, sent Wednesday to Minnesota State’s Leadership Council, said the system’s schools would require vaccination attestation for “specific student groups or populations that are in settings where there is close and frequent contact with others.” That includes students living in residence facilities run by the school system, those participating in intercollegiate athletics, and those required to by clinical or internship sites. Additionally, the memo said, colleges and universities could include other extracurriculars that pose difficulties for social distancing. As of Friday, the technical and community college hadn’t had conversations about student groups, though the school is limiting large group gatherings. Vice President of Administration Lori Kloos said extracurricular activities are being kept to a minimum but may continue in different ways, such as meeting outside or virtually.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: Two concert venues are now requiring guests to provide proof they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19 or show negative coronavirus test results. The Lyric and Proud Larry’s in Oxford announced last week that they would implement the requirements, The Oxford Eagle reports. Lyric general manager Lindsay Dillon-Maginnis said the regulations have been a trend nationwide for music festivals. “Promoters who have been in our line of work, we could see the storm coming,” Dillon-Maginnis told the paper. Not every venue in Mississippi is following suit. Entertainer Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit announced Friday that they would pull out of a show at the Brandon Amphitheater scheduled for October. Isbell said the venue would not require that attendees show proof of vaccination or a negative test. “Unfortunately, the powers that be were not willing to comply with the band’s updated Health and Safety standards,” a statement from Southeastern Records said. Dillon-Maginnis said there has been “overwhelmingly large majority of support” for the policy, with less than 1% of ticket holders requesting a refund. “I think what people see online or what you see in comments is vitriolic or negative,” she said. “But with those people, if you dig deeper, have no connection to the Lyric or Oxford or even Mississippi.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: New COVID-19 hospital admissions are reaching winter surge levels in the city, and southeast Missouri hospitals are under strain due to a surge in coronavirus cases and a rise in deaths. On Thursday, hospitals in St. Louis reported admitting 100 new patients with COVID-19 – the most since Jan. 16, according to the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force. A total of 585 people were hospitalized, including 25 children, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Twelve of those children are younger than 12 and not yet eligible for vaccines. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized at Southeast Hospital and Saint Francis Medical Center in Cape Girardeau has increased by more than 50% in the past week and a half, according to data released Thursday by both facilities. Saint Francis, which reopened its COVID-19 care unit last week, reported 39 coronavirus inpatients as of early Thursday afternoon, up from 25 just 10 days ago. At Southeast Hospital, the number of COVID-19 inpatients increased from 22 about 10 days ago to 32 as of Thursday morning, the Southeast Missourian reports. Statewide, the death toll from the rapidly spreading delta variant continues to rise in Missouri, with July shaping up to be an even deadlier month than earlier reported.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: While many large companies across the U.S. have announced that COVID-19 vaccines will be required for their employees to return to work in person, Montana stands alone in banning such mandates. Under a new law passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this year, requiring vaccines as a condition for employment is deemed “discrimination” and a violation of the state’s human rights laws. Montana is the only state in the U.S. with a law like this for private employers, said Hemi Tewarson, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy. The law has raised concern among employers across the state as Montana struggles with a rise in COVID-19 cases that is once again straining the state’s health care system. Pushback swelled last week when physicians called on the Legislature to reverse the law. “This is against everything we’ve ever known or believed about public health,” said Dr. Pamela Cutler, president of the Montana Medical Association. “I believe it’s a travesty now, and it needs to be fixed so that we can make our offices safe for patients and our co-workers.” GOP lawmakers who supported the bill in the Legislature said it was needed in response to employers “coercing” employees to get vaccinations under threat of termination.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Nebraska Medical Center on Friday announced it’s reducing inpatient surgeries at the Omaha hospital because of the rise in COVID-19 cases. The change will take effect Aug. 30, Nebraska Medicine spokesman Taylor Wilson said in a news release. Wilson said inpatient surgeries likely will be limited through October. Nebraska Medicine is not limiting surgeries at Bellevue Medical Center or any other outpatient surgery clinics. Wilson said the rise in coronavirus patients, who need extra care and resources, strained Nebraska Medical Center. On top of that, he said, Nebraska is facing a nursing shortage. Nebraskans can help to ease the strain on hospitals by getting vaccinated against COVID-19, Wilson said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Half of all eligible residents are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, pushing the state closer to the national inoculation rate of about 60% for all people 12 and older, state health officials said. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said Friday that the 50% mark for residents 12 and up who are now fully vaccinated is an “incredible milestone to reach.” “We know there is more work to be done and we will remain focused on promoting vaccine opportunities throughout the state,” he said in a statement. Among those 12 and older, 60.5% have initiated vaccination, receiving at least one dose of vaccine, officials said. Nationally, 59.8% of that age group was fully vaccinated, and 70.4% had received the first of two shots as of Thursday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nevada’s 14-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases and positivity rate both declined through the week after a steady rise began in early June. At an emergency meeting Friday, the state Board of Health approved a vaccine mandate plan for Nevada’s public colleges and universities scheduled to take effect Nov. 1. The requirement will not affect enrollment until the spring semester.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House of Representatives will begin holding committee meetings on retained bills this week, without the option to participate remotely that existed during much of the coronavirus pandemic. In the calendar published Friday, House Speaker Sherman Packard reminded lawmakers that the emergency order allowing public bodies to meet remotely without a physical quorum present in the same location expired when the governor lifted the state of emergency June 11. That means House committees meeting to discuss bills that were set aside for more work must meet in person at the Legislative Office Building, which has reopened to the public. Packard said dozens of additional air purification units have been set up throughout the office building and Statehouse, and each meeting room will have air treatment that meets or exceeds federal health guidelines for office buildings. Masks will be encouraged but not required.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A group of parents wants Gov. Phil Murphy to remove the ban on virtual learning for the 2021-22 school year and provide a permanent remote learning option for K-12 schools. A change.org petition started by New Jersey Parents for Virtual Choice has garnered more than 17,000 signatures. The parents are driven by a variety of reasons, some related to health and safety concerns due to the coronavirus and the highly transmissible delta variant, said group spokesperson Karen Strauss. Some parents want to retain the virtual learning option from last year because their children excelled, she said. The petition asks Murphy to let K-12 schools continue to offer virtual learning for parents who want it and to create a permanent virtual learning option by approving free virtual-only public or charter schools. It also asks Murphy to meet with the group. “New Jersey needs to catch up,” Strauss said, referring to school systems in other states that offer virtual learning options. Strauss said she wants a virtual option for her 5-year-old son, who has asthma and high-functioning autism. She said he thrived during remote learning last year even though it took some getting used to, but her primary consideration is his health. “We already lost someone to COVID. I’m not risking him getting sick,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: About 150 people protested in front of the state Capitol on Friday, demanding an end to vaccine mandates for health care workers. Many protesters identified themselves as hospital workers – nurses, nursing assistants and clerical workers. Other attendees included correctional officers, retirees and children of health care workers. A state mandate requires nurses and other workers in high-risk environments to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and some hospitals have their own mandates. “I believe the vaccine is harmful,” said practical nurse Katrina Philpot, who was picketing along the road outside the Capitol complex with a sign that read: “Healthcare workers deserve rights.” Philpot said the hospital where she works in Rio Rancho is requiring her to be vaccinated by Aug. 27 or be fired. She fears she won’t qualify for medical or religious exemptions to the mandate. State employees, including prison guards, are required to get COVID-19 shots or submit to weekly testing. At least one prison guard has sued the state over the mandate. New Mexico has outpaced neighboring states when it comes to getting people vaccinated. About two-thirds of residents 18 and up have been fully inoculated, but state health officials have warned that evidence shows vaccinated people can still get infected and spread the virus.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s public schools will require COVID-19 shots for student-athletes and coaches participating in “high-risk” sports including football, volleyball, basketball, wrestling, lacrosse, rugby and bowling, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday. The students and coaches will have to get at least one dose of vaccine before the start of competitive play, de Blasio said on radio station WNYC. Bowling, while not a contact sport like football or wrestling, is on the list because it is indoors, de Blasio said. Masks will be required for all students and staff when school starts Sept. 13, but while the mayor has urged all New Yorkers who are eligible for COVID-19 shots to get them, vaccination is not required either for school staff or for students over age 12. Asked about the possibility of requiring public school teachers to be vaccinated, de Blasio said: “We’re actively looking right now at different actions we could take.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Children now must get approval from a parent before receiving the current COVID-19 vaccine available to them under legislation that Gov. Roy Cooper signed into law Friday. The written consent requirement is contained in a broader measure that largely expands the medications or immunizations, including vaccines, that pharmacists trained to deliver shots can administer to consumers. It comes even as the U.S. and North Carolina see a marked rise in coronavirus cases due to a highly contagious variant. The measure, which received nearly unanimous support in the Republican-controlled General Assembly, also states that trained pharmacy technicians and interns can administer a COVID-19 or flu vaccine under a pharmacist’s supervision. “This important legislation will help our state administer COVID-19 vaccines more quickly and efficiently,” Cooper, a Democrat, said in a news release announcing the bill signing. Permission from a parent or guardian applies immediately to vaccines authorized by federal regulators for emergency use – such as the COVID-19 vaccine produced by Pfizer – and administered by any health care provider. State law had given minors the ability on their own to be treated for certain health issues, including communicable diseases.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Amid a COVID-19 resurgence, advocates are calling on nursing homes to require that all staff members get vaccinated, and a nonprofit tracking the latest data says there haven’t been enough workers getting on board. The latest COVID-19 dashboard from AARP shows that only 24% of senior care facilities in North Dakota have met the industry target of having at least 75% of their staffs inoculated against the disease. Josh Askvig, state director of AARP North Dakota, said experts don’t want to go back to last fall, when the state saw some of the highest coronavirus death rates among patients. “What’s concerning right now is as new variants are emerging, facilities cannot let preventable problems be repeated,” Askvig said. “We’ve got to increase vaccinations, and we’ve got to do it now.” The latest AARP dashboard also shows nearly 12% of North Dakota nursing homes lack personal protective equipment to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Askvig said the state should help to ensure they have enough supplies. As for the vaccinations, he said facilities need to step up in the area. “They’ve got the resources through the different relief funding to get it done,” Askvig said. “And so we’re encouraging everyone eligible for the vaccine to get vaccinated.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: While COVID-19 cases have reportedly risen nationally among children, that trend has yet to show up locally. Instead, another common virus has squeezed Nationwide Children’s Hospital in recent weeks: The pediatric hospital is dealing with a rise in cases of respiratory syncytial virus, which usually begins circulating more in the fall rather than late summer. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly why RSV is showing up again now, but the coronavirus pandemic is likely the cause, said Dr. Mike Patrick, an emergency department physician at Nationwide Children’s. With everyone masking up, staying home and keeping their distance, RSV didn’t spread as easily in 2020. Now that more families are getting out and doing things, and kids are returning to school and day care, RSV is able to spread, Patrick said. “No one knows for certain what is driving this,” he said. “But being isolated and behind masks and then suddenly reintroducing people together really fuels the spread of these viral illnesses.” The spike in RSV cases is similar to what Nationwide Children’s usually sees at its peak in winter, Patrick said. But Patrick said he worries whether COVID-19 cases could also start showing up more in kids seeking treatment at Nationwide Children’s.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt is criticizing both a northeast Oklahoma school district that adopted a mask mandate and President Joe Biden over comments that the state’s ban on school mask requirements ban may violate a coronavirus aid package for schools. The Republican governor and state Attorney General John O’Connor released a joint statement Thursday criticizing the Hulbert school district for its mask requirement. “It is disappointing that one school district has chosen to openly violate a state law that was supported by 80 percent of the Legislature,” Stitt said in the statement. The district’s policy includes an opt-out option for medical reasons. Earlier this month Stitt praised two Oklahoma City school districts for mask mandates that included opt-out options for medical, religious or personal reasons. O’Connor said that the law is constitutional and that the state is fighting a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality. Stitt’s criticism of Biden comes after U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in letters to him and state school Superintendent Joy Hofmeister on Wednesday that the school mask ban may violate the American Rescue Plan that provided $123 billion to the nation’s schools to help them return to the classroom.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Managers from a senior living facility say a video posted to social media by a recruiter for the company saying she would hire unvaccinated health care workers does not reflect the company’s views. Shayna Hall, a recruiter for Salem-based Bonaventure Senior Living, a senior assisted living community with locations in Oregon, Washington and Colorado, posted the video on TikTok last month, as first reported by the Salem Reporter. In the video, which has been deleted from Hall’s account but can still be found on other posters’ accounts, Hall says she came across medical workers posting on TikTok about being fired or forced out of their jobs because they refuse to get a “brand new vaccine.” “I just wanted to tell you if you are a nurse, a caregiver, a med tech, and you now need a new job because of this, hit me up, I’ll hire you,” she says in the video. “I need nurses, caregivers, med techs in Washington, Colorado and Oregon. Take your pick.” While the COVID-19 vaccines are new, the research behind them is not. Scientists around the world have been working on vaccines for the SARS coronavirus for more 20 years. Hall’s video swiftly ignited controversy online. Many have decried the company’s willingness to hire unvaccinated employees to serve elderly and high-risk residents.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s unemployment rate dropped to a new post-pandemic low in July, and the labor force shrank, as payrolls jumped by nearly 29,000, according to figures released Friday. Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate dropped three-tenths of a percentage point to 6.6% from June’s adjusted rate, the state Department of Labor and Industry said. The national rate was 5.4% in July, more than a point below Pennsylvania’s. The figures come out as the federal government prepares to end supplemental payments of $300 a week to people who lost jobs or self-employment income during the pandemic. The $300 payments last through the week ending Sept. 3. In a survey of households, the labor force shrank by 16,000 in July, closer to 6.3 million. However, the number of employed grew slightly, while the number of unemployed slid by 19,000. The state hit a record-high labor force of almost 6.6 million just before the pandemic hit. In a separate survey of employers, payrolls grew in July by 28,800, to above 5.7 million. The state has regained about 65% of the 1.1 million jobs lost in the pandemic. It hit a record high for payrolls of 6.1 million just before the pandemic hit, according to state figures. The leisure and hospitality sector led all gainers, adding 16,000 jobs.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The city’s downtown arts festival has been canceled for the second year in a row amid rising cases of COVID-19, city officials announced Friday. PVDFest, a weekend festival that typically draws more 100,000 people to downtown Providence, was scheduled to make its comeback Sept. 25-26. But officials said it would be unsafe to continue amid high levels of coronavirus transmission. Mayor Jorge Elorza said the decision was made “after carefully considering the increased spread of the delta variant.” “Together we can beat this virus and return to dancing and celebrating together downtown next year,” Elorza said in a statement. Although the downtown event is canceled, smaller outdoor art programs affiliated with the festival will continue in the coming weeks. Officials said face masks will be strongly recommended. Rhode Island is averaging about 310 new COVID-19 cases a day, up from about 196 a day two weeks ago. The festival was started in 2015 and has featured more than 5,000 artists and performers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s health agency became the latest group Friday to ask lawmakers to make it clear that school districts can require students to wear masks without losing state budget money or facing any other penalties. The General Assembly put the mask ban item into the budget in early June when South Carolina was seeing an average of 150 COVID-19 cases a day. Ten weeks later, the state is seeing about 3,520 new cases each day. And that dire new case average comes before about 700,000 public school students completed their first week back in classrooms. Of the more than 5,200 new coronavirus cases reported Friday, more than 500 were in children 10 or younger. The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control Board voted unanimously Friday to ask the state House and Senate to come back in special session to “provide local authority for mask mandates.” They joined the Republican state education superintendent, House Democrats, teacher groups, an association of school board members, a group of two Democratic and two Republican state senators, several school boards, and other groups that have asked lawmakers to reconsider the mask ban.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that she is planning to focus on water, sewer and broadband infrastructure projects as the state plans to spend nearly $1 billion in federal funds meant to help towns and cities recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The state government is readying to receive $974.5 million from the federal government over the next year and a half. Over the course of the pandemic, South Dakota has been alloted more than $4.8 billion in federal relief funds – a windfall that nearly matches the state’s annual budget. Under the American Rescue Plan Act passed by Congress, state and local governments must use the funds to respond to COVID-19. They can use the money for public health programs, addressing the financial fallout of the pandemic, replacing lost revenues, paying for essential workers, or infrastructure. The Republiacn governor said the state has “broad flexibility” in using the money. Meanwhile, daily coronavirus cases across the state on Friday topped 300 for the first time in more than six months as a fresh pandemic wave appeared to build. In the past two weeks, the state has seen case counts spike by 270%, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. However, the number of cases per capita in that time has remained one of the lowest in the country.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Bluff City teens have been leading the state’s surge of recent COVID-19 vaccinations. The 15-19 age group in the Memphis region showed the greatest growth of any age group across the state’s eight regions from late July through last week, according to a new study by researchers at the Department of Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt School of Medicine. Vaccinations among residents ages 12-14 also grew, according to the study. The increase in vaccinations comes as infections and hospitalizations surged through July and August, driven by the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The burden of new COVID-19 cases across the state is among the Tennessee’s younger populations, who are also less likely to be inoculated, researchers concluded. Findings show infections have grown the most among people in their early 20s. The two western Tennessee regions saw the greatest vaccination growth, according to the study, though each of the eight regions in the state saw growth in vaccinations beginning in late July. The state’s metropolitan areas of Nashville, Knoxville and Memphis have the highest vaccination rates in nearly all age groups, the researchers wrote. The lowest rates are among the Upper Cumberland region of Cookeville and surrounding counties.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The lieutenant governor blamed rising hospitalization and death rates from COVID-19 on unvaccinated Black people in comments that were quickly denounced as racist. Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick made the remarks Thursday night on a Fox News segment in response to question about the latest coronavirus surge in Texas, which is seeing its highest hospitalization rates since January. “The biggest group in most states are African Americans who have not been vaccinated,” Patrick said. He did not change course Friday, saying that “Democrat social media trolls” misstated facts and that he had used state data in his assertions. But statistics from the Texas Department of State Health Services don’t back that. Black people – who make up about 12% of Texas’ population – accounted for about 15% of total COVID-19 cases and just more than 10% of deaths. Patrick also told Fox News that Democrats were to blame for low vaccination rates among Black people, who frequently support that party, even though he believes Republicans should persuade more people to get their shots, too. But he also tiptoed around that issue, which has been sensitive for the GOP. About 8% of Texans who have been fully vaccinated are Black, according to state data. The resulting percentage of Black people who’ve been inoculated is unclear.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The mayor announced Friday that she had issued a mask order in the city’s K-12 schools as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus spreads. Mayor Erin Mendenhall said she used her emergency powers to issue the order and plans to work with health officials to determine when it can be lifted. “As Mayor it is my responsibility to do everything I can to keep our City, and our school district, from going down the tragic and dangerous path many others are already on,” Mendenhall, a Democrat, said in a statement. The order came a week after the Salt Lake County Council overturned a school mask order for kids under 12 that the county’s top health official issued. Mendenhall said the majority of board members had privately told her they feared retaliation and urged her to issue the order. “Unfortunately, and despite all the evidence that masks protect children and the adults who care for them, this issue has become politicized to the point that elected bodies across the country, and in the State of Utah, worry about retaliation if they take stand as an organization,” she wrote. Masks were required in classrooms last year, but under a new state law, school mask mandates are banned. Local health departments can issue a rule with the support of elected county leaders, but anti-mask advocates have been vocal in their opposition.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state and Vermont Legal Aid have reached a settlement over the end of a hotel voucher program for some of the homeless population during the pandemic, the Vermont Agency of Human Services and the legal services group announced Friday. Under the settlement, eligibility for the general assistance emergency housing program will be expanded for people with disabilities, and a formal process will be created for applicants whose health or welfare would be at risk due to their disability if they were unsheltered, the groups said. Last year Vermont expanded eligibility for the program during the pandemic to allow more people to stay temporarily in hotels and motels. It ended the program for some in July and gave $2,500 checks to those who were no longer eligible. Vermont Legal Aid sued, and a judge signed an agreement extending the emergency housing for some people to show they had a disability and could remain eligible. “People with disabilities who are experiencing homelessness will now be able to access GA benefits even if they are able to work,” Vermont Legal Aid staff attorney Jessica Radbord said in a statement. “We believe this will protect some truly vulnerable members of our community from suffering negative health consequences as a result of being unsheltered.”\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: More than 200 University of Virginia students who didn’t comply with the school’s COVID-19 vaccine requirement have been disenrolled ahead of the fall semester. The move affected 238 students, including 49 students who were enrolled in fall courses, The Virginian-Pilot reports. That may mean that “a good number” of the remaining students “may not have been planning to return to the university this fall at all,” university spokesperson Brian Coy said. The students were disenrolled after “receiving multiple reminders via email, text, phone calls, calls to parents that they were out of compliance,” Coy said. They can reenroll if they comply with the vaccine requirement or file an exemption by Wednesday. About 96.6% of students have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to a news release. The university granted 335 permanent vaccine waivers for students with religious or medical exemptions. The university also granted 184 temporary vaccine waivers for students who couldn’t get inoculated but intend to get a COVID-19 shot once on campus. Exempt students must be tested weekly for the coronavirus and wear a mask in indoor and outdoor common spaces.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee’s announcement of mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for state workers comes at a time when the state ferry system is experiencing a severe staffing shortage. KUOW reports that in an Aug. 13 notice, Washington State Ferries Chief of Staff Nicole McIntosh said there were “an unprecedented 91 relief requests yesterday.” She thanked the crew members who helped cover for their absent colleagues. In response to the shortage, the agency canceled sailings and went from two ferries on the Edmonds-Kingston and Clinton-Mukilteo routes to one. Washington State Ferries spokesperson Ian Sterling said staffing issues have been a chronic problem throughout the pandemic, but that week was “as bad as it’s been, due to the labor shortage, due to people out with active COVID or having to quarantine.” Capt. Dan Twohig, the regional representative of the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, one of several unions representing ferry service workers, said last week’s staff shortages were an anomaly. A coalition of unions representing Washington State Ferries employees started bargaining with state officials last week over the implementation of the vaccine mandate. Twohig said the unions agree that the mandate is legal and will go forward.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice on Friday launched a second round of vaccination sweepstakes, this time with prizes aimed at enticing younger residents to sign up for COVID-19 shots as the pandemic continues to worsen. The first of six weekly drawings will be held Aug. 31. Registration opens Monday. All residents must register again for the new drawings, even if they were registered for the first series of prizes earlier this summer, Justice said at a news conference. The prizes include season ticket packages to West Virginia University and Marshall sporting events, ski lift tickets, and a 10-year supply of free gas. Also being given away each week will be a $150,000 dream wedding, a luxury sports car, a custom fishing boat, ATVs or high-end lawnmowers, and college scholarships for residents ages 12 to 25. The governor’s announcement came as the number of people hospitalized statewide from COVID-19 reached 447, the most since late January. More than 1,350 coronavirus cases had been reported statewide in the prior two days alone. Cases of the more contagious delta variant of the virus are now present in at least 46 of the state’s 55 counties, according to health department data.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOneida: At least three American Indian tribes in the state will put cash in the pockets of their members and employees to get COVID-19 shots. The Oneida, Menominee and Ho-Chunk tribes are offering a $500 incentive for vaccinations. The offer includes those who have already been inoculated. For the Menominee Nation, members ages 12 and older as well as tribal employees who are fully vaccinated on or before Oct. 31 are eligible. Oneida tribal members and employees have until Sept. 30 to show proof of their vaccination to receive the $500. Ho-Chunk Nation members have until Nov. 1 to provide proof. “We know that once we can get at least 75% of our community vaccinated, we’re going to be able to have that level of safety that we can,” said Debbie Danforth, director of the Oneida Nation Division of Health. So far, Danforth said about 5,000 tribal members, or about 30%, have been vaccinated, WLUK-TV reports. The rate for employees is about 50%. Marlon Skenandore, who had COVID-19 last year and is still dealing with its effects, said the incentive is not swaying his decision on whether to get vaccinated. “I’m just hesitant about the FDA not approving it and not going through its normal procedure, so I’m on the fence, but I’m leaning towards getting it,” he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nMoose: Grand Teton National Park had its busiest month on record in July. July is almost always the busiest month for tourism in the park in northwestern Wyoming. In July 2021, almost 830,000 people visited, park officials said in a statement. That was up from 796,000 in July 2018, the second-busiest month in records dating to 1979. July was the first time Grand Teton topped 800,000 visitors in a month. Visitation was up almost 10% compared to July 2020, when the park had just reopened after being mostly closed by the coronavirus pandemic. Accompanying the tourism surge, camping was up 2.7%, backcountry camping was up 15%, and trail use was up 21% in July 2021 compared to July 2019. Researchers this summer have been studying the relationship between the number of vehicles entering Grand Teton and visitor traffic at key areas of the park, park officials said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/07/18/iran-pentagon-ballistic-missiles-column/12788249/", "title": "Iran won't slow down on ballistic missiles: Column", "text": "Ilan Berman\n\nWith time for nuclear diplomacy between Iran and the P5+1 nations (the U.S., UK, Russia, China, France and Germany) running out, and with the White House scrambling to cobble together some sort of deal with Tehran, it's perhaps not surprising that Pentagon's latest annual assessment of Iran's military capabilities has so far garnered little attention, either within the Washington Beltway or outside it.\n\nThe study, submitted to the U.S. Congress earlier this year (with an unclassified summary made public in recent days), is minimalist in nature, providing only the broadest contours of the contemporary challenge posed by Iran. Even so, it contains some useful insights into the current state of Iran's military capabilities — and, by inference, what they might mean for American security and U.S. interests abroad. Here are a few takeaways:\n\nIran's president is still just window dressing. The rise of Hassan Rouhani to the Iranian presidency last summer brought with it widespread hope that Iran had at long last turned over a new political leaf. This perception has only been strengthened by the soft diplomatic tones of Mr. Rouhani himself, and by the Iranian regime's newfound willingness to talk to the West about its nuclear effort. The Pentagon report, however, helpfully reminds us that Mr. Rouhani is simply the hired help, and that Iran's Supreme Leader holds that title for a very good reason. \"Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei remains unchallenged atop Iran's power structure as both the political-spiritual guide and the commander in chief of the armed forces.\" In other words, for all of his reformist political rhetoric and overtures toward the West, Mr. Rouhani isn't the ultimate arbiter of Iran's nuclear flexibility or its global interests — or of much else, for that matter.\n\nIran remains a source of regional instability. Since its inception in 1979, the Islamic Republic has made the \"export\" of its radical vision of global Islamic revolution a key regime priority. Thirty-five years on, those efforts are still going strong. Iran's covert and asymmetric activities are \"continuing unabated in countries such as Syria and Iraq,\" the Pentagon study points out. This includes massive ongoing military support (in the form of snipers and drones, among other things) for the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Damascus, as well as an extensive footprint on Iraqi soil — one that is once again growing in response to the advances of Sunni extremists.\n\nIran's international troublemaking, meanwhile, is on the rise. The Qods Force, the elite paramilitary unit of Iran's feared Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), \"has continued efforts to improve its access within foreign countries and its ability to conduct terrorist attacks,\" the study notes. This presence now extends far beyond the Middle East to include Latin America, Asia and Europe, making the IRGC a truly global threat actor.\n\nIran's military capabilities are steadily growing. The Iranian regime may now be negotiating with the West over its nuclear effort, but it is simultaneously arming for regional dominance. \"Tehran is quietly fielding increasingly lethal symmetric and asymmetric weapon systems,\" the Pentagon report notes. These include \"more advanced naval mines, small but capable submarines, coastal defense cruise missile batteries, attack craft, and anti-ship ballistic missiles\" — tools that are intended to allow Iran to more effectively and completely control the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial waterway through which nearly a fifth of world oil transits.\n\nThese capabilities, U.S. officials have warned in recent years, are already robust enough to allow Iran to close the Strait for brief periods of time, even with a sustained U.S. military presence in the region. But Iran's continued build-up guarantees that in the event of a regional conflict, America will need to contend with an Islamic Republic with its hand squarely on the global oil spigot.\n\nIran is bolstering its ballistic missile arsenal. Recent U.S. government estimates have warned that the Islamic Republic could potentially develop a intercontinental ballistic missile by next year. The Pentagon report qualifies this somewhat, stating that \"Iran has publicly stated it may launch a space launch vehicle by 2015 that could be capable of intercontinental ballistic missile ranges if configured as a ballistic missile.\" That change in phraseology reflects internal questions within the U.S. government about the pace of Iran's missile development.\n\nWhat isn't in doubt, however, is the Iranian regime's intent to become a global missile power. In recent years, the Islamic Republic has made heavy investments in both its ballistic missile and its space programs — technologies that, if fused together, would allow the regime to rapidly field an ICBM. The Iranian government, moreover, has consistently rejected any constraints on its ballistic missile capabilities as part of negotiations with the P5+1 powers. The message is clear: Iran sees missiles as inextricably linked to its global status, and isn't willing to give up on either.\n\nAlthough the Pentagon report on Iran is modest in both scope and depth, it nonetheless conveys the unmistakable impression that the Iranian regime — which not long ago was on the ropes as a result of Western pressure — has gotten a new lease on life. So, too, have its military capabilities, with all that this implies for the Middle East, and for us.\n\nIlan Berman is vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council.\n\nIn addition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from outside writers, including our Board of Contributors.

A corporate donation of $250,000 by the technology company SAIC Inc. pushed the effort over the top, officials said in a statement Tuesday. Nearly 8,000 people and companies from three dozen countries contributed to the “Save Space Camp” drive in the week it took to reach the goal, and donations will continue to be accepted. Located in Huntsville, Space Camp is an internationally known educational program run by the state-owned U.S. Space and Rocket Center. Leaders said the pandemic has hurt revenue so badly that donations were needed to continue operating the museum and to reopen Space Camp in the spring. Nearly 1 million youths and adults have attended Space Camp since it opened in 1982, and a dozen people who went on to become astronauts or cosmonauts participated. The Space and Rocket Center was closed from mid-March through late May because of the shutdown to slow the spread of COVID-19, and Space Camp, which features students working in groups on simulated space missions, did not reopen until late June with a limited capacity.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The first cruise in an already decimated southeast Alaska cruise season came to a devastating end Wednesday when a small ship carrying 36 passengers returned to Juneau because one of the guests tested positive for COVID-19. All 36 guests on the Wilderness Adventurer will quarantine at a hotel and the 30 crew members will quarantine on the ship in Gastineau Channel, just off Juneau’s downtown. The loss of cruise ships capable of carrying thousands of people has been devastating to Alaska’s tourism economy this summer, particularly for communities in southeast Alaska that would have seen their populations swell with the influx of tourists. The state tourism industry had anticipated 2.2 million visitors, many of them on cruises. Larger cruise ships – those carrying more than 250 passengers and crew members – have been under no-sail orders, but smaller companies were allowed to continue operating. The canceled trip by UnCruise Adventures was the first of the season. The company had four additional cruises planned but opted to cancel the entire Alaska season after the positive test, spokeswoman Liz Galloway said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The number of known coronavirus-related deaths in Arizona has now surpassed 4,000, health officials said Thursday. The Arizona Department of Health Services reported another 1,444 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 70 more deaths. This brings the total number of cases since the pandemic began to 183,647 and the death toll to 4,002. Some of the fatalities were likely counted after health officials reviewed death certificates going back weeks. Still, the news comes a day after Maricopa County public health officials confirmed 22 bodies were moved to portable storage coolers. The action was taken after the medical examiner’s office in metro Phoenix became 86% full, according to Robert Rowley, director of the county’s emergency management department. It’s a significant increase compared with the same time a year ago, he said. Dr. Rebecca Sunenshine, medical director of disease control for the Maricopa County Department of Public Health, said the county has seen more deaths than usual since January. Those are likely to include people who were hesitant to seek care for other conditions. The upward trend in deaths will likely “sustain itself for at least the coming weeks,” Sunenshine said. Overall, more than half of the COVID-19 related deaths have occurred in the state’s most populous county.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state is requiring schools to stay open five days a week when classes resume this month, state education officials said Wednesday, complicating efforts by some districts to limit on-site instruction because of the coronavirus pandemic. Education Secretary Johnny Key issued the guidance to districts as the state reported 912 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 18 more deaths from the illness caused by the virus. The Education Department told districts they must stay open to students and offer “relevant and engaging onsite learning opportunities” all week in order to comply with the state Constitution. Arkansas’ public schools are set to reopen the week of Aug. 24. Some districts could only keep their facilities open four days a week if approved by the state Board of Education, the guidance said. The directions come as some districts have been planning to limit the number of on-site classes and using remote learning during part of the week to reduce the risk of the virus’ spread. Gov. Asa Hutchinson has stood by plans to resume classes this month, despite objections from pediatricians and teachers’ groups.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State prison officials said as many as 17,600 California inmates might be released early because of the coronavirus, 70% more than previously estimated and a total that victims and police said includes dangerous criminals who should stay locked up. The releases also are causing consternation as probation officers and community organizations scramble to provide housing, transportation and other services for inmates who might pose a public health risk because several hundred have been paroled while still contagious. “It has just been a total madhouse, quite frankly, and we’re doing this in the midst of a pandemic,” said Karen McDaniel, the statewide transportation and services liaison between community groups and corrections officials. Among those released was Terebea Williams, 44, who served 19 years of an 84 years-to-life sentence for first-degree murder, carjacking and kidnapping. She was freed last week after being deemed at high medical risk for the virus. Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig, whose office prosecuted Williams, and the advocacy group Crime Victims Alliance complained that victims and prosecutors are given little notice and no opportunity to object to the releases. Officials have been under intense pressure from advocates, some state lawmakers and two federal judges to release more inmates, particularly after a botched transfer of infected inmates into San Quentin State Prison led to the state’s worst prison outbreak. Nearly 170 inmates still are infected there and 23 died, including 11 on death row. More than 2,000 have either recovered or were released while infected.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:As Colorado State University prepares to welcome students back to campus for the first time in nearly six months, it is dealing with an increase in students and staff with COVID-19 and bracing for more. Thus far, CSU said it was aware of 38 students and 21 employees who have tested positive since March 16, when the pandemic hit Colorado. Some of those cases have been among students who tested positive after they left campus and staff who were already working remotely and have not been at the university since mid-March, said CSU spokeswoman Dell Rae Ciaravola. But as of Aug. 2, 16 student athletes who have been practicing and preparing for fall sports and seven members of Sigma Kappa, an off-campus fraternity, have tested positive for COVID-19, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment reported last week. Three athletes who tested positive and another who is in quarantine for potential exposure live in Parmalee Hall. Two others live in Aggie Village, Ciaravola said in an email. A section of Parmalee Hall has been set aside for students who are in quarantine and self-isolation or who test positive the rest of the summer. The only COVID positive students living at Parmalee are student athletes, she said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: For the second day in a row, there have been no new COVID-19-associated deaths in Connecticut, according to new data released Wednesday. It also marked the sixth day in the past month that no new deaths were reported. As of Wednesday, a total of 4,437 people have died. Meanwhile, the state’s infection rate continues to hover just below 1%. Of the 11,839 tests conducted since Tuesday, 115 were positive. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said Monday that Connecticut is currently “in a good place” because the state’s baseline rate of COVID-19 infections continues to remain very low,. He predicted the state will have an upper hand with containing, rather than just mitigating, any flare-ups that might develop this fall. Also Wednesday, there were 59 hospitalizations, one fewer patient than on Tuesday.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A convicted killer serving two life sentences for a 1982 double murder has died after testing positive for COVID-19, Delaware prison officials said Wednesday. Authorities said Jackie R. Lovett, 71, died Wednesday at a Dover hospital of complications from hypothyroidism and COVID. Lovett was tested for COVID-19 on July 5 as part of the Department of Correction’s testing of all inmates. After his test result came back positive, Lovett was transferred from Sussex Correctional Institution and treated at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center’s COVID-19 treatment facility. He was admitted to Bayhealth Hospital on July 14. Lovett was from Salisbury, Maryland. He was sentenced to life in prison without probation or parole for the drug-related killings of Lori Todd and Richard Bull. The victims’ bodies were found in a tributary of the Pocomoke River in Maryland. Both had been shot in the head. A codefendant told police that he was in a farmhouse near Delmar, Delaware, when Lovett took Todd and Bull in back of the farmhouse and murdered them. A police officer testified that Lovett admitted that he shot Bull but said co-defendant Charles Bower later killed Todd.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Effective immediately, all public pools in the District must remain closed for the summer as the region continues to take precautions against the coronavirus pandemic. “We understand residents look forward to escaping the summer heat at our pools. Out of an abundance of caution, and in consultation with the District’s public health experts, we have decided to prioritize the health and safety of residents,” Delano Hunte, the DC Department of Parks and Recreation director, said. The department operates 21 outdoor public pools in the District, all of which have been closed since March 16. According to Mayor Muriel Bowser, the pools will undergo mandatory winterization processes like draining and covering. Indoor aquatic centers and spray parks owned by the parks and recreation department will remain closed for the rest of the summer, as well. Although the District continues to monitor for the latest reopening plans, other park facilities and programs have opened with social distancing guidelines in place. Parks and playgrounds are open to the public, and the department is still taking permit applications to accommodate outdoor groups of no more than 50. Community pools can start to reopen under a limited capacity in the third phase of ReOpening DC guidelines laid out by Bowser, which the District is still waiting to transition into.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach:Nurses at St. Mary’s Medical Center have complained they have been forced to wear masks that are not hospital-grade and snap off while they tend to the needs of patients with COVID-19. “They are the masks that can be found at Home Depot or Lowe’s,” said one nurse. Some said they have purchased their own personal protective equipment but the owner of St. Mary’s – Tenet Hospitals – prohibits the use of masks purchased on the open market. “They are now giving us these white N-95s that are cheaply made and snapping off when the nurses are on the COVID-19 units, therefore exposing them,” one nurse said. Another nurse said: “I’m afraid to bring this back home to my family. We are risking our lives every day.” A few weeks ago, the hospital provided nurses with Chinese-made masks that were ill-fitting and also broke easily, they say. Those have been replaced by 3M masks that are not N-95 hospital-grade and snap off if the nurse dares to adjust her face shield, they said. Several nurses at St. Mary’s reached out to The Palm Beach Post over the weekend, saying Tenet Hospitals won’t listen to their concerns and offer only platitudes. The nurses spoke on condition their names not be published out of fear of retaliation. They reiterated concerns Tenet nurses expressed about PPE in a Post news story in April, showing the situation has not gotten any better as coronavirus cases increased in recent months. Tenet Hospitals would not address the mask issue but said it follows guidelines set by the Florida Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the use and conservation of PPE.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWinder: More than 90 staff members in a Georgia school district have been quarantined because of coronavirus exposure or infection, prompting the district to plan to begin the year entirely online. State officials on Thursday, meanwhile, reported that Georgia had passed 4,000 deaths from the coronavirus. Barrow County Schools officials announced Wednesday that the district about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta would abandon plans to have in-person classes and distance learning when the school year begins Aug. 17, and instead have all students attend classes virtually. “We made a very difficult decision based on the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in our county, as well as the concerns over being able to appropriately staff our schools.” Superintendent Dr. Chris McMichael said in a statement posted to Twitter Wednesday night. “If today was the first day of school, we would have been hard-pressed to have sufficient staff available to open our schools.” The district had 1,800 full- and part-time employees and 14,400 students during the 2019-2020 school year, according to its records. McMichael said the district took “every precaution” and staff members were required to wear masks during preplanning before students returned to buildings. But dozens of employees were still infected or in quarantine due to a suspected case or direct contact with a confirmed case. Officials said they were working to return students to classrooms “as quickly as possible” under a phased approach. The district is the latest in Georgia to face complications as the new academic year begins. About 260 employees for Gwinnett County Public Schools, the state’s largest public school district, reported testing positive for the coronavirus or possibly being exposed to it ahead of the year’s start on Aug. 12, officials confirmed to news outlets this week. In Cherokee and Paulding counties, where districts began in-person classes Monday with mask-optional policies, some questioned safety protocols after on-campus pictures showed students packed shoulder-to-shoulder, with few wearing masks.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The head of a hospital group warned the growing number of coronavirus cases in Hawaii is on track to outstrip the state’s capacity to provide medical services to fight the illness. Hawaii Pacific Health CEO Ray Vara made the assessment following a meeting Monday of the state House of Representatives Select Committee on COVID-19 Economic and Financial Preparedness, Hawaii Public Radio reported Tuesday. “If we continue on these current trends of triple-digit numbers for another seven to 10 days, we’re going to begin stressing those capacities pretty quickly,” Vara said. Hawaii Pacific Health operates four hospitals on Oahu and Kauai, including Kapiolani Medical Center, Straub Medical Center, Pali Momi Medical Center, and Wilcox Medical Center. The group has built analytical models of the virus spread for months with the goal of preventing the illness from overwhelming the state’s health care system. The growth in new cases was predicted by the hospital group’s models until recently. But the state no longer appears to be maintaining an effective testing and contact tracing program, while members of the public are not adhering to face mask and social distancing guidelines, Vara said. Large public gatherings at beaches and parks have taken place in recent weeks, including one on Oahu’s North Shore over the weekend that was cited by the state Emergency Management Agency.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: The director of a soccer tournament in Moscow has apologized to city officials and residents after the event was shut down earlier this week over health concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. “I had every intention of providing a safe and fun environment for a weekend of soccer,” said Brandon Schreiner, director of the Harvest Cup soccer tournament. “I failed to properly deliver on one of those and for that I apologize.” Schreiner apologized at a Moscow City Council meeting Monday during the public comment and mayor’s response period, saying he respected and understood the decision to shut the tournaments down. Mayor Bill Lambert made the decision Sunday after two tournaments brought together more than 100 baseball and soccer team coaches and parents. He told the Daily News that there were too many people attending the events and not wearing masks or practicing social distancing. Schreiner said the tournament Saturday failed at enforcing social distancing measures. “We had full compliance from our coaches and players on (the) team bench side. Unfortunately, we didn’t do quite as good a job on the spectator side of the field.” He and tournament staff used safety precautions and cleaning protocols, he said, including enforcing teams to wear masks and displaying the coronavirus-related rules on signs at all the fields. Lambert told Schreiner he appreciated his remarks.\n\nIllinois\n\nTaylorville: U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Taylorville, said he has tested positive for COVID-19. In a statement, Davis said he has taken his temperature twice daily since the start of the pandemic. He said his temperature was slightly elevated Wednesday and he and his wife tested for the virus, with his coming back positive. “My staff, who I’ve worked with in-person this week, have received negative tests as well,” Davis said in the statement. “Other than a higher-than-normal temperature, I am showing no symptoms at this time and feel fine.” Davis said he is postponing planned public events and will quarantine himself until he tests negative, adding protecting the public health is his highest priority. “If you’re out in public, use social distancing, and when you can’t social distance, please wear a mask,” he said. “All of us must do our part. That’s what it will take to get through this pandemic.” Davis, 50, represents the 13th Congressional District in central and southwestern Illinois. He defeated Democrat Betsy Dirksen Londrigan of Springfield by a narrow margin in 2018. Davis and Londrigan will face-off again in November.\n\nIndiana\n\nAvon:An Avon High School student has tested positive for the coronavirus, school officials said. Avon Community Schools officials said they learned of the positive test Wednesday. Parents were notified in an email that night. “Our School Corporation follows the guidance from the Hendricks County Health Department,” spokesperson Stacey Moore said. “As a result of our preparations, we were able to quickly contact trace, so if anyone was deemed a close contact, they have been notified about the next steps.” Moore declined to say when the student last attended classes or how many people were considered close contacts, citing privacy concerns. Kandi Jamison, public health nursing director for the Hendricks County Health Department, declined to comment on the Avon High School case. Generally, Jamison said, health department and school officials work together to identify anyone who might have been in close contact with an individual who tests positive for the virus. She said anyone who has been within 6 feet of an infected person for 15 minutes or longer would be notified and instructed to self-quarantine for two weeks.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City:The Johnson County Board of Supervisors passed a face-covering regulation Thursday morning. The board unanimously approved the ordinance, which had originated with the county’s Board of Health. Johnson County Attorney Janet Lyness said that, by originating with a county board of health, the regulation will be enforceable, despite arguments from Gov. Kim Reynolds and Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller that local officials lack the authority to enforce such measures. Johnson County Supervisor Royeann Porter said the regulation is not aimed being punitive but at slowing the spread of the coronavirus. Supervisor Janelle Rettig said she had been contacted by a pastor who asked for a religious freedom exemption from the mandate. Rettig pointed to a recent outbreak at an Ohio church that originated from one congregant. The Plain Dealer of Cleveland reported Tuesday that Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said a man with COVID-19 went to church in mid-June and the virus spread “like wildfire.” “I get that people feel they have freedoms,” Rettig said Thursday, “but that also means you feel like you have the freedom to drive drunk or to drive a bus on drugs. I mean, sometimes your freedom ends when you can kill other people, and this is that case.” The Board of Supervisors’ regulation will go into effect Monday, after being posted in a paper of record like the Iowa City Press-Citizen, a requirement of Iowa Code. Once in effect, the ordinance will require people in unincorporated portions of Johnson County to wear masks covering the nose and mouth while in public spaces, including grocery stores, pharmacies, hardware stores, retail stores and schools; when using public transportation or taxi services; or when they’re outside and unable to maintain at least 6 feet of separation from other people. The ordinance mirrors the penalty for disobeying Iowa City’s order, making a first offense a simple misdemeanor with a fine that could range from $105 to $885, to be determined by a judge.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: Kansas counties that have mask mandates have seen a rapid drop in coronavirus cases, and counties that only recommend their use have seen no decrease in cases, the state’s top health official said. Dr. Lee Norman, the state health department’s top administrator, said statewide the numbers of new cases is favorable, but that the reduction of new cases is entirely in the counties that require masks be worn in public spaces. After Gov. Laura Kelly put a mask mandate in place last month, 15 counties stayed with the mandate and 90 abandoned it, Norman said. Norman pointed a graph showing the seven-day rolling average of cases per 100,000 people comparing counties with the mask mandates with those counties that abandoned it. The favorable trend line down was entirely in the counties that required the use of masks, and the trend line for those without one was flat, he said. “Do masks work? Here in this natural experiment called Kansas where we have essentially – not due to any great design, but it has worked out that way – some counties have been the control group with a no mask mandate and some have been the experimental group with masks,” Norman said. “The experimental group is winning the battle. All improvements in case development comes from those counties wearing masks.” It is important to understand, he noted, that the 15 counties with mask mandates represent two-thirds of the state’s population and include the more urban cities with greater population densities. People in those counties rely more on mass transit there and tend to have more racial and ethnic minority populations that are more likely to be infected by COVID-19.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville:Restaurants in Louisville will be allowed to expand outdoor dining into parking areas under a new Metro Government ordinance. City officials said the ordinance will ease strain on restaurants that have limited indoor seating during the pandemic. “The new on-street dining option will give restaurants the chance to serve more customers in a safe manner, while complying with the state restrictions that are necessary to stem the spread of COVID-19,” Mayor Greg Fischer said in a news release. Restaurants will submit plans to the city for approval. The dining areas must be adjacent to the sidewalk and on streets that have a speed limit of 35 mph or less. Restaurants will be responsible for providing their own furniture as well as required barriers for public safety. The release from the mayor’s office said Louisville Forward, the city’s economic development group, worked with Louisville Metro Council to pass an emergency ordinance.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration argued Wednesday that Louisiana’s statewide mask mandate and bar restrictions have helped to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, hoping to persuade a state district judge to uphold the regulations in a lawsuit challenging them as unconstitutional. After a daylong hearing from witnesses on both sides of the litigation, testimony in the case was scheduled to continue Thursday. Four Jefferson Parish residents, including a musician, a catering business owner and two bar owners, are asking Judge Janice Clark to declare the rules null and void and prohibit the Democratic governor from enforcing them. The lawsuit argues Edwards’ original order requiring the masks, banning indoor gatherings above 50 people and limiting bars to takeout and delivery “is unconstitutionally vague, riddled with many exceptions” and shouldn’t be allowed to stand. Ronald Dalleo, owner of Cleary Tavern, said his bar serves food and has a similar number of tables and similar layout to a neighboring restaurant that is allowed to remain open to onsite service with alcoholic drinks. He said his business shouldn’t be treated differently because it has a different permit and he sells a few hamburgers less than that restaurant. “What I’m asking for is to be treated fairly,” Dalleo said during his testimony. “I definitely feel like I’m being discriminated against.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The federal government is canceling a research survey about New England’s imperiled shrimp fishery because of challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Maine shrimp fishery has been shut down for several years because of concerns such as poor survival of young shrimp. Scientists have said environmental conditions in the Gulf of Maine have put the future of the fishery at risk. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was scheduled to perform a research survey about the fishery this year, but announced its cancellation this week. The agency said it’s also canceling a handful of other research surveys off the East Coast and Gulf Coast because of “uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the unique challenges those are creating for NOAA Fisheries.” The shrimp were once a popular winter seafood item. Fishermen also harvested them in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. The pandemic has caused numerous difficulties for fishermen and the seafood industry in New England. Some relate to the disruption of the international seafood supply chain.\n\nMaryland\n\nSilver Springs: The state election board is weighing late changes in the state’s plan for the November election, aiming to protect voters and volunteer workers from crowded and understaffed polling stations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Board vice chairman Patrick Hogan made a last-ditch appeal Wednesday for the board to recommend mailing ballots to every registered voter. The board has been divided on that option, and Gov. Larry Hogan issued a directive to hold a traditional in-person election on Nov. 3. “I think we’re at the point of no return after today,” said Patrick Hogan, a Democrat who is not related to the governor. Larry Hogan, a Republican, on Monday demanded an update from the board on its plans for mail-in voting and polling places. He said the board appears to be on a path to repeating the “massive failures” of the June 2 primary election, which was hampered by problems with mail-in ballots and long lines at polling stations. The board didn’t act on Patrick Hogan’s plea Wednesday for mailing ballots directly to voters. It is forging ahead with plans to mail applications for a mail-in ballot to more than 4 million voters. The board is scheduled to meet again on Friday to discuss and vote on whether to adopt changes suggested by local election officials, including expanding the number of early-voting centers. The state is authorized to have approximately 80 early voting sites.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Mayflower II, a replica of the ship that brought the Pilgrims to the New World 400 years ago, has canceled a scheduled stop in Rhode Island because of new travel restrictions required of people who visit the state. The 64-year-old reproduction is sailing from Mystic, Connecticut, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, after an $11 million renovation project. The Mayflower II made an unscheduled stop in New Bedford, Massachusetts, this week to shelter during Tropical Storm Isaias. It was scheduled to visit Newport, Rhode Island, on Thursday. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker earlier this week required people from Rhode Island or those who have visited the state to quarantine for two weeks because of a rising number of coronavirus cases there. “Due to Governor Baker’s recent change to the restrictions on travel to states including Rhode Island, Plimoth Plantation has decided out of an abundance of caution to keep Mayflower in New Bedford … until Saturday, August 8, when the ship will make its way to the Massachusetts Maritime Academy,” a press release said. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Plymouth on Monday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The Michigan Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, said its board held an emergency meeting Tuesday night to discuss the reopening of schools. It adopted a motion saying local units should, “if needed,” demand to collectively bargain with K-12 districts over their COVID-19 preparedness and response plans before classes begin this month or next month. “MEA supports any local associations who choose to take collective action in order to protect the health and safety of their students and staff,” the motion stated. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said more than a month ago that she was optimistic about returning to in-person instruction during the upcoming academic year after it ended in March. The seven-day statewide case average has risen since then, from to 745 from 361, however. Under her plan, in-person classes are allowed but not required in both phases four – which covers most of the state – and five, which includes northern Michigan. Schools must follow safety protocols. Several districts, including Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor and many in and around Lansing, have announced plans to start with just online learning. Teachers plan to rally Thursday at the Capitol to protest physically reopening schools and to demand funding. Traditional districts and charter schools do not yet know their state aid for the coming academic year.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: St. Louis County in northeastern Minnesota this week has added new coronavirus cases faster than any other county in the state, according to health officials. Of the 475 cases in St. Louis County as of Wednesday, more than half were confirmed in July. The virus has been detected throughout the state’s geographically largest county, but about three-fourths of the cases came from Duluth, statistics showed. Although nursing homes were hit hard by COVID-19 in the spring and early summer, now nearly one-third of those infected in the county are in their 20s. About 40% of those testing positive said they have attended restaurants or bars during the period they were likely exposed to the virus, the county’s public health director Amy Westbrook said. “There’s a lot of things to really be concerned about,” said Westbrook, notably the proliferation of community transmission. Westbrook said the next few weeks will be crucial as the county watches to see whether the number of daily new cases, recently hovering close to 20, drops. On Wednesday the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa reported its first two confirmed cases on the reservation, part of which is in St. Louis County, and a third case involving a band member tested in Duluth, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Corinth School District, which has seen a handful of coronavirus cases among students since reopening for in-person classes last week, is doing a good job of being transparent with the public, the governor and the state’s top health official said. The school district has reported six cases since July 27. More than 100 students are quarantined, according to State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs. He described the district as a “model” of how school districts should respond to the pandemic. The district has been posting daily updates on its Facebook page after receiving positive test results. However, Dobbs and Gov. Tate Reeves said during a news conference that the state has no requirement for districts to release information to the public when schools have outbreaks. “I commend Corinth and their leadership for doing that. They aren’t trying to hide anything. They’re being very transparent,” Reeves said. He said there’s no “specific guideline” for how schools should report coronavirus outbreaks. All school districts should make positive test results public, but it’s up to them to do so, Reeves said. The state Department of Health is working on releasing data of outbreaks in schools by county, which would appear on its website with other daily coronavirus information, Dobbs said. However, he did not say whether that data would be organized district by district.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Four people tested positive for the coronavirus following open testing at the Capitol in advance of lawmakers returning to work, the state health department said. The agency offered free testing to lawmakers, staffers and others who work at the Capitol at the request of Senate Democratic Minority Leader John Rizzo. A health department spokeswoman said 228 people were tested. Republican Gov. Mike Parson called lawmakers back to work this summer to pass legislation aimed at addressing a surge in violent crime in the state’s biggest cities. Rizzo had asked for coronavirus testing to reduce the spread among lawmakers who travel to Jefferson City from across the state.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Montana is spending $530,000 in coronavirus relief money to boost Census outreach efforts with two months left in the once-a-decade population count. The U.S. Census Bureau is ending its counting efforts on Sept. 30, a month earlier than the extension that was announced this spring because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the bureau said Tuesday. The state is partnering with the Montana Nonprofit Association, Western Native Voice and Forward Montana to help contact people who have not responded to the census, officials said. The state’s 56% self-response rate is behind the national average. An accurate count could help Montana gain a second U.S. House seat and affects the amount of federal funding the state receives.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: One-third of the staff of the Douglas County Engineer’s office is at home on quarantine after four people who work there tested positive for the coronavirus. Officials said 23 of the 70 people in the office are isolating themselves at home because they had contact with one of the four ill employees. “This is an unfortunate situation, but we are doing everything we feel is prudent,” said Dan Kutilek, engineering manager for Douglas County Engineer. “We are following all health guidelines and the advice of our human resources department.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Children ages 5 to 12 in Clark County will be able to supplement their online studies at 13 facilities. The facilities will house day camp activities, such as educational time, games, arts and crafts and sports, KVVU-TV reported. County officials voted unanimously in July to implement an exclusively online system for schools for the start of the school year. The day camps will serve as an optional extension of students’ online studies. The facilities will open on the first day of school, Aug. 24, and run Monday through Friday from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Space in the program is first-come, first-serve. The program will close once children can return to school in-person. All activities will be socially distanced and all staff members are required to wear masks. Parents are asked to provide a reusable mask for their child. Parents and students will be required to have their temperature checked and complete a daily Wellness Acknowledgement Form. Students will be required to bring their own lunch or a snack that does not require heating or cooling.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s Congressional delegation expressed disappointment the Trump administration has reduced support for National Guard members who are responding to the coronavirus pandemic. The Democratic delegation had asked the administration to extend the New Hampshire National Guard’s activation through Dec. 31. According to the delegation, the request has been granted, but starting Aug. 21, the state will be reimbursed at only 75% instead of 100%. Only Texas and Florida will be fully supported, they said. “Considering the enormous financial strain that the state is under as a result of COVID-19, full federal support for the Guard’s deployment remains vital,” the delegation said in a joint statement. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu had asked that the activation be extended through September.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state Supreme Court on Wednesday wrestled with whether a new state law letting the governor borrow nearly $10 billion to close budget gaps brought on by the coronavirus pandemic passes constitutional muster. The seven-justice court heard oral arguments over more than two hours via video conference, with the jurists peppering the Republican plaintiffs and the state government respondents with skeptical-sounding questions. The case hinged on questions raised by the state Republican Party, which brought the lawsuit, arguing that the state constitution doesn’t sanction the kind of borrowing the new law authorizes to meet general operations expenses in the state budget. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration defended the law and grounded its case in part of the constitution that carves out exceptions for bonding in emergency cases. GOP state Sen. Michael Testa, an attorney, argued for the Republicans. No ruling was issued Wednesday by the court.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: A state agency has reported 21 employees at a meatpacking plant in Roswell tested positive for COVID-19, the most cases reported to the state by any job location in the area. The New Mexico Environment Department has advised USA Beef Packing LLC owner Jose Madrid on how to handle the influx in cases, the Roswell Daily Record reported. Madrid said he is cooperating with the state as it investigates what has caused that number of cases, and has decreased operations to about 10%. Agency reports showed the company reported its first positive test on July 28, and had two by July 31. The number of cases jumped to 21 by Wednesday. The company closed following the first confirmed case and all employees were to be tested, department spokeswoman Maddy Hayden said. A quality control officer for the company previously told the Daily Record that the plant follows all federal and state guidelines regarding food and employee safety, including social distancing measures and employee temperature checks. “We at USA Beef Packing understand the importance of continuing our essential service; to deliver safe and nutritional food to the world,” the company said in a statement, adding that it is following all necessary safety precautions.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state’s teachers’ unions said that one COVID-19 case in a school should trigger its immediate closure for 14 days as they listed demands for reopening. New York State United Teachers and the United Federation of Teachers called for the state policy just as New York is poised to announce initial decisions on reopening plans submitted by roughly 700 school districts. The unions said in a release that districts moving ahead with reopenings “must err on the side of caution at all times.” Districts submitted reopening proposals last week amid worries that resumption of in-person classes could put students, teachers and their families at risk. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this weekend that there needs to be a “full conversation” that answers parents’ questions about reopening safely. The unions said that when there is a positive COVID-19 test of a student or staff member, there should be an immediate closure of that school building and a return to remote learning for at least 14 days. They also want clear statewide directives how contact tracing and quarantining will be conducted.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s COVID-19 restrictions keeping some businesses with higher risks for spreading the virus closed and mass gatherings severely limited will remain in place for another five weeks, Gov. Roy Cooper said. Cooper’s executive order, which also mandates face coverings in public places statewide, expires Friday. Now the restrictions will be extended until at least Sept. 11. A decision to maintain the status quo comes even as the governor and his top health official said case trends continue to stabilize, and even improve slightly in some areas, compared to a few weeks ago. The new order means bars, gyms, movie theaters and amusement parks – places where people are usually in closer contact – will now be closed for nearly six straight months. Gatherings are still limited to 10 people indoors and 25 people outdoors, with some exceptions. As many university campuses and K-12 public schools begin fall classes this month with some in-person instruction, Cooper said it’s important to keep the same social distancing restrictions in place. Retaining the other restrictions will help counterbalance the higher risk associated with bringing together students, the governor said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The mayor of the city that was once the hot spot for the coronavirus in North Dakota is supporting an annual outdoor music festival set to go on as planned this weekend. The 25th Fargo Blues Festival is scheduled for Friday and Saturday at Newman Outdoor Field, where officials have had plenty of preventative practice by holding home baseball games for the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks and Winnipeg Goldeyes of the American Association. Mayor Tim Mahoney, a member of a task force that was assembled in May when North Dakota’s largest city saw a spike in virus cases, is supporting the show. He cited statistics showing that Cass County, which includes Fargo, has held steady with a daily positive rate of 2% for 60 days. “I hope people wear masks and social distance,” Mahoney said. “But we’ve been having some events that have more people and we have not seen the surge.” Festival organizers have been working with city health officials and RedHawks staff on precautions, said Matt Rau, general manager for the Fargo baseball club. Rau said his staff has passed on its expertise from a month’s worth of games, although the music festival faces an added challenge because the stage is in the outfield and most people will be sitting in lawn chairs. Concert organizer Dan Bredell could not be reached for comment.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:The Ohio Department of Health reported 1,166 new cases of coronavirus in the state Thursday, bringing the total number of cases to 97,471. There were 22 new deaths reported Thursday, increasing the state’s virus death toll to 3,618. Hospitalizations increased by 135, bringing the total number to 11,366. Eighteen more people were admitted to the intensive care units, making the total number 2,627. Hamilton County has been downgraded from the red Level 3 Public Emergency to an orange Level 2, according to the Ohio Public Health Advisory System map. The Level 2 orange designation notes there is “increased exposure and spread” and that residents should “exercise high caution” when outside their homes.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt said that up to $250 million is being made available to cities and counties in Oklahoma to support coronavirus-related expenses. The funding will be distributed based on a city or county’s population based on 2019 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, with about $77 earmarked per capita, Stitt said in a news release. The state received about $1.5 billion in federal funding relief, with about $1.2 billion available as some $300 million was earmarked to cities and counties with populations of more than 500,000.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:There will be no fall sports for high schools in the state this year, the Oregon School Activities Association said. In a major decision, the OSAA is moving the traditional fall sports to March because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic.However, the OSAA left the door open for some schools to compete in the fall if certain districts meet the directives set by Gov. Kate Brown, the Oregon Health Authority and the Oregon Department of Education. The OSAA’s decision still allows for three sports seasons, with the winter season scheduled for January and February, followed by the fall season in March and April, then the spring season in May and June. Each will have a seven-week regular season. “It’s what I was kind of expecting to happen,” Sprague volleyball coach Anne Olsen said. “I’m a huge planner, and I try to plan things way in advance, so I think the unknown was really frustrating for me. It makes me really happy to finally have a plan in place.” In Oregon, high school sports have been shut down since March 12. The shutdown wiped out much of the basketball state tournaments and the entire spring sports season.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg:Gov. Tom Wolf ended his news conference abruptly Thursday by recommending no high school sports in Pennsylvania until Jan. 1. “We should avoid any congregate settings and that means anything that brings people together is going to help that virus get us. We should do everything we can to defeat the virus,” Wolf said when asked about no spectators at Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association events. “The guidance from us, the recommendation is that we don’t do any sports until Jan 1.” The PIAA and District 10 voted recently to move ahead with fall sports on the high school level. Surrounding states have either delayed in the start of the season or have moved contact sports to the spring. The question about fans was posed after a large pushback from parents and fans that spectators would not be allowed at fall high school sporting events. On June 10, Wolf’s office put out guidance that read, “During the Yellow and Green phases of reopening, sports-related activities at the PK-12 level are limited to student athletes, coaches, officials, and staff only.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Starting Sunday, visitors from more than 30 states with high rates of COVID-19 will have to sign a certificate confirming they will abide by the state’s 14-day quarantine if they want to stay at hotels and rental properties in Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo said. Those who refuse to sign the statement – or don’t provide proof of a recent negative coronavirus test – can be denied lodging, she said. Raimondo said the traveler certification is akin to a successful policy implemented by Maine. The new restrictions come as New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts this week added Rhode Island to their lists of states where arriving travelers must self-quarantine, or provide proof they’re not infected with COVID-19. Raimondo said the restrictions imposed by other states will hurt the state’s largely tourism-driven economy, and should serve as a “wake up call” to Rhode Islanders that they need to do better to comply with basic virus safety measures.The state will also be making rapid COVID-19 tests available to Rhode Islanders planning to travel to the states imposing the new restrictions starting this week, she said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Greenville County will use $2 million in coronavirus relief funds to expand child-care options while schools are operating on hybrid schedules. The funding is expected to create temporary capacity for more than 9,400 elementary school children in the county at a time when most students are unlikely to attend school in-person for five days a week, officials said. Greenville First Steps, a nonprofit organization focused on preparing children for school, and the YMCA of Greenville partnered with Greenville County Schools and county officials to craft the plan, which is intended to boost chil-dcare capacity and provide support for families in the county for 10 weeks. “We do not want our parents to have to choose between a job and a child,” said Greenville County administrator Joe Kernell. Typically during the school year, child-care centers have few or no school-aged children during the day but often care for them after school. Derek Lewis, executive director of Greenville First Steps, said the funding will help those centers serve more children throughout the day by giving them grants they can use to boost workforce or buy supplies. The funding will also connect churches and other organizations with licensed child-care providers who can help turn the facilities into temporary child-care centers. The county received $91 million in federal funding from the Coroanvirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. The $2 million is in addition to $1.7 million the county provided child-care centers earlier this summer to help offset costs associated with the pandemic.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: As the coronavirus pandemic affects the Oglala Sioux Tribe, one local community organization is doing everything it can to help people stay at home, fearing that the pandemic could take a disproportionate toll on an elderly population that maintains the language and culture of the tribe. Before the pandemic, the Thunder Valley Community Development Corporation worked to teach the Lakota language to children, as part of a resurgence of Lakota language and culture in recent years. Fewer than 3% of the community is fluent in the language, according to the organization. But as the coronavirus swept across the globe, local leaders feared that the elderly, many who are still fluent in the language, could be killed by COVID-19. “They are the keepers of our language and our knowledge,” said Kyle White, the director of advancement with Thunder Valley. White said the organizataion found that most homes had multiple generations living in them, with one home reporting there were 23 people living there. The organization made a list of the elderly in each community and began delivering cleaning supplies and care packages to help them avoid having to go to the store. Although the pandemic has been marked with isolation for many, Lynn Cuny, the deputy director at Thunder Valley, said the work of assembling and delivering the packages revealed that tribal members could still come together as it did in past generations during smallpox and flu epidemics. “As Lakota people, we’ve been here,” she said. “We’ve endured many pandemics.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville:People who refuse to wear masks in downtown Nashville can now end up behind bars. A man was charged with violating health regulations after authorities said they twice spotted him defying the capital city’s mask order on the same day that police committed to stricter enforcement. Joseph Bryant, 61, was booked into the Davidson County Sheriff’s Office jail at around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, news outlets reported, citing an arrest warrant. Metro Nashville officers first cited him in the popular Broadway area, where he was warned to put a mask on, but walked away without doing so, Metro police spokesman Don Aaron said. Bryant had two masks in his pocket at the time, Aaron added. He was arrested less than two hours later when officers again witnessed him without a mask, and believed the “defiant behavior would continue” if Bryant was only given a second citation, according to Aaron. Bryant had not posted his $500 bond Thursday morning but did have an attorney representing him, according to records obtained by The Tennessean. Nashville’s mask order mandates the use of face coverings in public settings to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. Metro Police Chief Damien Huggins pledged to city council members Wednesday that officers would increase enforcement.\n\nTexas\n\nMissouri City: Nineteen people at a Houston-area nursing home have died because of the coronavirus and 24 employees have been infected, officials said. Missouri City said it received notification Wednesday about the deaths and infections at Paradigm at First Colony Nursing Home after Mayor Yolanda Ford sent a letter to the state health department requesting notice about cases in the city. “The city is concerned about the individuals and families who are affected by the Paradigm cases,” Ford said. There was no answer early Thursday at a telephone listing for the facility. Missouri City officials did not immediately respond to questions about when the deaths occurred. Nursing homes have been hit hard by the pandemic. Residents and staff represent a tiny share of the U.S. population but account for as many as 4 in 10 coronavirus deaths, according to some estimates.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Mayors from Washington County and two of the county’s three commissioners joined together to release a proclamation encouraging face coverings in public while indoors. Signed on July 27, the proclamation is in conjunction with local physicians and the Washington County Commission, which decided to endorse face coverings for the health and safety of county residents. The move is the strongest push yet by local leaders in favor of recommending face coverings. It stops short of supporting a mask mandate, though. Gov. Gary Herbert, while encouraging masks, has not required residents to wear them in public. Several reasons were listed as the justification for the joint proclamation, including the increase of infections, lack of a cure or preventative medication and the risk to those with underlying health conditions. A notably absent signature was that of Victor Iverson, the only one of the three Washington County commissioners who did not sign the proclamation. Iverson said on June 20 that he “will never wear a mask” and although he has acknowledged that COVID-19 is real and an issue to be concerned about, the county commissioner has repeatedly said that people should have the ability to exercise free will in choosing whether to wear a mask.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont’s nonprofit hospitals, which are facing financial challenges because of the coronavirus pandemic, have filed budget requests with the Green Mountain Care Board for the coming fiscal year. The hospitals are asking regulators for increases in charges to achieve operating margins that range between zero and 2.5%. “Each of our hospitals has a unique story to tell but collectively, this request is about ensuring all of them can continue to be there – and ready to care – every minute of every day,” said Jeff Tieman, President and CEO of the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems. He said in less than three months, hospitals lost $221 million, and “even with federal grant dollars of just over $134 million, they lost ground on many fronts in the current fiscal year.” Tieman said, “we must prioritize recovery.” Claudio Fort, president and CEO of Rutland Regional Medical Center, told the Rutland Herald its budget projects that the hospital will not perform as many procedures as last year, partially because COVID screening steps slow the ability to process people through the health care system. To make up for the loss of revenue, Rutland Regional officials have applied for a 6% increase in rates and prices. Public hearings on the hospital budgets are scheduled to start on Aug. 18.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia’s state parks have experienced a surge in visitors during the coronavirus pandemic. But their popularity has led to an increase in littering and alcohol use, as well as environmental damage and people taking dangerous risks to post photos on social media. The Richmond-Times Dispatch reported Thursday that state parks saw 120,000 more visits than they did in June. Melissa Baker, director of Virginia State Parks, said some of the problem could stem from visitors who “don’t understand the purpose of the facility,” though the park system is “very thankful that people are finding us that weren’t our standard users before.” Falling Spring Falls, a scenic waterfall in western Virginia, has been “inundated with visitors.” But some are scaling a security fence and trying to reach the falls to take photos. At Buffalo Mountain Natural Area Preserve in Floyd County, heavy trail use and hikers going off the trail have caused erosion and had an adverse affect on fragile, rare plants. Bull Run Mountains Natural Area Preserves experienced attempted looting of a Civil War-era quarry trench. Cape Charles Natural Area Preserve was closed in July and won’t reopen until at least October because visitors were using a boardwalk to jump onto fragile dunes at the edge of the Chesapeake Bay. The jumping compromised the pilings holding up the boardwalk.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Gov. Jay Inslee said schools in the majority of Washington’s counties should strongly consider online-only learning for students this fall because of COVID-19 and canceling or postponing sports and all other in-person extracurricular activities. Inslee made the announcement with the superintendent of public instruction for Washington and the state’s health officer. “This pandemic will continue to grow unless something changes,” Inslee said, adding if every school district brought all students back “I believe we would see a dangerous increase of COVID activity.” Authorities said the virus is still spreading too extensively in the state, which saw the nation’s first confirmed virus case in late January. Since then, Washington has seen more than 59,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 1,600 deaths. Washington officials broke down their school guidelines - which are recommendations, not requirements - into categories for counties deemed high risk, moderate risk and low risk. For high-risk counties, the state recommends distance learning and no in-person activities. Limited in-person instruction could be considered for high-need students. Twenty-five of the state’s 39 counties are considered high-risk, meaning there are more than 75 cases per 100,000 people, including all three counties in the Seattle metro area. Many schools in the Puget Sound region have already announced plans to start the year with an online-only model. For moderate-risk counties (25 to 75 cases per 100,000) Inslee and others said distance learning should be considered for middle and high school students. In-person learning could be an option for elementary students and those with special needs. Extracurricular activities should also be cancelled. Nine counties are currently listed as moderate risk. In the five, smaller low-risk counties where there are fewer than 25 cases per 100,000 officials recommend a hybrid distance/in-person schedule for older students and in-person learning for elementary school students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said WiFi hot spots will be set up across the state to give students the option to take virtual classes when schools are scheduled to reopen in September. The Republican governor said counties will submit reentry plans this month for the state’s planned school reopening on Sept. 8, adding that he wants to give students and parents “total optionality” whether to attend classes in person or online. “We will absolutely deliver a quality education to them for the time period that they decide not to come to the school,” Justice said. Justice said he has committed $6 million to install more than 1,000 Wifi hot spots at schools, libraries and state parks across the state so students can access online courses when schools restart. The governor also said the state is developing a color-coded system for grading a county’s coronavirus levels “to be able to look at a facility and say ‘this county has this level of the metric and it is beyond what we think is acceptable for all students to be in school.’” Justice said the ability for schools to have sporting events will also hinge on the upcoming color-coded system.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Advocate Aurora Health will stop testing some patients for COVID-19 before surgery and will close all but one of its community testing sites in Wisconsin. The changes are temporary and the result of a shortage of tests, according to the hospital system. It is experiencing a \"delay in anticipated shipments\" of supplies, according to a news release. Advocate Aurora will suspend testing before gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, interventional radiology and selective cardiology procedures. They will provide \"enhanced\" personal protective equipment to medical staff instead. According to an email to employees obtained by the Journal Sentinel, Advocate Aurora Health has not received its last two shipments of 17,000 tests. The system uses about 13,000 tests a week, according to the email, and had a supply of two to three days on hand as of Tuesday. It was working to complete deals with other test providers that would become available Aug. 17. Advocate Aurora has been running drive-up testing at several of its hospitals across the state but began centralizing testing at Aurora Sinai Medical Center in Milwaukee on Thursday. Temporarily closed are testing sites at Aurora Health Care Midtown in Milwaukee as well as the Aurora hospitals in: Oconomowoc, Kenosha, Oshkosh, Two Rivers and Burlington. All previously scheduled appointments at those locations will continue as planned, though.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming will put $7.5 million toward college grants for people who are out of work or underemployed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The money comes from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. Adults ages 25-64 who are affected by the pandemic might qualify, Gov. Mark Gordon said. State officials plan to announce a start date for applying for the funding soon. “These grants will help impacted workers obtain new skills and advance their careers,” Gordon said in a statement. “They will also help Wyoming progress towards its goal of building a highly trained, well-equipped workforce.” Gordon to date has allocated $710 million of $1.25 billion in CARES Act funding allocated to Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/06/15/delaware-beach-guide-locals-guide-rehoboth-lewes-dewey-more/9940503002/", "title": "Delaware beach guide: A local's guide to Rehoboth, Lewes, Dewey ...", "text": "For a long time, Delaware's beach towns seemed to have their own distinct identities definitively carved out.\n\nFamilies and the LGBTQ community ran Rehoboth Beach, hard-charging partiers drank in Dewey Beach and the older crowd at \"Delaware's Quiet Resort\" enjoyed being in bed early in Bethany Beach.\n\nWhile each destination has its own vibe, the walls have mostly come down over the years.

When the Alabama Department of Public Health updated its COVID-19 school dashboard for the first time this school year Friday, three districts stood out with the highest percentage of confirmed cases: Covington, Greene and Marion county schools. All three are rural districts, and about 5% of students in each district have tested positive for the coronavirus. These schools were among only 52 of Alabama’s 137 school districts with available data on the state dashboard. In Marion, most of the 160 reported cases were concentrated in three schools, resulting in temporary closures, said Marion County Superintendent Ann West. “We’re just trying to operate with what’s best for each school,” West said. “I don’t like to send children home because for some of our students, what they get to eat is at school.” Masks are not required in Marion County Schools, but West said the district strongly encourages them. “Certainly, if I were not vaccinated, I would be wearing a mask,” she said. Meanwhile, masks are required in Greene County Schools, which reported 47 COVID-19 cases Friday. Covington County Schools reported 140 cases. According to district protocols, masks are “recommended for all individuals while indoors” and required on school buses.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The Sitka Assembly has authorized a 20-year lease of land to an Alaska Native corporation for development for cruise ship passengers. The Assembly, voting 5-2, approved leasing 17 acres to Shee Atika Inc., which plans to work with another company, Adventure Sitka, to develop the land with attractions such as zip lines, a salmon bake and a canoe launch, the Daily Sitka Sentinel reports. The land is between the ferry terminal and Sitka Sound Cruise Terminal. Chris McGraw, who owns the terminal and manages Adventure Sitka, said development of the property will be an important part of handling an expected large number of tourists. “The key to over-tourism is good distribution of guests,” McGraw said at an Assembly meeting. Karl Potts, CEO of Shee Atika Inc., said the lease would generate $300,000 to $400,000 a year for the city. Assembly member Kevin Knox raised questions about staffing at the site, citing difficulties businesses are having this year with hiring staff. But he said he would vote “yes” because of an expected influx of passengers next year. “We don’t have a lot of options here,” he said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The FBI’s Public Corruption unit is investigating efforts by Gov. Doug Ducey’s past and current staffers – including one who is now a federal judge – to push for a closed-door deal to issue tax refunds worth as much as $100million to aid one of Ducey’s campaign supporters. Grant Nulle, former deputy director at the Department of Revenue, said an FBI agent contacted him in mid-July, shortly after an Arizona Republic investigation uncovered how the Ducey administration had pushed the department to agree to refund sales taxes on fuel for mining companies, even though that tax had been in place for decades. The companies that stood to benefit were represented by Texas tax firm Ryan LLC, founded by Ducey supporter G. Brint Ryan. The top three deputies in Ducey’s administration left their government jobs and went to work for Ryan to push for the tax refund. The men and others working for Ducey met with Revenue officials at least 16 times to insist that the department – which was under their oversight in the governor’s office – agree to stop opposing Ryan and issue a tax refund to one fuel company. That, officials said, would have triggered refunds in all other similar cases, costing the state’s general fund more than $100 million.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of COVID-19 patients on a ventilator climbed to a new high Monday as the state reported 33 new coronavirus deaths amid the summer surge driven by the highly contagious delta variant. The Department of Health reported the state’s COVID-19 patients on ventilators rose by 17 to 361, surpassing the high the state had set last week. The state’s virus hospitalizations remained unchanged from a day earlier at 1,257. There are 533 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units around the state. The department reported there are 21 available ICU beds in Arkansas, though it’s not clear how many of those are equipped for COVID-19 patients. Last week the state ran out of ICU beds for virus patients, though availability has slightly eased since then. The state’s COVID-19 death toll rose Monday to 6,912 since the pandemic began. It also added 882 new virus cases. Arkansas ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. The Department of Health reported that the number of active cases among students and staff in the state’s public schools has grown to 3,684. Cabot, Fort Smith, Springdale, Rogers and Bentonville schools each reported more than 100 active cases.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Legislature on Monday voted to guarantee people can call out their bosses publicly in most harassment and discrimination cases. When companies settle complaints filed by their employees, the agreements often include a provision barring the employee from disparaging the company or talking publicly about what happened. These agreements came under fire during the #MeToo movement, criticized as shielding public figures and companies from responsibility in sexual harassment cases. California passed a law in 2018 that bans these nondisclosure agreements in cases involving sexual harassment, discrimination or assault. The Democratic-dominated Legislature voted Monday to expand that law to include other types of harassment and discrimination, including claims based on race, religion, gender identity and sexual orientation. The bill now heads to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who must decide whether to sign it into law. “No worker should ever be silenced from speaking out about their own experience of harassment or discrimination in the workplace,” said Sen. Connie Leyva, D-Chino, author of the bill. “For far too long, these secret settlements and agreements have reinforced a culture of secrecy that prevents accountability, respect and justice.”\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A former police officer involved in the rough arrest of an elderly woman with dementia should stand trial for assault, a judge ruled Monday. District Judge Michelle Brinegar said there is probable cause for the charge against former Loveland police Officer Austin Hopp, who will be arraigned in late September, the Loveland Reporter-Herald reports. Hopp arrested Karen Garner in June 2020 after she left a store without paying for about $14 worth of items. His body camera footage shows him catching up to the woman as she walks through a field along a road. Gardner, now 74, shrugs and turns away from him, and he quickly grabs her arm and pushes her 80-pound body to the ground. A federal lawsuit filed on Garner’s behalf, which included images from the body camera footage, claims that Hopp dislocated her shoulder by shoving her handcuffed left arm forward onto the hood of his patrol car and that she was denied medical treatment for about six hours. Former Loveland police Officer Daria Jalali is facing several charges stemming from the arrest, including failing to intervene in the use of excessive force.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: More than 1,500 long-term unemployed residents who recently found jobs are being awarded $1,000 bonuses under the first round of the Back to Work CT program, an initiative funded with federal COVID-19 relief funds. Approximately $10 million has been allocated for the program, which will provide bonus payments for up to 10,000 eligible applicants through Dec. 31. “Many workers who were displaced during the early months in the pandemic and faced long-term unemployment are now transitioning back into the workforce and starting to rebuild,” Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday in a statement. “This one-time bonus payment will help some of those workers pay for the critical things they need to get back to work, including childcare.” To be eligible for the program, applicants must obtain and maintain a full-time job for eight consecutive weeks between May 30 and Dec. 31. Applicants must complete and submit an application electronically to the Department of Revenue Services.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A state trooper who received several traffic commendations has been indicted for a fraudulent traffic warning scheme in which at least two of his victims were fellow law enforcement officers, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Tuesday. Cpl. Edwin Ramirez, who was stationed at Troop 9, was charged with misdemeanor and felony tampering with public records; issuing a false certificate, a felony; and official misconduct, a misdemeanor. If convicted, he faces up to nine years in prison. Delaware State Police contacted prosecutors in May, according to the justice department, after an internal review found “a serious pattern of fraudulent E-Warnings” by Ramirez. The review began April 30 after one of his supervisors found discrepancies in an accident report, prosecutors said. Ramirez was immediately suspended. According to the indictment, after finding the discrepancy, the supervisor began looking at Ramirez’s activity and compared instances in which E-Warnings and E-Tickets were issued to dashcam footage to determine whether the stop had occurred and if so, what had been issued. In April alone, Ramirez issued more than 30 fraudulent warnings, according to the justice department. In some cases, motorists were not informed of the warnings. In other instances, a traffic stop never happened.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Landon Collins, safety for the Washington Football Team, took some time away from the field Monday to bring joy to young football players, WUSA-TV reports. Collins surprised players at the D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation’s Woodbridge Warriors Youth Football Team at a Dick’s Sporting Goods store in Northeast D.C. Each member of the team got a $150 Dick’s Sporting Goods gift card to use however they wanted. Collins served as their personal shopping consultant. The kids, surprised and excited to spend time with the star player, grabbed new shoes and other football gear. “It just feels great for him to come down here and spend his time with us, just so we can have a surprise and get us ready,” one player said Collins said the opportunity to spend time with the kids was a blessing. “Being around these kids to give them a smile on their face and to put something on their shoulders that they can use on and off the football field is amazing,” Collins said.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State education officials on Monday began to make good on threats to withhold funding from school districts that defied Gov. Ron DeSantis’ ban on mask mandates, despite a circuit judge last week ruling the ban unconstitutional. Commissioner of Education Richard Corcoran announced that the Florida Department of Education has withheld an amount equal to monthly school board member salaries in Alachua and Broward counties, as directed by the State Board of Education. Funds will continue to be withheld until the districts comply, Corcoran said. Broward County Interim Superintendent Vickie Cartwright said in a statement that Broward County School Board believes it is in compliance with the law. “The health and safety of our students, teachers and staff continue to be our main priorities,” Cartwright said. “As such, BCPS (Broward County Public Schools) will continue to mandate masks, knowing the data shows they help minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our schools.” DeSantis, a Republican who is eyeing a possible presidential run in 2024, had been threatening to impose financial penalties on school boards for weeks. Democratic President Joe Biden has said if that happened, federal money would be used to cover any costs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State lawmakers will use the same guidelines as in 2010 to redraw congressional, legislative and other electoral districts, meaning lawmakers are not required to give members of the public an advance look at the plans, nor consider whether districts give candidates from different political parties a meaningful chance to win. Identical guidelines were presented to both House and Senate redistricting committees Monday. The House voted to adopt the guidelines, while senators gave preliminary agreement, with a final vote likely on the first day of a special session expected in October or November. Asked about whether maps would be released in advance, Senate Majority Leader John Kennedy emphasized the shortened time period because of delays in U.S. census data stemming from COVID-19. In 2010, state legislative maps were unveiled the Friday before the redistricting special session began. “We’re obviously operating under a very short period of time compared to what they had to this previously,” said Kennedy, R-Macon. Advance notice of maps is one of the key objectives for which outside groups have been lobbying. “Georgians need to have access to the maps and know how and when the maps will be presented,” said Jerry Gonzalez, CEO of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health care officials are concerned about a shortage of oxygen as the state’s coronavirus surge continues to grow. Hospital officials are canceling nonemergency procedures that require oxygen in an attempt to conserve supplies, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. There is a global shortage of oxygen containers that are needed for transport to the islands, said Hilton Raethel, president and CEO of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, a trade group for the state’s hospitals and nursing homes. “The combined demand has increased to the point where we are concerned about whether we can generate enough oxygen in Hawaii to meet all the needs of our health care facilities,” Raethel said. Hawaii’s two oxygen plants have switched to producing medical gas only. Raethel said mainland tank orders are backlogged for months. Hawaii Pacific Health, which oversees several hospitals in the state, directed staff to cancel elective procedures where oxygen is needed. “We do not plan to defer any emergency surgery, and we will need to have careful consideration of cases that are urgent but not emergent,” Hawaii Pacific Health President and CEO Ray Vara said in a staff memo. “Any cases that can be deferred safely should be deferred until the oxygen supply solutions are clearer.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: An environmental group that wants to end public-land grazing has outbid a rancher for a grazing lease on state land that includes habitat for bull trout and steelhead. Western Watersheds Project’s bid of $8,200 won the 20-year grazing lease on 620 acres in central Idaho’s Sawtooth Valley in Custer County. The group and the Idaho Cattle Association say it’s possible other state grazing leases could be sought by other environmental groups. Western Watersheds will also have to pay an annual $800 fee based on the number of sheep or cattle authorized for the allotment. “That’s still a screaming deal,” said Erik Molvar, executive director of Western Watersheds Project, noting that private-land grazing fees are about three times that much. “Certainly, at those prices, the parcel is a lot more valuable for conservation than it is for grazing livestock.” Molvar said the group will not graze livestock but instead convert the grazing lease into a conservation lease and allow the area to be used by wildlife, notably a herd of 50 pronghorn that frequent the area. Elk and bighorn sheep are also in the region. He also said sections of two streams running through the parcel, Fourth of July Creek and Champion Creek, will be protected. The new lease takes effect Jan. 1.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A white police officer has been placed on administrative duty as the city’s police oversight agency investigates his struggle with a Black woman who was walking her dog in a lakefront park. Police Superintendent David Brown on Monday directed that the officer be placed on paid desk duty while what happened over the weekend is investigated, the department said. Attorneys for the woman allege the encounter became violent and was an “obvious case of racial profiling.” The Civilian Office of Police Accountability said Monday that it reviewed the officer’s body camera video and recommended he either be placed on administrative duty or be relieved of his police power while it investigates. “If violations did occur, COPA will hold the officer accountable,” interim chief Andrea Kersten said. A law office representing Nikkita Brown said she was near the lakefront with her dog about 12:10 a.m. Saturday when a police officer approached her for being in the area after the park was closed. In a video recorded by a bystander, the woman and her dog appear to be walking away from the officer as he follows closely, and at one point she turns around with her phone in her hand and stops. Moments later, the officer appears to reach for her phone and then grabs Brown.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s health commissioner defended herself Monday against criticism arising from a photograph circulating on social media showing her not wearing a face mask during a wedding reception. Dr. Kristina Box said in a statement that she “made an informed decision” to take off her mask while dancing or talking at a recent family wedding with guests fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Box said all but five people at the wedding were fully vaccinated. Several social media comments called Box’s actions hypocritical, as she said Friday that Indiana had reached “the darkest time in the pandemic” amid a surge in infections and hospitalizations and urged more people to get COVID-19 shots and wear masks. The photo shows Box standing amid several people, none of whom are wearing masks. Box said in her statement that federal guidelines call for people to wear masks at indoor public places when in areas of “high or sustained transmission.” “I continue to wear my mask in these settings and encourage Hoosiers to do the same,” Box said. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb apologized in May 2020 after posing for a photo with two people in which none of the three wore masks inside a Brown County restaurant, a day after recommending mask-wearing.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A man was sentenced to life in prison without parole Monday in the abduction and killing of University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, three years after she disappeared while out for an evening run. Judge Joel Yates’ sentence for Cristhian Bahena Rivera was mandatory for a first-degree murder conviction in Iowa, which does not have the death penalty. The 27-year-old former farmhand, who testified that he came to the U.S. illegally from Mexico as a teenager, has been jailed since his arrest in August 2018. Yates pointedly rejected defense claims that others were responsible for the crime. “Mr. Bahena Rivera, you and you alone forever changed the lives of those who loved Mollie Tibbetts,” he said. The sentence caps a case that inflamed anger over illegal immigration, fueled fears about violence against solo female runners, and took several noteworthy twists during and after Bahena Rivera’s trial in May. Tibbetts’ mother, Laura Calderwood, addressed Bahena Rivera in a victim impact statement read to the court. “Mollie was a young woman who simply wanted to go for a quiet run on the evening of July 18 and you chose to violently and sadistically end that life,” she wrote.\n\nKansas\n\nMission: Former Gov. Jeff Colyer announced Monday that he is dropping out of the 2022 race for governor after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. “While I have always focused on helping others, for the next few weeks I am going to focus on my health,” said Colyer, a physician who served as governor for a little less than a year in 2018. In his announcement, Colyer said he was endorsing Attorney General Derek Schmidt in the governor’s race. Colyer had been Schmidt’s main rival for the Republican nomination to challenge Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s reelection. Schmidt wished Colyer “all the best in overcoming his current health challenges” in a statement and said that “now is the time to come together to elect a Republican governor for Kansas next year.” In a tweet, Kelly wished Colyer “a quick recovery.” “Colyer and I may have our disagreements. But one thing we can all agree on: the need to defeat cancer,” she wrote on Twitter. Colyer was elevated from lieutenant governor in January 2018, when GOP Gov. Sam Brownback resigned to become U.S. ambassador at large for international religious freedom. Colyer narrowly lost the 2018 Republican primary to polarizing conservative Kris Kobach, who alienated moderate GOP and independent voters and lost to Kelly that November.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The governor signaled Monday that he wants to convene a special legislative session to deal with COVID-19 issues once a “general consensus” is reached on what can be achieved. Gov. Andy Beshear said the special session needs to happen soon in part to maintain the state of emergency he declared at the outset of the pandemic in Kentucky. And there are pressing coronavirus-related issues stemming from school closures due to surging outbreaks, he said. The governor has the authority to call lawmakers into special session and to set the agenda. Beshear, a Democrat, has had discussions with leaders of the Republican-led Legislature over what actions could be taken if lawmakers are brought back to the statehouse. Those negotiations come as Kentucky suffers its worst surge of virus cases and hospitalizations since the pandemic began. Various emergency measures previously issued by Beshear are set to expire as a result of a recent landmark court decision. It’s up to lawmakers to decide whether to keep them in place. Kentucky had more new cases of COVID-19 last week than any other week in the pandemi, and on Monday reported another record number of hospitalized coronavirus patients. The highly contagious delta variant is spreading fastest among school-age Kentuckians, the governor said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A storied jazz site where a young Louis Armstrong once worked toppled when Ida blew through the state as one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the U.S. The Karnofsky Tailor Shop, where a Jewish family employed Armstrong, collapsed Sunday during the storm. Armstrong would play a small tin horn as he worked on the coal and junk wagons, according to the National Park Service. The business opened downtown in 1913 and had a residence above it where the late jazz legend would often eat meals. The family, who provided Armstrong a “second home,” lent him money to buy his first cornet. “Louis said it was the Karnofskys that instilled the love of singing in his heart,” jazz historian and retired photojournalist John McCusker said, according to WWL-TV. Morris Karnofsky, the family’s son and Armstrong’s childhood friend, opened the city’s first jazz record shop on that same street, according to the park service. Armstrong would visit Morris Music when he returned to New Orleans after moving away. When daylight came Monday morning, all that was left was a pile of bricks and other remnants of the historic site.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The lobster fishing industry will face a host of new harvesting restrictions amid a new push from the federal government to try to save a vanishing species of whale. The new rules, which have loomed over the profitable lobster industry for years and were announced Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, are designed to protect the North Atlantic right whale. The whales number only about 360 and are vulnerable to lethal entanglement in fishing gear. NOAA said it expects the new rules will result in a nearly 70% reduction of the risk of death and serious injuries the whales can suffer from entanglement. The rules had long been expected to focus on reducing the number of vertical ropes in the water, and they will. The rules reduce the number of rope lines that link buoys to lobster and crab traps, NOAA said. The rules will also require the use of weaker ropes so whales can more easily break free if they do become entangled, the agency said. NOAA said the rules also expand the areas of ocean where fishing with trap rope is prohibited or limited. Members of the lobster fishing industry have said strict new rules could make it difficult to get lobsters to consumers.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Organizers of the 80th National Folk Festival say they’re adding a fourth stage at this year’s festival, the Maryland Traditions Family Folklife Stage. The festival is slated to return to downtown Salisbury on Sept. 10-12 for the third year of its residency in the Eastern Shore city. Supported by Maryland Traditions, the traditional arts program of the Maryland State Arts Council, the Maryland Traditions Family Folklife Area & Stage at the 80th National Folk Festival celebrates and showcases the rich, living traditions of Maryland. The area shines a spotlight on the distinctive music, rituals, crafts, occupations, foodways and other traditions at the heart of Maryland heritage, expressing both the state’s deep history and its evolving character. Performances, demonstrations, displays, exhibits, and narrative presentations by Maryland master artisans and performers explore a wide range of cultural traditions, including those of its First Peoples, the cultural legacies of European settlers, and the expressions of the newest Maryland residents whose cultural roots come from around the globe.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Hundreds of students at Amherst College are pushing back against what they call the school’s overly restrictive coronavirus protocols that include double-masking indoors, restrictions on off-campus activities, and no in-person campus dining. In a letter sent to President Carolyn “Biddy” Martin a week ago, the students said that “the guidelines are not based on any given data, have been developed without student input, are significantly stricter than our peer institutions, and are in conflict with (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines.” The restrictions originally announced Aug. 24 and designed in response to the spread of the delta variant apply to the first two weeks of the fall semester, which began Monday. The prestigious private liberal arts college celebrating its 200th anniversary this year had already mandated COVID-19 vaccinations. In response to the pushback, Martin wrote another campuswide email Aug. 27. “We are in the midst of a surge, and you are arriving on campus from all over the country and the world, including from delta hotspots,” she said, adding later: “Now is not yet the time to relax key restrictions.” She did, however, amend a near-universal outdoor mask mandate, calling it “unworkable.”\n\nMichigan\n\nRoyal Oak: Some animals are rolling up their fur for COVID-19 shots at the Detroit Zoo. The zoo in suburban Detroit said its gorillas, chimpanzees, tigers and lions are getting a vaccine developed by Zoetis, a veterinary drug company, and authorized by the U.S. Agriculture Department. Other animals will follow. “We’re both thankful and relieved a special vaccine is now available to protect against COVID-19,” said Scott Carter, the zoo’s chief life sciences officer. “The animals routinely get other vaccinations.” The zoo said no COVID-19 infections have been found in its animals. Anti-vaccine advocates have aggressively criticized other zoos nationwide that have administered the shots to their animals. But the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has said it supports the animal vaccines, which “have been clinically tested and administered to animals only after deep consideration by veterinary professionals.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state has reached 300 traffic accident deaths before Labor Day for the first time in more than a decade, prompting state public safety officials on Monday to issue a plea for people to slow down. The state reported its 300th fatality Saturday – the earliest the state has eclipsed that threshold since 2007, according to data from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety’s Office of Traffic Safety. There were 240 traffic deaths in the state at this time last year, and the state did not reach 300 until October. Officials attributed 103 of the deaths, or about 40%, to speeding, compared to 78 at this time last year. “This many preventable deaths on Minnesota roads before Labor Day is completely unacceptable,” said Office of Traffic Safety Director Mike Hanson. “It’s not a homework assignment; you don’t get a do-over. We all need to drive smart to keep our family, friends and neighbors alive.” Nearly three-fourths of all victims were male, with the majority between 21 and 30 years old. Alcohol-related deaths stand at 74, which is down from 88 at this time last year and 136 in 2011. Drunken driving-related deaths comprised 20% of all traffic fatalities in 2020 compared to more than half in the 1960s. State officials say the lower numbers are due in large part to extra impaired driving enforcement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker said Tuesday that he is feeling well, less than two weeks after being diagnosed with COVID-19. “To everyone who has asked, I have recovered fully from my bout with COVID-19, and I have a clean bill of health,” Wicker posted on Twitter. “I am looking forward to resuming my travel in the state this week.” Wicker, 70, is one of three senators who announced Aug. 19 that they had tested positive for the coronavirus. Wicker, independent Sen. Angus King, 77, of Maine, and Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper, 69, of Colorado, had all been fully vaccinated. All three have recommended that people get their shots. Wicker wrote Tuesday: “Being fully vaccinated greatly reduced my risk of developing severe complications from the virus. Getting the shot is safe, easy, and free, and it could save your life.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A judge on Tuesday refused to reinstate federal unemployment benefits that were cut in June when Gov. Mike Parson pulled out of several programs, saying the court “would not substitute its judgment” for that of the governor. The ruling by Cole County Circuit Judge Jon Beetem came a day after lawyers representing Missouri residents who lost the jobless benefits asked for reinstatement with back pay that, for some people, could have amounted to $1,500. The enhanced benefits from several federal programs added money to the unemployment checks for out-of-work Americans to help ease the crunch caused by shutdowns for the COVID-19 pandemic. But some Republican governors, including Parson, ended the benefits, saying they wanted to prod people to rejoin the workforce. In his four-page ruling denying a preliminary injunction, Beteem wrote that “the balancing of harms and the public interest strongly favor the Governor’s decision to promote economic recovery and encourage workers’ re-entry into Missouri’s critically understaffed labor force.” Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt said in a statement that the ruling “affirmed the legality of Governor Parson’s decision to terminate these temporary benefits and will hopefully lead to the hiring of workers for businesses that desperately need the help.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte has announced a rule encouraging schools to give parents final say on whether children should wear masks in schools, after several large school districts implemented mask requirements for all students. Gianforte, a Republican, made the announcement Tuesday after the U.S. Department of Education on Monday opened civil rights investigations into five Republican-led states that have banned or limited mask requirements in schools, saying the policies could amount to discrimination against students with disabilities or health conditions. Gianforte said in a statement that masking in schools, which is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, is “based on inconclusive research.” He also said masking could have adverse impacts on children’s “health, wellbeing and development.” The CDC issued its guidance in light of the rapid spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The rule says schools should consider “parental concerns” when adopting mask mandates and provide parents the ability to opt out of health-related mandates for a wide array of reasons including physical and mental health, developmental needs, religious beliefs and moral convictions.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The number of COVID-19 cases in the state has increased in each of the past ten weeks, and the total nearly doubled over the past two weeks as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread. Nebraska reported 5,006 new cases for the week ending Friday, according to an Omaha World-Herald analysis of data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That’s up from 3,755 the previous week and nearly double the 2,668 cases recorded the week before. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has also risen over the past two weeks from 190 new cases per day Aug. 15 to 715.14 new cases per day Sunday. “Those numbers speak for themselves,” said Dr. James Lawler, a co-executive director of the University of Nebraska Medical Center’s Global Center for Health Security. “We’re going up, and we’re following in the footsteps of the Southern states that saw increasing cases before us. And we’ll continue that way unless something dramatic happens.” The state said 323 people were hospitalized with the virus in the state as of Thursday. Last week, Gov. Pete Ricketts ordered all the state’s hospitals to delay elective surgeries, if possible, to help free up capacity, but he resisted taking other measures to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: City officials say they’ll use a $50,000 grant from the National Park Service to fund research about five decades of segregation, civil rights activism and advocacy in the historic West Las Vegas neighborhood. An announcement Monday said the project aims to focus on the years 1930 through 1979 in what amounted to the city’s segregated Black community. The goal is to determine what buildings and properties could be included on the National Register of Historic Places and listed on the city’s Historic Property Register. The funds to Las Vegas are part of nearly $750,000 nationwide allocated under the park service’s Underrepresented Community Grant Program, the city statement said. The city Historic Preservation Office submitted the grant request, and the city will issue a request for proposals for contracts with experienced cultural resources consultants to prepare the survey and inventory.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A milestone anniversary for the New Hampshire Film Festival is again being pushed back a year due to COVID-19. Announced Monday, the 20th annual NHFF will have to wait another year because of the pandemic. The celebration was originally scheduled for October 2020, then delayed to October 2021. Now it’s planned for 2022. An autumn tradition in Portsmouth, which has hosted the festival since 2004 after its debut in Derry three years before, the festival said it would be unable to keep up with new health and safety protocols seen in art venues and community events across the country “due to the scale and scope” of an event spread across several days and multiple venues. “We are upset to find ourselves in this extremely difficult position, but our deeper concern lies with the filmmakers, attendees, supporters, partners and sponsors who continue to struggle with the ongoing pandemic,” NHFF executive director Nicole Gregg said in a statement. Celebrating newer filmmakers and directors, as well as more experienced screenwriters and actors, the NHFF is a four-day fall event that typically draws crowds for film showings, question-and-answer sessions with film producers and actors, and receptions and parties at downtown restaurants.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBerkeley Township: A young lifeguard was killed, and seven other people, including three other lifeguards, were injured when lightning struck a Jersey Shore beach Monday afternoon, authorities said. It marked the second death of a young lifeguard at the Jersey Shore in a little over a week. Ocean County Sheriff Michael Mastronardy said the others were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not considered life-threatening. “Our hearts are with the family and friends of the young lifeguard killed by today’s horrific lightning strike on the beach in Berkeley Township, and we pray for a full recovery for those injured,” Gov. Phil Murphy wrote on Twitter. “I’ve spoken to Mayor Carmen Amato and offered the full support and assistance of our administration during this difficult time.” Amato said his township’s beaches will be closed Tuesday through Thursday as crisis counselors are made available to beach staff and lifeguards. Four of those struck were lifeguards, and four others were beachgoers. “This is a tragic and heartbreaking day for our town and the entire Jersey Shore,” Amato said in a statement. “This young person was out there every day protecting the lives of others. Our lifeguard teams, like so many along the shore, develop special connections with our community throughout the summer, which makes this loss even greater.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest electric provider wants to transfer its share of a coal-fired power plant to an energy company backed by the Navajo Nation, but environmentalists argue that approving the deal would prolong the life of the plant and run counter to New Mexico’s renewable energy goals. The state Public Regulation Commission will determine whether Public Service Co. of New Mexico’s plan for Four Corners Power Plant is in the public interest during a two-week hearing that began Tuesday. It heard from the public Monday. Some of those who spoke at the virtual meeting Monday choked back tears when talking about pollution emitted by the plant over the decades, while others spoke about how their jobs at the power plant and coal mine helped to put their children through college. Some tribal members told regulators that all levels of Navajo leadership are behind the proposal. They said allowing the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. to take over the utility’s stake in Four Corners would provide more time for the tribe to find ways to deal with significant economic consequences that will come when the plant closes in 2031. If regulators don’t approve PNM’s plan, the Navajo Nation could lose up to $60 million annually, said LoRenzo Bates, former speaker of the Navajo Nation Council.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Resigning from office probably didn’t end former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s legal problems, and no matter what happens next, taxpayers are likely to wind up with a hefty bill. The state has already agreed to pay up to $9.5 million to lawyers representing and investigating Cuomo and his administration over sexual harassment allegations and other matters, according to a review of available contracts. That figure represents the maximum amount that could be spent, not actual bills submitted so far. It doesn’t include the legal fees of Cuomo’s private attorney, whose bills are being paid by his campaign committee. His successor, Gov. Kathy Hochul, can decide whether the state will continue to pay lawyers to defend Cuomo and his administration going forward. Cuomo and the administration face the possibility of civil lawsuits from women who have accused the Democrat of sexual harassment. The state attorney general is looking into Cuomo’s use of state employees to help with a book he wrote. Federal prosecutors are investigating his administration’s handling of nursing home death data. He’s also facing a state ethics commission inquiry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed a bill Monday that would do away with the permit someone must obtain from a county sheriff before buying a pistol, turning back a key agenda item of conservative gun rights supporters. Cooper’s veto was expected, and an override will be difficult for Republicans who control the General Assembly, since they lack veto-proof majorities in the House and Senate. Only two Democrats – both in the House – voted for doing away with the pistol purchase permitting system, which goes back more than 100 years. Cooper supports more gun-sale restrictions, not less, and his office expressed his opposition to the bill the day after the final legislative vote this month. “Gun permit laws reduce gun homicides and suicides and reduce the availability of guns for criminal activity,” Cooper said in a news release Monday. “At a time of rising gun violence, we cannot afford to repeal a system that works to save lives. The legislature should focus on combating gun violence instead of making it easier for guns to end up in the wrong hands.” Bill supporters said the current process has become duplicative with the comprehensive national checks that licensed gun dealers must conduct. The North Carolina Sheriffs’ Association backed the repeal this year after opposing it previously.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit by the state of Missouri seeking to stop a project that would supply Missouri River water to central North Dakota. The Bismarck Tribune reports the ruling will enable the federal Bureau of Reclamation to move ahead with a water service contract for the Central North Dakota Water Supply Project. The project will receive water from the McClusky Canal for systems in Burleigh, Sheridan, Wells, Foster, Kidder, McLean and Stutsman counties. The Missouri suit alleged violations of federal policy, including failure by project developers to properly study the project’s environmental impacts and its alternatives. U.S. District Judge Nanette Laughrey ruled against Missouri on all counts. The state of Missouri “doesn’t like any depletion from the Missouri River,” said Merri Mooridian, deputy manager of the Red River Valley Water Supply Program, which will move Missouri River water by underground pipeline from Washburn east to supply systems in the east and central parts of the state. The Central North Dakota Water Supply Project will use the same pipeline, taking nearly 13 million gallons a day. “The state of North Dakota has the right to flows of the Missouri River in the state of North Dakota,” Mooridian said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A Common Pleas judge has rescinded his order that a man sentenced for a felony drug charge get vaccinated against COVID-19 within two months as a condition of his probation. Speaking at a hearing Tuesday, Judge Christopher Wagner told Brandon Rutherford that it’s not a judge’s role to make decisions for him or “teach you to be a better person.” The reversal came nearly a month after Wagner had sentenced Rutherford. At the time, Wagner told Rutherford he presumed he hadn’t been vaccinated because he was wearing a mask in court, which Rutherford confirmed, telling the judge he wasn’t worried about the vaccine. Neither Rutherford nor his attorney, Carl Lewis, objected to the vaccination order during the sentencing, but soon afterward Rutherford expressed concerns about the directive. Lewis said Tuesday that his 21-year-old client has concerns about the vaccine and will not get it within two months. Lewis had argued that a judge doesn’t have the power or authority to order someone to be inoculated.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A bill approved by the Republican-led Legislature this year that seeks to crack down on protesters is unconstitutional and would chill the ability of groups to mobilize people to advocate for racial justice, a civil rights group argues in a federal lawsuit filed Monday. The Oklahoma chapter of the NAACP filed the lawsuit in federal court in Oklahoma City, along with the national NAACP, the nation’s oldest civil rights organization, and the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown University Law Center. The lawsuit argues the law, which takes effect Nov. 1, was written to discourage peaceful demonstrations and violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantee the right of the public to peacefully assemble and give citizens equal protection under the law. The new law increases the penalties for blocking roadways, grants motorists civil and criminal immunity if they kill or injure someone while fleeing from a riot, and authorizes hefty fines for national organizations that coordinate with those found guilty of committing crimes under the state’s rioting statutes.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: City employees must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 – or obtain a medical or religious exemption – by the middle of October, or they will be fired. “With COVID-19 filling hospitals and claiming lives, we must do everything within our power to end this pandemic and restore our community’s health,” Mayor Ted Wheeler and all four City Commissioners wrote Monday in a letter to municipal workers. The city will require its approximately 6,800 employees to submit proof of vaccination, show they are in the process of being vaccinated, or apply for an exemption by Sept. 10 and be fully vaccinated or granted an exemption by Oct. 18. Those who fail to meet the deadline “will be put on a list for separation from employment,” according to the letter. The city plans to provide a comprehensive outline of the new policy later this week and to answer whatever questions municipal workers might have. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that earlier this month, Multnomah County imposed a vaccine mandate on its employees, and Gov. Kate Brown has announced similar requirements for all teachers, health care workers and state employees across Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Masks will be required in all public and private schools, as well as child care facilities, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Tuesday, reversing course amid a statewide COVID-19 resurgence that is filling hospital beds just as students return to class. The Department of Health order will take effect Tuesday, Sept. 7 – a week or more after the start of school in many districts – and will require students, teachers and staff to wear masks when inside, regardless of vaccination status, the Wolf administration said. The order will not apply to student-athletes while they’re playing, nor to outdoor activities. “Wearing a mask in school is necessary to keep our children in the classroom and to keep COVID out of that classroom,” Wolf said at a news conference Tuesday. The Pennsylvania School Boards Association said the decision on masking should have been left to local school officials, but it would nevertheless remind school districts “of their legal obligation related to the directive.” Less than a month ago, Wolf had ruled out a statewide mask mandate for schools after requiring them last year. But the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus has changed the administration’s calculus about what is needed to keep students in class.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The union that represents nurses at the state’s only Level 1 trauma hospital is calling on its parent company to increase the pay of nurses who have been on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. The United Nurses and Allied Professionals union on Tuesday delivered a petition with more than 2,000 signatures to Lifespan Corp., which operates Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. Lifespan, the state’s largest health care organization, has already increased compensation for nurses at some of its other hospitals. “We provide a critical component of patient care in Rhode Island, yet during this unprecedented health crisis, Lifespan seems to have forgotten about us,” Frank Sims, a Rhode Island Hospital nurse and union president, said in a statement. “While the nurses at Miriam Hospital and Newport Hospital are being recognized for their front line service with appropriate compensation increases during this crisis, Lifespan has refused to do the same for Rhode Island Hospital nurses.” A Lifespan spokesperson said the system provides nurses with “highly competitive wage and benefits packages.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A private college is allowing men to live on campus for the first time since it was founded 167 years ago. About 45 men moved into a dorm set aside for them at Columbia College this month, media outlets report. College officials said last year that they decided to bring men to what had been an all-women college because enrollment had fallen 25% in the past decade. “Most women now are looking for a co-educational experience. Also, we really believe the opportunity that we provide and the environment we have is a good one for men to grow. And so it’s expanding our outreach to men of course but also to a broader group of women,” said Columbia College President Tom Bogart, who took over as leader of the school in October. Jordan Wright was one of the first men to move into the Columbia College dorms. “I feel like it’s a good experience,” Wright said. “It’s a new beginning and new blessings. I know it’s a little different now, but I feel like everything is still going to go good with the boys and girls, even though it’s a new thing.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Tuesday that she has activated nine soldiers from the state National Guard to help with coronavirus testing in the western part of the state amid a surge of infections. “This past week, I had conversations with all three South Dakota hospital systems and asked them what they needed as cases start to rise again,” she said in a statement. “Monument asked for the National Guard to assist them in their testing efforts, and we are happy to help.” Over the past two weeks, the average number of infections has tripled statewide. The western part of the state has been the hardest-hit, with Meade County, which hosted the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally earlier this month, leading the state in new cases per capita. The Department of Health reported last week that it had traced 63 cases among rallygoers. Meanwhile, COVID-19 hospitalizations statewide reached 216 – the largest number since January. Two deaths were also reported Tuesday, bringing the total death toll of people with COVID-19 in the state to 2,069. The health department said Pennington County had more than twice as many new COVID-19 cases in the prior day than any other county in the state. Noem activated the National Guard last year to prepare field hospitals for a surge in patients, but the hospitals were not utilized.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The snail darter, a tiny fish that notoriously blocked a federal dam project in the state decades ago, should no longer be on the endangered species list, federal officials announced Tuesday. Arguing that the fish is no longer in danger of extinction, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has begun the process to delist the species, a move backed by the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group that has favored lifting protections for the fish since 2019. “Thanks to the persistence of many people, the extinction of the snail darter was ultimately avoided, and today we can celebrate its recovery,” said Zygmunt Plater, the attorney who wrote the citizens’ petition to save the snail darter in 1975. Snail darters, a member of the perch family, grow up to 3.5 inches long and mostly eat freshwater snails. Shortly after the passage of the landmark 1973 Endangered Species Act, construction of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Tellico Dam in eastern Tennessee threatened the habitat of the newly discovered fish, located just above the site of the project. The case eventually made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, marking the first time the nation’s highest court took up an ESA case. In 1978, the court ruled in favor of protections for the fish and halted work on the nearly completed dam. Congress later exempted the dam from the law to allow the project to be completed. But the TVA worked to transplant the snail darter to other rivers and streams.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The GOP-controlled Legislature passed a broad overhaul of the state’s election laws Tuesday, tightening already strict voting rules and dealing a bruising defeat to Democrats who waged a months­long fight over what they argued was a brazen attempt to disenfranchise minorities and other Democratic-leaning voters. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said he will sign the bill, the latest in a national GOP campaign to add new hurdles to voting in the name of security, spurred in part by former President Donald Trump’s false claims of a stolen election. Texas Democrats fought the legislation for months, arguing the bill was tailored to make it harder for young people, racial and ethnic minorities and people with disabilities – all Democratic-leaning voters – to cast ballots, just as they see the demographics shifting to favor their party. The bill specifically targets Democratic strongholds, including Houston’s Harris County, further tightening rules in a state already considered among the hardest places to cast a ballot. The legislation set off a heated summer in Texas of walkouts by Democrats, Republicans threatening them with arrest, Abbott vetoing the paychecks of thousands of rank-and-file staffers when the bill failed to reach him sooner, and accusations of racism and voter suppression. Even the final vote did not escape a parting round of confrontation after Senate Republicans, at the last minute, scuttled one of the few areas of bipartisan agreement: efforts to shield voters with felony convictions from prosecution if they did not realize they were ineligible to cast a ballot. It had been included following backlash over the arrests of two Texas voters, both of whom are Black.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox cast doubt on the efficacy of mask-wearing Tuesday as health leaders made some of their most impassioned pleas yet for Utahns to mask up and get vaccinated. Cox, a Republican, said his administration is encouraging people to wear masks but said it is unclear whether they are effective against the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. “Masks are not as effective as most of the pro-mask crowd are arguing,” Cox told reporters at a news conference. “We know that they’re just not.” Cox offered no specific evidence to support his assertion, and his comments contradicted public health experts, as well as statements Utah’s state epidemiologist Dr. Michelle Hofmann made a few minutes earlier at the same news conference. State hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to prevent the state’s ongoing COVID-19 surge. “There will be enduring harm to our children and generations to come if we do not stop the divisiveness around the things we know work like masks and vaccines,” Hofmann said. “We know the path to healing is the end of this pandemic, and it hasn’t ended yet even if we want to pretend it has.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Nearly all arriving students at the University of Vermont have been vaccinated against COVID-19. UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials are still working with fewer than 100 students to bring them into compliance with the school’s inoculation requirement. Earlier this month UVM reinstituted an indoor mask mandate for all faculty, staff, students and visitors on the Burlington campus. The exact size of this year’s school enrollment won’t be known for several weeks, but it’s expected to be more than 13,000. The incoming freshman class is expected to have about 3,000 students. “In wonderful news for the years ahead, an extraordinary new class of Catamounts have joined us this fall – with more than 25,000 applications for admission, the incoming class is on track to being the best academically prepared and the largest we’ve ever welcomed!” President Suresh Garimella said in a message to the student body. Students at colleges and universities across Vermont are returning for the fall semester amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, this time driven by the more transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam granted posthumous pardons Tuesday to seven Black men who were executed in 1951 for the rape of a white woman, in a case that attracted pleas for mercy from around the world and in recent years has been denounced as an example of racial disparity in the use of the death penalty. Northam announced the pardons after meeting with about a dozen descendants of the men and their advocates. Cries and sobs could be heard from some of the descendants after Northam’s announcement. The “Martinsville Seven,” as the men became known, were all convicted of raping 32-year-old Ruby Stroud Floyd, a white woman who had gone to a predominantly black neighborhood in Martinsville, Virginia, on Jan. 8, 1949, to collect money for clothes she had sold. Four of the men were executed in Virginia’s electric chair Feb. 2, 1951. Three days later, the remaining three were also electrocuted. All of them were tried by all-white juries. It was the largest group of people executed for a single-victim crime in Virginia’s history. At the time, rape was a capital offense. But Northam said Tuesday that the death penalty for rape was applied almost exclusively to Black people. Northam said the pardons are an acknowledgement that the men did not receive due process and faced racial bias.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The coronavirus pandemic is filling hospitals at an “alarming” rate and continuing to strain health care workers, state health officials said Monday. And for the first time during the pandemic, hospitals are also seeing large numbers of sick pregnant patients, said Dr. Tanya Sorensen, the executive medical director of women’s health at Swedish Health Services. She noted pregnant patients are generally less likely to be inoculated against COVID-19. “We’re seeing ICU admissions, maternal deaths, babies born prematurely either to help the mother breathe or rescue the baby,” she said. “It’s really heartbreaking. … Pregnant women need to be vaccinated.” As of Monday morning, the state’s hospitals and health care centers were treating 1,570 COVID-19 patients, Washington State Hospital Association CEO Cassie Sauer said. Of those, 188 were on ventilators. Eleven days ago, the hospital association had counted 1,240 patients with 152 on ventilators. “It’s an enormous stress on a health care system to have this many patients with a single diagnosis,” she said. “This doesn’t happen. … It’s very, very alarming.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A historic suspension bridge will be undergoing major repairs, but it’s not clear whether the span will reopen to traffic. The West Virginia Division of Highways and Gov. Jim Justice announced Monday that a $17.9 million contract had been awarded to repair and rehabilitate the Wheeling Suspension Bridge, The Intelligencer/Wheeling News-Register reports. The project will make repairs on the span’s superstructure and substructure as well as clean, paint, replace damaged suspension cables and renovate lighting, officials said. “It is absolutely fantastic news for the city of Wheeling to know that its most iconic structure, the suspension bridge, is going to be fully repaired and rehabilitated,” Mayor Glenn Elliott said Monday. The future of the historic 1849 bridge was in question after officials closed the span to vehicle traffic in 2019 since motorists repeatedly ignored Division of Highways weight restrictions and warnings on the structure. Multiple overweight vehicles tried to cross it, leading to damage, and it’s unclear whether the repairs will allow the bridge to reopen to traffic. After the contractor begins work on the bridge, crews will determine the extent of the damage, and officials will then determine how the bridge will be used going forward.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: A school district has reversed a decision to leave a federal free meals program following widespread criticism and loud protests from parents and others. Waukesha school board members said they received threats in the wake of national attention after voting to opt out of the program that was providing free breakfast and lunch to all students in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The board voted 5-4 on Monday to reverse course, with parents and others packing the meeting room and two overflow rooms. Board member Karin Rajnicek said after the board’s previous vote to end the free program that it made it easy for families to “become spoiled.” Darren Clark, assistant superintendent for business services, said he feared there would be a “slow addiction” to the service. Even without the program, Waukesha students from low-income families still would have been able to apply for free or reduced-price meals under the traditional National School Lunch Program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to extend the Seamless Summer Option during the pandemic to offer free meals year-round has allowed for more coronavirus-safe practices by eliminating the need to collect payments and allowing meals to be served more easily in classrooms or outside.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: More staff than inmates at the state’s men’s prisons have tested positive for the coronavirus in the past month, the Department of Corrections said late last week. Since July 23, the state has reported 43 cases of COVID-19 among staff at the Wyoming State Penitentiary in Rawlins and the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution in Torrington. A total of 20 inmates in those two facilities tested positive for the virus over the same period of time. “Historically, we’ve had far more positives in our inmate population, as a percentage of the population, than we’ve had for staff,” Wyoming Department of Corrections spokesperson Paul Martin said Wednesday. “I think that trend is changing now.” About 35% of prison employees report being fully vaccinated, compared to 64% of inmates, the agency said. Vaccinations are not required for anyone, Martin told the Casper Star-Tribune, but are offered to employees and inmates. Inmates are still wearing face coverings and social distancing, Martin said. The only facility that did not experience an outbreak during the peak of the pandemic was the Wyoming Women’s Center in Lusk. This month, the women’s prison has reported five cases among staff and 11 among inmates.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/28/california-monsoon-popular-ports-disney-meets-elvis-news-around-states/117677814/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The number of COVID-19 patients in Alabama hospitals climbed to more than 900 on Monday – a number the state has not seen since February. There were 947 COVID-19 patients in state hospitals Monday, up from 204 at the beginning of July, according to numbers from the Alabama Hospital Association. The latest number is about a third of where the state was at the peak of the pandemic, when there were 3,000 virus patients in state hospitals in January. Dr. Scott Harris, who serves as Alabama’s health officer, said he is “extremely concerned” about the rise in cases. “It’s the perfect storm of large numbers of unvaccinated people and the delta variant which is highly infectious and much more transmissible than anything we saw before,” Harris said. Dr. Don Williamson, the former state health officer who now heads the Alabama Hospital Association, said the concern is the steep upward trajectory in numbers. Williamson said the state has the solution in the form of the vaccine, but “there is not a long line of people wanting to be vaccinated.” Health officials say the latest spike is associated with the delta variant which is exploiting low immunization rates, summer crowds and the end of cautionary measures like mask wearing.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced plans to review whether a southeast Alaska wolf population merits Endangered Species Act protections. The plans are outlined in a document set to be published in the Federal Register on Tuesday. The document stated that a petition from conservation groups to protect the Alexander Archipelago wolf included information indicating protections might be warranted because of potential threats associated with logging, illegal and legal trapping and hunting, climate change and loss of genetic diversity. The agency said it is initiating a status review to determine if protections are warranted. An email seeking comment was sent to an agency spokesperson Monday. The wolves are found in the coastal rainforests of southeast Alaska and British Columbia and a petition filed last year by the Center for Biological Diversity, Alaska Rainforest Defenders and Defenders of Wildlife raised particular concerns about the wolves in Alaska and on southeast Alaska’s Prince of Wales Island. In 2016, the Fish and Wildlife Service determined the wolf did not warrant Endangered Species Act protections.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Civil rights leaders, including the Revs. Jesse Jackson and William Barber, were among 39 people arrested Monday after refusing to leave the Phoenix office of Democratic U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who has faced unrelenting pressure from liberal activists over her opposition to ending the filibuster to pass voting rights legislation. Jackson, one of the nation’s most prominent civil rights leaders, said the U.S. is in a “civilization crisis” with “battle lines drawn,” and he urged activists to fight nonviolently for their rights. Sinema is among moderate Democratic senators who have ruled out changes to the filibuster, which she said encourages bipartisan cooperation and more lasting legislative compromises. Several hundred activists marched about a mile from a park to Sinema’s office in Phoenix’s Biltmore neighborhood, chanting “end the filibuster now.” Eliminating the filibuster would open the door for Democratic senators to enact voting rights bills and raise the federal minimum wage to $15, they said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he planned to meet with House and Senate leaders about growing calls to allow schools to require face masks as the state reported 23 more deaths from COVID-19. The Republican governor said he planned to discuss the issue Tuesday with the GOP leaders of the state House and Senate, following calls from Democratic lawmakers and others to lift a state law banning mask mandates by state and local governments. The Little Rock School Board on Monday night passed a resolution urging a change in the law so districts could decide whether to require students and employees wear masks. Arkansas’ virus cases have been surging in recent weeks, fueled by the delta variant and the state’s low vaccination rate. The state’s deaths rose to 6,077. The number of people hospitalized rose by 61 to 980. University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson tweeted that the hospital had 66 COVID-19 patients, surpassing the record it reached in January when it had 63.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPalm Springs:Monsoonal thunderstorms drenched the Coachella Valley early Monday, bringing flooded roadways, power outages and the wettest day for Palm Springs in more than 15 months. The Palm Springs International Airport collected nearly a half-inch of rain, setting a daily record. Monday's heavy rain was the largest single-day accumulation in the city since 0.46 fell on April 8, 2020. The heavy rain also impacted Monday's morning commute as intersections saw minor flooding. In Palm Springs, Indian Canyon Drive was closed between Sunrise Parkway and Garnet for several hours because of water washing over the roadway, but the road was reopened about 3:15 p.m. Monday, with the exception of one southbound lane. Near Mecca, Box Canyon Road was closed near Interstate 10 because of debris and flooding. Across the valley, the California Highway Patrol reported a sinkhole at Dillon Road and Thousand Palms Canyon Road, with residents advised to avoid the area. The weather also left several thousand residents in the Coachella Valley without power. Southern California Edison reported power outages impacted roughly 6,800 customers in the valley at the height of the storm, but that number dropped to approximately 1,500 customers by afternoon.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The first phase of the Larimer County Jail’s multimillion-dollar expansion project has wrapped up. Larimer County commissioners and other county officials toured the completed parts of the $80 million project last week, including a new kitchen, laundry area and boiler room. Construction on the first phase of the project was completed July 9. The new kitchen is about double the size and more open than the old kitchen, which jail Capt. Bobby Moll said will make it easier for jail staff to supervise those assigned to work in the kitchen. The jail works to provide meal options to accommodate religious and dietary needs, and the extra space in the new kitchen will give workers more space for food prep, Lt. Staci Shaffer said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Dr. Manisha Juthani, an infectious disease specialist at Yale School of Medicine, was nominated by Gov. Ned Lamont to serve as the next commissioner of the Department of Public Health. Juthani will succeed Dr. Deidre Gifford, the state social services commissioner who has also been leading the health agency since the departure of Renee Coleman-Mitchell in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic. Juthani was among the doctors who signed a letter in November to Lamont urging him to prohibit indoor dining, close gyms and ban nonessential social gatherings to slow the spread of the virus. Juthani will begin the new role on Sept. 20. At a news conference, she said she was eager to work on issues including health care equity and disparities in access to treatment. She also commended the health care workers and others who have helped the state through the pandemic.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:State Rep. Gerald Brady will not seek reelection when his term ends in 2022, he said Monday. The announcement came after a week of criticism and calls for his resignation after a an email sent by Brady using an anti-Asian racial slur.was published by The News Journal. The comments from Brady came from an email exchange with an out-of-state advocate regarding legislation intended to protect sex workers. That June 27 email was intended for a private citizen Brady knows, asking if they could read and summarize the study, said Drew Volturo, spokesman for the House Democratic Caucus. Instead, Brady hit reply and emailed the original sender. In Delaware, lawmaker emails are not considered public record. The response was shared with The News Journal. Brady’s actions “make it more difficult to effectively provide the kind of representation” constituents of his district deserve, he said in a statement on Monday.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:D.C. neighbors are calling for action from the city after three young men were shot on Q Street northwest Sunday afternoon, two of whom died, WUSA-TV reported. D.C. Police identified the two men killed as 22-year-old Javon Hill, Jr. and 19-year-old Tariq Riley. The third young man hit is recovering from gunshot injuries, according to police. Resident Brenda Stewart and her Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner, Karla Lewis, said they had been pressing the city to do more – to be more proactive – to no avail. “I don't have any answers, I just want some solutions,\" Stewart said. \"I like to see some real masterminds in our community that can come up with some solutions.” Stewart said she's proud of her home and wants the city to take care of it. Lewis said they're working with Councilmember McDuffie's office to set up a community meeting to discuss solutions.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings said “we are now in crisis mode” when it comes to dealing with soaring numbers of COVID-19 infections. Florida accounted for a fifth of the nation’s new infections last week, more than any other state, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now Orange County, the home to Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando Resort is seeing about 1,000 new cases a day, Demings said. “A thousand a day is extraordinary,” Demings said. “We are now in crisis mode … We as a community need to work together to slow this rate.” The positivity rate for the virus in the county of 1.4 million residents has tripled to 14% from about 4.3% a month ago. More than 61% of county residents have had at least one vaccination shot, and the mayor urged unvaccinated residents to get theirs as soon as possible. Demings said central Florida hospitals are approaching capacity. A medical officer at one of the state’s largest health systems said its number of COVID-19 patients is nearing a record high: 862, approaching the peak of 900 hospitalized patients with the virus in January.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah:For the first time, the Port of Savannah has moved 5.3 million 20-foot equivalent container units in a fiscal year, the Georgia Ports Authority said. That means it has grown its cargo volumes by 20% in fiscal year 2021. American companies are continuing to choose the Port of Savannah as a gateway to global trade, Gov. Brian Kemp said. Georgia’s ports are a key reason that it remains a strong state for business, the governor said. Georgia Ports Authority Executive Director Griff Lynch said the project to deepen Savannah Harbor, the Mason Mega Rail terminal and other capacity upgrades are preparing Georgia for future cargo demand. The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project is now nearly 90% complete, the Ports Authority said. The project is expected to finish in December. With a high-tide depth of 54 feet, the deeper harbor will allow vessels to take on heavier loads with fewer tidal restrictions.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: Kauai utility officials are installing glow-in-the-dark devices to prevent endangered nocturnal seabirds from crashing into power lines. The diverters help Newell’s shearwater, Hawaiian petrel and band-rumped storm petrel avoid power lines after dark. Kauai is considered an important breeding habitat for all of those species. The Kauai Island Utility Cooperative installed diverters on 109 power line spans last year and expects to install diverters on another 628 spans by the end of 2021, The Garden Island reported Monday. The cooperative said it is using reflective diverters that glow in the dark near residential areas, commercial districts and public roads. In remote areas, it’s using LED diverters that charge via a solar panel during the day to produce light that’s visible to birds at night. Bird diverters are estimated to be 40% to 90% effective in minimizing power-line collisions, depending on type and location.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A federal court has temporarily halted a northern Idaho logging project in grizzly bear habitat following a lawsuit contending the U.S. Forest Service violated environmental laws. U.S. District Court Judge B. Lynn Winmill ruled Friday in favor of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies and issued a preliminary injunction on the 2,500-acre Hanna Flats Logging Project in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest. The Forest Service and Idaho Department of Lands are partnering on the project under a program called the Good Neighbor Authority intended to speed up logging and forest restoration projects on U.S. Forest Service land by allowing state officials to take care of some of the work. The Forest Service said it doesn’t have to follow certain environmental laws because the project qualifies for a categorical exclusion under the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. The act allows the Forest Service to avoid some environmental studies if an area is designated as “wildland urban interface,” an area where homes and wildland intermingle, and that can leave homes vulnerable to wildfires. The Forest Service cited Bonner County’s wildfire protection plan that designates the area as wildland urban interface in saying the logging project qualified for the categorical exclusion. However, Winmill ruled that the project does not appear to qualify for an exclusion and halted logging until it rules on the merits of the case. The U.S. Department of Justice, which represents federal agencies in court cases, didn’t immediately respond to an inquiry sent through its online portal on Monday.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city of Chicago and its police union announced they have reached a tentative contract agreement after four years of negotiations. The tentative contract is aligned with the consent decree entered into in 2019 that calls for reforms to how the Chicago Police Department operates, according to officials. The 236-page plan negotiated between Illinois and Chicago officials calls for more community policing, more data collection on how officers work and expanded training on the use of force. One provision will require officers to file paperwork each time they point a gun at someone, even if they don’t fire. The reforms in the contract includes the end to a ban on investigation of anonymous complaints and the changing of officer testimony after viewing video. In addition, officers can now be rewarded for reporting misconduct of other officers. The tentative contract calls for rank-and-file police officers to receive a 10.5% retroactive pay raise and 9.5% more through January 2025. The proposal represents an average annual increase of 2.5%.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Department of Environmental Management forecasted high ozone levels Tuesday for four regions in the central, southern and western parts of the state. The alert covered Clark and Floyd counties in southeastern Indiana; Vigo, Carroll and Tippecanoe counties in west-central Indiana; Marion, Bartholomew, Boone, Brown, Delaware, Hamilton, Hendricks, Howard, Madison and Shelby counties in central Indiana; and Daviess, Dubois, Gibson, Greene, Knox, Perry, Pike, Posey, Spencer, Vanderburgh and Warrick counties in southwestern Indiana. Anyone sensitive to changes in air quality could be affected when ozone levels are high. Children, the elderly, and anyone with heart or lung conditions were advised to reduce or avoid exertion and heavy work outdoors. Ground-level ozone is formed when sunlight and hot weather combine with vehicle exhaust, factory emissions, and gasoline vapors. It can irritate lungs and can cause coughing and breathing difficulties for sensitive populations. The agency encouraged everyone to help reduce ozone by driving less; not refueling vehicles or using gasoline-powered lawn equipment until after 7 p.m.; and conserving energy by turning off lights and setting thermostats to 75 degrees or above.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:The Des Moines Metropolitan Wastewater Reclamation Authority has begun sampling sewage as part of a national program to track the spread of the coronavirus and its variants. The agency announced its participation Monday, the Des Moines Register reported. Agency workers began collecting samples last week and shipping them to a national lab in Maine. The effort is being funded by the federal government and is expected to continue for eight or nine weeks. Larry Hare, manager of the southeast Des Moines sewage treatment plant, said sewage sampling can inform officials if a dangerous virus or germ is circulating in a community. “It will tell us whether we’re behind the curve or ahead of the curve,” Hare said. He said the sampling is the first time the Des Moines agency has participated in a search for a virus, but it has previously provided samples for researchers looking for opioid drug use and other information.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: One of Kansas’ largest public school districts plans to require elementary students to wear masks this fall after a health official warned that the faster-spreading delta variant would lead to widespread infections among unmasked children. The Shawnee Mission district joins the Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, schools in requiring masks for some students. But Shawnee Mission is the only district to plan on mandating masks among the six in Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, The Kansas City Star reported. Shawnee Mission’s board voted 6-1 to require masks in elementary schools but keep them optional for middle and high schools. The district has 26,000 students, making it the third-largest in Kansas behind Wichita and Olathe. Johnson County Epidemiologist Elizabeth Holzschuh warned the board that the delta variant would become widespread in classrooms of unmasked elementary-aged students. The federal government has not authorized any vaccine for children under 12.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky Department for Public Health is offering a coronavirus testing program for schools to assist with safe in-person learning for the upcoming academic year, Commissioner Steven Stack said. It is limited to staff and students of Kentucky K-12 public, private and charter schools. “We’ve been given $134 million by the federal government to create a testing program for K-12 schools, public and private, throughout the entire commonwealth,” Stack said. “I urge everyone who operates a school out there to explore the options and make testing available to keep yourselves safe.” Superintendents and school administrators can learn more at govstatus.egov.com/K-12-kentucky-school-testing-program.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Officials suspended visitation and volunteer programs in Louisiana’s eight state-run prisons Tuesday to guard against the spread of COVID-19. The action came in response to a fourth surge of the disease in the state, where hospitalizations – at more than 1,200 as of Monday – have more than doubled in 10 days. The suspension is effective immediately and will be reevaluated on Aug. 16, the Department of Corrections said in a news release. “In lieu of visitation, the Department will continue to offer two free phone calls per week to ensure inmates have continued connection to family and friends during this event,” the department said. “In addition, video calling remains available for a fee.” At least two major hospital systems in the state have announced the suspension of nonemergency surgeries that might require hospital admissions as COVID-19 hospitalization numbers grow. In the New Orleans suburb of Jefferson Parish, officials held a morning news conference to again urge people to get vaccinated. Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng, accompanied by the parish coroner and doctors from two local hospital systems, said new cases are evident in areas of the parish where vaccination rates are low.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Public health authorities said a second case of a rare tick-borne infection has been located in the state. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said laboratory tests confirmed a case of Powassan virus in a resident of Knox County. A Waldo County resident who is still recovering from the virus contracted it in June. The agency said about 25 cases of the disease are reported in the U.S. every year. Maine has had 10 cases since 2010. Symptoms of the disease can include fever, headache, weakness, confusion and memory loss. Severe infection can also lead to death. The Maine CDC said residents should take precautions, such as wearing repellent and protective clothing to avoid Powassan and other tick-borne infections.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan honored deaf and blind swimmer Becca Meyers for courage in championing the disabled, after the three-time gold medalist withdrew from the Paralympics in Tokyo when told her mother couldn’t travel as her personal care assistant. Hogan presented a citation to Meyers during a news conference commemorating the 31st anniversary of the American with Disabilities Act. The certificate honored her “bravery for highlighting the issue of inequality and access for people with disabilities.” Hogan also signed an executive order declaring that Maryland will annually celebrate July as Disability Culture and Achievements Month. “Becca deserved to be able to compete, and while we’re all so disappointed for her, I got the chance to tell her just a moment before this started that I’m unbelievably proud of her for having the courage to speak up and to speak out about this injustice,” Hogan said. Meyers, 26, said the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee approved her mother to act as her assistant at all international meets since 2017 but the committee said her request to bring her mother this time was denied because of restrictions put in place by the Japanese government because of COVID-19. Meyers said she made the decision to withdraw to stand up for future Paralympic athletes, saying she didn’t want them to have to experience what she’s been through. “I hope to work with others to effect change so that no one ever feels afraid to travel with Team USA,” Meyers said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: City officials have approved an indoor mask mandate to fight an outbreak of more than 500 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the vacation haven at the tip of Cape Cod. The town’s Select Board and Board of Health unanimously voted in favor of the mandate during an emergency joint meeting Sunday. “We are entering a new stage of COVID,” Town Manager Alex Morse said. “COVID, while depressing for many of us, is not going away anytime soon.” The boards had approved an indoor mask advisory last week, but it had not adequately succeeded in slowing the spread, he said. The new cases stem from a busy Fourth of July weekend, officials have said. The indoor mask mandate will become an advisory again when positivity rates drop lower than 3% over five days. The advisory can be lifted when the positivity rate drops lower than 2%.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Ignace: Enbridge said it had retrieved an anchor that broke away from a maintenance vessel while on the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac. The mishap occurred June 21 as a contractor for the pipeline company was doing seasonal work on the underwater section of Line 5, an oil line that runs between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario. The section in the straits, which connects Lake Michigan and Lake Huron, is divided into two pipes about 1,200 feet apart. The anchor was deployed about midway between them. When the crew tried to raise it, the shackle connecting it to the cable failed, Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes said. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy ordered the company to remove the anchor, which took place Sunday. A crane on a barge was used to lift the 15,000-pound object to the surface, Barnes said. Pipeline operations weren’t affected, he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nFairmont: An announcer who was fired by an Iowa racetrack after a racist rant was back behind the microphone in southern Minnesota last weekend, but he did not receive a standing ovation as promised because he was apparently uncomfortable with that plan, according to the promoter of Fairmont Raceway. Lon Oelke is the full-time announcer at Fairmont Raceway, where he worked Friday – days after the Kossuth County Speedway in Algona, Iowa, cut ties with him after he went on a racist rant this month against Black fans and athletes who kneel during the national anthem as a protest against racial inequality. The Kossuth County Speedway said in a statement that its leaders “do not condone” Oelke’s comments, adding that management did not hear them during the race, but only after they gained attention on social media. “I think perhaps the whole thing is taken a little out of context with social media these days,” Fairmont track promoter Jon McCorkell told the Star Tribune, adding that he’ll “stick by my guy.”\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: The Mississippi Department of Public Safety said it wants local officials to find a larger building for the state driver’s license office in Vicksburg. The department’s director of driver services, Kevin Raymond, told Warren County supervisors Monday that the county-owned building is too small to accommodate workers and visitors, the Vicksburg Post reported. Raymond said the driver’s license office needs an additional entrance, a second bathroom, a break room and more square footage. However, he said the state doesn’t provide money for those needs. Warren County pays most expenses for the building where the driver’s license office is housed, including cleaning services and utilities. The new space being considered is in the former Outlets of Vicksburg. It would be larger, have two restrooms, multiple entrances and a large parking lot. The lot would provide space for commercial driver’s license training, and the manager of the Vicksburg driver’s license office, Rhonda Howard, said that would make a big difference. Performing a commercial driver’s license road test now requires 11/ 2 -hour round trip to Pearl.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt has sued to halt a mask mandate that took effect Monday in the St. Louis area amid a rise in COVID-19 cases that are burdening a growing number of hospitals across the state. The mandate, one of the first to be reinstated in the country, requires everyone age 5 or older to wear masks in indoor public places and on public transportation in St. Louis city and St. Louis County, even if they are vaccinated. Wearing masks outdoors is strongly encouraged, especially in group settings. But the lawsuit said the mandates are “arbitrary and capricious because they require vaccinated individuals to wear masks, despite the CDC guidance that this is not necessary.” It also questions mandating children to wear masks in school, noting they are less likely to become seriously ill. “This continued government overreach is unacceptable and unconstitutional, especially in the face of a widely available vaccine,” Schmitt said in a news release. St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones said Schmitt would not be successful in his legal challenge. She noted that he filed an unsuccessful lawsuit last year against the Chinese government over the coronavirus, alleging that nation’s officials are to blame for the pandemic.\n\nMontana\n\nLivingston: Authorities in south-central Montana continued searching Tuesday for an inmate who overpowered a county jail guard, took the guard’s gun and car keys and escaped in a stolen minivan. Jordon Earl Linde, 34, is believed to have stayed in the Livingston-Shields Valley area after escaping from custody in Park County at about 11 p.m. Sunday, Sheriff Brad Bichler said in a social media post. Bichler encouraged Linde to no longer “prolong the inevitable” and turn himself in, or for anyone who has contact with him to do the same. Linde was arrested Saturday for felony drug charges and other alleged offenses. After stealing a Park County Detention Center minivan during his escape, he abandoned the vehicle and was believed to have stolen another – a gold Chrysler Town and Country minivan. Linde had a pistol and was considered armed and dangerous.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: An Omaha man has been indicted on a federal charge of bank fraud after prosecutors said he lied to get a loan through a federal program meant to help businesses struggling in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. M.A. Yah faces court next month and could get up to 30 years in prison if convicted, the office of the U.S. Attorney for Nebraska said in a news release. The indictment against Yah said he was director of The Heartland News – a nonprofit newspaper with a mission to end poverty and homelessness in the region – when he requested a Paycheck Protection Program loan of more than $100,000 for the business in April 2020. Paperwork filed by Yah said the loan was to support the newspaper’s payroll, but prosecutors said he lied about the number of employees and payroll of the nonprofit from the previous year. Reached by phone Tuesday, Yah denied the allegations, ut said he could not yet comment further on the charges. Yah said he planned to hire an attorney this week to fight the charge.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A federal judge has denied environmentalists’ request for a court order temporarily blocking the government from digging trenches for archaeological surveys at a mine planned near the Nevada-Oregon line with the largest-known U.S. deposit of lithium. U.S. District Judge Miranda Du said in an 11-page ruling late Friday in Reno that four conservation groups failed to prove the trenches planned across a total of one-quarter acre would cause irreparable harm to sage brush that serves as crucial habitat for imperiled sage grouse. She said she plans to rule later this week on a request from a Nevada tribe to join the legal fight as a co-plaintiff and seek a similar restraining order based on claims the digging would disturb sacred burial grounds.Du emphasized she has placed the overall case on an expedited schedule and intends to issue a ruling on the merits by early next year. She noted any construction of the mine itself is unlikely to begin before the snow melts in the spring of 2022. Lithium Nevada Corp.’s proposed Thacker Pass mine is emerging as a key battleground in the debate over environmental trade-offs tied to President Joe Biden’s push for renewable energy. Lithium is a key component in electric vehicle batteries.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Fine-particle air pollution concentrations have reached unhealthy levels statewide for people with lung diseases and those who are active outdoors as smoke from wildfires in the West and Canada reaches the area, the Department of Environmental Services said. The department said people should take precautions by limiting prolonged outdoor exertion. Current wind patterns are transporting waves of smoke from fires in the West and parts of Canada across much of the country, including New Hampshire, the department said. The smoke plumes also diffract light, causing a hazy appearance in the sky and reducing visibility of distant objects, the department said. Sensitive individuals include children, older adults and anyone with lung disease such as asthma, emphysema, and bronchitis. The air quality is expected to improve Wednesday as the wind is forecast to move the smoke plumes out of the area.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: A $44 million federal grant announced Monday will be used to modernize, expand and reconfigure the road system at the port complex in Newark and Elizabeth, making it safer and cutting down on delays. Some of the most congested roads in New Jersey are at the port complex, where trucks roll through nonstop to pick up and drop off shipping containers at the nation’s second-busiest port. With container volume in the New York/New Jersey port system setting a record last year despite the disruptions to the global supply chain caused by the pandemic, the aging roads and interchanges in Newark figure to continue taking a beating. It’s estimated that 15,000 trucks use the roads each day at the northern access points to the port, which sit at the intersection of Interstate 78 and the New Jersey Turnpike across from Newark Liberty International Airport. The Port Authority, which operates the ports, said there were more than 400 truck accidents and three fatalities between 2005 and 2018. The grant comes from the Department of Transportation’s Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program, and will be used as part of the Port Authority’s 10-year, $176 million road network modernization project.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State education officials released updated guidance on COVID-19 case reporting, masking requirements and vaccine considerations for K-12 schools this fall. The new rules give vaccinated students more chances to take off masks. It also allows them to avoid quarantines if there’s an outbreak on campus. Schools serving only middle or high school students can choose to allow vaccinated children to go without masks in most situations. But deciding which schools can unmask won’t be easy, and could hinge on vaccination rates. Under the new guidelines, local school officials are allowed to require universal masking in any school, even among students who volunteer proof of vaccine status in the form of a card or a screenshot of a Department of Health confirmation.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Carlos Santana, LL Cool J and Barry Manilow are among the performers who will join previously announced headliners Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen and Jennifer Hudson at next month’s Central Park concert to celebrate the city’s recovery from the pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The Aug. 21 concert will be broadcast worldwide on CNN and will also include performances by Elvis Costello, Andrea Bocelli, Wyclef Jean and Cynthia Erivo, the mayor said. Patti Smith will duet with Springsteen. “This is going to be an historic, monumental moment for all New Yorkers and all Americans,” de Blasio said. “I’ll put it plainly: You’re going to want to be here.” City officials said 80% of the tickets for the concert will be free. Free and for-purchase tickets will be released to the public in batches starting Monday at www.homecoming2021.com. Proof of COVID-19 vaccination will be required for entry, de Blasio said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCurrituck: The Currituck-Knotts Island ferry service is being suspended to alleviate a staffing shortage at the Hatteras terminal, according to the N.C. Department of Transportation’s Ferry Division. In a news release, the division said the Currituck-Knotts Island route will resume its scheduled service on July 31. Earlier this year, the department said its ferry service was facing a shortage of deck hands, seamen and captains. The Virginian-Pilot reported in the spring that there is often a waiting list to get a ferry job. But this year, the service needs to fill an expanded summer schedule. Jed Dixon, deputy director of the North Carolina Ferry Division, said the pandemic prevented an annual job fair that typically helps recruit enough employees. But he said that people could simply be choosing other careers. North Carolina operates 22 ferries on seven routes, and officials said about 2 million people ride the vessels each year. In April, the ferry service said it needed roughly 20 more employees.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo:The Army has awarded a more than $13 million contract to Gast Construction Company, Inc. in Fargo to build a Remotely Piloted Aircraft operations center for the North Dakota Air National Guard’s 119th Wing. Republican U.S. Senator John Hoeven, a member of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Committee, was able to secure $17.5 million for the construction of the facility, which is needed to support new advanced technology and equipment that is crucial to the mission’s long-term success, while also preventing interruptions for the wing’s operations. The Air Guard anticipates moving into the new facility sometime in fiscal year 2023.\n\nOhio\n\nAthens: Ohio University has notified the Delta Pi chapter of Sigma Chi that it has been suspended for four years following an investigation by the school that revealed student code of conduct violations. The fraternity accepted responsibility for providing false information to school officials or law enforcement and two hazing-related counts. The suspension came about two weeks after the university found the Beta Chapter of Delta Tau Delta committed nine violations, including selling and distributing alcohol, reckless behavior and coerced consumption of alcohol. That fraternity was also suspended for four years. Members of the fraternities are prohibited from joining other frats on campus or starting their own, the school said. Both will be eligible to apply for reinstatement in 2025. Gov. Mike DeWine recently signed a measure that put in place tougher penalties for hazing at Ohio universities and colleges starting this fall. “Collin’s Law,” is named after Collin Wiant, an 18-year-old Ohio University freshman who died in 2018 after ingesting nitrous oxide at a different fraternity house, which was expelled in May 2019.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: The remains of 19 bodies exhumed as part of a city search for unmarked burials from the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre will be reinterred during a private ceremony Friday at Oaklawn Cemetery, city officials said. The bodies were exhumed in June and examined at an on-site laboratory by forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield, whose findings have not been made public, the Tulsa World reported. Efforts to identify the remains through records and possibly DNA are ongoing, according to the city. Stubblefield has said that the remains appeared to include men, women and children. In at least one set of male remains, a bullet was found in a shoulder. Other parts of the man’s remains showed similar signs of trauma, including to the head.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Health officials in Oregon’s most populous county said they strongly recommend that people wear masks in all indoor public spaces regardless of vaccine status. Multnomah County officials said in news release that the advisory was issued in response to COVID-19 cases increasing largely because of the highly contagious delta variant. Public Health Director Jessica Guernsey said if people don’t act, an exponential rise in cases can be expected, especially in pockets with low vaccinations. County health officials are particularly worried about the delta variant, which is roughly twice as contagious as earlier virus strains and might cause more severe illness. Eight counties in Western Washington are also recommending people wear masks in public indoor settings as are officials in Los Angeles County and San Francisco Bay Area counties.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg:Nearly 1,500 nursing home workers across Pennsylvania canceled a one-day strike Tuesday after they reached contract agreements with their employers. SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania had said that employees at 20 nursing homes were going to hold a one-day strike to draw attention to problems with the industry, such as low wages, short staffing and outdated state regulations. On Monday, the union first announced that workers had come to tentative contract agreements with Guardian Healthcare. Then late Monday afternoon, the union said workers at Priority-owned facilities had also come to preliminary agreements. “Our new agreements move us in the right direction but they are only a first step in an urgent and larger conversation about reforming our long-term care system,” said Matthew Yarnell, SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania’s president, in a statement. Workers will discuss the proposed agreements “over the next few weeks” and hold ratification votes, according to the union’s statement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Public health officials are investigating a rise in the number of cases of Legionnaires’ disease in Rhode Island, the state Department of Health said. There have been 30 cases reported since June 2, the agency said in an emailed statement. Of those, 28 people have required hospitalization. The state has had an average of 10 cases per month in June and July since 2014, the agency said. No common source of exposure has been identified. “We know that Legionella bacteria grow best in complex water systems that are not well-maintained,” department Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott said in a statement. “When this water becomes aerosolized in small droplets, such as in a cooling tower, shower, or decorative fountain, people can accidentally breathe in the contaminated water. This is of particular concern now as some buildings’ water systems have been offline for a prolonged period due to the COVID-19 pandemic and are just now returning to service.” Legionella is especially a concern in buildings that primarily house people older than 65, buildings with multiple housing units and a centralized hot water system like hotels or high-rise apartment complexes. Symptoms, which typically start two to 10 days after breathing in the bacteria, can include cough, shortness of breath, fever, muscle aches, and headaches.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLake Wylie: At least 80 dogs were taken out of a home because they were living in very poor conditions, deputies said. Two monkeys and a bird were also removed Monday from property in Lake Wylie, the York County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. “The smell about knocked me over. There were feces everywhere,” sheriff’s spokesman Trent Faris told reporters outside the home. The dogs were mostly smaller animals and were living inside and outside the home, deputies said. The animals have been taken to the county animal shelter to determine how healthy they are and if they can be adopted, authorities said. A man in the home was charged with ill treatment of and hoarding of animals and deputies said more charges are possible after a veterinarian examines the animals. Deputies said they found methamphetamine and several guns in the home as well. There were so many animals to examine that the York County Animal Shelter had to stop taking in other animals from the public on Monday.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The Great Plains Tribal Leaders’ Health Board is requiring all of its employees to be vaccinated for COVID-19. The board’s CEO, Jerilyn Church, has sent a memo to staff that said those working under the Health Board banner, including the Great Plains Tribal Epidemiology Center, Oyate Health Center and the We Are Warriors EOC will be required to be fully vaccinated by Sept. 21. “In accordance with GPTLHB’s duty to provide and maintain a workplace that is free of known hazards, GPTLHB has adopted this policy to safeguard the health of our employees and their families, our relatives and visitors, and the community at large from infectious diseases that vaccinations reduce,” Church said. Currently, 74% of the Health Board’s staff has received the vaccine, according to officials. But, with numbers on the rise and the emergence of the delta variant, mandatory vaccinations for all staff is a logical next step for the organization, Church said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis:An exhibit of artwork, costumes and props from The Walt Disney Co. archives is on display at the Graceland Exhibition Center. The 10,000-square-foot display, “Inside the Walt Disney Archives,” covers multiple Disney properties, ranging from Disney live action to animated films, Walt Disney’s personal effects, items from various Disney Parks and more. The exhibit premiered at D23 Expo Japan in 2018. The items are on loan to Graceland, Elvis Presley’s home in Memphis. Some items include Jack Sparrow’s compass from “Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,” Mary Poppins’ original carpet bag, Wilson from “Cast Away,” Lumiere and Cogsworth props from 2017’s “Beauty and the Beast” and Congo Queen Model Boat from Disneyland’s Jungle Cruise. The exhibit will continue through Jan. 2, with special events planned through the run. Tickets are $15 for ages 11 and older and $8 for ages 5 to 10. There is no charge for children 4 and younger to visit.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: A man elbowed a bailiff who was attempting to handcuff him after the man was convicted of killing a San Antonio police detective. Jurors deliberated about 25 minutes Monday before convicting Otis McKane, 40, of capital murder in the November 2016 fatal shooting of Detective Benjamin Marconi. Prosecutors were seeking the death penalty against McKane; the trial’s punishment phase was set to begin Tuesday afternoon. A bailiff was trying handcuff McKane when McKane elbowed him in the face before several officers pushed him into an adjacent room. District Attorney Joe Gonzales and defense attorney Joel Perez declined comment on the outburst. Gonzales said the bailiff was not seriously injured. Marconi was fatally shot as he sat in his patrol car during a traffic stop that did not involve McKane, authorities said. McKane, as he was being taken to jail following the shooting, told reporters that he “lashed out at someone who didn’t deserve it” because he was upset with the court system. McKane said he was angry because he had not been allowed to see his son during a custody battle.\n\nUtah\n\nKanosh: A sandstorm caused a 22-vehicle pileup on a highway that left eight people dead, including four children, authorities said. The Sunday afternoon crashes on Interstate 15 near the town of Kanosh came at the end of a holiday weekend for the state that often leads to increased highway traffic. At least 10 people were taken to hospitals, including three in critical condition, according to the Utah Highway Patrol. Ground and air ambulances were used to transport crash victims. The pileup occurred during a period of high winds that caused a dust or sandstorm that reduced visibility, the highway patrol said. Five of the eight people killed were in one vehicle, and two others were in another vehicle, according to a news release. Another fatality was in a third vehicle. I-15 remained partially shut down late Sunday. Traffic was redirected around the crash site. Roadways on Sunday were full of drivers headed home after a long weekend to celebrate a state holiday recognizing Utah history and settlers from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who trekked west in search of religious freedom.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Vermont’s congressional delegation sent a letter to the U.S. State Department on Tuesday asking it to direct sufficient resources to work through a backlog of requests for passports and renewals. The lawmakers also wrote they are hearing from a significant number of Vermonters having trouble with the main contact number, sometimes waiting on hold for hours. Earlier this month, the State Department reported a backlog of 1.5 million requests nationwide and said that the wait for a passport is now between 12 weeks and 18 weeks, even if people pay for expedited processing. The delay is because of ripple effects from the coronavirus pandemic that caused extreme disruptions to the process at domestic issuance facilities and overseas embassies and consulates. An email was sent to the State Department on Tuesday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The two leading candidates in the closely watched race for governor said they will voluntarily disclose at least some information from recent tax returns before the November election. In response to questions from the Associated Press, the campaigns of Republican Glenn Youngkin and Democrat Gov. Terry McAuliffe made vague pledges to release unspecified details from their tax returns, but neither said they would make the documents available in full. “Glenn Youngkin will release information from his tax returns in recent years when his latest filings are complete, before November,” said spokeswoman Macaulay Porter. Christina Freundlich, a spokeswoman for McAuliffe, said he would share a summary of recent years’ returns before the election. Although it is not required for Virginia gubernatorial candidates to disclose their returns, there is some limited precedent for doing so. The complete documents could give a more nuanced look at a candidate’s income, tax deductions and philanthropy than the state’s mandatory disclosures do.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: The federal government has issued big fines against two Yakima County fruit companies for missing the annual deadline for filing forms reporting that their facilities store anhydrous ammonia. Stadelman Fruit LLC was fined $238,875 by the Environmental Protection Agency, and Hollingbery and Sons Inc. and the related Hollingbery CA and Cold Storage LLC were penalized a total of $118,200. The Capital Press reported the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act required companies that store hazardous chemicals to submit the forms by March 1 to state and local emergency planners, and the local fire department. Bud Hollingbery, president of the Hollingbery companies, said Friday his businesses have been sending in the information for years. In 2020, the employee who files the forms had a family emergency, and the forms weren’t submitted until May 12, he said. By then, according to EPA, the Hollingbery companies had committed 12 violations. Stadelman Fruit also was fined for missing the March 1, 2020, reporting deadline for its four cold-storage facilities in Zillah. Stadelman agreed to settle, but also did not admit to the allegations.

The marker was unveiled last week in Mount Hope on the 55th anniversary of the blast, the Herald-Dispatch reported. The explosion was caused by the ignition of built-up methane gas, according to the marker, which also noted that 39 miners were able to escape unharmed. The marker is sponsored by Mount Hope Heritage & Hope and the National Coal Heritage Area Authority, along with the city of Mount Hope, the West Virginia Archives and History and the state Division of Highways. More than 1,000 highway markers note significant locations across the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The Milwaukee Common Council voted Tuesday to approve a $627,000 settlement with former Police Chief Alfonso Morales over his demotion last year. A federal lawsuit by Morales over his ouster would be dropped as part of the agreement. Morales has 21 days to sign off on the negotiated deal. The Milwaukee Fire and Police Commission, a citizen panel, unanimously voted to remove Morales as chief last August, claiming he failed to fulfill a list of directives. But Milwaukee County Judge Christopher Foley in December reversed the civilian commission’s decision to demote Morales to captain, which had prompted Morales to retire and sue. Foley at the time called the commission’s process “fundamentally flawed.” Under the agreement, the city and commission would not admit to any negligence or to having violated any contract or federal, state and local laws. The commission’s vote came days before an Aug. 1 deadline agreed to by both sides to resolve the matter.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Recently retired U.S. Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming died Monday at 77. Enzi had been hospitalized with a broken neck and ribs three days after a bicycle accident near Gillette on Friday. Enzi was stabilized before being flown to a hospital in Colorado. He remained unconscious and was unable to recover from his injuries, former spokesman Max D’Onofrio said. Police said they have seen no indication anyone else was nearby or involved in the accident. Enzi fell near his home about 8:30 p.m. Friday, about the time Gillette police received a report of a man lying unresponsive in a road near a bicycle. Enzi, a Republican, retired in January after four terms as senator. He previously was a state lawmaker and mayor of Gillette, where he owned a shoe store. Enzi is survived by his wife; two daughters, Amy and Emily; a son, Brad; and several grandchildren.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/politics/analysis-zelensky-appeal-to-americans-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Zelensky's address to Congress comes at cruel turning ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRarely in modern times has a political leader matched his moment so bravely.\n\nBut a tangible note of desperation is now lacing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s inspirational rhetoric as he pleads for a more direct Western intervention to save Ukraine as merciless Russian President Vladimir Putin’s troops lay waste to cities and bombard civilians.\n\nZelensky’s relentless media campaign and courage in staying in Kyiv to fight alongside his people prompted the world’s democracies to rush anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons into the country and to crush the Russian economy in a far more robust response than was expected. But his appeals for more help, which are expected to dominate his address to the US Congress and the American people on Wednesday, will also lay bare Ukraine’s developing tragedy.\n\nThe measures the warrior President says his country needs to survive – like NATO-enforced no-fly zones and Soviet-era jets from ex-Warsaw Pact states that are now part of the West – are seen by the Biden administration as a step too far because they could antagonize Moscow and drag the US into a dangerous escalation with its nuclear-armed rival.\n\nThe Ukrainian President offered a possible preview of his request – and of his growing anger – in an address to the Canadian parliament Tuesday, his latest stop in a virtual tour of national legislatures that is highlighting his skill at pressuring Western leaders.\n\n“Can you imagine when you call your friends, your friendly nation, and you ask: ‘Please close the sky, close the airspace. Please stop the bombing. How many more cruise missiles have to fall on our cities until you make this happen?’ And they, in return, they express their deep concerns about the situation,” he said.\n\nZelensky’s heartrending daily appeals, alongside the horrifying images of civilian casualties, are making it impossible to ignore the torment of Ukraine and its people. If the worst happens and he ends up being killed – as he has candidly admitted is a real possibility – and Ukraine falls, addresses like the one to US lawmakers will stand as an indictment of Putin’s barbarism and of a global system that was unable to stop it.\n\nEven with Biden set to announce an additional $800 million in security assistance, including anti-tank missiles, following Zelensky’s speech, there may be a limit to what the Ukrainian President’s appeals can achieve. As CNN’s Kevin Liptak has reported, Biden hadn’t relented in his opposition to a no-fly zone.\n\nThe West’s external conscience\n\nZelensky has already pushed Western leaders further into a conflict that has changed the shape of post-Cold War Europe than they may have thought they were willing to go. His showcase of personal courage put a human face on the conflict and struck a contrast with Putin’s reckless authoritarianism.\n\nWith his actor’s talent, Zelensky knows exactly how to communicate with the citizens of the western nations whose leaders he’s trying to move. He plays on foreign nations’ sense of their own greatness and self-image by evoking history and national mythology.\n\nIn addressing the British House of Commons, for instance, Zelensky drew analogies to wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill and the country’s lonely stand against Nazi tyranny in 1940. “We will fight in the forests, on the shores, in the streets,” he said, echoing a famous Churchill speech in which the great statesman also appealed for help from the “New World” – America – much as Zelensky is doing now. He also borrowed the quintessential Shakespearean line “To be, or not to be” – a meditation on the nature of existence and death – to argue that Ukraine had chosen life and sovereignty or, “to be.”\n\n“Please make sure you do what needs to be done and what is stipulated by the greatness of your country,” Zelensky told British members of parliament.\n\nIn his speech to the Canadian parliament on Tuesday, Zelensky blatantly heaped direct personal pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a father of young children who is one of the NATO leaders who would have to sign off on greater support.\n\n“Imagine that at 4 a.m., each of you start hearing bomb explosions,” Zelensky said. “Severe explosions. Justin, can you imagine hearing – you, your children, hear all these severe explosions: bombing of (the) airport, bombing of Ottawa airport, tens of other cities of your wonderful country. Can you imagine that?”\n\nZelensky also showed a consummate politician’s flair for making a complex or faraway issue relatable to a local audience. He asked Canadians to imagine what it would be like if Vancouver was under siege or if Toronto’s signature CN Tower was bombed. “Each city they are marching through, they are taking down Ukrainian flags. Can you imagine someone taking down your Canadian flags in Montreal and other Canadian cities?” he said.\n\nZelensky is sure to adapt that message for a US audience on Wednesday. Given his facility with historical allusion, it would not be a surprise to hear him reference great wartime presidents and freedom champions like Franklin Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln or America’s own liberation struggle against a superior military power. His speech is also certain to increase domestic political pressure on Biden to do more to support Ukraine and to punish Russia. CNN’s MJ Lee and Lauren Fox reported Tuesday that some congressional leaders are losing patience with the administration’s unwillingness to come closer to Zelensky’s requests.\n\n“Everything Congress has asked to do, the administration has originally said no. And then later on, they say yes after our allies do it,” said Sen. Jim Risch, the top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “It’s slow. It’s excruciating.”\n\nBut Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated opposition on Tuesday to a no-fly zone that could bring US and Russian pilots into direct clashes over Ukraine. “He (Zelensky) already knows that the US is not going to engage directly in Ukraine,” the Kentucky Republican said, though he expressed support for helping Kyiv get old Soviet-era jets.\n\nHis comments reflected the mood in Congress that Zelensky is certain to solidify on Wednesday. Ukraine will get more support but will not be able to escape the geopolitical and nuclear conundrum that stops the West from committing unreservedly to its defense.\n\nA cruel turning point\n\nZelensky’s address comes at a cruel turning point of the conflict, and his refusal to abandon his country puts him in grave danger with Russia intensifying its assault on Kyiv and apparently preparing a siege of the city.\n\nRussia’s slow advance has evolved into a murderous war of attrition as its forces bombard civilian residencies. In the coastal city of Mariupol, which may offer a catastrophic preview of what lies in wait for Kyiv, thousands of civilians are trapped without heat and with water and food running scarce in an unfathomable act of Russian cruelty.\n\nA frenzied international diplomatic effort, meanwhile, has made little headway. Nor have days of talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials on a ceasefire. There is every sign that Putin, despite making his nation a political, cultural and economic pariah, is determined to blast Ukraine into submission to achieve his goal of it never joining the West.\n\nIn a possible show of flexibility on that issue, Zelensky told a UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force in a virtual address Tuesday that it must be “acknowledged” that his country could not join NATO. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer that the possible concession to one of Moscow’s key demands was a “reflection of reality.”\n\nBut there was no immediate sign that Putin, who has rebuffed ceasefire talks, is in any mood to show mercy.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/03/16"}]}

Ron DeSantis made his first appearance as a presidential candidate.\n\n“The tired dogmas of the past are inadequate for a vibrant future. We must look forward, not look backwards,\" DeSantis said. \"We must have the courage to lead, and we must have the strength to win, because the stakes couldn’t be higher.”\n\nA few hundred supporters packed into Eternity Church in Clive, filling the seats of the small auditorium and standing along the grey cinderblock walls. Cheering drowned out the music when Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds welcomed DeSantis to the stage and as he took the podium.\n\nIt was the first public campaign event since DeSantis launched his presidential campaign last week in a Twitter event marred by technical difficulties.\n\nAlthough this is his first swing through Iowa as an official presidential candidate, DeSantis has been a frequent visitor for several months. He sprinkled praise for Reynolds and Iowa's Republican-led legislature throughout his speech, comparing Iowa's political trajectory to Florida's.\n\n“I wish the elites in Washington, D.C., would take a page out of the Iowa playbook, but instead, they have ignored what works and they have continued to plunge this nation into the abyss,\" DeSantis said.\n\nDeSantis will be on the campaign trail Wednesday morning, holding four events across Iowa before traveling to New Hampshire. He will be back in Iowa Saturday for a fundraiser with U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst.\n\nMore:Where and when are presidential candidates visiting Iowa?\n\nRon DeSantis recites his Florida record, notes similarities with Iowa\n\nUnlike many presidential contenders, DeSantis didn’t have to introduce himself to Iowans — his highly-anticipated candidacy comes after two high-profile terms as the governor of Florida, which has been at the vanguard of Republican policy-making in recent years.\n\nInstead, DeSantis presented a lengthy, wide-ranging speech focused on policy, listing dozens of bills he signed into law and lambasting President Joe Biden’s handling of the economy and the U.S.-Mexico border. He made frequent comparisons to Iowa, which has considered or passed many of the same conservative laws as Florida.\n\n“In Florida, we didn't lead with mere words. We followed up our words with deeds, and we have produced a record of accomplishment that we would put up against anybody in this country,\" DeSantis said.\n\nReynolds praised DeSantis for signing a bill that bans most abortions after six weeks: “the same bill that I was proud to sign into law in 2018,” she said, her words swallowed by the crowd's cheers. The Iowa Supreme Court is considering whether to lift a permanent injunction on that law and allow it to take effect.\n\nDeSantis railed against \"indoctrination” in schools — another theme echoed in Republican politics in Florida and Iowa alike.\n\nAs governor, DeSantis has signed legislation to ban instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation, to remove funding for diversity, equity and inclusion offices at state colleges, to restrict care for transgender individuals, and to prohibit the teaching of \"critical race theory,\" which argues that the U.S. still struggles with systemic racism.\n\nThose efforts have led to an ongoing feud with Walt Disney World, the largest employer in Florida, and drawn ire from the NAACP and LGBTQ advocacy groups.\n\nMore:Is Ron DeSantis ready for Iowa prime time? What to watch in first presidential campaign trip\n\nDeSantis framed those laws as victories for Florida and as the future of the Republican Party nationwide. Many Republican-led states, including Iowa, have already followed Florida's lead and passed similar laws.\n\nIowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart said in a statement that DeSantis \"is running for president on the same agenda of taking away freedoms that he enacted in Florida — and ignoring the biggest economic issues that face the middle class.“\n\n\"One thing is certain: No matter who wins the Republican primary, it is absolutely clear that another MAGA presidency would be a disaster for Iowans,\" Hart said.\n\nDeSantis visit precedes Trump — again\n\nOnce again, DeSantis’ Iowa trip coincides with a visit from former President Donald Trump, his most formidable opponent for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump is set to arrive in Des Moines Wednesday night, his campaign said, before events on Thursday.\n\nThe Trump campaign sent an email touting Trump’s strength in the polls and criticizing DeSantis on issues ranging from Social Security to ethanol.\n\n\"With the Republican primary field continuing to expand, I have never been more confident that President Trump is the only person capable of steering our country off this path of destruction to a nation filled with prosperity,\" Iowa Sen. Tim Kraayenbrink said in the email.\n\nAttendees of DeSantis' Tuesday kickoff said they prefer the Florida governor to the former president.\n\nDave Wisnieski, a 60-year-old Clive resident who attended the event, said DeSantis is his top choice for the GOP nomination. He’s ready to move on from Trump and sees DeSantis as the best alternative.\n\n“His policies were good,” he said of Trump. “But with DeSantis, you get an adult that says all the right things and is very presidential.”\n\nDerian Baugh, a 40-year-old Johnston, said he thinks Trump should be held accountable \"for what happened with COVID-19 and the vaccine.\"\n\n\"I think that DeSantis right now has a track record of getting things done, and what matters at the end of the day is putting points on the board and he clearly knows how to do that,\" Baugh said.\n\nRon DeSantis enters the race with national attention, huge war chest\n\nDeSantis comes to Iowa with significantly more name recognition and money in the bank than most presidential hopefuls.\n\nNational support for DeSantis peaked at about 30% earlier this year, according to data compiled by Real Clear Politics. He was running about 15 percentage points behind Trump at the time.\n\nBut the gap has widened since March. The Real Clear Politics rolling average of national polling puts Trump's support at about 54% and DeSantis' at about 21% — a 33-point margin.\n\nA Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll conducted in March showed support for Trump was waning in Iowa. Meanwhile, DeSantis' favorability numbers were on par with Trump's: 80% of Iowa Republicans said they felt favorable toward Trump, compared with 74% who viewed DeSantis favorably.\n\nDespite lagging in the polls, DeSantis has entered the race with millions in the bank. At the beginning of this month, political action committees aligned with DeSantis held tens of millions of dollars more than PACs aligned with Trump.\n\nThe DeSantis campaign raised $8.2 million in the first 24 hours after DeSantis entered the race last week.\n\nHowever, some of DeSantis's funding is under scrutiny.\n\nA campaign watchdog organization Tuesday filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission, accusing DeSantis of violating fund-raising laws by shifting more than $80 million from his state spending committee into a federal one.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit, accused DeSantis and his Friends of Ron DeSantis state political committee, of violating federal, unregulated “soft money” restrictions when they recently transferred funds to a new, Never Back Down federal account.\n\n“We’re talking about funds from billionaires and corporate special interests who could exert massive influence over the candidate they are financing,” said Saurav Ghosh, with the CLC, which has also previously filed complaints against Trump.\n\n“Laws banning these funds from being used to seek office are there for a reason — to prevent corruption, promote transparency and ensure that wealthy special interests can’t rig the system even further in their favor,” he added.\n\nThe complaint also alleges that DeSantis was effectively a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination well before his formal campaign kickoff last week. A pro-Trump super-PAC earlier this year made a similar claim in filing a spending complaint against DeSantis with the Florida Commission on Ethics.\n\nThe DeSantis campaign and his Never Back Down PAC did not immediately respond to questions about the complaint.\n\nJohn Kennedy and Brianne Pfannenstiel contributed reporting to this story.\n\nKatie Akin is a politics reporter for the Register.

Ron DeSantis rarely engaged in the speculation or mudslinging. He insisted a statement victory in his bid for a second term needed to precede any discussion of 2024.\n\nOn Tuesday night, that statement came in the form of a 19-point landslide win over Democrat Charlie Crist – the most lopsided victory by a Republican gubernatorial nominee in Florida history and a gap that dwarfed Trump’s own Sunshine State win in 2020. Within minutes of the polls closing, DeSantis’ Tampa election night party burst into euphoria as the totality and breadth of his resounding performance began to crystalize. DeSantis had turned once-solidly blue counties red, won over a majority of Latino voters and carried on his coattails Republican candidates up and down the ballot and in every corner of the state.\n\n“We not only won election, we have rewritten the political map,” DeSantis declared to his supporters before confetti rained down on him and his family. Some in the crowd urged him to consider a White House bid by chanting, “Two more years!”\n\nThe outcome in Florida was a bright spot for Republicans, who otherwise waited for a red wave that never arrived and watched Trump-backed candidates flounder in key battlegrounds. And the reaction within the GOP has only further fueled momentum for DeSantis to run for president and take on Trump head-on next year.\n\n“DeFuture,” read Wednesday’s front page of the New York Post, owned by conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\n\nRepublicans are particularly encouraged by the result in Latino-majority Miami-Dade County, where DeSantis won 55 percent of the vote, because of what it might suggest about the governor’s ability to engage with and message to Latino communities around the country. A GOP gubernatorial candidate hadn’t won the county in two decades. A CNN exit poll showed DeSantis with an 18-point lead over Crist among Florida Latino voters, a reversal from his first campaign for governor four years ago.\n\nWithin Florida, DeSantis allies are already huddling about what comes next. Even before Election Day, there was a strong sense among those in his orbit that DeSantis would likely launch a presidential campaign regardless of whether Trump did the same. Multiple sources told CNN that DeSantis in recent months has privately suggested to donors that Trump’s divisiveness is a hindrance to enacting conservative priorities, a marked shift in how the governor has discussed his former ally.\n\nAfter Tuesday, more Republicans have gone public in suggesting that the former president’s influence is dragging down the GOP. One source close to DeSantis’ political operation told CNN that he expected the governor to make a decision “soon after inauguration” in January, though he may not publicize it.\n\nDeSantis, the source added, “must take action” and capitalize on Trump’s midterms setback.\n\n“There’s no way to deny Donald Trump got fired Tuesday night,” Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican who has been critical of Trump, told “CNN This Morning” on Thursday. “The search committee has brought a few names to the top of the list and Ron DeSantis is one of them. I think Ron DeSantis is being rewarded for a new thought process with Republicans and that solid leadership.”\n\nStill, the timing of a 2024 campaign launch, if it happens, remains up in the air. When reports first emerged that Trump intended to kickstart his presidential campaign in mid-November, those in DeSantis’ circle braced for the possibility of a quick turnaround from the midterm to a presidential primary showdown. Now, several consultants in Florida say DeSantis likely won’t formally jump into the presidential field until after state lawmakers meet for their annual legislative session. That would put DeSantis on a timeline of a May or June announcement.\n\n“Build anticipation,” one longtime Republican fundraiser with knowledge of DeSantis’ operation said. “I think DeSantis controls the time frame. As much as everyone anticipates things and you want to move quickly, he calls the shots now.”\n\nEven those with access to DeSantis caution that he has not come to a final decision about his future and they say he has maintained a tight circle as he weighs his options. The governor’s brain trust is notoriously small. It consists of himself and his wife, Casey. But sources said the DeSantises also are hyper aware that he has a window to make a 2024 move, and though it widened after Tuesday, it might not stay open forever.\n\n“You have a moment,” one GOP pollster told CNN before Election Day. “Something could come up in a second term that knocks him down.”\n\nThe intrigue surrounding a potential Trump-DeSantis showdown reached the White House on Wednesday. Asked which of the two Republican rivals would be the tougher 2024 competitor, President Joe Biden remarked, “It’d be fun watching them take on each other.”\n\nPlanning red meat for spring\n\nMultiple sources told CNN that DeSantis will orchestrate a legislative session full of conservative priorities that he can carry into a GOP presidential primary. Republicans won a super majority in both chambers of the Florida legislature Tuesday, allowing DeSantis to make good on promises to further restrict abortion and make it easier to carry a firearm in public.\n\nThe legislative session will be “as red meat as you can possibly imagine,” a GOP consultant said. “Whatever he proposes, they will pass it, and it will become law.”\n\nThe Republican fundraiser said that “anything ‘woke’ they can find to kill within their path, they’re going to do that” and predicted that financial institutions, in particular, would be a DeSantis target this spring.\n\nIn the meantime, DeSantis will continue to build out a political operation that has already proved it can raise money at an impressive clip. His reelection effort brought in more $200 million between his two political committees, according to state campaign finance reports, pulling money in from deep-pocketed donors and grassroots Republicans alike to shatter national fundraising records for a gubernatorial campaign. As of November 3, those committees had $66 million in unspent cash. CNN previously reported that DeSantis’ political team has explored how to transfer the unused money into a federal committee that could support a presidential campaign. That remains the plan, sources confirmed.\n\nHe is also expected to continue political travel outside the state to raise money and grow his brand. After avoiding public events outside Florida for most of his first term, DeSantis in August took the calculated gamble to hold rallies in support of Republican candidates in some of the country’s most contested races for governor and US Senate. He continued to travel up until 10 days before the election.\n\nHowever, DeSantis stuck largely to midterm battlegrounds and avoided early nominating states where appearances can set off presidential buzz. Stephen Stepanek, the chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party, said DeSantis’ political operation turned down multiple requests to address voters there and the state GOP has had “virtually no contact with the governor.” Despite the hype around DeSantis, Stepanek predicted it will be difficult for the Florida governor to overcome Trump in the nation’s first primary in New Hampshire. Trump’s victory in the 2016 New Hampshire primary served as the launching point to him winning the GOP nomination.\n\n“People not only still have their 2020 signs out, but they have 2024 signs,” Stepanek said. “It’s still Trump country here in New Hampshire.”\n\n‘When people bring up DeSantis today, I bring up Scott Walker’\n\nDespite the tailwinds from Tuesday, DeSantis nevertheless faces an uphill climb to win over GOP primary voters whose loyalty to Trump has not wavered.\n\nAt home, Republicans are divided but seem to favor DeSantis. While 33% of Florida voters want to see Trump run again in 2024, 45% said DeSantis should take the plunge, according to the preliminary results of the Florida exit poll conducted for CNN and other news networks by Edison Research.\n\nJC Martin, the chairman of the Polk County Republican Party, said it would be a waste for DeSantis to go up against Trump because he “still has plenty of work to do in Florida and he’s a shoo-in for 2028.”\n\n“I’m not looking for an all-out party war in this next primary,” Martin said.\n\nBut Shawn Foster, a Republican state committeeman for Pasco County, said the GOP “needs a new face” and he hopes it is DeSantis.\n\n“I think the party needs it, and I think independents would look more for that,” Foster said.\n\nNationally, DeSantis must avoid the perception that he is peaking too soon, a pitfall for countless GOP stars who came before him.\n\n“When people bring up DeSantis today, I bring up Scott Walker,” Bob Vander Plaats, an influential conservative leader in the early nominating state of Iowa, told CNN earlier this year, drawing comparisons to the former Wisconsin governor who was an early favorite in 2016 before his campaign stalled.\n\nLike Walker, DeSantis’ agenda has won over conservative editorial boards and Beltway think tanks. He relishes confrontations with reporters, flaunting a brash style similar to the one that endeared New Jersey’s Chris Christie to many GOP voters. He has built a fundraising machine that rivals Florida’s Jeb Bush.\n\nThose past governors all acted on presidential ambitions; Trump crushed their dreams.\n\n“If in fact you go into a presidential primary with Donald Trump and think you’re going to kick his ass, you got another thing coming,” one Republican consultant in Florida told CNN.\n\nTrump publicly lashed out at DeSantis in the final days of the midterm cycle while privately stewing over the perceived disloyalty from a former political disciple. He nicknamed DeSantis “Ron DeSanctimonious” at an event Saturday in Pennsylvania and held a rally in Miami two days before the election without inviting the home-state governor.\n\nDeSantis declined to engage and instead held competing rallies on Florida’s opposite coast.\n\nIn an interview before Election Day, Trump warned against a challenge from DeSantis.\n\n“I don’t know if he is running. I think if he runs, he could hurt himself very badly,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News Digital. “I think he would be making a mistake. I think the base would not like it – I don’t think it would be good for the party…I would tell you things about him that won’t be very flattering.”\n\nTrump later downplayed Tuesday’s election results, noting he received “more votes” than DeSantis in Florida in 2020. Presidential races usually have much higher turnout than midterms and Trump’s margin of victory over Biden was about 3 points.\n\nIt will only grow more difficult for DeSantis to avoid talk of Trump and 2024 in the weeks ahead, though he may still try. On Wednesday morning, DeSantis, his voice hoarse from a demanding closing campaign schedule and election night celebrations, held a news conference to brief Floridians on Tropical Storm Nicole.\n\nDeSantis didn’t mention the election results. And he left without taking questions.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Steve Contorno"], "publish_date": "2022/11/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/15/politics/trump-2024-presidential-bid/index.html", "title": "Donald Trump announces a White House bid for 2024 | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2024.\n\n“In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the United States,” Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign will be headquartered.\n\nSurrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden administration’s policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived accomplishments – from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious freedom initiatives – remain deeply polarizing to this day.\n\nAs Trump spoke to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate “a politician or conventional candidate” if it wants to win back the White House.\n\n“This will not be my campaign, this will be our campaign all together,” Trump said.\n\nTrump’s long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP’s underwhelming midterm elections performance – including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers – and the subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.\n\nTrump’s paperwork establishing his candidacy landed with the Federal Election Committee shortly before he delivered his announcement at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTo the delight of aides and allies who have long advised him to mount a forward-looking campaign, he spent only a fraction of his remarks repeating his lies about the 2020 election. Though he advocated for the use of paper ballots and likened America’s election system to that of “third world countries,” Trump also tried at times to broaden his grievances – lamenting the “massive corruption” and “entrenched interests” that in his view have consumed Washington. Many of Trump’s top advisers have expressed concern that his fixation on promoting conspiracies about the last presidential election would make it harder for him to win a national election in 2024.\n\nThroughout the hour-long speech, Trump made clear that he wants his campaign to be seen by Republicans as a sacrificial undertaking.\n\n“Anyone who truly seeks to take on this rigged and corrupt system will be faced with a storm of fire that only a few could understand,” he said at one point, describing the legal and emotional toll his presidency and post-presidential period has taken on his family members.\n\nOn the heels of last week’s midterm elections, Trump has been blamed for elevating flawed candidates who spent too much time parroting his claims about election fraud, alienating key voters and ultimately leading to their defeats. He attempted to counter that criticism on Tuesday, noting that Republicans appear poised to retake the House majority and touting at least one Trump-endorsed candidate, Kevin Kiley of California. At one point, Trump appeared to blame his party’s midterm performance on voters not yet realizing “the total effect of the suffering” after two years of Democratic control in Washington.\n\n“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country – and the voting will be much different,” he claimed.\n\nBeating others to the punch\n\nTrump is betting that his first-out-of-the gate strategy will fend off potential primary rivals and give him an early advantage with deep-pocketed donors, aides say. He is widely expected to be challenged by both conservative and moderate Republicans, though the calculus of some presidential hopefuls could change now that he is running. Others – like his former Vice President, Mike Pence – may proceed anyway.\n\nTrump’s third presidential bid also coincides with a period of heightened legal peril as Justice Department officials investigating him and his associates revisit the prospect of indictments in their Trump-related probes. The former president is currently being investigated for his activities before and during the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and his retention of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left office. While Trump is counting on an easy path to the GOP nomination with his sustained support among the party’s base, his announcement is likely to dash the hopes of party leaders who have longed for fresh talent. In particular, top Republicans have been paying close attention to the next moves of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who won his reelection contest with a 19-point margin of victory and considerable support from minority and independent voters. Some Republican leaders may try to scuttle Trump’s campaign by elevating or encouraging alternative candidates, including DeSantis, who has been quietly laying the groundwork for a possible White House bid of his own.\n\nOf course, any countereffort to inhibit Trump’s path to the nomination is likely to prove difficult. Despite his myriad legal entanglements and the stain of January 6, the twice-impeached 45th president remains immensely popular among most Republican voters and boasts a deep connection with his core backers that could prove difficult for other GOP hopefuls to replicate or weaken. Even leading conservatives who disliked Trump’s pugnacious politics and heterodox policies stuck with him as president because he helped solidify the rightward shift of the US Supreme Court with his nominations – one of the most far-reaching aspects of his legacy, which resulted in the conservative court majority’s deeply polarizing June decision to end federal abortion rights. In fact, while Trump ended his first term with the lowest approval rating of any president, Republicans viewed him favorably, according to a May NBC News poll. That alone could give Trump a significant edge over primary opponents whom voters are still familiarizing themselves with.\n\nAmong those potential competitors is Pence, who would likely benefit from high name recognition due to his role as vice president. Pence, who has been preparing for a possible White House run in 2024, is sure to face an uphill battle courting Trump’s most loyal supporters, many of whom soured on the former vice president after he declined to overstep his congressional authority and block certification of now-President Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Trump could also find himself pitted against DeSantis, who has risen to hero status among cultural conservatives and who is widely considered a more polished version of Trump. Even some of the former president’s advisers have voiced similar observations to CNN, noting that DeSantis also made inroads with major Republican donors during his quest for reelection and built a mountain of goodwill with GOP leaders by campaigning for federal and statewide Republican candidates in the middle of his own race.\n\nBeyond his potential rivals, Trump has another roadblock in his path as the House select committee continues to investigate his role in January 6, 2021, and Justice Department officials weigh whether to issue criminal charges. The committee, which subpoenaed him for testimony and documents in October and which Trump is now battling in court, held public hearings throughout the summer and early fall featuring depositions from those in Trump’s inner circle at the White House – including members of his family – that detailed his public and private efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results through a sustained pressure campaign on numerous local, state and federal officials, and on his own vice president.\n\nBut Trump’s desire to announce his campaign early can be especially traced to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which advisers say further emboldened his decision to mount what he believes will be a triumphant political comeback. The day after the search, the former president fielded calls from allies advising him to accelerate his 2024 timeline. That night, he huddled with House lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee and told them he’d “made up his mind” about launching a bid, though some of those same House Republicans later convinced him to wait until after the midterm elections to announce his next move.\n\nFew of those lawmakers were present for Trump’s speech on Tuesday, choosing to remain in Washington as House Republicans conducted their leadership elections and the party continues to grapple with its failures in highly prized midterm races. Rather, the room was filled with prominent election deniers like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, several of Trump’s attorneys, and past and present aides. Before he entered the room on Tuesday alongside former first lady Melania Trump, several members of the ex-president’s family were also seen filtering into the ballroom, including Eric and Lara Trump, his son Barron, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. His eldest son was notably missing, along with daughter Ivanka, , who has since said she will no longer be involved in the political arena. A source close to Donald Trump Jr. said he was stuck on a hunting trip in the mountain west and unable to catch a flight back to Florida in time for his father’s announcement. Other guests included longtime Trump adviser Roger Stone; outgoing North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn; former congressman and the current CEO of Trump’s Truth Social app Devin Nunes; and his chief political adviser Susie Wiles.\n\nPreparing for 2024\n\nFrom the moment Trump left Washington, defeated and disgraced, in January 2021, he began plotting a return to power – devoting the bulk of his time to building a political operation intended for this moment. With assistance from numerous former aides and advisers, he continued the aggressive fundraising tactics that had become a marker of his 2020 campaign, amassing a colossal war chest ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, and worked diligently to elect steadfast allies in both Congress and state legislatures across the country.\n\nWhile maintaining a home base in Florida, he also regularly jet-setted across the country for campaign rallies that afforded him crucial face time with his base and with candidates he bet would become valuable allies in the US Senate and House.\n\nThrough it all, Trump continued to falsely insist that the 2020 election was stolen from him, indulging in far-flung conspiracy theories about voter fraud and pressuring Republican leaders across the party’s election apparatus to endorse changes that would curtail voting rights.\n\nTrump’s aides were pleased earlier this fall when his public appearances and rally speeches gradually became more focused on rising crime, immigration and economic woes – key themes throughout the midterm cycle and issues they hope will enable him to draw a compelling contrast with Biden as he begins this next chapter. Allies of the former president have long said that he views the 2024 contest as an opportunity to regain what he believes is his: another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nBut there is no guarantee that Trump will glide easily to a nonconsecutive second term. In fact, it could be quite difficult.\n\nNot only does history offer just one example of such a feat (defeated in 1888 after his first term, President Grover Cleveland was elected again in 1892), no previously impeached president has ever run again for office. Trump was first impeached in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice, and then again in 2021 for inciting the riot at the US Capitol. Though he was acquitted by the Senate both times, 10 House Republicans broke with their party the second time around to join Democrats in a vote to impeach him. Seven Republican senators voted to convict him at his Senate trial.\n\nTrump has also been the subject of a bevy of lawsuits and investigations, including a New York state investigation and a separate Manhattan district attorney criminal probe into his company’s finances, a Georgia county probe into his efforts to overturn Biden’s election win in the state, and separate Justice Department probes into his campaign’s scheme to put forth fake electors in battleground states and his decision to bring classified materials with him to Mar-a-Lago upon leaving office.\n\nTrump’s actions since he left Washington have, for the most part, signaled his interest in an eventual return. While most former presidents go quietly into retirement – resurfacing to assist their parties during midterm cycles or for the opening of their presidential libraries – Trump bucked tradition to instead plot the comeback he now hopes to make. Despite its distance from Washington, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club has transformed into a new hub for Republicans and a home base for his political machine. Assisted by a small group of paid staffers, he has hosted numerous candidate and committee fundraisers and seen a rotating cast of party leaders and congressional hopefuls filter through its gilded hallways in the hopes of nabbing his endorsement or reingratiating themselves with his base. Trump’s schedule has enabled him to build close relationships with party leaders and fringe figures – from House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy of California to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia – whose support in a contested primary could ultimately help him clear the field. Many of the aides who have been with him since he left the White House are expected to continue on as campaign hands, as the former president and his de facto chief of staff, longtime Florida GOP strategist Wiles, aim to maintain a lean operation much like the early days of his 2016 presidential campaign. Among those who are likely to be involved are Wiles, Taylor Budowich, Chris LaCivita, Steven Cheung, Justin Caporale and Brian Jack. Brad Parscale, who managed part of Trump’s failed 2020 campaign will not be part of his 2024 operation, nor will Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was deeply involved in his quest for reelection.\n\nTime in office\n\nAs president, Trump faced criticism over several of his actions, especially his management of the worst public health crisis in nearly a century – the Covid-19 pandemic – though his administration helped facilitate the development of vaccines to treat the novel coronavirus in record time. He also was blasted by critics over his handling of Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017; the White nationalist rally, also in 2017, in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Heather Heyer was killed while walking with a group of counterprotesters; and Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nWhile in office, Trump signed sweeping tax cuts into law, enacted controversial hard-line immigration policies, including a policy that separated migrant children from their families and one known as “Remain in Mexico,” which the US Supreme Court ruled in June could be ended by his successor, and appointed hundreds of federal judges with deep conservative credentials. He also successfully nominated three Supreme Court justices, whose decisions this year as part of the court’s majority have shifted American society and laws rightward on issues such as abortion, guns, religious freedom and climate change.\n\nThe former real estate businessman and reality TV star was first elected to office in 2016, beating out a wide field of more than a dozen GOP candidates in an ugly primary, and then prevailing over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a contentious general election, despite sexual misconduct allegations that would have typically been campaign-ending.\n\nAs president, Trump was an impulsive leader, who dispensed with long-standing norms, often announcing policy and Cabinet personnel changes on Twitter. (He was ultimately banned from the platform following the US Capitol riot and was later barred from Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube as well.)\n\nHe pushed an “America First” foreign policy approach, pulling the US out of international agreements such as the Paris climate accord and the Iran nuclear deal, a pair of controversial moves that were decried by many of America’s top European allies.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story mistakenly said who was likely to be involved in the Trump campaign.

He finally scratched that itch on Tuesday night, formally declaring his candidacy for the 2024 race.\n\nAnd no one should be happier about it than Ron DeSantis.\n\nThe Florida governor is widely expected to run for the Republican presidential nomination. But, at least on Wednesday, he showed no signs of urgency to enter the race now that Trump is in.\n\n“I mean, seriously. We just ran an election,” DeSantis said, as CNN’s Steve Contorno reported. “We have this Georgia runoff coming, which is very important for Republicans to win that Georgia runoff.”\n\nWhich is a perfect strategy for DeSantis to take – and one that makes Trump look a) needy and b) more focused on himself than the Republican Party.\n\nThink about all of this from DeSantis’ perspective. He just cruised to a second term as governor of Florida, winning by a stunning 19 points. It was, without question, the best moment for Republicans in an election that was, as a whole, disappointing for the party.\n\n“It was not so bright in many other parts of the country,” DeSantis said Wednesday. “It was a substandard performance, given the dynamics that are at play.”\n\nDeSantis is already well-known nationally and his victory last Tuesday only raised that profile.\n\nIn short: DeSantis is right where he wants to be. And he wants to revel in it for a while.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, looks a bit desperate. Despite some of his allies advising him to wait to launch his presidential campaign until after the December 6 runoff in Georgia, Trump decided he needed to get in the race immediately. Which, candidly, looks somewhat weak – especially when you consider that Trump has already faced much of the blame for Republicans falling short of expectations in the midterms.\n\nEven before Trump formally entered the race, he was clearly very aware of – and nervous about – the prospect of a DeSantis candidacy.\n\n“I would tell you things about him that won’t be very flattering – I know more about him than anybody – other than, perhaps, his wife,” Trump said on Election Day. He has also taken to referring to the governor as “Ron DeSanctimonious.”\n\nWhich is, of course, vintage Trump.\n\nBut the more DeSantis looks to be above the fray, the more magnanimous he looks. He looks more like the front-runner, making decisions on his own terms rather than reacting to every move that Trump makes.\n\nThat would mark a major departure from the 2016 Republican presidential primary, when candidates allowed Trump to dictate the terms and pace, constantly reacting to his latest attack.\n\nDeSantis has clearly learned a lesson from that race. On Tuesday, he dismissed Trump’s attacks as “noise,” urging people to “check out the scoreboard last Tuesday night.”\n\nWhat this early maneuvering suggests is that DeSantis is going to run a far different campaign than those waged by Republicans who fought and lost to Trump in the 2016 election. He won’t be rushed into the race by Trump and will do his best to avoid getting down in the mud – at least at the start – with the former president.\n\nGiven how little success past candidates had in trying to out-Trump Trump, it’s a worthwhile strategy.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/03/02/ron-desantis-announces-first-iowa-trip-for-2024-presidential-caucuses/69959827007/", "title": "Ron DeSantis announces first Iowa trip for 2024 presidential caucuses", "text": "Florida Gov.

Kim Reynolds at both events March 10. DeSantis has been traveling the country discussing his \"Florida blueprint\" and promoting his new book, which was released earlier this week.\n\nPolling shows that DeSantis has risen as an early favorite in the Republican presidential primary race, particularly as a possible foil to former president Donald Trump, who announced a campaign late last year. This will be DeSantis's first visit to the first-in-the-nation caucus state.\n\nHe will appear with Reynolds, who will host a pair of interview-style conversations at each event, the official said.\n\nThe pair held a similar panel discussion at a retreat DeSantis hosted for top donors in Palm Beach, Florida, last weekend where they compared notes on their agendas and leadership styles.\n\nBoth governors saw their national profiles rise as they fought against shutdowns and mask mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic and leaned into controversial culture war issues, such as restrictions on transgender athletes and a \"parents rights\" agenda focusing on what's taught in public schools.\n\nReynolds emerged out of the pandemic and the 2022 midterms uniquely powerful among Iowa Republicans who say she could use her influence to play kingmaker in this year's caucus cycle. But she has promised to stay neutral and offer her guidance to every candidate who comes through the state.\n\nMore:Uniquely powerful, Kim Reynolds could be a caucus kingmaker. Why she won't play favorites.\n\nAlready she's appeared with former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and South Carolina U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, giving the pair glowing introductions at their Des Moines-area events last week. Haley announced her candidacy in February, and Scott may launch a campaign later this year.\n\nIt's a clear signal from Iowa's top Republican official that caucusgoers are eager to hear from every candidate who campaigns in the state, even as Trump mounts a third campaign and seeks to reenergize the base of voters who supported him here in 2016 and 2020.\n\nAlthough many Iowa political observers didn't expect to see DeSantis until after the end of the Florida legislative session later this spring, his first visit to the state could pre-empt Trump, who has yet to arrive.\n\nThat is expected to change quickly, though. Trump said during a Tuesday interview on WHO Radio's Simon Conway Show that he plans to be back \"very soon\" with a formal announcement expected to come this week.\n\nHe has also hired four senior staffers in the state who will make up the backbone of his Iowa operation.\n\nMore:Iowa's 50 Most Wanted: These Republicans will help shape the 2024 presidential caucuses\n\nHaley is also scheduled to be in Iowa March 10.

Ron DeSantis is widely being discussed as a potential 2024 candidate for Republicans – and he’s doing little to knock down that chatter. And, his state of the state speech on Tuesday gave us all a preview of how DeSantis would run if he runs.\n\n“Florida has become the escape hatch for those chafing under authoritarian, arbitrary and seemingly never-ending mandates and restrictions,” DeSantis said, adding that Florida was now “the freest state in these United States.”\n\nDeSantis repeatedly touted his willingness to buck so-called conventional wisdom during his first term – particularly when it came to dealing with the spread of Covid-19 in his state. DeSantis made mention of his decision to re-open Florida schools fully in the fall of 2020.\n\n“We were right and they were wrong,” DeSantis said, in what could easily double for a presidential campaign if/when he runs.\n\nAnd, make no mistake: What DeSantis was doing in his speech was positioning himself for just such a run. Which feels like a natural next step from the first three years of DeSantis’ time as governor; he has used his position to not only differentiate himself on Covid-19 mandates (and masking) but play directly into the arms of the Donald Trump base of the party – on everything from “woke” culture in education to restrictive voting rights in the state.\n\nVoters have taken notice. At CPAC’s annual 2021 gathering, two straw polls were conducted. The former President won the first straw poll. DeSantis won the second, Trump-less one. (DeSantis took 21% in the straw poll with Trump, the only candidate other than the former president to gain double-digit support.)\n\nIn a Reuters national poll released in late December, DeSantis was the only potential candidate not named Trump to make it into double digits – although his 11% was well behind the former President’s 54%. That same poll showed that eight in 10 Republican voters knew who DeSantis was and 66% had a favorable impression of him.\n\nTrump is taking notice of DeSantis’ jockeying.\n\nIn an interview with OANN that ran Tuesday, the former President appeared to take issue with DeSantis’ ongoing unwillingness to say whether he has received a booster shot for Covid-19.\n\n“I watched a couple of politicians be interviewed and one of the questions was, ‘Did you get the booster?’” Trump said. “Because they had the vaccine, and they’re answering like – in other words, the answer is ‘yes,’ but they don’t want to say it, because they’re gutless. You gotta say it, whether you had it or not, say it.”\n\nWhich isn’t the first time that Trump has thrown a bit of a blowback pitch at the Florida governor.\n\n“If I faced him, I’d beat him like I would beat everyone else,” Trump said of DeSantis late last year. “I think most people would drop out, I think he would drop out.”\n\n(Worth noting: DeSantis, unlike others – such as former Gov. Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina – being mentioned as potential 2024 candidates, has not said he would stay out of the race if Trump won.)\n\nWhat DeSantis’ speech on Tuesday makes clear is exactly how he would position himself in a 2024 race: Trumpism without all of the antics, lies and distractions that the former President creates. The promise is that he will fight the Washington swamp, the “fake news” and those who would make America less free, he will just do it without all of the tweets and the chaos that Trump creates.\n\nWhich isn’t a bad argument given where the current iteration of the Republican party now finds itself. DeSantis, of course, would face a major uphill climb if Trump decides to run in two years’ time. But, if Trump – for whatever reason – decides to take a pass, DeSantis could well be in the pole position in the race.\n\nAnd, as his state of the state speech makes clear, he is gearing up for that possibility.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/01/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/23/desantis-presidential-announcement-musk-twitter-how-to-watch/70249936007/", "title": "How to watch: Gov.

Instead, he emerges from Tuesday’s underwhelming election night facing questions about his political future and with the momentum behind Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, potentially his potential chief nemesis in a 2024 primary.\n\nWith key races still too early to call in Arizona and Nevada, and with Georgia heading to a Senate runoff, Trump entered Wednesday with few victories to tout and the possibility that they might soon be overshadowed by further losses.\n\nHis chosen candidates for open Senate seats in Ohio and North Carolina prevailed, as did incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. But he lost a critical Senate contest in Pennsylvania, where Mehmet Oz, whom he backed in the primary despite widespread concerns about his electability, was defeated by Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. In Michigan, Trump’s candidate in the governor’s race failed to unseat Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. And while Republicans still appear to be on track to capture a House majority, it is likely to be far slimmer than initially thought.\n\nAs powerful as Trump is in the Republican Party, we learned that he cannot anoint anyone a winner. You still need candidates who have the fundamentals,” said Bryan Lanza, a longtime Trump adviser.\n\nOthers were more blunt in their assessment of Tuesday’s known outcomes.\n\nEx-Trump official: Election shows that Trump is holding GOP back 00:49 - Source: CNN\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, a Texas Republican who won reelection and was endorsed by Trump, appeared to cast the former president as a drag on other GOP candidates in a radio interview Wednesday.\n\n“There’s just a lot of negative attitudes about Trump,” Nehls said. In a statement to CNN after this story published, the congressman said he remains supportive of Trump and “will support him as the 47th president.”\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday morning, a current Trump adviser, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, conceded that Trump “is in a tough spot coming out of tonight.”\n\n“Two narratives are going to take hold over the next week and neither one is going to be easy to dispel,” the adviser said.\n\nAcutely aware of his unprecedented involvement in Republican primaries earlier this year, this adviser and other Trump allies said they expect the former president will be blamed for elevating flawed candidates in some of the party’s most important contests – especially Oz, a daytime talk show host who had barely resided in Pennsylvania before launching his Senate campaign there.\n\nTrump’s disappointment was palpable inside the gilded ballroom at his Mar-a-Lago estate, where he gathered with dozens of aides, allies and donors to watch returns on Tuesday evening. When he returned to the party halfway through the night following a private dinner, his mood had visibly shifted.\n\n“Interesting evening,” he shouted to reporters before taking the stage for brief and unenthused remarks.\n\nAs the crowd dwindled, Trump sat at a table in front of a television tuned to Fox News with just a handful of advisers. Meanwhile, several guests whose names appeared on a VIP list that one Trump adviser circulated to reporters were nowhere to be found, including some who apparently decided to skip the event – surfacing as television pundits throughout the night from studios elsewhere in the country.\n\nThe end result was the exact scenario Trump’s advisers had hoped to avoid: an election where his top recruits fizzled or flopped and his primary Republican rival soared to new stardom.\n\nSources familiar with the matter said Trump left the party at the end of the night in a sour mood and resentful of the attention on DeSantis, who won reelection with a monstrous margin of victory and became the first Republican governor to carry Miami-Dade County, a densely populated and diverse area, for the first time in two decades. Just hours before the Florida governor’s victory, Trump had trashed DeSantis in comments to reporters aboard his 757 plane, threatening to dish unflattering information about him and suggesting he could have been more “gracious” for Trump’s endorsement in his 2018 bid for the governor’s mansion.\n\n“It wasn’t a great night for Trump and makes 2024 more competitive,” said one Republican operative.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, Trump was in touch with allies in early 2024 voting states as he worked to develop a message that could carry him forward, according to two people briefed on those talks. In Iowa, Trump plans to tout Republican Brenna Bird’s defeat of incumbent Democratic Attorney General Tom Miller even though he didn’t endorse Bird until November 5, three days before her election.\n\nAs he works to plot his next steps, one of the biggest questions he is grappling with is how to approach DeSantis, sources said.\n\nBefore his resounding success on Tuesday, the Florida governor “was already having a moment but the spotlight just quadrupled in intensity,” said one Trump adviser.\n\n“We’ve got to figure out how to get it back before next Tuesday,” the Trump adviser added, referring to the “big announcement” Trump has teased for November 15, when he is expected to formally declare his third campaign for the White House. DeSantis’ strength was reflected in CNN exit polls on Tuesday, which showed the Republican governor exceeding President Joe Biden’s 2020 margin of victory among Latino voters in Florida and maintaining a small edge among independents, which Biden carried in the state by 11 points two years ago.\n\nBoth data points could prove compelling GOP primary between DeSantis and Trump, who made inroads with Black and Hispanic voters in some 2020 states but not to the degree of the Florida Republican.\n\nTwo people close to the former president said he backed himself into a corner by publicly setting a date for his expected campaign announcement before the outcome of the midterm elections was known, something he did at an Ohio campaign rally on election eve to compromise with allies who did not want him to use the event as the launch site for his campaign.\n\n“He has to [announce],” said a source close to Trump, adding that it is too late for him to back out. “It would be embarrassing.”\n\nAnother Trump ally noted it would be “less embarrassing to delay than to get out there to a bunch of silence.”\n\nSome in Trump’s circle hoped a runoff in Georgia could help the former president delay the announcement and save face.\n\nTrump adviser Jason Miller said that Herschel Walker – who will face Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in a December 6 runoff, CNN projected Wednesday – should be the priority.\n\n“I’ll be advising him to delay it until after the Georgia runoff, assuming that’s where the race is still trending,” Miller said.\n\nOthers expect that advice will fall on deaf ears. One source noted that Trump had so far been resistant to arguments that he should postpone his announcement and as of Wednesday morning, it was still unclear to some of the former president’s closest aides how he would handle his 2024 ambitions. Would he proceed defiantly – launching a campaign with disregard for the potential obstacles that lie ahead – or entertain a rare recalculation?\n\n“I could see him claiming that Republicans didn’t turn out in droves because he wasn’t on the ballot and blaming everyone but himself,” said one of his advisers.\n\nDesire to be a kingmaker\n\nFor Trump, Tuesday’s underwhelming results followed months of intense engagement in a midterm cycle that marked a notable departure from the post-presidential activities of his modern predecessors. As early as last summer, he began working to recruit candidates for key Senate contests who would advance his false claims about the 2020 election.\n\n“He wanted to be seen as a legendary kingmaker,” said a former Trump campaign official.\n\nBy this spring, Trump was directly meddling in contested primaries – endorsing candidates he deemed to be the most MAGA, criticizing their opponents in statements and Truth Social posts, and patently ignoring advice from some of his advisers to remain on the sidelines until the general election began. Trump often argued that his involvement would pay dividends in the end, not only ushering in majorities in both congressional chambers but ensuring elected officials loyal to him – not the party – were installed in Washington and key governor’s mansions.\n\nIn many cases, even candidates that Trump didn’t endorse emblazoned their campaign websites with his image or familiar phrases like “America First” or “MAGA fighter.” Throughout the cycle, GOP contenders regularly trekked to Mar-a-Lago to seek his support. Others shelled out thousands of dollars to host fundraising events at the waterfront property, hoping the former president would take note of their devotion and reward them with an endorsement.\n\nTrump ended the cycle by spending more than $16 million through his MAGA Inc. super PAC in the final weeks to boost many of his hand-picked candidates and link his top Democratic targets to Biden, who has grappled with sinking favorability during his first two years in office. Hours before results began pouring in on Tuesday, Trump’s team circulated a memo touting his “unprecedented success in 2022” that quantified his campaign trail appearances and assistance to Republican candidates.\n\n“President Donald J. Trump has endorsed over 330 candidates this election cycle,” the memo read, adding that Trump has “raised nearly $350 million” for GOP candidates and the party overall since leaving office.\n\nWith votes still being tabulated in some states, it is unclear just how many of the hundreds of candidates who earned Trump’s endorsement prevailed on Tuesday. What is clear is that Trump allies entered Tuesday night believing it would be an undeniable success for the 45th president.\n\nAs he gathered with other Trump campaign alums at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, Miller described the former president as a “juggernaut” at the beginning of the evening.\n\n“It will be a much different-looking party now because of the Trump MAGA movement,” Miller had predicted.\n\nAsked about the 330 endorsements that could make or break his political future, Trump himself began the night suggesting that he should emerge on the other side of the midterms unblemished, telling NewsNation hours before polls closed, “I think if they win, I should get all the credit. If they lose, I should not be blamed at all.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional statement from Rep.

Ron DeSantis' presidential announcement on Twitter ...", "text": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign got off to a rocky start Wednesday when his announcement event on Twitter was plagued by technical difficulties, which persisted for more than 20 minutes before the governor was able to deliver his speech and participate in a question-and-answer session.\n\nDeSantis filed his presidential paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday afternoon, making him an official candidate. The 6 p.m. Twitter event with company CEO Elon Musk and moderator David Sacks was DeSantis' first opportunity to publicly tout his campaign, and it did not start well.\n\nSacks attributed the problems to strong interest in the event, saying \"we’ve got so many people here that we are kind of melting the servers, which is a good sign.\"\n\nPolitics:Biden says 'it's time to act' on gun reform, marking one year since Uvalde school shooting\n\nFlorida:DeSantis makes it official, files to run for president in 2024\n\nWhatever the cause, the technical glitches marred what was supposed to be a triumphant moment for DeSantis as he debuted as a national candidate after years of buzz about his presidential potential.\n\nThe malfunctions also undercut one of DeSantis' central campaign themes, that he is a more disciplined and competent leader than former President Donald Trump.\n\nWhen DeSantis finally did get going, he plowed forward with a speech touching on a range of issues, including policing the border, maintaining \"law and order\" and freeing the military of \"distractions\" such as \"gender ideology and pronouns.\" He also highlighted some of these issues in an announcement video.\n\nDeSantis talked up his record as governor, saying \"our results in Florida have been second to none.\" He criticized President Joe Biden, arguing he has \"allowed woke ideology to drive his agenda\" and pledging to reverse his policies.\n\n\"You can't do any of that if you don't win; there is no substitute for victory. We must end the culture of losing that has infected the Republican Party in recent years,\" DeSantis said.\n\nHe added, \"Voters who are participating in this primary process, my pledge to you is this: If you nominate me you can set your clock to Jan. 20, 2025 at high noon because on the west side of the U.S. Capitol I will be taking the oath of office as the 47th president of the United States. No excuses, I will get the job done.\"\n\nThe comments speak to Republican voters' frustration after poor performances in recent elections, and are an implicit criticism of Trump's influence on the GOP during that period.\n\nAfter his speech, DeSantis participated in a question-and-answer session with Musk, Sacks and others supportive of his campaign that touched on his COVID-19 record, education policies, immigration and other issues.\n\nConservative activist Christopher Rufo, appointed by DeSantis to the New College of Florida board to carry out a controversial makeover of the liberal arts school, was among the questioners. He asked DeSantis how he would institute policies touching on race and gender issues at the federal level, noting \"D.C. is another animal, it's quite different, the scale.\"\n\nDeSantis argued he has public opinion on his side when it comes to issues such as eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs in higher education.\n\n\"I just know instinctively kind of what, like, normal people think about all this stuff and I have a good sense of when the legacy media and the left are outside of where the average American is because people want you to be using common sense,\" DeSantis said.\n\nThere were 301,000 people listening to the announcement event when it ended.\n\nKicking off a presidential campaign on Twitter is an unconventional approach that drew criticism before the event, and the technical problems only will add to the perception that DeSantis miscalculated.\n\nThe event was supposed to start at 6 p.m. but didn't kickoff on time and then immediately cut out. It then started and cut out again multiple times.\n\n\"We're just trying to get it going, there's so many people,\" somebody said.\n\nTrump was quick to pounce.\n\n\"WOW! The DeSanctus TWITTER launch is a DISASTER!\" Trump said on social media. \"His whole campaign will be a disaster. WATCH!\"\n\nTrump also shared a video of a rocket with DeSantis' name on it exploding on the launch pad.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee described DeSantis' campaign launch as an \"absolute faceplant.\"\n\n“In true Ron DeSantis fashion, his presidential launch was quite literally not ready for primetime,\" said DNC spokesperson Ammar Moussa. \"Welcome to the race for the MAGA base, Ron!”\n\nAfter DeSantis finished his speech, Sacks thanked him for \"putting up with these technical difficulties\" and asked why he wanted to do the announcement this way.\n\nDeSantis said during COVID-19 he \"went against the grain\" and received criticism. Arguing for the importance of open debate, DeSantis praised Musk's leadership at Twitter.\n\nThe announcement event ended with Musk defending how it played out.\n\n“It’s going to be imperfect because it’s not scripted but it’s genuine,\" he said.\n\nDeSantis' campaign later put out a video where the governor said his announcement \"broke the Internet because so many people were excited about being on that Twitter Space.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/23/gov-ron-desantis-expected-to-launch-presidential-bid-with-elon-musk/70248833007/", "title": "DeSantis will kick off presidential bid with Elon Musk on Twitter", "text": "SpaceX Founder Elon Musk will help launch Florida Gov.

It has been updated to reflect the current status of the legislation.\n\nCNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed into law a $1.7 trillion yearlong federal government spending package on Thursday, after the House and Senate passed it last week.\n\nThe legislation includes $772.5 billion for nondefense discretionary programs and $858 billion in defense funding. That represents an increase in spending in both areas for fiscal year 2023.\n\nThe sweeping package includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies, an overhaul of the electoral vote-counting law, protections for pregnant workers, an enhancement to retirement savings rules and a TikTok ban on federal devices.\n\nIt also provides a boost in spending for disaster aid, college access, child care, mental health and food assistance, more support for the military and veterans and additional funds for the US Capitol Police. And the legislation contains several major Medicaid provisions, particularly one that could disenroll up to 19 million people from the nation’s health insurance program for low-income Americans.\n\nHowever, the law, which runs more than 4,000 pages, left out several measures that some lawmakers had fought to include. An expansion of the child tax credit, as well as multiple other corporate and individual tax breaks, did not make it into the final bill. Neither did legislation to allow cannabis companies to bank their cash reserves – known as the Safe Banking Act – or a bill to help Afghan evacuees in the US gain lawful permanent residency. And the spending package did not include a White House request for roughly $10 billion in additional funding for Covid-19 response.\n\nThe spending law, which will keep the government operating through September, the end of the fiscal year, is the product of lengthy negotiations between top congressional Democrats and Republicans.\n\nCongress originally passed a continuing resolution on September 30 to temporarily fund the government in fiscal year 2023, which began October 1.\n\nHere’s what’s in the law:\n\nMore aid for Ukraine: The spending law provides roughly $45 billion to help support Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself against Russia’s attack.\n\nAbout $9 billion of the funding will go to Ukraine’s military to pay for a variety of things including training, weapons, logistics support and salaries. Nearly $12 billion will be used to replenish US stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine through presidential drawdown authority.\n\nAlso, the law provides $13 billion for economic support to the Ukrainian government. Other funds address humanitarian and infrastructure needs, as well as support European Command operations.\n\nEmergency disaster assistance: The law provides more than $38 billion in emergency funding to help Americans in the west and southeast affected by recent natural disasters, including tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. It will aid farmers, provide economic development assistance for communities, repair and reconstruct federal facilities and direct money to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, among other initiatives.\n\nOverhaul of the electoral vote-counting law: A provision in the legislation aims at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, the first legislative response to the US Capitol insurrection and then-President Donald Trump’s campaign to stay in power despite his loss in 2020.\n\nThe changes overhaul the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which Trump tried to use to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe legislation clarifies the vice president’s role while overseeing the certification of the electoral result to be completely ceremonial. It also creates a set of stipulations designed to make it harder for there to be any confusion over the accurate slate of electors from each state.\n\nFunding for January 6 attack prosecutions: The law provides $2.6 billion for US Attorneys, which includes funding efforts “to further support prosecutions related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol and domestic terrorism cases,” according to a fact sheet from the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe package also gives $11.3 billion to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, including for efforts to investigate extremist violence and domestic terrorism.\n\nThe funding measures are part of nearly $39 billion for the Justice Department.\n\nRetirement savings enhancements: The law contains new retirement rules that could make it easier for Americans to accumulate retirement savings – and less costly to withdraw them. Among other things, the provisions will allow penalty-free withdrawals for some emergency expenses, let employers offer matching retirement contributions for a worker’s student loan payments and increase how much older workers may save in employer retirement plans.\n\nTikTok ban from federal devices: The legislation bans TikTok, the Chinese-owned short-form video app, from federal government devices.\n\nSome lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok – or its parent, ByteDance – to hand over the personal data of its US users. Recently, a wave of states led by Republican governors have introduced state-level restrictions on the use of TikTok on government-owned devices.\n\nProtections for pregnant workers: The law provides pregnant workers with workplace accommodations – such as additional bathroom breaks, stools or relief from heavy lifting duties – needed for healthy pregnancies. It will prevent them from being forced to take leave or losing their jobs, as well as bar employers from denying employment opportunities to women based on their need for reasonable accommodations due to childbirth or related medical conditions. Also, another provision in the package guarantees workplace accommodations – particularly time to pump – for more nursing workers.\n\nChanges to Medicaid and other health care programs: The law phases out the requirement that prevented states from disenrolling Medicaid recipients as long as the national public health emergency was in effect in exchange for an enhanced federal match. This continuous coverage measure was enacted as part of a Covid-19 relief package passed in March 2020 and has led to a record 90 million Medicaid enrollees, many of whom may no longer meet the income requirements to qualify.\n\nUnder the law, states will be able to start evaluating Medicaid enrollees’ eligibility and terminating their coverage as of April 1. The redetermination process will take place over at least 12 months. Also, the enhanced federal Medicaid funding will phase down through December 31, 2023, though the states will have to meet certain conditions during that period.\n\nUp to 19 million people could lose their Medicaid benefits, according to estimates, though many would be eligible for other coverage.\n\nAlso, under a provision in the law, Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP, will offer 12 months of continuous coverage for children. This will allow the 40 million children on Medicaid and CHIP to have uninterrupted access to health care throughout the year.\n\nIn addition, the law makes permanent the option for states to offer 12 months of postpartum coverage for low-income mothers through Medicaid, rather than just 60 days. More than two dozen states, plus the District of Columbia, have implemented the measure, which was available on a temporary basis through the American Rescue Plan, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another seven states are planning to implement the option.\n\nPlus, the package provides more money for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. The funds are intended to speed the development of new therapies, diagnostics and preventive measures, beef up public health activities and strengthen the nation’s biosecurity by accelerating development of medical countermeasures for pandemic threats and fortifying stockpiles and supply chains for drugs, masks and other supplies.\n\nIncreased support for the military and veterans: The package funds a 4.6% pay raise for troops and a 22.4% increase in support for Veteran Administration medical care, which provides health services for 7.3 million veterans.\n\nIt includes nearly $53 billion to address higher inflation and $2.7 billion – a 25% increase – to support critical services and housing assistance for veterans and their families.\n\nThe law also allocates $5 billion for the Cost of War Toxic Exposures Fund, which provides additional funding to implement the landmark PACT Act that expands eligibility for health care services and benefits to veterans with conditions related to toxic exposure during their service.\n\nBeefing up nutrition assistance: The legislation establishes a permanent nationwide Summer EBT program, starting in the summer of 2024, according to Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger advocacy group. It will provide families whose children are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals with a $40 grocery benefit per child per month, indexed to inflation.\n\nIt also changes the rules governing summer meals programs in rural areas. Children will be able to take home or receive delivery of up to 10 days’ worth of meals, rather than have to consume the food at a specific site and time.\n\nThe law also helps families who have had their food stamp benefits stolen since October 1 through what’s known as “SNAP skimming.” It provides them with retroactive federal reimbursement of the funds, which criminals steal by attaching devices to point-of-sale machines or PIN pads to get card numbers and other information from electronic benefits transfer cards.\n\nHigher maximum Pell grant awards: The law increases the maximum Pell grant award by $500 to $7,395 for the coming school year. This marks the largest boost since the 2009-2010 school year. About 7 million students, many from lower-income families, receive Pell grants every year to help them afford college.\n\nHelp to pay utility bills: The package provides $5 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Combined with the $1 billion contained in the earlier continuing resolution, this is the largest regular appropriation for the program, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. Home heating and cooling costs – and the applications for federal aid in paying the bills – have soared this year.\n\nAdditional funding for the US Capitol Police: The law provides an additional $132 million for the Capitol Police for a total of nearly $735 million. It will allow the department to hire up to 137 sworn officers and 123 support and civilian personnel, bringing the force to a projected level of 2,126 sworn officers and 567 civilians.\n\nIt also gives $2 million to provide off-campus security for lawmakers in response to evolving and growing threats.\n\nMore money for child care: The legislation provides $8 billion for the Child Care and Development Block Grant, a 30% increase in funding. The grant gives financial assistance to low-income families to afford child care.\n\nAlso, Head Start will receive nearly $12 billion, an 8.6% boost. The program helps young children from low-income families prepare for school.\n\nMore resources for children’s mental health and for substance abuse: The law provides more funds to increase access to mental health services for children and schools. It also will invest more money to address the opioid epidemic and substance use disorder.\n\nInvestments in homelessness prevention and affordable housing: The legislation provides $3.6 billion for homeless assistance grants, a 13% increase. It will serve more than 1 million people experiencing homelessness.\n\nThe package also funnels nearly $6.4 billion to the Community Development Block Grant formula program and related local economic and community development projects that benefit low- and moderate income areas and people, an increase of almost $1.6 billion.\n\nPlus, it provides $1.5 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which will lead to the construction of nearly 10,000 new rental and homebuyer units and maintain the record investment from the last fiscal year.\n\nMore support for the environment: The package provides an additional $576 million for the Environmental Protection Agency, bringing its funding up to $10.1 billion. It increases support for enforcement and compliance, as well as clean air, water and toxic chemical programs, after years of flat funding.\n\nIt also boosts funding for the National Park Service by 6.4%, restoring 500 of the 3,000 staff positions lost over the past decade. This is intended to help the agency handle substantial increases in visitation.\n\nPlus, the legislation provides an additional 14% in funding for wildland firefighting.\n\nWhat’s not in the law\n\nEnhanced child tax credit: A coalition of Democratic lawmakers and consumer advocates pushed hard to extend at least one provision of the enhanced child tax credit, which was in effect last year thanks to the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Their priority was to make the credit more refundable so more of the lowest-income families can qualify. Nearly 19 million kids won’t receive the full $2,000 benefit this year because their parents earn too little, according to a Tax Policy Center estimate.\n\nNew cannabis banking rules: Lawmakers considered including a provision in the spending bill that would make it easier for licensed cannabis businesses to accept credit cards – but it was left out of the legislation. Known as the Safe Banking Act, which previously passed the House, the provision would prohibit federal regulators from taking punitive measures against banks for providing services to legitimate cannabis businesses.\n\nEven though 47 states have legalized some form of marijuana, cannabis remains illegal on the federal level. That means financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses are subject to criminal prosecution – leaving many legal growers and sellers locked out of the banking system.\n\nCovid-19 response: Lawmakers did not include a White House request for an additional $10 billion in funding for Covid-19, which would have been aimed at continued access to and development of vaccines and therapeutics, among other things. Earlier in the year, the Biden administration unsuccessfully pushed for $22.5 billion in extra funds.\n\nFBI headquarters: There was also no final resolution on where the new FBI headquarters will be located, a major point of contention as lawmakers from Maryland – namely House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer – pushed to bring the law enforcement agency into their state. In a deal worked through by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the General Services Administration would be required to conduct “separate and detailed consultations” with Maryland and Virginia representatives about potential sites in each of the states, according to a Senate Democratic aide.\n\nAfghan Adjustment Act: Also not included in the spending bill was the Afghan Adjustment Act, which would have helped Afghan allies who run the risk of deportation from the US. It would have given those evacuees a pathway to lawful permanent residency before their temporary status, known as humanitarian parole, expires in 2023. Many congressional Republicans raised concerns about vetting and other issues, but the legislation’s supporters, including former US military leaders, argued those worries have been addressed.\n\nLegislation to extend and expand Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans who worked with the US during the war there and want to come to America is included in the spending bill.", "authors": ["Tami Luhby Katie Lobosco", "Tami Luhby", "Katie Lobosco"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/congress-lame-duck-agenda/index.html", "title": "Congress returns for lame duck with long to-do list | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nLawmakers are set to return on Monday after being away for several weeks campaigning for the crucial midterm elections.\n\nThey face a jam-packed legislative to-do list before the new congressional session begins in January.\n\nWith that in mind, Democratic leaders are eager to bring several bills to the floor for votes during the lame duck session – the period after the midterms and before the new Congress begins.\n\nThe busy agenda includes: Funding the government to avert a shutdown before the end of the calendar year, passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the annual must-pass legislation that sets the policy agenda and authorizes funding for the Department of Defense, a vote in the Senate to protect same-sex marriage and possible consideration of other key issues.\n\nWhile the House is able to pass legislation by a simple majority, Democrats in the Senate face an uphill climb given their narrow majority. With a 50-50 partisan split in the Senate, Democrats lack the votes to overcome the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold – and do not have enough support within their party to abolish the filibuster, as many are anxious to do. Therefore, major priorities for liberal voters – like the passage of legislation protecting access to abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade – are expected to remain out of reach for the party for the foreseeable future.\n\nDemocrats, who currently control both chambers, are returning with a new reality in the wake of Tuesday’s election they did not expect: Key races that will determine the balance of power in the House have not been called, and CNN has not yet projected who would control the House. While Republicans still appear likely to win enough seats to control the chamber, it would likely be with a narrower margin than originally anticipated.\n\nOn Saturday, CNN projected that Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada will win reelection, meaning the Democrats will continue to control the Senate once the news session of Congress starts in January. But with a runoff election set for Georgia’s US Senate seat set for December 6, the final make-up of the chamber won’t be known until at least then.\n\nAt a news conference Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned of a busy lame-duck session, promising “heavy work” and “long hours,” though he declined to get into specifics, saying he first needs to talk to his caucus about their agenda.\n\nFunding the government\n\nCongress passed a short-term funding bill in September that is set to expire December 16, making funding the government the number one priority for Congress when they return from recess.\n\nBecause the legislation must be passed, it could attract additional measures that Democrats want to clear during the lame duck session. For example, additional financial support for Ukraine as it continues to defend itself against Russia. While that funding has bipartisan support, some conservatives – such as Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican who is expected to become speaker if his party eventually wins the chamber – are balking at the pricey contributions and are vowing to scrutinize more closely additional requests from the Biden administration, a dynamic that is dividing Republicans.\n\nDemocrats also want more funding for the Covid-19 pandemic, but Republicans are not likely to support that request. Democrats may also seeking more money for the Department of Justice investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nCongress also has to pass the defense bill. Consideration of the wide-ranging bill could spark debate and a push for amendments over a variety of topics, including whether to punish Saudi Arabia for its recent decision to cut oil production.\n\nSenate Democrats will also continue confirming judges to the federal bench nominated by President Joe Biden, a key priority for the party.\n\nSame-sex marriage vote in the Senate\n\nA Senate vote on codifying same-sex marriage is also on tap. In mid-September, the chamber punted on a vote until after the November midterm elections as negotiators asked for more time to lock down support – a move that could make it more likely the bill will ultimately pass the chamber.\n\nThe bipartisan group of senators working on the bill said in a statement at the time, “We’ve asked Leader Schumer for additional time and we appreciate he has agreed. We are confident that when our legislation comes to the Senate floor for a vote, we will have the bipartisan support to pass the bill.” The bill would need at least 10 Republican votes to overcome a filibuster.\n\nSchumer has vowed to hold a vote on the bill, but the exact timing has not yet been locked in. Democrats have pushed for the vote after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, sparking fears that the court could take aim at same-sex or inter-racial marriage in the future.\n\nElectoral Count Act\n\nVotes are likely on bipartisan legislation that would make it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, a response to former President Donald Trump’s efforts to block the 2020 election results, which led to the siege of the Capitol. It is supported by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. If the bill passes the Senate, it would also need to clear the House, which in September, passed its own version of the legislation.\n\nDebt limit\n\nMeanwhile, it’s not yet clear when exactly the nation will run up against the debt limit and it appears unlikely for now that Congress will act to raise it during the lame-duck session, especially as other must-pass bills compete for floor time. But political battle lines are already being drawn and maneuvering is underway in Washington over the contentious and high-stakes issue. Democrats are insisting it would be irresponsible to cause a damaging default over paying for bills already accrued. While Republicans are digging in and insisting that they will only approve a debt limit hike if Democrats agree to cut spending moving forward.\n\nAt his news conference Sunday, Schumer vowed to “look at” the issue over the next few weeks, but said he needs to talk to the other members of leadership and see where the makeup of the House ultimately lands.\n\n“The debt ceiling, of course, is something that we have to deal with. And it’s something that we will look at over the next few weeks,” Schumer said. “I have to talk to the leadership first. We don’t know where the House is going to be.”\n\nCongress does not need to raise the nation’s borrowing limit until sometime next year, but there’s been some internal debate over whether Democrats should try to raise before the end of this year, especially if Republicans wind up in control of the House.\n\nMcCarthy thrust the issue to the forefront with comments last month that echoed those of several colleagues.\n\n“If people want to make a debt ceiling (for a longer period of time), just like anything else, there comes a point in time where, OK, we’ll provide you more money, but you got to change your current behavior,” he said in an interview with Punchbowl News.\n\nMinnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar summed up the busy work period ahead in an interview with “CNN This Morning” on Thursday.\n\n“In Washington, we have a bunch of things on our plate, including getting the defense bill done with Ukraine right before us and the strides that (Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky) is making against Vladimir Putin,” she said. “On our plate is the end-of-the-year budget bill to make sure we get that right, As you know the Electoral Count Act, an effort that I’m leading with (Maine Republican Sen.) Susan Collins and (West Virginia Democratic Sen.) Joe Manchin and others, so we don’t have January 6 happen again.

The bill will next go to President Joe Biden to be signed into law.\n\nGovernment funding is currently set to expire late Friday evening – and lawmakers raced the clock to clear the measure before the deadline. The Senate passed the legislation on Thursday along with a bill to extend the deadline by one week, to December 30, to provide enough time for the yearlong bill to be formally processed and sent to Biden. The House also approved the one-week extension and Biden signed it into law on Friday, ensuring there will not be a shutdown.\n\nThe massive spending bill for fiscal year 2023, known on Capitol Hill as an omnibus, provides $772.5 billion for non-defense, domestic programs and $858 billion in defense funding. It includes roughly $45 billion in emergency assistance to Ukraine and NATO allies and roughly $40 billion to respond to natural disasters like hurricanes, wildfires and flooding.\n\nOther key provisions in the bill include an overhaul of the 1887 Electoral Count Act aimed at making it harder to overturn a certified presidential election – the first legislative response to the US Capitol insurrection and then-President Donald Trump’s relentless pressure campaign to stay in power despite his 2020 loss.\n\nAmong other provisions, the spending bill also includes the Secure Act 2.0, a package aimed at making it easier to save for retirement, and a measure to ban TikTok from government devices.\n\nThe legislative text of the package, which runs more than 4,000 pages, was released in the middle of the night – at around 1:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday – leaving little time for rank-and-file lawmakers, and the public, to review its contents before it came up for a vote in both chambers.\n\nHouse GOP leader Kevin McCarthy criticized $1.7 trillion dollar spending bill in a floor speech ahead of the House vote.\n\n“This is a monstrosity. It is one of the most shameful acts I have ever seen in this body,” the California Republican said. “The appropriations process has failed the American public, and there is no greater example of the nail in the coffin of the greatest failure of a one-party rule of the House, the Senate, and the presidency of this bill here.”\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi later spoke in favor of the spending bill while noting that the moment would “probably be my last speech as speaker of the House on this floor, and I’m hoping to make it my shortest.”\n\nThe California Democrat took issue with McCarthy’s floor comments, saying she was “sad to hear the minority leader earlier say this legislation is the most shameful thing to be seen on the House floor in this Congress.”\n\n“I can’t help but wonder, had he forgotten January 6?” she asked, a reference to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nSenate passage of funding bill\n\nThe giant government funding bill initially stalled in the Senate in the days following its release over a GOP amendment regarding the Trump-era immigration policy, Title 42, that could have sunk the entire $1.7 trillion legislation in the Democratic-controlled House.\n\nGOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah insisted on getting a vote on his amendment to keep in place the immigration policy that allows migrants to be turned back at the border, which Republicans strongly support. Because Lee’s measure was expected to be set at a simple majority threshold, there was concern it would pass and be added to the government funding bill as several centrist Democrats back extending the policy – only for it to later be rejected in the House.\n\nBut senators had a breakthrough in negotiations Thursday morning.\n\nSens. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Jon Tester of Montana wrote an amendment in an attempt to give moderates an alternative way to vote in support of extending Title 42, which the administration and most Democrats want to get rid of.\n\nAs expected, both amendments did not pass. Lee’s amendment to extend the Trump-era immigration policy failed 47-50.

She previously estimated she could do that until June 5, which is when she expects the government to run out of money.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office had projected sometime later this summer, as had financial firms Goldman Sachs, Moody's Analytics and Wells Fargo.\n\nBut all three firms recently projected an early June deadline looks likely because the government is collecting 35% less in taxes this year, meaning it has less revenue and money to pay the bills.\n\nIf those projections are true and Republicans don't lift the debt limit during the 15 days they are in session between now and then, a default would impact all Americans.\n\nIt would mean higher home and auto loan rates and credit card payments, officials have warned, and could stop payments on government programs like Social Security.

Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a nationwide right to abortion.\n\nThe abortion restrictions these states approved last week all denied exceptions for victims of rape or incest – a provision that was once a common feature of conservative anti-abortion proposals but has been jettisoned almost completely in the wave of new restrictions approved since 2021. The Oklahoma legislation banned nearly all abortions from the moment of conception and imposed severe penalties on doctors who perform them, including up to 10 years in jail. The Kentucky bill, continuing an offensive already underway in several other red states, prohibited state residents from obtaining medication abortion through the mail, as the federal Food and Drug Administration authorized late last year.\n\nTaken together, the sweeping bills finalized last week show how the sympathetic signals from the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority are changing the strategy of red states. In earlier legislative sessions, Republican-controlled states generally had either passed abortion restrictions designed to provide a test case the Supreme Court could use to overturn Roe or had approved bills crafted narrowly enough that they hoped they could survive legal challenges while Roe remained the law, says Mary Ziegler, a Florida State University law professor who studies the history of abortion law.\n\nWe are seeing this pattern because the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has signaled that it is ready to reverse Roe. Now, we are getting a sense of what red states really want to do when Roe is gone. That is why we are seeing bans from fertilization – as in Oklahoma – and laws that focus on abortion pills, which will be crucial in determining whether bans will be effective. Mary Ziegler, Florida State University law professor\n\nBut after former President Donald Trump’s appointments of Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett established a clear conservative majority on the court – and particularly since that majority signaled during last year’s hearing on a challenge to Mississippi’s 15-week abortion ban that it is inclined to retrench or entirely scrap Roe – the red states are removing the veils to more clearly indicate where they will take the law if the court allows them.\n\n“We are seeing this pattern because the Supreme Court’s conservative majority has signaled that it is ready to reverse Roe,” Ziegler told me in an email. “Now, we are getting a sense of what red states really want to do when Roe is gone. That is why we are seeing bans from fertilization – as in Oklahoma – and laws that focus on abortion pills, which will be crucial in determining whether bans will be effective.”\n\nAll of this is coming even as a January CNN survey conducted by SSRS found that more than two-thirds of Americans oppose the court overturning Roe v. Wade. Abortion restrictions routinely draw broader support in red states, but even in them, a 2018 state-level analysis by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute shared with CNN found that in most cases, a majority of residents do not want to completely ban abortion – despite the fact that several states have passed “trigger” bans to do so if the Supreme Court allows it.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the severe abortion restrictions rapidly proliferating in red states represent a bet from the Republicans controlling them that they can satisfy the demands of their most ardent base supporters without facing any consequences among more centrist voters in their coalition who are uneasy, or outright opposed, to the new limits. Across the red states, Republicans are placing a similar wager on the broad wave of other bills they have approved in rapid-fire succession since 2020 to limit transgender rights, censor classroom discussion of race, gender and sexual orientation and ban certain books.\n\nIf that bet pays off, and red state Republicans suffer no midterm defections over this surge of socially conservative legislation – an outcome that may be the most likely possibility amid the extensive public discontent over President Joe Biden’s performance – pressure inside the party to lurch policy further to the right will only intensify, not only on abortion, but also on the broad range of cultural issues energizing conservative activists.\n\nA rising tide of legislation\n\nEven amid the increasing red-state focus on the issue since 2021, last week’s activity constituted a kind of crescendo. On Tuesday, Oklahoma Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt signed one of the nation’s most sweeping bans, which bars almost all abortions, denies exceptions for rape and incest and imposes felony penalties, including up to 10 years in prison, on doctors who perform or attempt to perform the procedure. On Wednesday, the Republican-controlled Kentucky state legislature overrode a veto from the state’s Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, to approve legislation that bans abortion after 15 weeks also without exceptions for rape and incest, prohibits the distribution of abortion pills through the mail and imposes so many restrictions on abortion clinics that neither of Kentucky’s two facilities is expected to continue operating in the state. Then on Thursday, Florida’s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law that state’s 15-week abortion ban, which also contains no exceptions for rape and incest.\n\nThese hardline bills continue the clear pattern of the past two years. Elizabeth Nash, who tracks state policy for the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank supporting reproductive rights, says that since 2021, 12 Republican-controlled states have passed laws restricting or banning abortion. Of those, she says, only the new limits approved in Idaho, South Carolina and Wyoming preserve some exemptions for victims of rape and incest.\n\nThe removal of exceptions for rape and incest in the new state laws represents only one of the ways in which red states are escalating their campaign against abortion. Since 2021, seven Republican-controlled states have banned distribution of medication abortion through the mail, despite the FDA ruling. Texas, in another case that’s reached the Supreme Court, last year created a “vigilante” lawsuit system that authorizes private litigation against anyone who assists or provides an abortion (although not the woman herself) after cardiac activity can be detected, which can be as early as six weeks into pregnancy. Idaho has incorporated a similar approach into its “heartbeat” abortion ban as well.\n\nIt is critical that Democrats take this radicalization we are witnessing and make it into a kitchen table issue. That has to be part of the discourse with the American people this year in order to make this into a competitive election, because it is the single most important thing happening in our politics. Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN\n\nMore states may follow before this legislative season ends. Republican-controlled legislatures in Ohio and Louisiana may advance new abortion bans, with further action under discussion but less likely in Alabama, Missouri, South Carolina and Tennessee, Nash says. Separately, Missouri, Tennessee and Ohio may bar residents from obtaining medication abortion solely through the mail. Oklahoma could also supplement the ban Stitt signed last week with several additional measures, including a bill authorizing Texas-style private lawsuits (which are also under discussion, if less imminently, in Ohio and Louisiana).\n\nRed states are also discussing ways to extend the reach of their restrictions beyond their borders. A Republican state legislator in Missouri has proposed to authorize lawsuits against people in other states who help a state resident obtain an abortion. After Citibank indicated it would pay expenses for Texas employees who traveled out of state to obtain abortions, a Republican Texas state legislator last month threatened to introduce legislation barring companies that did so from local government contracts.\n\nThis increasingly confrontational posture toward abortion in red states tracks with the GOP’s trajectory on other social issues. Republican-controlled states have also moved toward more militant positions on LGBTQ issues, not only banning transgender women and girls from school sports, but also initiating child abuse investigations against parents (Texas) and criminal penalties against medical professionals (Alabama) who provide gender-affirming treatment for transgender minors. A broad red-state push to limit how race and gender are discussed in public school classrooms has spilled over to new measures to restrict how teachers talk about sexual identity and orientation (such as the Florida legislation critics call the “don’t say gay” bill, which DeSantis recently signed into law), and proposals to make it easier to ban books they don’t approve of not only in school libraries, but also in public ones.\n\nDemocrats struggling to respond\n\nOn every front, ideas that once might have been considered on the fringe inside the GOP have moved rapidly into law – and, in most instances, inspired copy-cat proposals in other states. Democrats have struggled to respond to this offensive, both at the state and national level. In Washington, the House of Representatives has passed legislation that would codify a national right to abortion and undo many states’ moves against transgender youth, but Republican-led filibusters have blocked those proposals in the Senate (along with the House-passed bill that would override the voting restrictions many of these same red states have approved). And though state Democrats have voted almost en masse against these policies, as well as the voting restrictions, the party has been divided over how much to stress its opposition to them in the midterm elections – frustrating some party strategists in the process.\n\n“It is critical that Democrats take this radicalization we are witnessing and make it into a kitchen table issue,” says Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a Democratic research and advocacy group. “That has to be part of the discourse with the American people this year in order to make this into a competitive election, because it is the single most important thing happening in our politics.”\n\nOf all the socially conservative causes Republicans are advancing in the red states, abortion is probably the issue Democrats feel most comfortable contesting. As CNN recently reported, with the Supreme Court decision approaching, a wide array of Democratic candidates are stressing their commitment to preserving abortion rights.\n\n“I do think they are overplaying their hand electorally, because November could be the first election we’ve had in decades when Roe is not the law of the land, and I think the backlash will be very swift and severe,” says Christina Polizzi, press secretary for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\nPolls have consistently found that a solid majority of Americans oppose overturning Roe – with that resistance extending well into the Republican coalition. In the January CNN survey, not only did 69% of all adults oppose ending the constitutional right to abortion, so did 43% of Republican men and a striking 47% of Republican women, according to detailed results provided by the CNN polling team. In a follow-up question, nearly three-fifths of all adults said that if the Supreme Court did overturn Roe, they wanted their states to make their abortion laws more permissive, while only 40% wanted them more restrictive. About one-third of both Republican men and women joined the majority who preferred that state laws become more permissive.\n\nSupport for abortion restrictions, not surprisingly, is greater in red-leaning states, whose populations typically include more of the White evangelical Christians who compose the core of the social conservative movement. When the Public Religion Research Institute tabulated state-by-state abortion attitudes in a massive 2018 poll, it found that majorities in Mississippi, Idaho and Arkansas – states that have imposed some of the latest restrictions – said it should be illegal in all or most cases, according to results provided by the institute’s research director, Natalie Jackson. But clear majorities said it should be legal in all or most cases in Florida and Arizona, where Republicans have passed new restrictions, and slight pluralities echoed that position in Georgia, Texas and Oklahoma – three other states where Republican officials have voted to limit access.\n\nMore recent surveys have also found unease with the restrictions. Nearly 3 in 5 Florida voters opposed the state’s 15-week abortion ban in a University of North Florida poll earlier this year. (Half of those polled were told that the bill offered no exceptions for rape and incest – and only 51% of even Republican voters who were given that information backed the ban.)\n\nIn Texas, a University of Texas/Texas Tribune survey has found state residents split almost exactly in half over the fetal heartbeat abortion ban but a clear majority opposed to the separate “trigger” bill the legislature approved to ban all abortions if the Supreme Court allows it. Other UT polls have found that fewer than about 1 in 8 Texas residents want to ban abortion without those exceptions for rape, incest and the woman’s health, and a solid majority oppose the legislation authorizing private lawsuits against those involved in providing abortions. That opposition encompassed a significant portion of Republicans: two-fifths of Republican women and about one-third of Republican men said they opposed the absolute “trigger” ban and about one-third of Republicans opposed the private lawsuit bill.\n\nVoters’ reactions may be crucial\n\nThe future of the anti-abortion drive in red states – and the broader movement to roll back civil rights and liberties there – will likely pivot on how the Republican voters uneasy with these proposals respond to them. These polls show that in theory the sharp right turn on abortion and other social issues from red-state Republicans could fracture the electoral coalition that now allows them to dominate these states.\n\nBut in practice, many observers believe, Democrats face significant obstacles to peeling away many Republican-leaning voters unhappy over these issues, in the near term at least.\n\n“That 40% of Republican women may oppose banning abortion,” says James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin, “but in a campaign situation” Republicans can overcome that hesitance by shifting those voters’ focus toward other issues where they disagree with Democrats.\n\nEven if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, he says, the GOP’s odds of holding those voters are magnified by a midterm environment in which ordinarily Republican-leaning voters have so many objections to the performance of Biden and other Democrats, from inflation to immigration. “The environment shapes what you can get leverage on and what people will respond to, and it’s a very noisy environment right now,” Henson says.\n\nRed state Republicans broadly share that confidence. As Matt Mackowiak, an Austin-based GOP strategist, told me earlier this year, “I do not expect to see a suburban revolt due to the legislature’s priorities.” Rather than losing suburban support over the right’s turn on abortion and other social issues, he predicted the Republican vote share will rise “due to parental anger at school and Covid overreach.” Republican Govs. Greg Abbott in Texas and DeSantis in Florida, who have pushed some of the most aggressive social conservative agendas, are considered strong favorites for reelection in November, and Tennessee GOP Gov. Bill Lee, who has matched them step for step, does not even have a serious Democratic opponent.\n\nTresa Undem, a Democratic pollster who focuses on issues relating to gender equality and politics, agrees that few Republican women who support abortion rights are likely to defect from the party coalition if the court overturns Roe. Her extensive surveys have found that the vast majority of them still share the broader unease with cultural change in American society that has energized the GOP coalition in the Trump era. “Republican women don’t vote on” abortion, she says.\n\nBut Undem thinks the situation could be very different among women who identify as independents. That’s especially likely, she thinks, if the Supreme Court’s ruling so unambiguously rescinds Roe that it generates sustained media coverage.\n\n“I think if it’s outright overturned, and this breaks through, people learn about, it will definitely affect independent women,” she says. “I keep going back in my mind to Texas. I was stunned; we did a focus group of independent women and they said things I have never heard. At least half the women said something like this: ‘I have never even really cared who the governor was of Texas, but my skin crawls thinking about the issue of (the private lawsuits Texas authorized against abortion providers).’ It’s the signal of all that other power and control that they think politicians have over their lives.”\n\nThe January CNN survey underscores that possibility: Fully three-fourths of women who identified as independents said they opposed overturning Roe. Yet with so many other challenges at this tumultuous moment in American life shaping voters’ attitudes, it’s far from clear that those concerns will translate into votes against the Republicans advancing those laws. Even many voters opposed to the abortion restrictions, Undem acknowledges, may calculate, “I don’t think I am going to need an abortion, but I am filling up my (gas) tank right now.”\n\nDani Thayer, left, and Marina Lanae, both of Tulsa, Oklahoma, protest at the state Capitol, Wednesday, April 13, 2022, in Oklahoma City. Sue Ogrocki/AP\n\nThe safest prediction may be that if Republican governors and state legislatures run well this November in the states moving so sharply to the right on abortion and other cultural issues, they will be emboldened to continue pushing the frontier of such legislation.\n\nThere are no signs the current round of targets represents the outer boundary of ambition for the social conservative movement or the red-state Republican officials responding to it. During the recent confirmation hearings for incoming Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, three Republican senators suggested the court had erred in previous decisions that prevented states from barring the sale of contraceptives or blocking interracial and same-sex marriages. The total abortion bans, prohibition on mail distribution of medication abortion, discussion of extending private lawsuits across state lines and punishment of companies that help employees obtain abortions outside states that are prohibiting them signal where red states may move next on that front.\n\nAll of which suggests that if voters don’t send a cautionary signal in November, the red-state drive may be just beginning to roll back the “rights revolution” of the past six decades – and return the US to a pre-1960s world in which people’s basic civil rights and liberties varied much more depending on where they lived.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/23/politics/congress-lame-duck-session-agenda/index.html", "title": "Democrats predict an 'extremely busy' lame duck. Here's what's on ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA packed legislative to-do list awaits Congress when it returns to session after the midterms – and Democrats, who currently control both chambers, will face a ticking clock to enact key priorities if Republicans win back the House or manage to flip the Senate in the upcoming elections.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has predicted an “extremely busy” lame duck session – the period of time after the midterms and before a new Congress begins in January.\n\n“We still have much to do and many important bills to consider,” Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor at the end of September. “Members should be prepared for an extremely, underline extremely, busy agenda in the last two months of this Congress.”\n\nThe jam-packed agenda for the lame-duck session includes: Funding the government to avert a shutdown before the end of the calendar year, passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the annual must-pass legislation that sets the policy agenda and authorizes funding for the Department of Defense, as well as a vote in the Senate to protect same-sex marriage and the potential consideration of other key pieces of legislation.\n\nDemocrats are still limited in what they can achieve, however, given their narrow majorities in both chambers. With a 50-50 partisan split in the Senate, Democrats lack the votes to overcome the filibuster’s 60-vote threshold – and do not have the votes to abolish the filibuster. As a result, major priorities for liberal voters – like the passage of legislation protecting access to abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade – will still remain out of reach for the party for the foreseeable future.\n\nGovernment funding, the NDAA and confirming judges\n\nGovernment funding is the most pressing priority that lawmakers will confront during the lame duck. The current deadline for the expiration of funding is December 16 after the House and Senate passed an extension to avert a shutdown at the end of September.\n\nSince the funding bill is viewed as must-pass legislation it will likely become a magnet for other priorities that lawmakers may try to tack on to ride along with it. It’s possible that further aid for Ukraine could come up as Ukraine continues to counter Russia’s invasion of the country. While that funding has bipartisan support, some conservatives are balking at the pricey contributions to Ukraine and may scrutinize more closely additional requests from the administration, a dynamic that is dividing Republicans on this key issue.\n\nDemocrats also want more funding for pandemic response, but Republicans have pushed back on that request.\n\nOne issue that may come up during the government funding effort is money for the Department of Justice investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nA House Democratic aide told CNN that final fiscal year 2023 funding levels have yet to be determined. Justice Department needs and resources are part of this ongoing conversation, but under the leadership of Rep. Matt Cartwright, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on commerce, justice, science, and related agencies, the House bill included $34 million that would allow DOJ to fund these prosecutions without reducing their efforts in other areas.\n\nHouse Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro told CNN in a statement, “I look forward to working with my colleagues on the House and Senate appropriations committees and passing a final 2023 spending package by the December 16th deadline.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate has begun work on the NDAA, and is expected to pass the massive piece of legislation during the lame duck. Consideration of the wide-ranging bill could spark debate and a push for amendments over a variety of topics.\n\nRepublican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa has called for punishing OPEC for its production cut by passing legislation that would hold foreign oil producers accountable for colluding to fix prices – and the senator has said he believes the measure can pass as an amendment to the NDAA. The legislation would clear the way for the Justice Department to sue Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations for antitrust violations.\n\nSenate Democrats will also continue confirming judges to the federal bench nominated by President Joe Biden, a key priority for the party.\n\nSame-sex marriage vote in the Senate\n\nA Senate vote to protect same-sex marriage is also on tap for the lame-duck session. In mid-September, the chamber punted on a vote until after the November midterm elections as negotiators asked for more time to lock down support – a move that could make it more likely the bill will ultimately pass the chamber.\n\nThe bipartisan group of senators working on the bill said in a statement at the time, “We’ve asked Leader Schumer for additional time and we appreciate he has agreed. We are confident that when our legislation comes to the Senate floor for a vote, we will have the bipartisan support to pass the bill.” The bill would need at least 10 Republican votes to overcome a filibuster.\n\nSchumer has vowed to hold a vote on the bill, but the exact timing has not yet been locked in. Democrats have pushed for the vote after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, sparking fears that the court could take aim at same-sex marriage in the future.\n\nLegislation in the wake of the January 6 attack\n\nThe Senate could take up legislation during the lame duck in response to the January 6, 2021, attack by a mob of pro-Trump supporters attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nOver the summer, a bipartisan group of senators reached a deal to make it harder to overturn a certified presidential election. The proposal would still need, however, to be approved by both chambers. Notably, the Senate proposal has the backing of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican.\n\n“I strongly support the modest changes that our colleagues in the working group have fleshed out after literally months of detailed discussions,” McConnell said at the end of September. “I’ll proudly support the legislation, provided that nothing more than technical changes are made to its current form.”\n\nIf the bill passes the Senate, it would also need to clear the House, which in September, passed its own version of legislation to make it harder to overturn a certified presidential election in the future by proposing changes to the Electoral Count Act.\n\nStock trading legislation in the House and a debt limit push\n\nPassing a bill to to restrict lawmakers from trading stocks is a priority for a number of moderate House Democrats – who may continue to push for the issue to be taken up during the lame duck, though whether there will be a vote is still to be determined and other pressing must-pass items like government funding could crowd out the issue. The House did not vote on a proposal prior to the midterm elections.\n\n“It’s a complicated issue, as you can imagine, as a new rule for members they have to follow, and their families as I understand, so I think it deserves careful study to make sure if we do something, we do it right,” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told CNN last month.\n\nMeanwhile, it’s not yet clear when exactly the nation will run up against the debt limit and it appears unlikely for now that Congress will act to resolve the issue during the lame-duck session, especially as other must-pass bills compete for floor time. But political battle lines are already being drawn and maneuvering is underway in Washington over the contentious and high-stakes issue.\n\nA group of House Democrats recently sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Schumer calling for legislation to “permanently undo the threat posed by the debt limit” during the post-election lame-duck session. The letter, led by Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, was signed by several prominent House Democrats, including Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n\nBiden on Friday gave a window into how he’s preparing for a looming political showdown over the debt ceiling, stating unequivocally that he will not relent to Republican lawmakers threatening to send the nation into default if he doesn’t meet their demands, but adding that he doesn’t support efforts from within his own party to abolish the debt limit entirely.", "authors": ["Clare Foran Ted Barrett", "Clare Foran", "Ted Barrett"], "publish_date": "2022/10/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/16/politics/biden-inflation-reduction-act-signing/index.html", "title": "Biden signs Inflation Reduction Act into law | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed a sweeping $750 billion health care, tax and climate bill into law at the White House on Tuesday – marking a major victory for his administration and the Democratic Party ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nBiden said during a signing ceremony in the State Dining Room that the legislation, called the Inflation Reduction Act, is “one of the most significant laws in our history.”\n\n“With this law, the American people won and the special interests lost,” Biden told an audience of Democratic members of Congress and administration officials. “For a while people doubted whether any of that was going to happen, but we are in a season of substance.”\n\nThe bill signing is the latest celebration of a major legislative accomplishment for Biden this summer, having already held bill signings at the White House last week for a bill aimed at increasing domestic semiconductor production and increasing benefits for veterans affected by toxic burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq. Biden has also chalked up wins on several other fronts in the last few months, including a bipartisan gun reform bill, ordering the successful mission to kill al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, sending billions in aid to Ukraine to help that nation defend itself against Russia’s invasion and helping Finland and Sweden begin the process of joining NATO.\n\nAnd throughout Tuesday’s White House ceremony, the President underscored the significance of what he sees as his administration’s accomplishments – despite being written off when past negotiations for his legislative agenda failed.\n\n“Today, too often do we confuse noise with substance. Too often we confuse setbacks with defeat. Too often we hand the biggest microphones to the critics and the cynics who delight in declaring failure while those committed to making real progress do the hard work of governing,” the President told the audience. “Making progress in this country, as big and complicated as ours, clearly, is not easy. It’s never been easy. But with unwavering conviction, commitment and patience, progress does come.”\n\nThe act accomplishes several key Biden legislative agenda items, representing the largest climate investment in American history and making major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation will reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes – including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks – and boost the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to collect.\n\nIt will raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit.\n\nBiden, in his remarks, offered a blistering criticism of congressional Republicans for voting against the bill, turning their opposition into a call to action at the polls.\n\nHe underscored that “every single Republican in Congress voted against this bill.”\n\n“Every single Republican in Congress voted against lowering prescription drug prices, against lowering health care costs, against the fair tax system. Every single Republican – every single one – voted against tackling the climate crisis, against lowering our energy costs, against creating good paying jobs. My fellow Americans, that’s the choice we face – we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build a future where everybody has an even shot,” he continued.\n\nA series of events focused on the rollout of the new law is expected to take place in the coming weeks. The White House says Biden will soon host a Cabinet meeting focused on the law’s implementation, travel around the country to highlight the bill’s impact on Americans and take part in a post-Labor Day White House celebration focused on the enactment of the bill.\n\nSenate Democrats had long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party, but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus.\n\nWest Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin – a major holdout throughout much of Biden’s term in office – played a key role in the legislation, agreeing to a deal that was announced at the end of last month. Schumer and Manchin attended Tuesday’s signing ceremony at the White House.\n\nBiden credited Schumer for the bill’s passage and in a sign of thanks, handed Manchin his pen after signing the bill into law.\n\nManchin later outlined the long, bumpy road to Tuesday’s bill signing, giving Biden “all the credit” for allowing the process to play out on Capitol Hill.\n\n“He knew enough, being a former senator. Sometimes you just gotta let us do what we got to do, and I gave him all the credit for that, and you don’t do something this of this magnitude with him – with the President of the United States – not having involvement on what’s going on,” Manchin told reporters following the bill signing.\n\nManchin also pushed back against a Congressional Budget Office analysis that concluded the new law would have little to no effect on inflation in the short term, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins that “they haven’t always been always right” and that the new law “basically puts confidence in the market.”\n\nAnd he also acknowledged it may take time for Americans to feel the effect of the law, surmising that there may be visible progress in “a year or two or three years … but it’s not going to happen in the next two, three, four months.”\n\nThe West Virginia Democrat also addressed Republicans in Congress, blaming what he said were “politics of the day” for their opposition to the bill.\n\nThe bill passed in the Senate earlier this month after 16 hours of amendment votes – known as a vote-a-rama – and the House of Representatives approved the bill along party lines this past Friday.\n\nThe bill Biden signed on Tuesday does not include several provisions that had been previously proposed as part of the President’s plan, including paid family and sick leave, universal pre-kindergarten, an extension of the enhanced child tax credit, as well as provisions to lower the cost of college.\n\nThe key legislative victory comes as the White House plans a major speech for Biden after Labor Day, which is being billed as a hard-hitting kick off for midterm campaigning.\n\nAides are preparing a speech in which the President will tout tangible, long-talked-about wins like lowering prescription drug costs and gun restrictions while hammering Republicans for being extremists who are in the pocket of special interests.\n\nDemocrats are fighting to maintain their narrow majorities in Congress. And it’s not entirely clear whether voters perceptions about the President or his party will improve in the fall following a summer of dismal polling.\n\nA CNN poll released in late July, for example, found that 75% of Democratic voters want their party to nominate someone other than Biden to the presidency in 2024.\n\nNow, the White House is aiming to make the most of a string of wins – including the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act – as part of a rush to reset his image ahead of the November elections.\n\nBiden on Tuesday appeared to make a campaign pitch focused on his optimism about the future of the country, arguing that he’s been able to deliver long-sought progress to the American people.\n\n“To me, the critical duty of the presidency is to defend what is best about America. … To pursue justice, to ensure fairness and deliver results that create possibilities that all of us can live a life of consequence and prosperity in a nation that’s safe and secure. That’s the job. Fulfilling that pledge to you guides me every single hour of every single day on this job,” Biden said at the signing ceremony.\n\nAmerican presidents, he added, “should be judged, not only by our words but by our deeds, not by our rhetoric but by our actions, not by our promise but by reality. And today is part of an extraordinary story that’s being written by this administration and our brave allies in the Congress.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Donald Judd", "Maegan Vazquez", "Donald Judd"], "publish_date": "2022/08/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/07/biden-state-of-the-union-sotu-address-updates/11204405002/", "title": "State of the Union 2023 address recap: Biden lays out ambitious ...", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C — President Joe Biden took credit Tuesday for what he said was the country's economic revival while pushing an agenda of reducing prescription drug costs, protecting abortion rights and banning assault weapons.\n\nThe economy was reeling two years ago, Biden said in his second State of the Union address delivered in a packed House chamber.

Turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases. Provide more support for patients and their families.” The issue is also deeply personal to Biden, as one of his sons, Beau Biden, passed away due to brain cancer. “It’s personal to so many of us.”\n\nBiden also singled out Maurice and Kandice Barron, a pair of guests invited by First Lady Jill Biden. Their daughter, Ava Barron, was diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer when she was one year old. “She turns four next month,” Biden said to wide cheers from the audience. “They just found out Ava’s beating the odds and is on her way to being cured from cancer.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCancer treatment:New cancer therapy takes personalized medicine to a new level\n\nBiden says US stood up to China\n\nFacing Republicans who’ve accused him of being too soft on China, Biden said he responded clearly last week when a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States.\n\nChina knows that if U.S. sovereignty is threatened, Americans will act to protect the country.\n\n“And we did,” Biden said, an apparent reference to his decision to shoot down the balloon.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChinese spy balloon:Chinese spy balloon went over other US missile and nuclear weapons sites, lawmaker says\n\nBiden: Stop production, trafficking of fentanyl\n\nCiting Americans’ growing dependence on prescription drugs, Biden called for a major campaign to stop the production, sale and trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nBiden noted that fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.

Among them: expanding access to preschool and raising teacher pay.\n\nIn 2021, teachers made less than 77 cents on the dollar compared with other college graduates. Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far.

Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation to independent.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden: Pelosi is 'greatest speaker’ ever\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t sitting behind Biden for his address but she got a special call-out from the president anyway.\n\n“I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said.\n\nPelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership after the midterm elections. Biden also congratulated her successor, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black American to be House minority leader.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat are burn pits?:Why were burn pits used? Toxic fumes, medical risks explained.\n\nBiden begins speech telling McCarthy he looks forward to ‘working together’\n\nBiden began his remarks congratulating Kevin McCarthy, the new Republican House speaker, and saying he looks forward to “working together.”\n\nBiden also congratulated Democratic Leader Hakeem Jefferies, the first African American man to lead a party, and gave shout outs to Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n“The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up,” Biden said.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nLabor Secretary Marty Walsh is designated survivor for 2023 State of the Union\n\nSecretary of Labor Marty Walsh is the designated survivor for this year's State of the Union address.\n\nEvery year, a top government official is chosen as the “designated survivor” as a way to maintain the presidential line of succession in case of a catastrophic event where multiple officials in the line are unable to assume office.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMarty Walsh:Former Boston mayor Marty Walsh stepping down as Biden Labor Secretary for job with NHL union\n\nBono is at the State of the Union\n\nBono, the Irish lead singer of U2, is attending the State of the Union as a guest of first lady Jill Biden.\n\nBono is a longtime social justice advocate who co-founded the nonprofit ONE Campaign to address poverty and preventable diseases and Prouct RED to address HIV and AIDS in Africa.\n\nHe’s sitting next to Paul Pelosi, husband of former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\n2 Californians will sit behind Biden\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy may not share a political party. But they do have something in common. Both are from California.\n\nThat gave them at least one thing to talk about as they stood on the rostrum, waiting for Biden’s speech to begin.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden gets a Supreme Court majority for speech, if not policies\n\nAt least for tonight, President Joe Biden landed a majority of the Supreme Court.\n\nFive sitting Supreme Court justices stepped into the House chamber before the president’s remarks: Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justices Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThat’s a decent turnout for an event some current and former justices have derided as a “political pep rally” and a “childish spectacle.”\n\nWhether the president can cobble together a majority for any of his policies pending at the court – on immigration, student loan debt relief or environmental rules – remains to be seen.\n\n– John Fritze\n\nBiden to get bipartisan escort into House chamber\n\nBiden will be escorted into the House chamber by a bipartisan group of House and Senate officials, including Senate leaders Chuck Schumer, D-NY, and Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nFace masks uncommon as pre-pandemic normality returns\n\nFew lawmakers were wearing face masks as they filed onto the House floor for Biden’s State of the Union speech.\n\nAnd unlike last year, members of Congress were allowed to bring guests, a return to pre-pandemic normality.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden will declare, according to speech excerpts the White House released in advance.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nBiden arrives at Capitol\n\nBiden’s motorcade arrived at the Capitol at 8:40 p.m. ahead of his 9 p.m. State of the Union speech.\n\n“Great shape, getting better,” Biden said when a reporter asked him, “What’s the state of the union?” before he departed the White House.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\n5 big questions for Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nPoll: Republicans want GOP leaders to 'stand up’ to Biden\n\nIf Biden doesn’t find a receptive audience to his call for the two parties to work together, Republican voters could be the reason.\n\nMost Republicans (64%) want GOP congressional leaders to “stand up” to Biden on matters important to GOP, even if that makes it harder to address critical problems facing the country, according to recent polling from the Pew Research Center.\n\nAnd more are concerned that GOP lawmakers won’t focus enough on investigating the administration than the share worried that they will focus too much on investigations.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nBiden approval rating hovering in low 40s ahead of speech\n\nBiden’s second State of the Union address Tuesday comes as he remains under water politically, with more than half of voters disapproving of his job performance, according to most polls.\n\nA Washington Post-ABC poll released this week found 42% of voters approve of Biden’s job performance, while 53% disapprove. That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol.

That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who despite earlier posts did not bring a white balloon into the chamber to troll Biden about what she describes as a delayed response in taking down the Chinese spy balloon.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nBiden traveling to Wisconsin and Florida after speech\n\nBiden administration officials will hit the road this week, holding events in at least 20 states to highlight parts of the president’s message.\n\nBiden himself will talk about his economic agenda in Wisconsin Wednesday and will discuss Social Security and Medicare in Florida Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is heading to Georgia and Minnesota. Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name? Bill Clinton ... then-future President Bill Clinton.\n\nSanders will give the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n5 big questions for the SOTU:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden and China: Spy balloon likely to be addressed\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/08/politics/joe-biden-midterms-stakes/index.html", "title": "Biden readies for 'a horrible two years' if GOP takes control of ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs if Democrats needed any more convincing Tuesday’s midterm elections carry enormous stakes, President Joe Biden offered a bluntly dire assessment during a fundraiser last Friday in Chicago.\n\n“If we lose the House and Senate, it’s going to be a horrible two years,” Biden told the small crowd gathered inside a hotel ballroom, where cameras weren’t allowed. “The good news is I’ll have a veto pen.”\n\nAfter two years of Democratic control of Congress, a change in leadership in the House or Senate – or both – would thrust Biden’s presidency into an entirely new phase. Biden himself has been projecting optimism in the final days of the campaign, but reality is setting in for Democrats their majority rule in Congress could soon end – and Biden’s ability to get his top priorities passed could go with it.\n\nWhite House officials have begun pointing out their losses aren’t likely to be nearly as bad as previous midterm wipeouts, including in 2010, and say the fact Democrats have a fighting chance at all is a positive sign for Biden. But his advisers privately acknowledge that they don’t see a viable path for Democrats to hold onto their House majority, though the president and his senior team are starting the day with the view that the prospect of Democrats holding on to their Senate majority is real – even if it’s one that may take days, or longer, to be fully realized.\n\nWith the intraparty blame game set to boil over in the weeks ahead, the White House moved Tuesday to separate Biden’s agenda – and the president himself – from the list of targets. The White House circulated an Election Day memo to allies more than two dozen individual poll results they say underscores the popularity of the key individual elements of Biden’s agenda, ranging from his cornerstone legislative achievements to his actions on student loans, marijuana and his administration’s response to Covid-19\n\n“Before all the votes have even been cast, pundits are declaring that these midterms have been a referendum on the president’s agenda – nothing could be further from the truth,” the memo, which was obtained by CNN, says in its introduction.\n\nYet even Biden has acknowledged that his agenda, no matter how it polls in isolation, hasn’t translated to an American public that has taken a largely negative view on the direction of the country.\n\n“We’ve passed so many good things,” Biden said at a fundraising event last week. “They’ve been so good people haven’t realized how good they are yet.”\n\nThe effort to get in front of expected losses comes after months of frontline Democratic candidates actively seeking to separate themselves from Biden, relegating the party’s leader mostly to Democratic states and districts as the party scrambled to save its majorities. It’s a reality advisers say Biden doesn’t take personally. After 36 years in the Senate, Biden’s view has long been that the candidates know what’s best for their state or district. But as Biden’s approval ratings started to inch up in the last few months, White House officials have bristled at the view that he was a singular drag on Democrats.\n\nThe defensive tone in the memo echoes a message Biden has repeatedly sought to emphasize in the closing days of the campaign, one that centers on the idea that the election represents a choice between two parties, not a referendum on Biden or his presidency.\n\nA loss of a few seats – Republicans need only pick up five seats to take control of the House – would mean dramatic changes for the president.\n\nHere are four areas that are at stake this Tuesday for Biden and his administration:\n\nGOP investigations\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have made abundantly clear that if they take control of Congress, Biden should get ready: Investigations are coming his way.\n\nA majority in the House or Senate would hand GOP lawmakers powerful chairmanships on a number of oversight committees, giving them the ability to launch investigations targeting Biden, the White House and even members of the president’s family.\n\nAnd so far, Republican members have indicated that they’re eager to target all of the above.\n\nGOP lawmakers including Reps. James Comer and Jim Jordan, who are likely to chair the House Oversight and Judiciary committees respectively, are getting ready to probe a range of issues, from the business dealings of Biden’s son, Hunter; to what Republicans allege is political interference by the FBI and Justice Department; to the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nAnd that’s not to mention the drumbeat of impeachment talk – for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas or even the president himself.\n\nKevin McCarthy asked about impeaching Biden if GOP wins House. Hear his answer 02:29 - Source: CNN\n\nWhite House officials have been expecting and preparing for this new world for months, including by making personnel hires earlier this summer to beef up its oversight operations. Officials say if Republicans do in fact, take control of Congress, the White House is prepared to beef up those efforts even more with additional hires, and believe it will be ready to push back on future GOP investigations as lacking in merit, politically motivated and nefarious.\n\nWhile officials have been cautious not to get in front of any GOP actions or pre-judge the results of the election, they are also keenly aware of political dynamics that may work in their favor, people familiar with the matter said.\n\n“American people historically don’t respond well to egregious overreach,” one of the people told CNN, specifically citing a new Republican majority’s battles with former President Bill Clinton. “We’ll be prepared, but it’s tough to look at House Republicans and think this won’t wander into that territory.”\n\nAgenda\n\nThe historic likelihood that Biden would lose seats – and majorities – in Congress has loomed over the White House his entire term so far. It is part of what motivated the president’s ambitious legislative agenda, including major Covid-19 relief and a bipartisan infrastructure package, in the earliest months of his presidency.\n\nIf Republicans gain control of one or both chambers, the era of big, progressive bills will likely end. Instead, Biden will be on the defense as Republicans work to undo much of what he accomplished in the first two years of his term.\n\nThe GOP has already vowed to roll back elements of Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, including its new, higher taxes on corporations. And they could work to roll back or challenge some of the president’s climate initiatives that are included in the package.\n\nOther areas where the president has vowed action, like cementing into law the nationwide right to abortion, would have no chance of advancing if Republicans take control. And other programs, like student loan relief, could be subject to blocking efforts by the GOP.\n\nIn all of these areas, Biden is poised to wield his veto pen in rejecting potential Republican attempts to undermine his agenda. As president, Biden has not vetoed any bills, a facet of Democratic control on Capitol Hill.\n\nWhite House officials have already been quietly preparing for the areas where agreement is a necessity – spending bills and an increase of the nation’s debt limit. The two issues represent must-pass items that have been at the center of a series of Congress vs. White House battles over the last decade.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has been among a number of House Republicans who have pledged to deploy similar tactics should they take the majority.\n\nMcCarthy tells CNN first bill would be on border security if GOP wins House 02:05 - Source: CNN\n\nThe first concrete signs of how that may play out will quickly become apparent. Lawmakers will return to Capitol Hill this month with a matter of weeks to reach an agreement to fund the government.\n\nAt the same time, Biden has a long history of working with Republicans to advance pieces of legislation. And he vowed when running for office to find areas to work across the aisle, something he was able to do on several of his key cornerstone legislative wins.\n\nBiden advisers point to the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law and the $250 billion semiconductor manufacturing and science bill as providing a road map to bipartisan success.\n\nBiden’s 2024 decision\n\nAs soon as the 2022 midterm election results are in, national attention will immediately turn to 2024 – including on the question of whether Biden will seek a second term.\n\nWhile Biden and his aides have been quietly thinking about his political future for months and they have accelerated conversations in the last month, those deliberations will accelerate with the close of the midterm cycle. Biden has pointed to family meetings during the holiday stretch as important to his decision-making, though people familiar with the matter say first lady Dr. Jill Biden and others are on board with another run.\n\nFor weeks, the president and his advisers have maintained that his intention, for now, is to run again. Biden moved quickly to transfer his 2020 operation to the Democratic National Committee after he defeated former President DonaldTrump. The party committee has spent the last two years maintaining and beefing up his grassroots list, fundraising pipeline and building out state-level infrastructure that would make up the critical infrastructure of a nascent campaign.\n\nThey’ve also said that no decision is final until the president has had ample opportunity to discuss his political future with his family. But Biden’s 2024 decision won’t just be a family affair – there will also be strong political dynamics at play.\n\nFor one, Trump’s decision to seek a second term – and the timing of that potential announcement – is expected to be a key factor. Biden advisers continue to believe that the president is best positioned to take on his predecessor, and are confident about a second Biden vs. Trump contest.\n\nAl Franken reacts to Trump teasing his run for presidency 02:57 - Source: CNN\n\nAnother consideration: How fellow Democrats respond to the results of Tuesday night. Polling from this fall indicates a majority of Democrats say they do not want Biden to run again in 2024. And losses for Democrats could only exacerbate the sense within the party that a change in direction is required.\n\nWhile many elected officials in Biden’s party have been loyal in expressing their public support for a second term, some others have openly called for change.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota, who said over the summer that he does not believe Biden should run again, told CNN on the eve of Election Day that he believes “a majority of Democrats” feel the same way.\n\n“Regardless of tomorrow’s results, I believe Democrats must rebuild our brand and repopulate our bench of future leaders – for both Congress and the White House,” Phillips said. “President Biden has fulfilled his promise to serve as a stabilizing ‘bridge’ to the future, and I expect a majority of Democrats will be seeking a next generation candidate to take the baton in 2024.”\n\nStaffing changes\n\nBiden has seen remarkably little turnover in the first two years of his tenure among his Cabinet and senior team. The halfway mark of his first term, however, could be a natural moment for staff changes.\n\nIt reflects a reluctance to shake up his team, despite calls at various points to dismiss members of his administration. Biden has refrained from firing or asking for the resignation of any members of his Cabinet and sought to lock in his senior team months ahead of this year’s midterms.\n\nThere has been turnover among his senior staff, including in top West Wing positions. His press secretary, White House counsel and senior adviser for public engagement all left earlier this year. Some officials decided to leave the White House around the one-year mark of the administration, while others departed at the start of summer.\n\nBut Biden’s inner circle remains mostly intact. That includes chief of staff Ron Klain, senior advisers Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti, deputy chiefs of staff Bruce Reed and Jen O’Malley Dillon, communications director Kate Bedingfield and top communications adviser Anita Dunn.\n\nOfficials have said changes are possible both to the president’s Cabinet and his senior White House staff later this year, though no moves are guaranteed. Should Biden announce his decision to run in 2024, several of the members of his core team are considered likely to shift over to the political operation.\n\nEarlier this fall, the White House established a talent search project to prepare for potential vacancies across Cabinet and senior administration roles following the midterm elections.\n\nKlain brought forward the talent search idea, which will be overseen by two Biden White House alums, Jeff Zients and Natalie Quillian. The pair served in similar roles during the 2020 presidential transition.\n\n“It’s just good government to make sure that you’re thinking ahead,” O’Malley Dillon said during an Axios event last week. “The people that are part of this and helping make that change are the people that you’d expect, and you want to see.”\n\nZients and Quillian – who both served in Covid-19 response roles at the White House earlier in Biden’s presidential term – have specifically been conducting a wide and diverse search for prospective candidates outside the administration to fill Cabinet, deputy Cabinet and senior administration roles.\n\nSome top officials, like Covid adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci, are preparing to leave soon. Climate envoy John Kerry has told CNN he plans to stay in the administration at least until this week’s major climate conference in Egypt – without indicating whether he’ll stay longer. And Biden recently appointed a seasoned veteran of Democratic White Houses, John Podesta, to serve as his climate adviser.\n\nThe future of other officials is unclear. Klain has been the subject of speculation, and it is typical for White House chiefs of staff to serve only a portion of a president’s term. But as Biden faces the inevitable personnel transition that all presidents experience after the midterms, Klain’s deeply ingrained role in all corners of the West Wing’s operations may create even more incentive for him to stick around, some officials note, even as they acknowledge he’s given no indication of his intentions.\n\nA potential replacement has been floated in Dunn, who would be the first woman to serve in the role.\n\n“I like the job I have,” Dunn insisted at the Axios event. She added, “I hope Ron Klain stays as long as Joe Biden is president.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Mj Lee Phil Mattingly", "Kevin Liptak", "Mj Lee", "Phil Mattingly"], "publish_date": "2022/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/05/health/daylight-saving-time-explainer-wellness/index.html", "title": "Why the US kept Daylight Saving Time", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nIt’s almost time for clocks to “spring forward” one hour.\n\nOn the second Sunday of March, at 2 a.m., clocks in most of the United States and many other countries move forward one hour and stay there for nearly eight months in what is called Daylight Saving Time. On the first Sunday of November, at 2 a.m., clocks fall back an hour to standard time.\n\nThe current March to November system that the US follows began in 2007, but the concept of “saving daylight” is much older. Daylight Saving Time has its roots in train schedules, but it was put into practice in Europe and the United States to save fuel and power during World War I, according to the US Department of Transportation’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\n\nPro tip: It’s Daylight Saving Time, with singular use of “saving,” not “savings.”\n\nReasons for Daylight Saving Time\n\nDon't forget to reset your alarm clock. Jasmin Merdan/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nThe US kept Daylight Saving Time permanent during most of World War II. The idea was put in place to conserve fuel and keep things standard. As the war came to a close in 1945, Gallup asked respondents how we should tell time. Only 17% wanted to keep what was then called “war time” all year.\n\nDuring the energy crisis of the 1970s, we tried permanent Daylight Saving Time again in the winter of 1973-1974. The idea again was to conserve fuel. It was a popular move at the time when President Richard Nixon signed the law in January 1974. But by the end of the month, Florida’s governor had called for the law’s repeal after eight schoolchildren were hit by cars in the dark. Schools across the country delayed start times until the sun came up.\n\nDaylight savings time ends: 2 men, 2,000 clocks and 48 hours to change them all 03:36 - Source: CNN\n\nBy summer, public approval had plummeted, and in early October Congress voted to switch back to standard time.\n\nIn the US, states are not required by law to “fall back” or “spring forward.” Hawaii, most of Arizona and some territories in the Pacific and Caribbean do not observe Daylight Saving Time. The twice-yearly switcheroo is irritating enough to lawmakers of all political stripes that the US Senate passed legislation in March 2022 to make Daylight Saving Time permanent. The bill passed by unanimous consent. It would need to pass the House of Representatives and be signed by President Joe Biden to become law.\n\nHouse lawmakers failed to vote on the bill in 2022. However, on March 2, a dozen senators forming a bipartisan group reintroduced the legislation that would end clock switching in favor of permanent Daylight Saving Time. Companion legislation to the Sunshine Protection Act was introduced by Rep. Vern Buchanan, a Republican from Florida, in the House.\n\nWhy do we need Daylight Saving Time\n\nStudies over the last 25 years have shown the one-hour change disrupts body rhythms tuned to Earth’s rotation, adding fuel to the debate over whether having Daylight Saving Time in any form is a good idea.\n\nThe issue is that for every argument there is a counterargument. There are studies, for example, that show we have more car accidents when people lose an extra hour of sleep. There are also studies that show robberies decline when there is an extra hour of sunlight at the end of the day. We also know that people suffer more heart attacks at the start of Daylight Saving Time. But what about our mental health? People seem to be happier when there is an extra hour of daylight.\n\nOf course, there’s the economy, which pays for all that outdoor fun in the sun. Although saving energy was often put out as a reason to have Daylight Saving Time, the energy saved isn’t much — if anything at all.\n\nInstead, the lobbying effort for Daylight Saving Time came mostly from different sectors of the economy. In the mid-20th century, lobby groups for the recreational sports industry (think driving ranges) wanted more customers to come out after a day at the office. It’s easier to do so when there is more light at the end of the day.\n\nBut the movie industry didn’t like Daylight Saving Time. You’re less likely to go to a movie when it’s bright outside. Despite the myth, farmers didn’t like it either because it made it difficult to get their food to the market in the morning.\n\nThe bottom line: It’s not clear whether having that extra hour of sunlight at the end of the day versus the beginning is helpful. It just depends on who you are and what you want. And it doesn’t look like Daylight Saving Time in the US is going away anytime soon.", "authors": ["Katia Hetter Stephen Mays", "Katia Hetter", "Stephen Mays"], "publish_date": "2022/11/05"}]}

It is the largest fine the FTC has ever imposed for a rule that it enforces, the agency said Monday.\n\nIn a second and separate settlement, Epic will pay $245 million as refunds to consumers who were allegedly harmed by user-interface design choices the FTC claimed were deceptive. That agreement is the largest administrative order in FTC history, the FTC added.\n\nIn a blog post addressing the twin settlements, Epic said the agreement reflects an evolution in how US laws are applied to the video gaming industry.\n\n“No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here,” Epic said in the blog post. “We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.”\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan said the settlement reflects the agency’s heightened focus on privacy and so-called “dark patterns,” a term used to describe design elements intended to nudge users toward a company’s preferred result.\n\n“Protecting the public, and especially children, from online privacy invasions and dark patterns is a top priority for the Commission, and these enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices,” Khan said in a statement.\n\nThe FTC’s complaint and proposed settlement dealing with children’s privacy was filed in the US District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. In addition to the alleged illegal collection of children’s data, the FTC also claimed that Epic’s default settings for matchmaking and in-game communications exposed children to bullying and harassment.\n\nThe allegations of Epic’s deceptive design choices were filed as an FTC administrative complaint. The complaint claims Epic made it extremely easy for children to purchase in-game items with a single click or button press without parental approval, resulting in more than one million parental complaints to Epic about unwanted charges.\n\nThe FTC further alleged that Epic made it more difficult to cancel purchases of in-game items by burying the option at the bottom of the screen and by requiring consumers to push and hold a button on their controllers to complete the cancellation. Those design choices were allegedly implemented after surveys showed that, when the cancel button was more prominently displayed, accidental charges were the “number one ‘reason’” users clicked on the button, the FTC said.\n\nEpic’s agreement with the FTC, which is not yet final, prohibits the company from using dark patterns or charging consumers without their consent, and also forbids Epic from locking players out of their accounts in response to users’ chargeback requests with credit card companies disputing unwanted charges. The agreement will last for 20 years from the time it is adopted.\n\nIn its blog post, Epic said it has agreed with the FTC to implement a feature that explicitly asks Fortnite users whether to save their payment information for future use. The feature is currently live, it added. The company also recently rolled out a more limited version of “Fortnite” for younger players that allows them to access some features while awaiting parental consent but that restricts chat and purchases.\n\nThe FTC said that as part of its children’s privacy settlement, Epic may no longer enable text and voice chat by default for teenage Fortnite players or those under the age of 13. The company must also establish a comprehensive privacy program and delete the data it allegedly gathered in violation of COPPA.\n\n“We share the underlying principles of fairness, transparency and privacy that the FTC enforces, and the practices referenced in the FTC’s complaints are not how Fortnite operates,” Epic wrote. “We will continue to be upfront about what players can expect when making purchases, ensure cancellations and refunds are simple, and build safeguards that help keep our ecosystem safe and fun for audiences of all ages.”", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/south-jersey/2018/01/03/phh-mount-laurel-settlement/1000962001/", "title": "Mt.

Binghamton and Johnson City sought compensation for \"repair and replacement of various design and construction errors\" connected to the $67 million Phase III improvement project under which the wall was constructed between 2004 and 2006.\n\nThe document stated the suit was filed due to \"breach of contract, professional malpractice, negligence and demand for payment under performance bonds.\" The BAF system was part of the Phase III improvement project.\n\nOverall, a lengthy reconstruction project at the facility project ultimately cost around $275 million.\n\nWhat could have led to the wall collapse at the sewage plant?\n\nAn expert report prepared on behalf of the city, the village and the Binghamton-Johnson City Joint Sewage Board was filed with the Broome County clerk last month. Dr. Paul Carr, a forensic engineer, found that the BAF technology implemented by contractors did not match the size constraints of the site, leading to the downsizing of filters and other components smaller than design standards required.\n\n“The project, during planning and design had a multitude of warnings and opportunities to redirect the trajectory of the project, yet all parties … continued with an ever-decreasing size system, since it was all that would ‘fit’,” wrote Carr.\n\nThe decision led to undersized and overloaded filters, among other challenges that “were all known — yet never shared among the team, and no action taken, which then led to the complete failure of the system,” wrote Carr. “If these issues had been only admitted, the planning work would have had to be erased and delays would be experienced.”\n\nCarr’s report found that the problems predicted during design started occurring “from the months when the BJCSTP first received wastewater flow.” Those problems “worsened over the next three years, culminating in the failure of the treatment system and the collapse of the wall.”\n\nAccording to the 2011 Press & Sun report, sewage board documents dating back to at least February 2009 chronicled a litany of problems with the Phase III project — including cracking walls and leaking joints between the concrete cells — and led the plant's owners to commission an audit of the construction work in 2010.\n\nThe audit report released in February 2011 by LMK Engineers of Pottstown, Pa., found 157 deficiencies in the Phase III project's design and construction, including missing water stops and vertical construction joints that were not installed according to specifications.\n\nMore:Broome County school bus cameras net more than 3K tickets, $750K in fines in 1st year\n\nEconomy:Over $113 million awarded to Binghamton's battery manufacturing efforts\n\nWhat is the Binghamton Johnson City Wastewater Treatment Plant?\n\nThe Binghamton Johnson City Wastewater Treatment Plant on Vestal Road cleans up much of the wastewater and sewage generated by the area’s industrial, commercial and residential activities before entering the Susquehanna River watershed and, eventually, the Chesapeake Bay. Owned by the City of Binghamton and the Village of Endicott, the facility serves much of Broome County’s population, also handling wastewater from the Village of Port Dickinson and the towns of Binghamton, Fenton, Dickinson, Conklin, Kirkwood, Union and Vestal.\n\nThe facility is governed by a six-member board that oversees day-to-day operations, with three members appointed by Binghamton’s mayor and three appointed by Johnson City’s mayor.\n\nState:Polio found in another NY county; Hochul declares emergency. What to know\n\nWhat might a trial have looked like?\n\nConstruction of the Binghamton-Johnson City Joint Sewage Treatment Plant generated thousands of pages of documents, many of which were submitted as possible exhibits during the trial.\n\nSome documents cited by defense attorneys date all the way back to 1998. The exhibit list included email records and memos, superintendent’s reports from throughout 2010 and 2011, engineering progress reports, procurement agreements, management and inspection agreements, wastewater load data sheets and water treatment handbooks, along with payroll records, change orders, cost summaries and invoices.\n\nAttorneys for the various parties submitted a wide list of potential witnesses who may have been called to testify during the trial. The list included expert witnesses, engineers, village and city officials, as well as current and former employees of the companies listed as defendants in the case.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/media/les-moonves-cbs-settlement/index.html", "title": "Les Moonves, CBS to pay $30 million in settlement with NY AG over ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nLeslie Moonves, former chief executive officer of CBS, and CBS reached a $30.5 million settlement with the office of the attorney general of New York, Letitia James, on Wednesday.\n\nThe settlement is a part of an investigation by the state alleging that “CBS and its senior leadership knew about multiple allegations of sexual assault made against Mr. Moonves and intentionally concealed those allegations from regulators, shareholders, and the public for months.”\n\n“The investigation also revealed that another senior executive at CBS — one of the few people who knew about the allegations — sold millions of dollars of CBS stock in the weeks before the allegations became public,” the attorney general’s office said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nMoonves stepped down as CBS’ chief executive in 2018 following multiple sexual misconduct allegations. The exit marked the end of Moonves’ tenure atop one of the most powerful companies in the media world. Moonves denied the allegations.\n\nThe agreement with the New York attorney general requires CBS to pay $28 million, “$22 million of which will go back to CBS shareholders and $6 million to strengthening mechanisms for reporting and investigating complaints of sexual harassment and assault,” the attorney general’s office said in a statement.\n\nMoonves himself must pay $2.5 million, which will also go to CBS shareholders.\n\nA representative for Moonves did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nCBS and Viacom merged to become ViacomCBS in 2019. The merger was a reunion for the two companies, which split in 2006. The company then changed its name to Paramount Global earlier this year.\n\n“We are pleased to resolve this matter concerning events from 2018 with the New York Attorney General’s office, without any admission of liability or wrongdoing,” a Paramount Global spokesperson told CNN Business. “The matter involved alleged misconduct by CBS’s former CEO, who was terminated for cause in 2018, and does not relate in any way to the current company.”\n\nThe attorney general said in her statement that “CBS and Leslie Moonves’ attempts to silence victims, lie to the public, and mislead investors can only be described as reprehensible.”\n\n“As a publicly traded company, CBS failed its most basic duty to be honest and transparent with the public and investors,” she added. “After trying to bury the truth to protect their fortunes, today CBS and Leslie Moonves are paying millions of dollars for their wrongdoing.”\n\nThe press release also says that Gil Schwartz, CBS’ former chief communications officer, sold millions of dollars in shares weeks before the allegations became public. Schwartz died in 2020.\n\nThe New York AG office also claimed on Wednesday that the investigation “uncovered that a captain at the Los Angeles Police Department informed CBS executives of a confidential sexual assault complaint against Mr. Moonves.”\n\nThis included text messages between the captain, a CBS executive, and Moonves, which “revealed that the LAPD captain shared confidential information and worked with CBS executives for months to prevent the complaint from becoming public.”\n\nThe LAPD said on Wednesday that it is “fully cooperating with the New York and California Attorney General offices and have also initiated an internal investigation regarding the conduct of the retired command officer as well as to identify any other member(s) of the organization that may have been involved.”\n\n“What is most appalling is the alleged breach of trust of a victim of sexual assault, who is among the most vulnerable, by a member of the LAPD,” Chief Michel Moore said in a statement. “This erodes the public trust and is not reflective of our values as an organization.”\n\nThe New York AG office said that it “has shared all relevant information about this investigation with the Office of the California Attorney General.”\n\nThe California attorney general couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.", "authors": ["Frank Pallotta"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/tech/facebook-internet-tracking-settlement/index.html", "title": "Meta agrees to pay $90 million to settle lawsuit over Facebook ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFacebook (FB)-parent Meta has agreed to pay $90 million to settle a decade-old class action lawsuit over a practice that allowed the social network to track users’ activity across the internet, even if they had logged out of the platform.\n\nThe settlement, announced on Tuesday, is one of the largest in the history of the social media company, but it’s unlikely to impact the bottom line of the $590 billion internet giant. If approved, the agreement will also rank among the 10 largest data privacy class action settlements in the United States, according to DiCello Levitt Gutzler, one of the law firms involved in bringing the case.\n\n“Reaching a settlement in this case, which is more than a decade old, is in the best interest of our community and our shareholders and we’re glad to move past this issue,” Meta spokesperson Drew Pusateri said in a statement to CNN Business. The company has denied any wrongdoing as part of the deal.\n\nThe case, filed in 2012, dates back to a 2010 update by Facebook called “Open Graph,” which was designed to give users’ friends a closer look at their activity and interests across the internet. As part of the update, the company launched a “Like” button plug-in on sites across the internet, which users could hit to highlight their interests to their Facebook networks.\n\nThe “Like” button plug-in also allowed Facebook to gather data, using cookies, about users’ activity on that site — including, for example, what sites they visit, items they viewed or purchased, and communications they had with that site — regardless of whether the user actually used the button or even knew it was there, according to court documents.\n\nTo alleviate privacy concerns, the company said at the time that it would not collect user-identifying cookies about a user’s activity on partner websites while they were logged out of Facebook. However, researchers found that Facebook continued to collect some identifying cookies on users’ internet activity even after they logged out of the platform, contrary to its promise. After the issue was publicized in 2011, Facebook initially defended the practice but later issued a fix and clarified its policies. The class members in the case accused the company of breach of contract.\n\nThe legal battle dragged on for years. In 2017, after the plaintiffs had submitted a third updated complaint, a judge granted Facebook’s motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs appealed the dismissal and in 2020, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit partly reversed the decision. Facebook appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case, opening the door for the parties to begin negotiating the settlement.\n\nThe settlement applies to US Facebook users who had an account between April 22, 2010, and September 26, 2011, and who visited non-Facebook websites that displayed the “Like” button, a list that included everything from Pandora to ESPN.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Meta agreed to delete the user data it collected through this practice.\n\n“It’s truly a wake-up call for internet and advertising companies who collect user data and use advanced browser tracking,” Stephen Grygiel, one of the lead attorneys representing the class members, said in a statement about the settlement.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/04/business/turbotax-intuit-settlement/index.html", "title": "TurboTax to refund customers $141 million after allegedly steering ...", "text": "1.

None of the class members is timed out.\"\n\nCar owners will have at least seven months from the order to file a buyback claim, and some may have up to the year 2023 to file, he said.\n\nOver the last year, as the high-profile case has been argued in court, Ford opened up a voluntary buyback program. The company disclosed in court documents in 2019 that Ford spent $47 million buying back 2,666 vehicles.\n\nBased on what consumers have reported to the lawyers, most of them appear to have received buybacks between $15,000 to $22,000 on each car, Wu said.\n\n\"We think the number of cars with serious problems are about 100,000,\" he said. \"So assuming 10% of those car owners goes forward and files a claim, and does what they need to do, well, you do the math.\"\n\nWu said he felt uncomfortable offering an estimate, saying the full cost to Ford depends on the number of car owners who apply for financial relief. He did not challenge a \"potential $500 million\" cost to Ford.\n\nBig payout\n\nAn internal Ford report dated December 2016 noted that 350,000 of the problem cars \"have already reached 3+ repairs in the US,\" the Free Press investigation showed.\n\nSo while Wu estimated just 100,000 vehicles qualify for the buyback program, Kirkpatrick cited the Free Press documents and pointed to Ford's own data calculations when predicting a bigger payout.\n\n\"This settlement has two parts,\" Kirkpatrick said. \"People get cash for the inconvenience of having multiple repairs or they may seek to have their vehicle repurchased.\"\n\nA customer must show three or more repairs under most state lemon laws to get repurchase, Kirkpatrick said. \"Under the settlement, a class member can qualify for repurchase either under the applicable state lemon law or the settlement-created standard of four transmission repairs within five years or 60,000 miles.\"\n\nFord wrote in its 2016 internal report, when framing projected costs through 2020, that \"Total quality related spending for DPS6 could reach $3 billion.\"\n\nNearly 2 million owners and former owners stand to be affected by the settlement, which also includes a minimum $30 million in cash payments from Ford to customers that are separate from the buyback program. At least 1.5 million of the vehicles remain on the road today, according to U.S. vehicle registration data.\n\nThe $30 million is set aside for smaller payments of anything from $20 to $250 for customers who may not qualify for a buyback. Kirkpatrick said. He emphasized the settlement agreement requires Ford to spend all $30 million, so after everyone applies for what may seem like a trivial amount, if any remains unclaimed, those consumers who applied may receive a second payment check because \"the residue\" of the $30 million must be distributed.\n\nSo, one month after a brutal 2019 earnings report, Ford is now looking at a new liability of more than half a billion dollars related to Ford Fiesta and Focus vehicles.\n\nMore:Ford COO Jim Farley: Tough road ahead but we know what to do\n\nMore:Ford workers break their silence on faulty transmissions: 'Everybody knew'\n\nMore:US fraud prosecutors demand Ford Focus, Fiesta documents\n\nWarranty cost hell\n\nJim Farley, now chief operating officer at Ford, said Feb. 26 to the Wolfe Research Global Auto, Auto Tech and Mobility Conference in New York that Ford had spent $5 billion on warranty costs in 2019, significantly up in recent years. It was, he said, the kind of uncontrolled spending the company planned to contain in the future with improved quality.\n\nThese cost totals do not include Ford's legal fees.\n\nMore:Lawsuit: Ford hid Focus, Fiesta transmission problems — then blamed customers\n\nMore:Ford: Court of Appeals orders review of Focus, Fiesta class-action deal\n\nMore:Ford to pay millions to Focus, Fiesta owners in transmission settlement\n\nSweeter deal\n\nAnybody who didn't proactively opt out of the class-action case is bound by the settlement agreement. But thousands of consumers have active individual suits against Ford.\n\n\"Whether through direct litigation against Ford or through the class-action settlement, Ford must still be held fully accountable for design and manufacturing defects of the Powershift transmission,” said Ken Stern, a Novi lawyer representing more than 12,000 Focus and Fiesta owners from around the country who opted out of the class-action lawsuit to sue Ford individually. \"The frustration here has been overwhelming and these people deserve relief. Many owners have been waiting years.\"\n\nStern represents a majority of the car owners who rejected the class action.\n\nMeanwhile, consumers who live in California typically can get a repurchase price plus additional civil penalties when they sue individually, Kirkpatrick said. \"California has very pro-consumer laws. A lot of other states can't get anything other than the repurchase price and the statute of limitations is very short.\"\n\nJudge Andre Birotte Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California held a brief hearing Feb. 28 that included all parties to the lawsuit. He asked how consumers would be notified of their options, and lawyers discussed how Ford would be sending postcards to all affected consumers with directions. This is important, lawyers involved said, because the revised settlement provides relief to people who previously thought they failed to qualify for relief.\n\n\"Things have gotten better\" for car owners, Kirkpatrick said.\n\nSubstantial cost\n\nBrian Wolfman, a professor at Georgetown University who litigates public interest appeals all over the country, said industry observers will take note of the settlement details.\n\n\"It's signaling that the kind of behavior that Ford is alleged to have engaged in — of producing defective vehicles, not taking responsibility, potentially hiding the problem from the public — has real costs,\" he said. \"It says this kind of behavior is risky and is going to undermine the bottom line of the company and its reputation with the public.\"\n\nWhen consumers stand to collect significant money and the plaintiffs’ lawyers take care to provide good notice and make claiming easy, the \"claim rate\" to settlement money tends to be higher than average, he said. \" There's no reason, with a big ticket item and good notice, you can’t get a high claim rate like 75%,\" Wolfman said.\n\nNo question, Ford Fiesta and Focus owners have been monitoring the case for months.\n\nWhat about your mother?\n\nPatty Wilden, 64, of Topeka, Kansas, is a retired nurse who purchased her 2014 Ford Focus with just 7 miles on it and her frustration is immeasurable. She paid about $23,000, she said.\n\n\"I just paid my car off three weeks ago, right after replacing the fourth transmission. I am on a limited income,\" she said. \"I was so frustrated I went and talked to the manager. I said, 'I cannot believe you sold me a car you knew had a defective part in it. Would you have sold your mother this car?' He just looked at me. I said, 'I didn't think so.' \"\n\nWhen driving, Wilden said, the car sometimes jerks forward or does not accelerate when she depresses the gas pedal. She said customers have suffered with these cars financially and she's relieved to see consumers get compensated.\n\nNow, after 40 years\n\nRandy Hart, 70, of Columbia, Tennessee, retired from Ford in 2007 after 40 years of service that included material handling and production work. He has been struggling with multiple clutch repairs on his 2013 Ford Focus.\n\n\"The clutches need replaced again,\" he said. \"The last time they were replaced, the manager said, 'You'll be back but don't worry, they extended the warranty.' But now they say he told me wrong.\"\n\nHart is eager to read details of the class-action settlement in hopes of recovery.\n\nConnie Malloy, 53, an author from Milwaukee, replaced her trouble-free 2002 Focus with a 2016 Focus that lurched forward while in reverse gear.\n\n\"I tried two times to get my car in to have the clutch replaced again,\" she said. \"I was told that the wait was almost two months due to volume of clutch replacements.\"\n\nMalloy owned a Ford Escort for 11 years. Her first car was a Ford Mustang. Her brother owned a Mustang, too. The family has been loyal to Ford but the siblings say their loyalty has evaporated.\n\nHer brother, a marketing executive, fought with a Ford dealership in Grand Rapids in 2019 and convinced them to buy back his 2016 Focus for $13,500 \"to be done with this nightmare,\" she said.\n\n\"I was encouraged to trade my car in as opposed to getting it fixed because I was directly told that I would have my car in every six months to have the clutch replaced,\" Connie Malloy said. \"Our hope is to have the car repurchased. Our car is paid off. Both my husband and I are lifelong Ford owners and, because of this, we will never own another Ford.\"\n\nAfter reading details of the settlement, she said, \"I am stunned. This totally feels like justice has been, or will be, served.\"\n\n'I am a U.S. Marine'\n\nGeorge Simon, 91, of Tustin, California, said he has had his 2014 Focus towed to the dealership five times. And he is furious. He provided a receipt for $23,712.59 for his car and documentation of an ongoing struggle with Ford.\n\n\"It's been nothing but a headache,\" he said. \"I am a U.S. Marine who served our country and protected these people for 21½ years. And now all I get is this piece of junk causing me nothing but grief. It has been in the shop since Feb. 11. We're coming up on 30 days. And it was in the shop about 30 days a few months ago.\"\n\nHe didn't know whether he'd qualify for any payments under the settlement but he is eager to read the agreement and see what's possible, he said.\n\n\"I was stranded in traffic when the car would not move with the engine running and the gear shift in drive,\" he said. \"I also put the gear shift in low and it still wouldn't move.\"\n\nSimon wrote after talking with a reporter, \"I was a strong advocate of Ford Motor Company. This transmission problem was, and is, being deliberately mishandled. As a result ... unsuspecting and dedicated Ford customers were treated with disdain & contempt. I purchased in good faith a 2014 Ford Focus Titanium that has given me more nightmares than my combat experiences in Vietnam.\"\n\nWho gets the $30M?\n\nThe mediation agreement says Ford will issue cash payments for:\n\nCar owners with three or more service visits for transmission hardware replacements\n\nCar owners with three or more software updates\n\nCar owners who did not have a documented service visit and were turned away by a Ford dealer after complaining about a transmission problem.

The former President, who is widely expected to run again, had previously eyed Labor Day as his target launch date, but is now being advised to accelerate his timeline to capitalize on what Republicans have described as extraordinary overreach and political persecution by Justice Department officials, including by advisers who previously counseled him to take his time with a 2024 announcement.\n\n“My advice that we should wait until after the midterms was based upon a rather standard landscape. [The Justice Department] set off a nuclear bomb on that landscape yesterday. This is no longer a business-as-usual campaign. Not even close,” said Michael Caputo, a longtime Trump confidant, who previously urged the former President to wait for the 2022 election outcome before diving into a presidential primary.\n\nOne senior House Republican personally encouraged Trump on Tuesday to launch a bid before November, a source familiar tells CNN, dismissing concerns among fellow GOP lawmakers that a pre-midterm announcement could galvanize Democratic voters in a political environment that is otherwise considered favorable for Republicans.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s Capitol Hill allies, told reporters he spoke to the former President twice on Tuesday and “the one thing I can tell you is that I believed he was gonna run before [and] I am stronger in my belief now.”\n\n“I think President Trump is determined now more than ever to straighten this country out,” Graham added.\n\nThe thinking inside Trump’s orbit and among some of his top allies on Capitol Hill has undergone a notable shift since the search was executed at his waterfront estate, said three well-placed sources. Advisers who initially worried Trump would steal the spotlight from vulnerable Democrats if he announced before November have largely abandoned those concerns, while those who fear the FBI search was prompted by compelling evidence against Trump – and he thus shouldn’t rush into another presidential campaign – become a minority in his orbit. The former President, who previously told aides he was concerned about not being able to tap into the $121 million war chest he’s amassed once he declares his candidacy, is now shrugging off those concerns in the last 12 hours, according to a person close to him.\n\n“Where others see criminal jeopardy, Donald Trump sees dollar signs,” said one person close to the former President.\n\n“Most of the downsides of announcing early are regulatory or financial but the Democrats just guaranteed that Trump will raise three times the money he was going to and probably in the immediate future,” Caputo added.\n\nA second person close to Trump said the episode has injected unity into the GOP, whose leaders were welcoming a contested presidential primary just weeks ago amid frustrations with Trump. This person said they had not seen Republicans “this unified behind something in a long time,” pointing to comments by two of Trump’s potential 2024 rivals – Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Vice President Mike Pence – condemning the FBI search.\n\n“When do you see DeSantis and Pence on the same page defending Trump?” said one of the people close to Trump.\n\n‘On the phone since daybreak’\n\nAfter revealing the FBI had conducted a “raid” of his Palm Beach residence in a statement Monday evening, Trump became inundated with calls from allies wanting him to dive into the 2024 race sooner rather than later, according to a person familiar with the matter. He spent most of Tuesday hopping “from one phone call to the next,” this person said, adding that the former President “has been on the phone since daybreak.”\n\nThose conversations were expected to continue well into Tuesday evening, with Trump huddling with Republican Study Committee members for a private dinner at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club. RSC Chairman Jim Banks of Indiana wrote in a tweet hours before the event that Republicans “have a moral duty to fight back” following the search of Trump’s home.\n\nAccording to Banks, Trump used the Bedminster meeting to inform the group of 12 Republicans that he’s “made up his mind” about launching a 2024 presidential bid, it’s just a matter of “when” he announces it.\n\nThe group encouraged Trump to run “sooner than later,” Banks said, who described Trump as being “upbeat,” “fired up,” and “not fazed at all” by the FBI search on his Florida property.\n\n“My sense is he is fired up and ready to go. And he received a lot of encouragement in the room to get out sooner than later,” Banks said.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have already initiated discussions about the party’s oversight response to the FBI search, according to GOP sources familiar with the situation, though these talks remain in the early stages. During a House GOP conference call on Tuesday morning, which had been previously scheduled, top Republicans – including Reps. Jim Jordan and Mike Turner of Ohio – made clear they intend to seek a full accounting from the DOJ about the FBI’s actions, according to sources on the call.\n\nOne of the more immediate steps likely to be taken is sending preservation letters to top DOJ officials – likely including Attorney General Merrick Garland. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy hinted at the party’s investigative plans Monday evening, tweeting: “Attorney General Garland: preserve your documents and clear your calendar.”\n\nThere’s also the possibility that Republicans create a select committee to investigate the agency if the GOP retakes the lower chamber in November. However, a source familiar with his thinking said McCarthy is more inclined to let existing committees take the lead, and the decision is not one House GOP leaders would need to make for several more months.\n\nAcross Trump world, Republicans’ widespread condemnation of the FBI search appeared to dismantle a divide among his advisers over the timing of his 2024 campaign launch that had long been simmering beneath the surface. While many of Trump’s political advisers have warned him to wait until after the midterms to announce his plans, fearing it would harm some GOP candidates on the ballot in November to launch a campaign early this fall, others believe an early announcement could help the former President sell the argument that a federal investigation into Trump – or even a potential indictment – is strictly motivated by politics.\n\n“There are some people making arguments that an indictment is an endorsement” for Trump, said Caputo, suggesting that Trump wouldn’t “present himself as a victim but as the leader of the victims” if he ran in 2024, harkening back to Trump’s use of Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” gaffe as the Democratic presidential nominee in 2016 to cultivate an anti-elitist bond with his base.\n\nIt’s a message Trump has already leaned into. During a rally in Arizona last month, Trump told the audience, “If I renounced my beliefs and… agreed to stay silent, and if I stayed home and took it easy… the persecution of Donald Trump would immediately stop. They would go onto the next victim.”\n\n“But that’s not what I do. I can’t do that,” Trump said.\n\nStill, while many of Trump’s allies are publicly slamming the unprecedented FBI activity at his home, some of the former President’s most loyal supporters are concerned that the search could have only happened because it was provoked by real evidence – noting that federal investigators would be unlikely to take such a drastic step without something tangible to back up their actions.\n\n“They better have the goods or they just went a long way in resurrecting [Trump],” said one former Trump adviser.\n\nA longtime Republican operative who disagreed with that sentiment said the search warrant that was executed at Mar-a-Lago might prove to be politically detrimental for Trump if it becomes “just another reason to pick someone else” for Republican voters in a presidential primary.\n\n“Trump may eventually become too heavy a lift for voters. Now we have better, less draining options,” this person said.\n\nMeanwhile, one top Republican continued to urge Trump on Tuesday to pump the brakes on a presidential announcement until after the midterms, despite the growing outrage over the FBI search among grassroots activists and other potential 2024 candidates.\n\n“You don’t talk about the Super Bowl until you win the playoffs,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told Fox News Tuesday morning.\n\nRepublican response\n\nNearly all of Trump’s potential rivals for the GOP nomination in 2024 have spoken up – a reflection of how the former President remains the central figure around which others in the Republican Party revolve.\n\nSince the news of the search broke, possible White House hopefuls have expressed everything from measured skepticism of the Justice Department’s actions to full-blown accusations of a political witch hunt against Trump.\n\nSeveral have adopted the language of Trump’s allies, accusing the Biden administration of “weaponizing” the Justice Department and targeting a political rival.\n\nTrump spokesman Taylor Budowich condemned the raid as “brazen” and “completely unnecessary” in a statement.\n\n“These disgusting actions by Joe Biden’s administration would make a third-world dictator blush. However, in the Democrats’ desperate attempt to retain power, they have unified and grown the entire conservative movement,” Budowich said.\n\nDeSantis – widely considered Trump’s chief competition in 2024 – responded quickly on Twitter Monday night, calling the search a “raid” and “another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves.”\n\nOthers who may run for president in 2024 echoed those sentiments with similarly strident language and proposals.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas wrote on Twitter that the Justice Department had been “weaponized” and called the search “corrupt & an abuse of power.” Also referring to a “weaponization” of the department was Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who vowed “consequences” against Garland for the search. And Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said the event was an “unprecedented assault on democratic norms and the rule of law,” calling on Garland to resign or be impeached, FBI Director Christopher Wray to be “removed” and for the FBI to be “reformed top to bottom.”\n\nOthers have responded less bombastically but with carefully worded outrage about the FBI’s search. Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin called it a “stunning move” and suggested it was a “selective, politically motivated” search. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tempered his criticism by saying it demonstrated “apparent political weaponization” of federal law enforcement.\n\nStill other Republicans are framing their response even more guardedly, expressing a desire for the Justice Department to answer questions about the search warrant.\n\nOn Twitter, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley called on the Justice Department and the FBI to comment, saying, “If they won’t comment, then Biden owes it to the American people to answer for his agencies.” Pence, who has spent months trying to find an independent political identity from Trump, tweeted a lengthy response to the search.\n\nPence said he has “deep concern” about what he called an “unprecedented search” of Trump’s home and said the event “undermines public confidence” in the justice system.\n\n“Attorney General Garland must give a full accounting to the American people as to why this action was taken and he must do so immediately,” Pence concluded.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who has been talked about as a potential anti-Trump Republican contender in 2024, said the FBI search will “undermine faith in democracy and the rule of law” if the Justice Department “cannot ultimately provide overwhelming evidence that action was absolutely necessary.”\n\nThe Republicans’ collective defensive posture appears to reflect how the party’s leaders remain distrustful of federal law enforcement by default – a development borne out of Trump’s own attacks on the FBI ever since its investigation into his 2016 campaign.\n\nDuring an appearance on CBS Tuesday morning to promote his new book, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said there have long been concerns among Republicans about whether the FBI is “doing their job apolitical[ly].” He also said the search will “raise more questions” and urged people to “let this play out and see what happens.”\n\nAnd when pressed about whether Trump remains the best representative of the GOP, Scott provided a clue about why even those who may run against him in the 2024 primary may feel compelled to accept Trump’s narrative about the search.\n\n“Certainly he is the largest voice in American politics, period,” said Scott. “The more focus you put on him, the more likely his supporters will rally around him.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.", "authors": ["Gaborr Melanie Zanona Kristen Holmes Michael Warren", "Melanie Zanona", "Kristen Holmes", "Michael Warren"], "publish_date": "2022/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/21/politics/joe-biden-reelection-2024-trump-republican/index.html", "title": "As Joe Biden ramps up for a Trump rematch, Democrats worry he'd ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nTop Democrats see Republicans’ unenthusiastic greeting of Donald Trump’s third White House bid with a combination of schadenfreude and perhaps some other German word for terrifying, unintended consequences: They love seeing the former president struggle, but privately some tell CNN they worry this could lead to a more difficult 2024 campaign against a younger, fresher Republican.\n\nPresident Joe Biden heads into Thanksgiving for the first of several stretches with family members whose advice he’ll seek on whether to launch another campaign. He has privately and publicly signaled that he sees Democrats’ better-than-expected midterm results as an endorsement of him running for a second term – and he’s reveling in how many in his party seem to be agreeing with him.\n\nBiden and his aides believe that even with a potential recession looming next year, his reelection argument will grow stronger. They say voters will start to feel the benefits from the implementation of laws the president has signed over the past two years. They think House Republicans flexing their narrow hold on power through government shutdowns and debt ceiling showdowns to try to force repeals of those same laws will help them even more.\n\nAccording to CNN’s conversations with 24 Democratic elected officials, top operatives and Biden aides, the past two weeks have left them more confident that Biden would be their best bet to beat Trump in 2024. Some say they miscalculated how much appeal Biden continues to hold. Others now realize voters see him as a likable enough bulwark against extremism and a decent man, who can be a standard-setting, consensus choice amid historic polarization. Several onetime opponents say they’ve come around to thinking that maybe his approach in not responding with rage to the people raging at him has been more effective with voters.\n\n“What he did translated more with voters than favorability ratings, and that’s important for Democrats to remember as we go forward,” said North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, adding that after talking to Biden on the election night call he received as chair of the Democratic Governors Association, he’d be “surprised” if the president doesn’t run again.\n\nWhen asked, though, how they’d feel about Biden’s chances against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis or other Republicans who could make a generational argument without the baggage Trump brings, many Democrats’ voices tend to tighten. “Not great,” said one top operative. “Uneasy,” said two others, in separate conversations.\n\nOthers point out that nearly all of Democrats’ key midterm victories were narrowly won, leaving them worried about how little room for error there likely will be next time.\n\nFour Democratic members of Congress, asking not to be named to speak candidly, estimated that at least half of their colleagues would pick someone other than Biden as their 2024 nominee – if they could vote by secret ballot.\n\nAll four also said that if there were a second question about whom they’d want instead, the votes would be all over the place – with several noting that one of the strongest arguments for Biden running is that it would help Democrats avoid a chaotic primary and give their bench time to gain more experience before the 2028 election.\n\nMinnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, the first Democrat in Congress to call for Biden not to run, said that regardless of his respect for the president, the midterm results or where Biden’s popularity lands, the party needs to “create pathways for new generations of leaders.”\n\n“There’s a pragmatic element of this too. I believe the country will be in a place where they’ll be looking for a new generation as well,” said Phillips, whom several colleagues note has become the person voicing feelings others are keeping private.\n\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet, one of the few Democrats running in 2022 who appeared at an event with the president and scored an unexpectedly big reelection win in the onetime swing state, had long talked about how the best argument for another Biden campaign was that he could beat Trump again.\n\nAsked after Trump’s announcement if he’d be as confident in Biden against another Republican, Bennet dodged.\n\n“I just think that’s too contingent a question to answer,” the senator said.\n\nA few weeks ago, when many expected significant House losses for the party, Phillips was one of multiple Democrats predicting that the election aftermath would include more and louder calls for Biden to step aside. Phillips acknowledged last week that those calls haven’t come but attributed that more to the “culture of deference” in Congress than to renewed support for Biden.\n\n“It’s a little bit like when Trump was president, and none of the Republicans would say what they really thought on the record,” said one Democratic strategist.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ann McLane Kuster also expressed doubts about Biden running for reelection as she campaigned in New Hampshire. Back in Washington after winning a sixth term by a wider-than-anticipated margin, she said she’s still not convinced.\n\n“I’m still in a wait-and-see, and I think a lot of people are,” Kuster said, noting that she has “been a Biden fan since she I was pregnant with my son, who was just sworn into the New York Bar.”\n\nAsked how she’d feel about Biden going up against a Republican who was younger and fresher than Trump, Kuster initially responded with a long “Hmmmmm.” She said she’s less concerned about that because she believes if Biden does run, that will drive Republicans to Trump, while if Biden doesn’t, that will drive them away from Trump.\n\n“It is an easy thing for people to underestimate Joe Biden – and they’ve been doing it and being wrong for a couple of election cycles now,” said one Biden adviser. As for those who still have doubts, “there are some Democrats who aren’t happy unless they can be anxious about something,” the adviser added.\n\nIncoming members of Congress who won their seats this year are among the most openly enthusiastic about a Biden reelection campaign.\n\n“I think he’s the guy who can beat anybody,” said California Rep.-elect Robert Garcia, who’s close with both the West Wing and Vice President Kamala Harris. “Presidents get reelected if they’re successful and if the American people want them back, and to me there is nothing in the president’s first two years that points to that he shouldn’t run again.”\n\nMaxwell Frost, the 25-year-old Florida Democrat who is the first member of Generation Z (those born after 1996) elected to Congress, said he was supporting Biden too, minutes after borrowing a tie to make his first visit to the House floor to watch 82-year-old House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announce she’d be stepping down from leadership.\n\n“He’s been unafraid to put forth bold, transformational ideas and policies, and that’s really what excites young voters,” Frost said, citing the infrastructure deal and the health care, tax and climate package dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act. Asked whether he was concerned about a potential generational contrast with Biden if the Republicans back someone other than Trump, Frost said, “I’d say good luck with whoever they put up.”\n\n“It doesn’t matter” who the Republican nominee is, argued Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, fresh off his own reelection in a swing state that Biden won narrowly in 2020. “The Biden-Harris administration will carry Nevada and will carry the country again.”\n\nDrawing a contrast with Trump\n\nAfter a strategy of not even saying Trump’s name at all in his first year and then pounding on Trump by name throughout the midterm campaigning, the president is expected to revert to talking about his predecessor “sparingly,” an adviser said. What Biden and aides will do, though – like with the new section of the White House website touting administration achievements, which was launched last week a few hours before Trump’s presidential announcement – is emphasize their record in contrast with Trump’s rhetoric.\n\nA Trump rematch might be easier, several Democratic operatives involved with the preliminary thinking said, because they’d know how to go about it. They hope that one lesson of the midterms is Democrats’ ability to make voters see many leading Republicans as extreme and tainted by Trump.\n\nAs they wait on a Biden decision that they expect to drag into at least January, and with members of the president’s own Cabinet divided on whether he’ll go through with a launch, aides are planning to head into next year with events and travel to showcase now-tangible achievements.\n\n“There’ll be a bridge built that wasn’t built this year, more of the impact of prescription drug benefits will be felt,” said Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, an early and consistent Biden supporter.\n\nEarly planning is also underway for a string of state dinners, starting with one scheduled for December 1 to honor French President Emmanuel Macron, both to highlight what the White House says is Biden’s reasserting of American global leadership and to demonstrate another notch toward a post-pandemic normal.\n\nMeanwhile, aides are also gearing up for two years of trying to frame every move by the new House Republican majority as extremist overreach, including undermining the legitimacy of any investigations in the eyes of the media and the public. They’re counting on House Republicans who face tough reelections in 2024 to themselves back away from some of the biggest threats, such as impeaching the president. And as personally painful as any Republican inquiries of Biden’s son Hunter will be for the president, aides believe that the politics will boomerang in their favor by making Republicans look like they’re chasing conspiracy theories down rabbit holes rather than governing and by making Biden seem empathetic in a way that has consistently been his greatest strength.\n\n“The last two Democratic presidents lost the House – by far more than Biden did – and in both cases, that provided a powerful reelection foil,” said a person familiar with White House thinking. “We are dealing with a much more extreme Republican Party than they were. … But Biden does not provoke the Republican base in the way that other national Democrats have.”\n\nAge vs. ‘wisdom and experience’\n\nRepublican attempts to make Biden an anchor to Democratic midterm candidates by saying his name and flashing his image in ads about inflation, border control or gas prices don’t seem to have been decisive for independents and swing voters. Biden’s greatest weakness has repeatedly proved his greatest strength, several Democratic strategists said: People don’t feel strongly about him. There are few T-shirts with his face on them or flags with his name on them, but he also doesn’t inspire passionate hate. As Republican operatives tend to admit, voters’ sense of him is so well established that it’s hard to make anything stick to him.\n\nWhat does stick, in focus group after focus group: his age – he turned 80 on Sunday – and the sense that he’s not up to the job. One place where that caused problems: Pennsylvania, where Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman was seen as independent from Biden – until the aftermath of his stroke. Then, focus groups noted, voters began to draw connections between the two men related to their physical fitness for office. (Fetterman, however, was able to overcome enough of those perceptions to help his party flip an open seat.)\n\nBiden “has his work cut out for him in terms of having folks believe he can command this job for four more years,” said one person familiar with the focus group findings.\n\nSome Democratic politicians and operatives shudder imagining a younger Republican nominee campaigning around the country at multiple stops a day, bounding onstage and reinforcing the skepticism that’s already in voters’ minds. These Democrats say their solace is fantasizing about Trump failing to snag the GOP nomination and then sabotaging the Republican nominee’s campaign, out of spite.\n\nBiden’s inner circle has seen the focus group data and has heard the same complaints. They’ve also seen how those concerns faded over the summer, as Biden signed more bills. That mattered for other Democrats too, with Rep. Dan Kildee, who just won a tight reelection race in Michigan, saying that people connecting with those legislative successes “got me over the finish line.”\n\nKildee said he believed Biden would be strong against Trump in Michigan, which Trump won by less than half a point in 2016 but Biden carried by 3 points in 2020. As for how he’d fare against another Republican, “there’s too many chess moves between now and then to figure that out yet,” Kildee said.\n\nAfter how unpredictable the factors shaping the 2020 and 2022 elections were, Biden’s circle doesn’t see a point in trying to guess exactly what he’d be campaigning on by the end of 2024. But the Biden adviser touted the president’s “wisdom and experience,” saying that had “allowed him to achieve an extraordinary legislative record and extraordinary record of global leadership in the first two years of his term.”\n\n“I don’t see anybody else that’s stronger. With all the things he’s doing, I don’t care how old he is,” said Eileen Reyes, a former Pete Buttigieg supporter from Luzerne, Pennsylvania, speaking ahead of Biden’s joint rally with Barack Obama in Philadelphia the Saturday night before the election.\n\nStephanie Schlatter, a lawyer in Washington who wore her old Biden-Harris white T-shirt to the celebratory speech Biden delivered at a Washington theater two days after the midterms, agreed.\n\n“My parents are older than he is, and they’re still whooping it up,” she said. “People are starting to come back from the nastiness, and they’re starting to see results.”", "authors": ["Edward-Isaac Dovere"], "publish_date": "2022/11/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/26/politics/key-dates-2022-midterm-election/index.html", "title": "Key dates for the 2022 midterm election | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nVoting ends in the first primaries for the 2022 midterm elections in a matter of days.\n\nTexas will kick things off on March 1, and the primary process will wrap up more than six months later on September 13 in Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. Those contests will tee up Election Day on November 8, when control of the House and Senate will be up for grabs as well as several high-profile gubernatorial races in key battleground states.\n\nThe outcome of November’s elections will serve as a referendum on President Joe Biden’s first two years in office and set the table for the 2024 presidential campaign. Biden and congressional Democrats have scored some legislative victories and are poised to confirm a history-making pick to the Supreme Court in Ketanji Brown Jackson. Yet economic anxiety punctuated by inflation concerns combined with exhaustion over the coronavirus pandemic has tilted the political environment in favor of Republicans, who also have electoral history on their side. There is also a unique dynamic to these midterms, with former President Donald Trump eyeing a potential return to the White House and looking to lay the groundwork by endorsing candidates in GOP primaries who have embraced his lies about the 2020 election results.\n\nThe majority in the Senate, currently split 50-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaker, is expected to come down to a handful of competitive races. There are four Democratic incumbents running in battleground states Biden won in 2020: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire. Republicans have incumbents seeking reelection in Wisconsin and Florida, and they’re defending three open seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio. In total, 34 Senate seats will be decided in November.\n\nIn the House, Republicans need a net gain of five seats to win control of the chamber. More than 40 members, mostly Democrats, have announced they are leaving Congress. Some of those decisions were driven by redistricting, the once-a-decade process of redrawing congressional and state legislative boundaries. In states with partisan control of the process, both parties have tried to draw new maps to their advantage: to pick up more seats, shore up incumbents or reduce the number of competitive districts.\n\nThere are currently 27 Republican governors and 23 Democratic governors – with 36 seats up for grabs this November – including several in battleground states that could play a significant role in deciding the outcome of the 2024 election. Beyond elections for governor, state races for secretary of state and attorney general will receive unprecedented attention, as the battle over how elections are handled intensifies in the aftermath of the 2020 campaign.\n\nHere are the key dates and contests to watch as the 2022 primary process plays out:\n\nMarch 1: Texas primaries\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott Lynda M. Gonzalez/Pool//Getty Images\n\nThe Lone Star State is home to a few intriguing GOP statewide primaries and a House Democratic primary that highlights the ideological divide within the party.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott is seeking reelection to a third term, which could set the stage for a potential 2024 bid. First, he must get through a GOP primary that includes challenges from former (Florida) Rep. Allen West and businessman and ex-state Sen. Don Huffines.\n\nThere is also a contested Republican primary in the race for state attorney general, with incumbent Ken Paxton being challenged by state Land Commissioner George P. Bush, US Rep. Louie Gohmert and former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman. Paxton’s rivals have taken aim at his legal problems, but Trump has thrown his support behind the incumbent, who led a failed effort to challenge the 2020 election results in four battleground states at the US Supreme Court.\n\nIn south Texas, there is a rematch of a 2020 Democratic primary in the 28th Congressional District between centrist Rep. Henry Cuellar and immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros, who has received the endorsement of progressive leaders, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The FBI searched Cuellar’s home and campaign office in January, but the nine-term congressman released a video a week later vowing to seek reelection despite the “ongoing investigation.”\n\nThe Dallas-area 3rd Congressional District is the site of a battle over how the GOP should handle the 2020 election and the events of January 6, 2021. Rep. Van Taylor is a conservative Republican, but he voted to accept the 2020 presidential election results and supported an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. (He opposed the select committee that was eventually created.) He’s now facing several primary challengers who question the results of the election, criticize Taylor’s vote on the commission and downplay the Capitol insurrection. The district also became much more Republican in redistricting, so while the seat shouldn’t be competitive in November, it could be easier for a more right-wing candidate to defeat Taylor in the primary.\n\nApril 5: Special election primary in California’s 22nd Congressional District\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes JIm Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFormer GOP Rep. Devin Nunes set off this special primary contest with his resignation from Congress in January to join Trump’s new social media venture. Assuming no candidate gets a majority of the vote in the all-party primary, the top two finishers will face off in June, when California holds its general election primaries, giving the eventual winner about six months to represent this Central Valley seat in Congress. The district will have new boundaries for the election held in November.\n\nMay 3: Indiana and Ohio primaries\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine Paul Vernon/AP\n\nThe Buckeye State has a pair of Republican primary battles that could offer early clues about the GOP electorate heading into the heart of the nominating calendar.\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike DeWine is seeking a second term. His management of the coronavirus pandemic has become the target of fierce criticism from opponent Jim Renacci, a former GOP congressman who has accused DeWine of governing Ohio “like a blue-state liberal.” On the Democratic side, it’s a battle between two former mayors, with Dayton’s Nan Whaley and Cincinnati’s John Cranley squaring off for the nomination.\n\nIn the GOP Senate primary, the crowded contest has at times veered toward political theater as several top contenders – most notably former state Treasurer Josh Mandel and “Hillbilly Elegy” author J.D. Vance – have sought to burnish their conservative pro-Trump credentials with incendiary rhetoric and inflammatory displays of opposition to public health precautions. Former state GOP chair Jane Timken and businessman Mike Gibbons are also making plays for the Trump base, while state Sen. Matt Dolan is testing the theory that there is still room in the party for a candidate who doesn’t fully embrace the former President.\n\nAfter a history of teasing potential statewide bids only to pass, Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan decided to take the plunge (with a helpful shove from redistricting) and launched a bid for US Senate. He faces a primary challenge from consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper. While Ohio has been trending red in recent years, Ryan is hoping to follow a similar blue-collar blueprint that has helped Sen. Sherrod Brown win statewide three times, most recently against Renacci in 2018.\n\nMay 10: Nebraska and West Virginia primaries\n\nWest Virginia Rep. David McKinley Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nWest Virginia is poised to hold the country’s first incumbent vs. incumbent primary of the 2022 cycle, featuring GOP Reps. David McKinley and Alex Mooney. The Republicans were drawn into the new 2nd Congressional District after the state lost a House seat following the 2020 census. The matchup will be an early test of Trump’s sway in GOP primaries, with the former President backing Mooney over McKinley, who did not object to counting the Electoral College vote and supported the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Mooney objected to the Pennsylvania electoral count, but not Arizona, and voted against the infrastructure package.\n\nIn Nebraska, outgoing Gov. Pete Ricketts urged Trump to stay out of the GOP primary to replace him, but the former President spurned the request and threw his support behind businessman Charles Herbster last October. Ricketts later endorsed Nebraska University Regent Jim Pillen, setting up a proxy battle between the two GOP leaders who both carried the Cornhusker State by wide margins.\n\nMeanwhile, in Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District, embattled GOP Rep. Jeff Fortenberry is facing a primary challenge from state Sen. Mike Flood, who has been endorsed by Ricketts and former Gov. Dave Heineman. Fortenberry was indicted last fall for allegedly concealing information and lying to federal authorities investigating illegal campaign contributions. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nMay 17: Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania primaries\n\nCelebrity doctor Mehmet Oz Brad Barket/Getty Images\n\nThe fight for the GOP Senate nomination in Pennsylvania could be one of the nastiest and most expensive primary contests of the entire 2022 cycle, with hedge fund executive David McCormick and celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz trading pointed attacks over their personal ties to foreign countries. Both contenders are pumping massive amounts of their personal wealth into TV ads. The crowded field also includes former US ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands, who, like the top contenders, is relying on her personal wealth, and Jeff Bartos, the party’s 2018 nominee for lieutenant governor. The race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Pat Toomey was upended last November when Trump-backed candidate Sean Parnell ended his campaign amid scrutiny of his turbulent personal life. So far, the former President has held off on throwing his support behind another candidate, a move that could shake up the trajectory of the primary.\n\nDemocrats see the Keystone State as perhaps the party’s best opportunity to flip a Republican-held Senate seat. The competition on the Democratic side features candidates with distinct backgrounds who represent divergent ideological factions within the party. Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, an outspoken progressive and strong fundraiser, and Rep. Conor Lamb, a Marine Corps veteran and former federal prosecutor, are seen as the top contenders. Rounding out the field is state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who has won the backing of some progressive groups.\n\nThere is also a wide-open race for governor in Pennsylvania, with Democrat Tom Wolf term-limited. The lone Democratic candidate is state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who was one of the leading officials rebutting false claims about the commonwealth’s 2020 election results. The GOP field includes state Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman, former US Rep. Lou Barletta, former US Attorney Bill McSwain, state Sen. Doug Mastriano and businessman Dave White. Trump, and his lies about the election, are expected to be a driving factor in the primary.\n\nIn North Carolina, Trump’s early surprise endorsement of US Rep. Ted Budd failed to clear the GOP Senate primary field, with former Gov. Pat McCrory, former US Rep. Mark Walker and Army veteran Marjorie K. Eastman also in the running to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. Walker announced in January he would stay in the Senate race, defying Trump’s effort to get the former congressman to drop his bid and run for a House seat. On the Democratic side, the party has largely cleared the field for former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley.\n\nIdaho is another state home to a GOP civil war, with Gov. Brad Little getting a primary challenge from Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The two have engaged in a political tug-of-war, with McGeachin on multiple occasions using her powers as acting governor to issue executive orders while Little was out of state, only to have the governor rescind them upon his return. Trump endorsed McGeachin last November, calling her a “a true supporter of MAGA from the very beginning.”\n\nMay 24: Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia primaries; Texas runoffs (if necessary)\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp Megan Varner/Getty Images\n\nThere is perhaps no state on the 2022 map where Trump is seeking to exert his influence on the Republican Party more than Georgia, where he rolled out a “Trump ticket” of candidates, including two who are challenging GOP incumbents the former President attacked after they rejected his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe top target for Trump is Gov. Brian Kemp, whose decision to certify Biden’s narrow win in Georgia unleashed fierce and frequent attacks by the former President. The attacks culminated with Trump’s endorsement of former US Sen. David Perdue after he launched a primary challenge against Kemp. Perdue lost his Senate runoff to Democrat Jon Ossoff in January 2021, which some Republicans blamed, in part, on Trump’s efforts to undermine the state’s election results. Now Perdue is making Trump’s lies about the 2020 election a cornerstone of his bid to defeat Kemp. The winner of the GOP primary will likely face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who lost the 2018 gubernatorial race to Kemp by less than 2 percentage points.\n\nWhile the GOP primary for governor is unsettled, Republican Herschel Walker has plenty of running room in the Senate race. The former football star has Trump’s support as he seeks to defeat Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who scored a 2-point victory in a Senate special election runoff against Republican Kelly Loeffler last year. Warnock has been a prolific fundraiser, beginning 2022 with nearly $23 million in the bank.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger stood up to Trump’s demands that he “find” the votes to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. Now the question is whether the state’s top election official can withstand a primary challenge from Trump-backed US Rep. Jody Hice, who embraced the former President’s false claims about the election. Among the Democratic contenders are state Rep. Bee Nguyen, who succeeded Abrams in the state legislature, and former Fulton County Commission chair John Eaves.\n\nThe Atlanta area will host the year’s first Democratic member vs. member primary, with Reps. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux running in the newly redrawn 7th Congressional District after the GOP-controlled state legislature turned McBath’s current seat safely red. Both Democrats flipped suburban districts previously held by Republicans – McBath in 2018 and Bourdeaux in 2020.\n\nGeorgia won’t be the only state testing the power of Trump’s endorsement on this primary day. In Alabama, US Rep. Mo Brooks is hoping the former President’s support will help deliver him the GOP Senate nomination. But the conservative firebrand is running against two well-funded opponents: Katie Britt, a former top aide to retiring Republican Sen. Richard Shelby, and Mike Durant, an aerospace executive and former Blackhawk helicopter pilot. Brooks has struggled to take command of the field, prompting frustration from the former President.\n\nAlabama Gov. Kay Ivey is running for a second full term but is being challenged by several candidates in the GOP primary, including Lindy Blanchard, who served as ambassador to Slovenia in the Trump administration. Blanchard initially launched a bid for the open Senate seat but switched gears to run for governor last December.\n\nIn Arkansas, Sarah Huckabee Sanders – a former White House press secretary under Trump and daughter of former Gov. Mike Huckabee – has a clear path to the Republican nomination as she seeks to succeed GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson. With Trump having carried the Natural State by more than 20 points in 2020, Sanders is poised to follow in her father’s footsteps and become Arkansas’ first female governor.\n\nJune 7: California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota primaries; special election in California’s 22nd Congressional District (if necessary)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nLast September, California Gov. Gavin Newsom became the second governor in US history to defeat a recall. Now the Democrat appears to be coasting toward a second term in office – which could serve as a platform for a national run down the road. There are already signs of a brewing feud between Newsom and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a top GOP 2024 prospect.\n\nSen. Alex Padilla, appointed by Newsom to the seat vacated by Harris ahead of her becoming vice president, is running for a full six-year term. At the same time, Padilla must run in a special election for the remaining weeks of the original Harris term.\n\nCalifornia is losing a US House seat for the first time in the state’s history because of slower population growth. The new congressional maps, drawn by an independent commission, have scrambled the Golden State’s political landscape. With the potential for as many as 10 competitive House races this fall, the state’s top-two primary system could be a major factor in shaping the battleground map.\n\nGOP Rep. David Valadao is running in the newly drawn 22nd District in the Central Valley, which became more favorable to Democrats under redistricting. Valadao is the only House Republican running for reelection who voted for to impeach Trump in 2021 for inciting the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol and doesn’t have a challenger endorsed by the former President (yet). Among his Democratic challengers is Rudy Salas, a California assemblyman and former member of the Bakersfield City Council.\n\nAnother race to keep an eye on is the new 27th District around Los Angeles, where GOP Rep. Mike Garcia is a top target of Democrats. His challengers include former state assemblywoman Christy Smith, who is running for a third time against Garcia. She lost a special election and general election to him in 2020, with the latter race decided by a margin of just 333 votes. Democrat Quaye Quartey, a retired Navy intelligence officer, is also running.\n\nPrior to serving as Trump’s interior secretary, Ryan Zinke spent about two years representing Montana in the US House. Zinke is now eyeing a return to Capitol Hill after Montana gained a House seat following the 2020 census, though he’s facing scrutiny about his current ties to the state.\n\nJune 14: Maine, Nevada, North Dakota and South Carolina primaries\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto is one of the most endangered Senate Democrats running this year, looking to carry a state Biden won by less than 3 points in 2020. The top contender in the GOP field is former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt, the party’s 2018 nominee for governor, who has managed to unite the Trump and Mitch McConnell wings. Still, he is facing a primary challenge from Army veteran Sam Brown, who has demonstrated some fundraising strength.\n\nIn the Silver State’s race for governor, incumbent Democrat Steve Sisolak is seeking a second term, with several Republicans lining up to run against him, including former US Sen. Dean Heller and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo.\n\nThe fate of two Trump targets could be decided this day in South Carolina, where the former President has endorsed primary challengers to GOP Reps. Tom Rice and Nancy Mace. In the 7th Congressional District, Trump has backed state Rep. Russell Fry against Rice, who was one of the 10 House Republicans to vote in favor of Trump’s impeachment last January. Mace, who represents the 1st District, voted to certify the election results (but not for impeachment) and has tried to walk the Trump tightrope, criticizing his actions at times and embracing the former President at others. Trump has thrown his support behind former state Rep. Katie Arrington, who defeated former Rep. Mark Sanford in the 2018 GOP primary for the 1st District, only to lose to Democrat Joe Cunningham in the general election.\n\nIn Maine, a pair of Republicans are attempting political comebacks – with former Gov. Paul LePage and former US Rep. Bruce Poliquin both running for their old jobs. LePage is looking to challenge Democrat Janet Mills, who won the 2018 race to succeed him. Poliquin is eyeing a rematch in the 2nd Congressional District with Jared Golden, the Democrat who defeated him four years ago.\n\nJune 21: DC and Virginia primaries; runoffs in Alabama, Arkansas and Georgia (if necessary)\n\nVirginia Rep. Abigail Spanberger Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nLast November’s victory by Republican Glenn Youngkin in the race for Virginia governor boosted the GOP’s hopes that 2022 would be a strong year for the party in the commonwealth and beyond. This year, the battleground in the Old Dominion will center on two competitive House races featuring a pair of Democrats first elected in the 2018 blue wave – Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria. A handful Republicans have lined up to challenge Spanberger in the new 7th Congressional District, which was redrawn to include more of the Democratic-leaning exurbs in Northern Virginia but no longer includes the congresswoman’s home near Richmond. Luria’s 2nd District, meanwhile, became more favorable to Republicans under redistricting, with state Sen. Jen Kiggans seen as a top contender in the GOP primary.\n\nJune 28: Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma and Utah primaries; runoffs in Mississippi and South Carolina (if necessary)\n\nIllinois Rep. Mary Miller Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc./Getty Images\n\nThe Land of Lincoln is the scene of not one but two dual incumbent House primaries after Illinois lost a seat based on the 2020 census.\n\nThe GOP contest in the 15th District will provide another test of Trump’s endorsement strength, with Reps. Mary Miller and Rodney Davis facing off. The former President rebuffed the advice of GOP leaders to remain neutral and threw his support behind Miller, a freshman member who has stirred controversy since arriving in Congress. Davis, now in his fifth term, is an ally of House Republican leadership and poised to become a committee chairman if the GOP wins control of the chamber.\n\nDemocrats have their own incumbent vs. incumbent primary in the 6th District, where Reps. Sean Casten and Marie Newman will compete for the party’s nomination. Casten flipped a GOP-held seat in 2018 while Newman narrowly defeated conservative Democratic Rep. Dan Lipinski in a 2020 primary before winning her general election race by double digits.\n\nOn the same day, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul will face off against US Rep. Tom Suozzi and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams in the Democratic primary as Hochul seeks a full term in office. Hochul became the first female governor of the Empire State last August after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment. Among the candidates on the Republican side are Rep. Lee Zeldin, 2014 GOP gubernatorial nominee Rob Astorino, businessman Harry Wilson and Andrew Giuliani, the son of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.\n\nWith popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan unable to run for a third term in Maryland, Democrats are hopeful about their prospects of retaking the governor’s mansion after eight years of Republican rule. That optimism has produced a crowded Democratic field, which includes former US Labor Secretary Tom Perez, state Comptroller Peter Franchot, author and former nonprofit chief Wes Moore and former US Education Secretary John King. Trump has endorsed state Del. Daniel Cox, who is running in the GOP primary against Hogan’s preferred candidate, state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz.\n\nJuly 26: North Carolina runoffs (if necessary)\n\nThe calendar in July is rather bare, unless any of the North Carolina primary contests in May require a runoff to decide the winner. Candidates only need to top 30% of the vote to avoid that scenario.\n\nAugust 2: Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington primaries\n\nArizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs Ross D. Franklin/AP\n\nTwo states at the center of Trump’s lies about the 2020 election will vote on this day – Arizona and Michigan.\n\nSparked by the former President’s falsehoods, GOP lawmakers in Arizona launched a months-long partisan review of the results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, which ultimately confirmed Biden’s victory there. That fact has failed to dissuade Republican candidates from embracing Trump’s baseless claims. The former President has endorsed former TV anchor Kari Lake, who is running for governor, and state Rep. Mark Finchem, a candidate for secretary of state, both of whom have cast doubts about the 2020 election results.\n\nCurrent Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is running for governor, putting her defense of the state’s elections at the center of her candidacy. In addition to Lake, the other Republican contenders include former US Rep. Matt Salmon, developer and former Arizona Board of Regents member Karrin Taylor Robson and businessman Steve Gaynor.\n\nFinchem is joined in the GOP secretary of state primary by state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who has advocated for so-called election integrity legislation. The Democratic candidates hoping to succeed Hobbs include Adrian Fontes, the former Maricopa County recorder, and Arizona House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding.\n\nTrump has yet to endorse in the Arizona GOP Senate primary, but his impact on the field has been felt in how the leading candidates are positioning themselves to align with the former President’s policies and politics. That list of hopefuls includes state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, businessman Jim Lamon and venture capitalist Blake Masters, who has the backing of tech billionaire Peter Thiel and the anti-tax Club for Growth.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Kelly and his massive campaign war chest await whichever candidate emerges victorious on the Republican side. The former astronaut is running for a full six-year term after defeating appointed Republican Sen. Martha McSally in a 2020 special election.\n\nIn Michigan, Trump has endorsed two statewide candidates who’ve spread election falsehoods – Kristina Karamo for secretary of state and Matthew DePerno for state attorney general. They are seeking to challenge incumbent Democrats Jocelyn Benson and Dana Nessel, who have pushed back on Trump’s efforts to undermine the state’s 2020 election results.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was on Biden’s short list for vice president, is also seeking a second term. Businessman Kevin Rinke and former Detroit police chief James Craig are among a packed field of GOP candidates looking to challenge Whitmer.\n\nThe new congressional map in Michigan has set up an all-incumbent primary battle in the 11th district featuring Democratic Reps. Haley Stevens and Andy Levin. The district’s new lines make it a safer seat for Democrats than the one Stevens flipped in 2018. Levin has deep political roots in the state, with his father, Sander, serving in the US House for more than 30 years and his uncle Carl Levin serving six terms as a US senator.\n\nGOP Rep. Peter Meijer is running for reelection in Michigan’s 3rd Congressional District after voting for impeachment and faces a primary challenge in John Gibbs, a former Trump administration official who has the backing of the former President.\n\nTrump has also endorsed state Rep. Steve Carra, who had launched a bid against Rep. Fred Upton, another GOP member who voted to impeach. But Upton has not yet officially announced if he’s running for another term, which would mean having to face off against fellow GOP Rep. Bill Huizenga in the newly drawn 4th District.\n\nTwo House Republicans from Washington who voted for Trump’s impeachment – Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse – will also face GOP primary voters on this day. Both have Trump-backed opponents in their all-party primaries. Retired Army Special Forces officer Joe Kent is challenging Beutler, while failed 2020 gubernatorial candidate Loren Culp is seeking to oust Newhouse. Like in California, the top two finishers in the primary advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation.\n\nIn Missouri, there is a crowded GOP primary to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Roy Blunt in a state that should favor the party. Some Republicans are concerned that if former Gov. Eric Greitens emerges as the nominee, it could put the seat in play for Democrats, given his scandal-plagued past. GOP Sen. Josh Hawley has endorsed US Rep. Vicky Hartzler in the primary, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, US Rep. Billy Long, state Senate President Pro Tempore Dave Schatz and St. Louis attorney Mark McCloskey also in the mix. On the Democratic side, Marine veteran Lucas Kunce appears to be the leading contender.\n\nAugust 4: Tennessee primaries\n\nFormer State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus Gabriel Aponte/Getty Images South America/Getty Images for Concordia Ameri\n\nTennessee Republicans cracked Democratic Rep. Jim Cooper’s Nashville-based seat in redistricting, diluting the power of the vote in Davidson County, spreading it across three GOP-leaning districts. The move prompted Cooper to announce his retirement. It has also sparked a GOP showdown for the new 5th Congressional District. Trump is backing Morgan Ortagus, a former State Department spokesperson, while two top allies of the former President – US Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn – are supporting social media influencer Robby Starbuck. Former state House Speaker Beth Harwell is running for the redrawn seat as well.\n\nAugust 9: Connecticut, Minnesota, Vermont and Wisconsin primaries\n\nWisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson is the only Republican senator seeking reelection in a state Biden carried in 2020. A dozen Democrats have lined up to take on the two-term incumbent, who has evolved from a tea party insurgent during his first run in 2010 to a promoter of Covid-19 and January 6 conspiracies. The leading Democratic challengers appear to be Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski.\n\nThe GOP field to take on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers is less crowded, with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch, state Rep. Timothy Ramthun and Kevin Nicholson, who lost in the 2018 Senate Republican primary, among the contenders.\n\nThe last time a Republican candidate won a statewide office in Minnesota was 2006, when former Gov. Tim Pawlenty was narrowly reelected. Several Republicans are running to prevent Democratic Gov. Tim Walz from winning a second term. Misinformation about Covid-19 and the 2020 election have been key issues in the GOP primary. One leading candidate is Scott Jensen, a former state senator and family doctor, who has voiced vaccine skepticism and opposition to mandates. Another physician, Neil Shah, has suggested he took an unproven drug to treat coronavirus. At a forum last December, none of the five candidates who participated were willing to answer a plain “yes” when asked whether they thought Biden won a “constitutional majority in the Electoral College.”\n\nUltimately, whether Republicans lean toward a candidate like Jensen or Shah or a more mainstream pick like state Sens. Paul Gazelka or Michelle Benson, the primary may well be decided long before August. The state GOP will endorse a candidate at its convention in May and most, if not all, of the other candidates could drop their bids if they don’t earn that nod.\n\nVermont is the only state in the union that’s never sent a woman to Congress. But Democratic Sen. Pat Leahy’s decision to call it quits after almost 50 years in the Senate started a domino effect that could change that. Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, the state’s lone House member, is trying to move across the Capitol to succeed Leahy. That’s set up a Democratic primary in which two of the leading candidates are women. Lt. Gov. Molly Gray and state Sen. Becca Balint both declared for the seat shortly after Welch made his announcement.\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican who leads one of the most Democratic states in the nation, will also be up for reelection (Vermont governors serve two-year terms) but he’s yet to announce his plans.\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, also face voters this year.\n\nAugust 13: Hawaii primaries\n\nHawaii Lt. Gov. Josh Green State of Hawaii\n\nTerm limits prevent Hawaii Gov. David Ige from seeking a third term, and several Democrats have lined up to succeed him. The primary field includes Lt. Gov. Josh Green, a doctor who has been one of the main faces of the state’s pandemic response, former Hawaii first lady Vicky Cayetano and former Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell. US Rep. Kai Kahele has also been mentioned as a potential candidate.\n\nHawaii is one of the most Democratic states in the country, so the winner of the Democratic primary will be heavily favored in November.\n\nAugust 16: Alaska and Wyoming primaries; South Dakota runoffs (if necessary)\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney Oliver Contreras/Pool/Getty Images\n\nTwo of Trump’s top GOP targets in 2022 are Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. The coincidence of both states holding primaries on the same day sets up an epic test of the former President’s sway in the GOP.\n\nThere is arguably no Republican who has drawn Trump’s ire more than Cheney, who voted in favor of impeachment last year and is the vice chair on the House select committee investigating the events surrounding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Trump has endorsed Harriet Hageman, a onetime critic, as the candidate to fulfill his goal of ousting Cheney. So has House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And the Republican National Committee took the unprecedented step of censuring the congreswoman. Working in Cheney’s favor are her family’s deep roots in the state and her massive campaign war chest. She also might benefit from the fact that she could win the primary without receiving a majority of the vote, as Hageman has not cleared the field of Cheney challengers despite Trump’s support.\n\nMurkowski is the lone Republican running for reelection this year who voted to convict Trump at his impeachment trial in the Senate. The former President has backed Kelly Tshibaka, who formerly led Alaska’s Department of Administration. But the race in Alaska will be complicated by the state’s new election system, with all the Senate candidates running on a single ballot and the top four finishers, regardless of party, advancing to the general election, which will be decided by ranked-choice voting. Given that, Murkowski is almost certain to advance to the November vote, where she could benefit from the reallocation process. The senator has faced tough reelection campaigns before – winning as a write-in candidate in 2010 after losing the GOP primary to a tea party challenger. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and his allies are firmly behind Murkowski’s bid.\n\nAugust 23: Florida primaries; Oklahoma runoffs (if necessary)\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, who has made himself a national figure with a laissez-faire approach to the Covid-19 pandemic and willingness to embrace hot-button conservative causes, might be eyeing another office in a few years. But first, he needs to win a second term, with the possibility of a decisive victory likely to only spark further speculation about his ambitions beyond the Sunshine State.\n\nThree Democrats are hoping to derail DeSantis’ rise, with US Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Republican governor, trying to reclaim his seat as Florida’s chief executive. Crist leads the Democratic field in fundraising. The other contenders to take on DeSantis are state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried and state Sen. Annette Taddeo.\n\nBefore DeSantis, Sen. Marco Rubio was seen as the GOP’s rising star in Florida. His failed 2016 presidential bid upended that trajectory and led Rubio to reverse course and seek reelection to the Senate. Now he’s seeking a third term, with the onetime tea party darling turned Trump critic having fully embraced the former President amid Florida’s shift to the right. US Rep. Val Demings, a former Orlando police chief, is the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic primary and has been a strong fundraiser.\n\nThe outcome of these two races could dictate heading into 2024 how much attention and resources Democrats will deploy to Florida, which has been one of the premier battleground states in presidential races for many cycles.\n\nSeptember 6: Massachusetts primaries\n\nFormer state Rep. Geoff Diehl Matt Stone/MediaNews Group/Boston Herald/Getty Images\n\nThe decision by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker to not seek a third term in deep-blue Massachusetts sets up another test of Trump’s power inside the GOP. Former state Rep. Geoff Diehl originally launched his campaign as a challenge to Baker and picked up Trump’s endorsement. But while Diehl won’t have the popular incumbent as an opponent, he also doesn’t have a clear lane to November. Chris Doughty, a businessman and self-described moderate, joined the race in late January. While he doesn’t have electoral experience like Diehl, Doughty was able to open his campaign with half a million dollars of his own money.\n\nOn the Democratic side, state Attorney General Maura Healey, who entered the race after Baker declined to run again, leads the entire field in fundraising. State Sen. Sonia Chang-Díaz is also running. Despite favoring Democrats at the federal level, Massachusetts has a habit of electing moderate Republican governors. Without Baker on the ballot, Democrats are hopeful they’ll avoid such a fate this November.\n\nSeptember 13: Delaware, New Hampshire and Rhode Island primaries\n\nNew Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan Erin Scott/Getty Images\n\nDemocratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire is one of the GOP’s top targets in 2022, but the party’s hopes of flipping the seat took a hit last November when popular Granite State Gov. Chris Sununu passed on a Senate bid. Sununu’s decision sets up what could be a long and crowded GOP primary, given New Hampshire’s late primary date. Candidates include former Londonderry Town Manager Kevin Smith, retired Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc and state Senate President Chuck Morse, who’s received praise from McConnell.\n\nRedistricting is poised to make New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, currently held by Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, more favorable for Republicans. That shift has attracted a wide field of GOP challengers, including Matt Mowers, who lost to Pappas in 2020, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt and Gail Huff Brown, a former TV anchor and the wife of former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown.\n\nThere will likely be another crowded primary on this day on the Democratic side in the Rhode Island governor’s race. Then-Lt. Gov. Dan McKee was elevated to the top job when Gina Raimondo was appointed as Biden’s commerce secretary last year, and he’s now seeking a full term. But Rhode Island Democrats aren’t just letting McKee have it. The packed field currently includes Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, former Secretary of State Matt Brown and Helena Foulkes, a former executive at Rhode Island-based CVS.\n\nNovember 8: Election Day; Open primaries in Louisiana", "authors": ["Terence Burlij Melissa Holzberg Depalo Ethan Cohen", "Terence Burlij", "Melissa Holzberg Depalo", "Ethan Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/opinions/gop-blueprint-to-steal-the-2024-election-luttig/index.html", "title": "Opinion: The Republican blueprint to steal the 2024 election | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: J. Michael Luttig, appointed by President George H. W. Bush, formerly served on the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit for 15 years. He advised Vice President Mike Pence on January 6. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nNearly a year and a half later, surprisingly few understand what January 6 was all about.\n\nFewer still understand why former President Donald Trump and Republicans persist in their long-disproven claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Much less why they are obsessed about making the 2024 race a referendum on the “stolen” election of 2020, which even they know was not stolen.\n\nJ. Michael Luttig Joe Perry/The Morning News/AP\n\nJanuary 6 was never about a stolen election or even about actual voting fraud. It was always and only about an election that Trump lost fair and square, under legislatively promulgated election rules in a handful of swing states that he and other Republicans contend were unlawfully changed by state election officials and state courts to expand the right and opportunity to vote, largely in response to the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe Republicans’ mystifying claim to this day that Trump did, or would have, received more votes than Joe Biden in 2020 were it not for actual voting fraud, is but the shiny object that Republicans have tauntingly and disingenuously dangled before the American public for almost a year and a half now to distract attention from their far more ambitious objective.\n\nThat objective is not somehow to rescind the 2020 election, as they would have us believe. That’s constitutionally impossible. Trump’s and the Republicans’ far more ambitious objective is to execute successfully in 2024 the very same plan they failed in executing in 2020 and to overturn the 2024 election if Trump or his anointed successor loses again in the next quadrennial contest.\n\nThe last presidential election was a dry run for the next.\n\nFrom long before Election Day 2020, Trump and Republicans planned to overturn the presidential election by exploiting the Electors and Elections Clauses of the Constitution, the Electoral College, the Electoral Count Act of 1877, and the 12th Amendment, if Trump lost the popular and Electoral College vote.\n\nThe cornerstone of the plan was to have the Supreme Court embrace the little known “independent state legislature” doctrine, which, in turn, would pave the way for exploitation of the Electoral College process and the Electoral Count Act, and finally for Vice President Mike Pence to reject enough swing state electoral votes to overturn the election using Pence’s ceremonial power under the 12th Amendment and award the presidency to Donald Trump.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe independent state legislature doctrine says that, under the Elections and the Electors Clauses of the Constitution, state legislatures possess plenary and exclusive power over the conduct of federal presidential elections and the selection of state presidential electors. Not even a state supreme court, let alone other state elections officials, can alter the legislatively written election rules or interfere with the appointment of state electors by the legislatures, under this theory.\n\nThe Supreme Court has never decided whether to embrace the independent state legislature doctrine. But then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in separate concurring opinions said they would embrace that doctrine in Bush v. Gore, 20 years earlier, and Republicans had every reason to believe there were at least five votes on the Supreme Court for the doctrine in November 2020, with Amy Coney Barrett having just been confirmed in the eleventh hour before the election.\n\nTrump and the Republicans began executing this first stage of their plan months before November 3, by challenging as violative of the independent state legislature doctrine election rules relating to early- and late-voting, extensions of voting days and times, mail-in ballots, and other election law changes that Republicans contended had been unlawfully altered by state officials and state courts in swing states such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Michigan.\n\nThese cases eventually wound their way to the Supreme Court in the fall of 2020, and by December, the Supreme Court had decided all of these cases, but only by orders, either disallowing federal court intervention to change an election rule that had been promulgated by a state legislature, allowing legislatively promulgated rules to be changed by state officials and state courts, or deadlocking 4-4, because Justice Barrett was not sworn in until after those cases were briefed and ready for decision by the Court. In none of these cases did the Supreme Court decide the all-important independent state legislature doctrine.\n\nThwarted by the Supreme Court’s indecision on that doctrine, Trump and the Republicans turned their efforts to the second stage of their plan, exploitation of the Electoral College and the Electoral Count Act.\n\nThe Electoral College is the process by which Americans choose their presidents, a process that can lead to the election as president of a candidate who does not receive a majority of votes cast by the American voters. Republicans have grown increasingly wary of the Electoral College with the new census and political demographics of the nation’s shifting population.\n\nThe Electoral Count Act empowers Congress to decide the presidency in a host of circumstances where Congress determines that state electoral votes were not “regularly given” by electors who were “lawfully certified,” terms that are undefined and ambiguous. In this second stage of the plan, the Republicans needed to generate state-certified alternative slates of electors from swing states where Biden won the popular vote who would cast their electoral votes for Trump instead. Congress would then count the votes of these alternative electoral slates on January 6, rather than the votes of the certified electoral slates for Biden, and Trump would be declared the reelected president.\n\nThe Republicans’ plan failed at this stage when they were unable to secure a single legitimate, alternative slate of electors from any state because the various state officials refused to officially certify these Trump-urged slates.\n\nThwarted by the Supreme Court in the first stage, foiled by their inability to come up with alternative state electoral slates in the second stage, and with time running out, Trump and the Republicans began executing the final option in their plan, which was to scare up illegitimate alternative electoral slates in various swing states to be transmitted to Congress. Whereupon, on January 6, Vice President Pence would count only the votes of the illegitimate electors from the swing states, and not the votes of the legitimate, certified electors that were cast for Biden, and declare Donald Trump’s reelection as President of the United States.\n\nThe entire house of cards collapsed at noon on January 6, when Pence refused to go along with the ill-conceived plan, correctly concluding that under the 12th Amendment he had no power to reject the votes that had been cast by the duly certified electors or to delay the count to give Republicans even more time to whip up alternative electoral slates.\n\nPence declared Joe Biden the 46th President of the United States at 3:40 a.m. on Thursday, January 7, roughly 14 hours after rioters stormed the US Capitol, disrupting the Joint Session and preventing Congress from counting the Electoral College votes for president until late that night and into the following day, after the statutorily designated day for counting those votes.\n\nTrump and his allies and supporters in Congress and the states began readying their failed 2020 plan to overturn the 2024 presidential election later that very same day and they have been unabashedly readying that plan ever since, in plain view to the American public. Today, they are already a long way toward recapturing the White House in 2024, whether Trump or another Republican candidate wins the election or not.\n\nTrump and Republicans are preparing to return to the Supreme Court, where this time they will likely win the independent state legislature doctrine, now that Amy Coney Barrett is on the Court and ready to vote. Barrett has not addressed the issue, but this turns on an originalist interpretation of the Constitution, and Barrett is firmly aligned on that method of constitutional interpretation with Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch, all three of whom have written that they believe the doctrine is correct.\n\nOnly last month, in a case from North Carolina the Court declined to hear, Moore v. Harper, four Justices (Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch and Kavanaugh) said that the independent state legislature question is of exceptional importance to our national elections, the issue will continue to recur and the Court should decide the issue sooner rather than later before the next presidential election. This case involved congressional redistricting, but the independent state legislature doctrine is as applicable to redistricting as it is to presidential elections.\n\nThe Republicans are also in the throes of electing Trump-endorsed candidates to state legislative offices in key swing states, installing into office their favored state election officials who deny that Biden won the 2020 election, such as secretaries of state, electing sympathetic state court judges onto the state benches and grooming their preferred potential electors for ultimate selection by the party, all so they will be positioned to generate and transmit alternative electoral slates to Congress, if need be.\n\nFinally, they are furiously politicking to elect Trump supporters to the Senate and House, so they can overturn the election in Congress, as a last resort.\n\nForewarned is to be forearmed.\n\nTrump and the Republicans can only be stopped from stealing the 2024 election at this point if the Supreme Court rejects the independent state legislature doctrine (thus allowing state court enforcement of state constitutional limitations on legislatively enacted election rules and elector appointments) and Congress amends the Electoral Count Act to constrain Congress’ own power to reject state electoral votes and decide the presidency.\n\nAlthough the Vice President will be a Democrat in 2024, both parties also need to enact federal legislation that expressly limits the vice president’s power to be coextensive with the power accorded the vice president in the 12th Amendment and confirm that it is largely ceremonial, as Pence construed it to be on January 6.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris would preside over the Joint Session in 2024. Neither Democrats nor Republicans have any idea who will be presiding after that, however. Thus, both parties have the incentive to clarify the vice president’s ceremonial role now.\n\nAs it stands today, Trump, or his anointed successor, and the Republicans are poised, in their word, to “steal” from Democrats the presidential election in 2024 that they falsely claim the Democrats stole from them in 2020. But there is a difference between the falsely claimed “stolen” election of 2020 and what would be the stolen election of 2024. Unlike the Democrats’ theft claimed by Republicans, the Republicans’ theft would be in open defiance of the popular vote and thus the will of the American people: poetic, though tragic, irony for America’s democracy.", "authors": ["J.

Trump and DeSantis have been in something of a cold war for months now.\n\n“If I faced him, I’d beat him like I would beat everyone else,” Trump told Yahoo Finance in October of last year of DeSantis. “I think most people would drop out, I think he would drop out.”\n\nLast month, Trump labeled it a “BIG MISTAKE” when DeSantis recorded a robocall for Colorado Republican Senate nominee Joe O’Dea. O’Dea had drawn Trump’s ire by saying in an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash that he would “actively” oppose the former president if he ran for the White House in 2024.\n\nDeSantis, for his part, has not paid the sort of obeisance to Trump that the former president is used to receiving from GOP politicians. DeSantis did not seek Trump’s endorsement for his 2022 reelection bid and, over the weekend, the two men held dueling rallies on the eve of the general election in Florida. (At his Florida rally on Sunday, Trump avoided criticizing DeSantis.)\n\nDeSantis looks, for all the world, like he is gearing up to use the momentum garnered from his expected win on Tuesday to launch a White House bid. He released a video last week that could easily have doubled as a presidential announcement and Politico noted that DeSantis raised $200 million for his reelection bid and had more than $90 million in the bank.\n\nSo, assuming DeSantis runs for president, how would Trump run against him?\n\nWell, the “DeSanctimonious” nickname actually hearkens back to how Trump sought to bring down Ted Cruz, his main rival for the 2016 Republican nomination.\n\nIn that race, Trump insisted that Cruz was sanctimonious – insisting that while the Texas senator portrayed himself as a honest broker and a man of God, he was actually something short of that.\n\n“I think he’s going to go down,” Trump said of Cruz in February 2016. “I think a guy can’t be – I’m a Christian – but you know Ted holds up the Bible and then he lies about so many things.”\n\nIt would seem, then, that Trump would rehash the playbook he used against Cruz in his potential fight against DeSantis. The idea is to undermine the notion of DeSantis as a principled conservative by portraying him instead as someone who talks down to average people and thinks he’s better than them.\n\nTrump, in this formulation, is the real man of the people, who would never dare think he is better than anyone. (That Trump has a super-sized ego and routinely casts himself as special seems to go unnoticed in this equation.)\n\nWhether and how DeSantis runs for president remains an entirely open question. But what’s clear is that Trump is already beginning to position himself against DeSantis – even before the 2022 election is over.", "authors": ["Chris Cillizza"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/15/politics/house-republicans-investigation-plans-trump/index.html", "title": "House Republicans plot investigative revenge on January 6 panel ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nHouse Republicans are plotting revenge on the select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, as the GOP weighs a broader effort to re-litigate some of Donald Trump’s biggest election grievances if it recaptures the House majority.\n\nThe former President has been itching for payback and leaning heavily on his Capitol Hill allies to defend him against a recent slew of damaging revelations about his role in the deadly attack on the US Capitol. Now, as Republicans search for ways to undermine those findings, their party has started to lay the groundwork to investigate the select committee itself.\n\nRepublicans have already asked the January 6 panel to preserve a broad range of documents in its possession – a signal they’re preparing to force those records to be turned over should they wield powerful committee gavels next year. And privately, Republican sources say there have been discussions about subpoenaing members of the select committee, particularly Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who is fighting an uphill battle for reelection, and retiring Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, if both Republicans are private citizens next year.\n\nIt’s an idea that has garnered support among allies of the former President. But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy – who has refused to comply with a subpoena from the select committee and has long held that the panel lacks the authority to haul in private citizens – is cool to the idea, according to a Republican source familiar with his thinking.\n\nOther investigative ideas under consideration among House Republicans include establishing their own select committee – or repurposing the current one – to investigate matters such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s role in Capitol security enforcement on January 6, 2021; the intelligence and security failures surrounding that day; and the treatment of the rioters who have been jailed for their role in the insurrection.\n\nMeanwhile, some of Trump’s fiercest acolytes have started to publicly push for hearings and probes into his baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election – even as the select committee reveals an avalanche of testimony about how those lies incited a violent mob to attack the Capitol.\n\n“I think that it is important to seek the truth – wherever it may lead – on all of this,” GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, told CNN. “We should be looking at whatever we can through the standing committees and have a robust debate about it.”\n\nThe GOP’s growing desire to craft a counternarrative on January 6 – and shift the blame away from Trump – comes as the former President is gearing up to soon announce another White House bid. Pursuing that effort could also be politically advantageous for McCarthy, whose expected bid for speaker would be made easier with support from Trump. The former President has sometimes criticized the California Republican over how he has handled the GOP’s defense of Trump during the select committee’s investigation.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois are two Republicans who might face subpoenas from members of their own party should the GOP win the House majority in the midterms. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nWhile McCarthy has vowed to conduct aggressive oversight and investigations, it’s unclear just how far he is willing to go when it comes to January 6 and the 2020 presidential election. And there could be some risks for turning the House into a venue for Trump’s vengeance campaign: Some Republicans have warned against rehashing old issues, arguing that the party would be better served by moving past 2020.\n\n“I get it. There are people that still want to kick that dead horse,” said Rep. Steve Womack of Arkansas, who quit the powerful GOP Steering Committee because he was outraged some of his colleagues weren’t reprimanded for their conduct on January 6. “But at the end of the day, I think the smartest political move for us is to concentrate our efforts on the policies that will absolutely make life better for all Americans.”\n\nKinzinger, meanwhile, said he wasn’t sweating the GOP subpoena threats and accused Republican leaders of being willing to destroy the Constitution to do Trump’s bidding.\n\n“It just shows (McCarthy) is trying to impress the Freedom Caucus,” Kinzinger told CNN. “It’s who he is.”\n\nOther GOP targets: Hunter Biden, Afghanistan withdrawal and the border\n\nMcCarthy began working to craft an oversight agenda earlier this year in anticipation of a House Republican majority. He has gathered input from key stakeholders, influential conservatives and — of course – Trump. The GOP leader and relevant committee heads have been actively pursuing document requests and preservation notices, and McCarthy will continue to seek input from across the House GOP Conference about which probes to pursue next year, according to the Republican source familiar with his thinking.\n\nAside from possible election-related inquiries, some of the GOP’s potential investigative targets include the origins of the novel coronavirus, particularly the laboratory leak theory that has gained steam in Republican circles; the bureaucratic decision-making behind Covid-related school closures and vaccine mandates; any business dealings involving President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter; the chaotic pullout from Afghanistan; and the border policies being overseen by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nBut there’s also been growing calls on the right for the GOP to use its firepower to rewrite the narrative on January 6.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, a Trump ally and major proponent of overturning the 2020 election who was subpoenaed by the select committee, sent a letter to the House Oversight Committee this week demanding hearings into the election conspiracy theories featured in the widely debunked movie “2000 Mules.”\n\n“Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Texas, all have issues. … They fall into categories that we call irregularities, abnormalities and inconsistencies,” said Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas, who signed the letter long with 10 other House Republicans. “We believe we’re due answers.”\n\nBut not everyone in the GOP believes they should use their power and platform to revisit the 2020 election. “We need to move on. I don’t support retribution politics,” one senior Republican told CNN. “This is not what the majority of Americans care about.”\n\nThere seems to be more of an appetite in the GOP for focusing on the security failures that enabled the Capitol to be breached on January 6.\n\nReps. Rodney Davis of Illinois and Jim Banks of Indiana have been leading a GOP investigation into the matter and are planning to unveil their findings in a report sometime this fall, according to sources familiar with the matter. That timeline that would coincide with – and, the GOP hopes, help counter-program — the select committee’s final report about the insurrection.\n\nBut Davis, who was poised to chair the House Administration Committee in a GOP-led chamber, recently lost his primary to a colleague backed by Trump.\n\nRep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, who is next in line to lead the Administration Committee, told CNN he is “definitely interested” in chairing the panel next year, though the decision is ultimately up to McCarthy. Loudermilk feels strongly that the committee, which has jurisdiction over Capitol security and election issues, should pick up the reins of Davis’ probe if Republicans control committee gavels next year.\n\n“Rodney’s doing yeoman’s work. But there’s a lot of info we aren’t privy to or able to get our hands on,” Loudermilk told CNN, citing his party’s lack of subpoena power in the minority.\n\nLoudermilk has his own grievances about the select committee, which publicly raised concerns about a tour he gave in the Capitol complex the day before the January 6 insurrection.\n\nOn the GOP’s requests for the select committee to preserve documents, Loudermilk said: “If they have not preserved or turned those over – especially those that are departing – then we would definitely have to look at (subpoenas).”\n\nThere’s also a debate inside the conference about whether to create a select committee to investigate these issues. But lawmakers familiar with McCarthy’s thinking believe his preference is to see any investigations housed within the committees that have relevant jurisdiction, although he may need to offer concessions to his right flank to secure the speaker’s gavel.\n\n“That’s a conference decision, it’ll be a Speaker Kevin McCarthy decision,” said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who is in line to chair the powerful House Judiciary Committee if the GOP wins the majority. When asked whether Trump was itching for investigations, he added: “He wants the truth out there for the American people, just like we all do.”\n\nMcCarthy was noncommittal when asked by CNN whether he wants to pursue investigations into January 6 security failures, potentially in the form of a select committee, if Republicans are in charge next year.\n\n“Let’s wait. Don’t prejudge our report,” McCarthy said. “Let’s see what our report is. … Then we’ll evaluate.”\n\nBut it’s not just 2020 that Trump’s allies are interested in revisiting. There’s also been talks of scrutinizing the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, GOP sources said.\n\nRepublicans on the House Intelligence Committee quietly met with former Trump national security official Kash Patel in a secured classified setting on Wednesday, raising eyebrows in the Capitol as GOP lawmakers weigh potential investigative targets for next year.\n\nPatel, who remains close with Trump and speaks to the former President regularly, was an aide to former House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, a onetime Republican congressman from California, and played a prominent role in pushing back against the investigation into the Trump campaign’s connections to Russia.\n\nPatel was “waived in” by GOP members of the Intelligence Committee, according to a source familiar with the matter, who said it was “very odd” for the minority party to hold such a meeting. Democrats on the committee were not notified that the meeting was taking place, according to the source, raising questions about its purpose.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump speaks beside GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach in June 2018. Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMcCarthy faces balancing act\n\nIf elected speaker, McCarthy will have to balance the investigative demands of his right flank with the preferences of his so-called governing wing.\n\nWhile McCarthy and Trump speak “weekly,” according to people familiar with their relationship, several Trump allies said the former President hasn’t felt the need to pressure the California Republican to consider wielding his potential investigative powers aggressively because McCarthy has already shown he wants to do so.\n\n“There is crossover with what Trump wants because, in general, he wants Kevin to be tougher, but a lot of this is being driven by McCarthy on his own,” said a person familiar with the former President’s thinking.\n\nStill, McCarthy continues to hold some cards close to his chest – not wanting to telegraph his moves and tip off potential witnesses.\n\nWhile that thirst for vengeance may dictate some of Republicans’ targets of inquiries, people close to McCarthy said it would not affect the investigative process or the conduct of committee members and their staff.\n\nThe House minority leader has also rejected some oversight targets floated to him by conservatives that he doesn’t believe have merit and would thus be a waste of time and taxpayer resources. ​\n\nInside Trump’s orbit, allies told CNN that McCarthy’s attitude toward aggressive oversight investigations changed earlier this year after Pelosi rejected his bid to install two staunch Trump allies – Banks and Jordan – on the House panel investigating the former President’s involvement in January 6. McCarthy was also enraged when the panel slapped him and several other GOP lawmakers with subpoenas.\n\n“Pelosi rejecting Jordan and Banks [from the House Select Committee investigating January 6] was a turning point for Kevin,” said a person familiar with his thinking.\n\n“He was like, ‘OK, if that’s how you want to play.’ I think you’re going to see him play a lot harder ball when he takes the majority than people realize,” this person continued.", "authors": ["Melanie Zanona Gaborr Zachary Cohen", "Melanie Zanona", "Zachary Cohen"], "publish_date": "2022/07/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/18/politics/house-republican-investigations-biden/index.html", "title": "Here are 5 big investigations House Republicans are planning to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nEarlier this week, CNN projected that Republicans will win the House majority. Shortly afterward, they made it very clear what their priority will be: Investigating President Biden and his administration on a variety of fronts.\n\n“In just 47 days, House Republicans will have the gavel, and we will be prepared to hold the Biden administration accountable from day one,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted Thursday. “Our investigations are just getting started.”\n\nSo, what, exactly are they panning to investigate? Well, a whole lot of things. Here’s a list of areas:\n\n1) The southern border. On Friday, Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas telling him and other department officials to be prepared to provide their testimony once the 118th Congress convenes in January. At a hearing earlier this week, Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee questioned Mayorkas on the number of migrants entering the US via the southern border. US border authorities encountered more than 2 million migrants in fiscal year 2022, an increase from the 1.7 million encounters in 2021. In announcing his 2024 presidential bid earlier this week, Donald Trump focused heavily on immigration. “Our southern border has been erased and our country is being invaded by millions and millions of unknown people, many of whom are entering for a very bad and sinister reason, and you know what that reason is,” said Trump. (He did not explain what he believed the reason to be.)\n\n2) The Afghanistan withdrawal. President Joe Biden’s decision to remove US troops from Afghanistan last year around the 20-year anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks turned into a disaster. The withdrawal led to a frantic attempt by many Afghans to flee the county, with devastating scenes of people clinging to the wings of planes as they tried to escape before the Taliban government officially assumed power. A bombing outside the Kabul airport in August 2021 killed 13 US service members and about 170 Afghans. CNN previously reported that Biden had made the decision to withdraw troops over the objection of many of his senior-most military advisers.\n\n3) The origin of the Covid-19 pandemic. Back in 2019, Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee launched their own investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus. At that time, they sent a letter to Frances Collins, who was the head of the National Institutes of Health, requesting “an independent, expert investigation of the origin of COVID-19,” which they insisted was “of paramount importance to public health and biosecurity.” Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce panel, has said that “how the pandemic started, that’s probably the most important public health question that needs to be answered.” Two studies released in July both concluded that a seafood market in Wuhan was most likely the epicenter for the virus.\n\n4) The Department of Justice. Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who is widely expected to chair the House Judiciary Committee when Republicans formally take over the majority in January 2023, sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland on November 2, requesting a slew of documents on everything from the Justice Department’s alleged “targeting” of Project Veritas to the search for classified documents at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. In a report released on November 4, Jordan insisted that “the Federal Bureau of Investigation, under the stewardship of Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland, is broken.”\n\n5) Hunter Biden. Kentucky Rep. James Comer, who is in line to chair the House Oversight Committee in January, said this week that “in the 118th Congress, this committee will evaluate the status of Joe Biden’s relationship with his family’s foreign partners and whether he is a President who is compromised or swayed by foreign dollars and influence.” At the center of that future investigation is the president’s son. As CNN noted earlier this week: “At the heart of Comer’s investigation is digging into a series of suspicious activity reports that Republicans claim banks have filed related to Hunter Biden’s financial activities.” Hunter Biden has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThis is far from a complete list of the investigations various Republican-led committees will embark on over the next two years.

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nAlong with Sauber, this spring the White House hired veteran Democratic communications aide Ian Sams as spokesman for the White House counsel’s office. Top Biden adviser Anita Dunn returned to the White House in the spring, in part to oversee the administration’s preparations for a GOP-controlled Congress.\n\nThe Justice Department is also bracing for investigations, bringing in well-known government transparency attorney Austin Evers to help respond to legislative oversight. Evers is the founder of the group American Oversight and served as its executive director until this year, and previously handled the oversight response at the State Department.\n\nStudying Jordan and Comer\n\nThe White House is preparing to hire additional lawyers and other staff to beef up its oversight response team in the next two months, before the new Congress convenes in January, administration officials said. The hires will bolster Sauber’s current team of about 10 lawyers, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\nIn piecing together GOP targets and strategy, the team has paid close attention to Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and James Comer of Kentucky, the two Republicans who are likely to lead much of the investigations under a GOP-controlled House and have spent months telegraphing their intentions in TV interviews and oversight letters.\n\nJim Jordan and James Comer. Getty Images\n\nTheir opening salvo came Thursday, when Comer and Jordan hosted a joint news conference to preview the various investigations into President Joe Biden’s family.\n\n“In the 118th Congress, this committee will evaluate the status of Joe Biden’s relationship with his family’s foreign partners and whether he is a president who is compromised or swayed by foreign dollars and influence” said Comer, the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee. “I want to be clear: This is an investigation of Joe Biden, and that’s where the committee will focus in this next Congress.”\n\nComer, flanked by Jordan and other Republicans on the Oversight Committee, said Republicans have made connections between the president’s son, Hunter Biden, and the president whom they believe requires further investigation.\n\nThe White House accused Comer of pursuing “long-debunked conspiracy theories.”\n\nEven though the Republican majority is poised to be much thinner than expected – with a likely margin of just a couple seats – all indications are that House Republicans are poised to push ahead with a wide-ranging set of investigations into all corners of the Biden administration, including the messy US withdrawal from Afghanistan, Covid-19 vaccine mandates and the Justice Department’s handling of the various investigations related to Donald Trump.\n\nRepublicans are also intent on investigating the president’s family, particularly his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nWith little chance of passing much legislation in a deadlocked Congress, investigations are shaping up to be the focal point of how a House Republican majority wields its power.\n\n“You’re gonna have a bunch of chairmen who are totally on their own, doing whatever the hell they want without regard for what the national political implications are,” said Brendan Buck, a former top adviser to House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said he believes GOP leader Kevin McCarthy will have “very little leash” to rein in those investigative pursuits.\n\nHouse Republicans have already sent over 500 letters to the administration requesting that they preserve documents, key committees have hired new legal counsels to help with investigations, and leadership has hosted classes for staffers on how to best use the oversight tools at their disposal.\n\nMeanwhile, McCarthy’s office has been working with likely committee chairs over the last several months to delegate who is going to be investigating what, according to a source familiar with the matter.\n\n“It’s like a clearing house,” the source said.\n\nBut the GOP’s push for aggressive investigations could run into resistance from the moderate wing of the GOP, who want to use their newfound majority to address key legislative priorities – not just pummel Hunter Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci. While McCarthy has vowed to conduct rigorous oversight, he will have to strike a delicate balance between the demands of the competing factions in his party.\n\nWhite House officials believe Republicans are bound to overstep and that their investigative overreach will backfire with the American public. In the meantime, they are prepared to push back forcefully, believing that many proposed investigations are based on conspiracy theories and politically motivated charges.\n\n“President Biden is not going to let these political attacks distract him from focusing on Americans’ priorities, and we hope congressional Republicans will join us in tackling them instead of wasting time and resources on political revenge,” Sams, the spokesman for the White House counsel’s office, said in a statement to CNN.\n\n‘We look forward to seeing you in January’\n\nThe House’s expected razor-thin majority is likely to make it more difficult to take steps like impeaching members of Biden’s Cabinet – or even the president himself. But that doesn’t mean, sources told CNN, they’re not going to try, particularly when it comes to the border and Mayorkas.\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas testifies before a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, on Capitol Hill on May 04, 2022. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday, the House Homeland Security Committee provided a preview of what is to come. Over the course of a marathon four-hour hearing, Republican lawmakers grilled Mayorkas over the influx of migrants at the southern border, the number of people who evade Border Patrol capture, and encounters with people on the border who are on the terror watch list.\n\nThroughout, Mayorkas stood his ground, maintaining that the border is “secure” and batting down criticism that it’s “open” as Republicans have claimed.\n\nAt one point, Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana foreshadowed more testimony next year, telling Mayorkas: “We look forward to seeing you in January.”\n\nMayorkas, officials said, remains undeterred by the threats of impeachment and intends to stay at the helm of the department, a point he reiterated Tuesday. Still, one person close to Mayorkas told CNN that the DHS chief is “nervous” about impending GOP investigations and the potential of being continually hauled before Congress by hostile Republican committee chairs.\n\n“Don’t let the bastards win,” one US official familiar with Mayorkas’ thinking said when asked to sum up the DHS chief’s attitude toward potential GOP investigations on border issues and impeachment.\n\n“We will respond to legitimate inquiries,” the official said. “We’re not going to feed into what might wind up as kabuki theater.”\n\nDHS already responds to hundreds of congressional inquiries per month, according to a Homeland Security official, who added the department has been preparing for months for any potential increase in congressional activity. The department is also ready to “aggressively respond to attempts to mischaracterize the strong record” of the DHS work force, as well as “politically motivated attempts to attack the secretary,” the official said.\n\nDHS officials considered hiring outside legal counsel to prepare for the potential onslaught of Republican scrutiny but ultimately chose not to, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Ricki Seidman, a senior counselor to Mayorkas and former senior Justice Department official, has been involved in DHS’s preparation for the GOP oversight, the source added.\n\nAnother Homeland Security official said that the Border Patrol along with Customs and Border Protection “are going to take the most heat.”\n\nThe Hunter Biden probes\n\nThe most politically charged investigations next year are poised to be those into the president’s son Hunter Biden.\n\nTop Republicans have largely been more than happy for Comer to take on the leading role of investigating Hunter Biden, multiple sources said. Jordan does not plan to be intimately involved in the Hunter Biden probe but will provide public support for Comer, including appearing with him at the upcoming press conference.\n\n“We’re going to lay out what we have thus far on Hunter Biden, and the crimes we believe he has committed,” Comer told CNN earlier this month just before the election. “And then we’re going to be very clear and say what we are investigating, and who we’re gonna ask to meet with us for transcribed interviews.”\n\nHunter Biden has denied wrongdoing in his business activities.\n\nHunter Biden, the son of President Joe Biden, attends a ceremony at the White House on Thursday, July 7, 2022. Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images\n\nBehind the scenes though, Jordan and other soon-to-be powerful Republican lawmakers – including likely chairman of House Intelligence Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio – have sought to distance their committees from the Hunter Biden investigation in favor of other investigative pursuits they deem to be “more serious,” the sources said.\n\nThe handling of Republican investigations related to Hunter Biden will fall to Hunter Biden’s own attorneys, while Bob Bauer, the president’s personal attorney, will handle related matters related to Joe Biden’s personal capacity that do not touch on his official duties. Bauer, who is married to Dunn, and White House attorneys have already met to divvy up workflow over potential lines of inquiries to ensure there are clear lanes of responsibility between investigations that touch on Joe Biden’s official role as president and vice president and his personal life.\n\n‘We know it’s coming’\n\nAnother key point of interest is likely to be the administration’s handling of the August 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, which led to the death of 13 Marines and nearly 200 Afghans when a bomb exploded at the Kabul airport.\n\nAt the State Department, a small group of officials has already begun planning for the coming investigations into Afghanistan, officials said. While that group will work with Sauber’s team at the White House, State Department officials expect to take the lead in handling GOP inquiries into Afghanistan.\n\nThe department has not hired new people to work on these efforts, but certain officials who are already at the department expect to spend a lot more of their time responding to the congressional inquiries, officials said.\n\nThe Republican investigation into the withdrawal is likely to be led by Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs committee. McCaul and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have historically had a good relationship, which State Department officials are hoping will be an important factor.\n\nUS soldiers stand guard behind barbed wire as Afghans sit on a roadside near the military part of the airport in Kabul on August 20, 2021 WAKIL KOHSAR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAdministration officials said they plan to take McCaul’s inquiry seriously because they expect he will demonstrate a seriousness of purpose, instead of making bombastic demands like some other Republicans. And House Republican aides said they plan to explore the administration’s willingness to work with them before issuing subpoenas.\n\n“If they’ll meet us in the middle by giving us some documents instead of all documents, or agreeing to turn over certain individuals but not all of the individuals for interviews, then that’s a start,” said one of the GOP aides familiar with the plans. “But if they just want to be completely obstructive and say no to every single request, then you’ll see subpoenas fairly soon.”\n\nThe department concluded its own review of the withdrawal in March, but the findings of that report have not been shared publicly, officials said. While it was expected to be put out earlier this year, State Department officials said the White House is making that determination, and they are unsure of where that decision stands. House Republicans want to see that report.\n\nAt the Pentagon, officials are bracing for the possibility of public grilling at televised hearings on everything from Afghanistan to views about “wokeness” in the force and the discharging of troops who refused to take the Covid-19 vaccine.\n\n“We know it’s coming,” one administration official said.\n\nBoth Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, whose term expires at the end of September 2023, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who appears determined to stay until the end of the Biden administration, have faced sharp criticism from congressional Republicans and know the coming months may be a rough political ride, officials said.\n\nMilley has been a particular target for Republicans for his well-known efforts to keep the final weeks of the Trump presidency from careening into a national security crisis.\n\nBoth Milley and Austin have pushed back forcefully on GOP accusations that the military is “woke,” a topic that’s likely to become a focal point for some Republicans in the coming months.\n\n‘Feed the base red meat’\n\n“This is going to be a Congress under Republican control like no other,” said Rafi Prober, a congressional investigations specialist with the law firm Akin Gump who previously worked in the Obama administration.\n\nAaron Cutler, the head of the Washington government investigations group at law firm Hogan Lovells and a former Republican congressional leadership staffer, said the partisan investigations serve to “feed the base red meat.”\n\nBut Cutler said he has heard from conservatives that the tepid result for Republicans in the midterm elections may translate to less “silliness in politics,” he said. “The American people are pushing back, and saying we want government to work.”\n\nThat is exactly the calculation the White House and congressional Democrats are making. A senior House Democratic source said that aggressive attacks on Biden’s son could backfire, adding that congressional Democrats were gearing up to defend the president by calling out “lies and hypocrisy.”\n\nStill, with the GOP investigations in mind, a team of White House lawyers has in recent weeks and months advised senior White House staff on how “not to be seen as influencing politically sensitive missions at (departments and agencies),” a source familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nAsked at his press conference last week about the prospect of GOP investigations, including into his son, Biden said: “I think the American people will look at all of that for what it is. It’s just almost comedy. … Look, I can’t control what they’re going to do.”\n\nThis story has been updated with comments from Rep.

Vance in the heated Ohio Senate Republican primary, he began asking allies which contest he should disrupt next.\n\nVance, once a fervent critic of Trump during the 2016 presidential race, had cemented his status as the poster boy of MAGA conversions when he earned Trump’s coveted endorsement on Good Friday, and the former President was “very pleased” with his decision to back the conservative author after many months of closely watching the Ohio race, according to a person close to Trump.\n\n“Because he pulled the trigger in (Ohio), I think you’re going to see him do the same in other messy primaries that were once off the table,” this person said.\n\nHow soon Trump delivers his next big endorsement could shed light on his mindset as May approaches and offers the first real test of his political clout with a series of high-profile primaries. As he looks to use the midterm map to validate his status as the de facto leader of the Republican Party ahead of 2024, every move he makes and candidate he supports puts that goal at risk, particularly his endorsements in highly competitive contests.\n\nNevertheless, by Monday evening, Trump had apparently settled on the contentious Senate GOP primary in Arizona as his next target.\n\n“I will be making an Endorsement in the not too distant future!” he wrote at the end of a statement criticizing state Attorney General Mark Brnovich for his failure to prosecute so-called “election crimes,” dashing any hope for Trump’s support that the Senate candidate might have had.\n\nThe odds of Trump entering next year with a clean record of winners also diminishes with every high-risk move he makes, hence the advice he’s received from some in his circle to hit the pause button on an endorsement in Arizona.\n\nOne Trump aide, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations, said the former President is currently feeling bullish and has talked about throwing his weight behind a candidate in the Grand Canyon State before the end of this month, long before the August 2 primary. But others in Trump’s orbit have recently counseled him to wait to see how the next month plays out, arguing that the odds of Trump entering next year with a clean record of winners diminishes with every high-risk move he makes.\n\nThese advisers openly admit that Trump is gearing up for a third presidential bid in 2024 and have told him that the best way to improve his positioning out of the gate is to enter this fall with a clear track record of picking winners.\n\n“”You don’t want to ride the golden escalator again, you want to be surrounded by all the new Republicans that you elected,’” one adviser claimed he told Trump.\n\nBut the odds of Trump finishing the 2022 midterm cycle with an unblemished track record of endorsements looks increasingly unlikely as some of his candidates have stumbled on the campaign trail, others have failed to outraise their incumbent opponents and a few remain in competitive primaries. The odds of Trump entering next year with a clean record of winners also diminishes with every high-risk move he makes, hence the advice he’s received from some in his circle to hit the pause button on an endorsement in Arizona.\n\nThree Senate candidates whom Trump has endorsed – Vance in Ohio, Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Rep. Ted Budd in North Carolina – remain locked in tight primaries and are fighting for survival in their final weeks.\n\nThe same can be said of former Georgia Sen. David Perdue in his gubernatorial bid, which could deliver a stinging loss for Trump on May 24 if incumbent GOP Gov. Brian Kemp’s lead in recent polling lead translates at the ballot box. In an effort to prevent that scenario, Trump recently funneled $500,000 from his Save America PAC to Get Georgia Right PAC, a group that is working to defeat Kemp in the primary, according to a person familiar with the donation.\n\nStill, other Trump-backed candidates on the ballot next month who are more likely to deliver good news to the former President include former NFL star-turned-Georgia senate candidate Herschel Walker and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is heavily favored to win his runoff contest against Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush.\n\n“Whether or how he will play in the rest of the calendar year will depend a lot on what happens in places like Pennsylvania and Ohio,” said longtime GOP strategist Rob Stutzman.\n\n“I don’t think he’s going to have a clean narrative that he single handedly drove the congressional Republican majorities that will get elected in 2022 but he could have some success if his endorsement can propel come-from-behind candidates.”\n\n‘You could see him retreat’\n\nTrump’s rush to prove his sway over the GOP has left him in a vulnerable spot if the gubernatorial and down-ballot races he is counting on to drive momentum next month fail to deliver his desired results.\n\nWhile one or two losses could be chalked up to fundraising difficulties or personality issues, one former Trump campaign official said the former President will be forced to recalibrate the midterm strategy he’s developed from his Palm Beach perch if voters reject multiple candidates who are competing with his stamp of approval. Alternatively, this person said, the major risks that Trump has taken – both in recruiting insurgent candidates to challenge Republican incumbents and diving into crowded primaries – could deliver major rewards if the bulk of those contestants prevail.\n\nThe earliest barometer of Trump’s influence will happen May 3 in Ohio, when voters in the Republican primary will decide whether to send Vance to the general election contest, where he is likely to face Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan. Should one of the other Trump-aligned candidates vanquish Vance, aides expect Trump to become more reserved in choosing which remaining primaries to wade into. He has not yet endorsed in gubernatorial primaries happening between June and August in Nevada, Wisconsin or Michigan, nor has he endorsed a Senate candidate in Arizona, Missouri or Alabama, where he yanked his support from Rep. Mo Brooks in March while promising to re-endorse before the May 24 primary.\n\n“You could see him retreat a bit if things don’t go well next month,” said one Trump adviser, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\n“For instance, I wouldn’t expect him to go endorsing (Blake) Masters if Vance loses in Ohio,” the adviser added, referencing the Arizona Senate candidate who, like Vance, has been bankrolled by conservative tech billionaire and Trump confidant Peter Thiel in his primary.\n\nThe person close to Trump described the next 30 days as “pivotal” to the former President’s future inside the GOP, especially if he decides to run again in 2024. Some Trump aides have privately joked that a successful run in May will finally give him something to talk about besides the 2020 election, this person said.\n\nSetting expectations in advance\n\nPublicly, Trump has appeared confident about his candidate choices so far. In his endorsement of Vance, he repeatedly cast the “Hillbilly Elegy” author as the only Republican capable of taking down Ryan in the general election.\n\n“I’ve studied this race closely and I think J.D. is the most likely to take out the weak, but dangerous, Democrat opponent – dangerous because they will have so much money to spend,” Trump said in a statement last Friday.\n\nBut behind the scenes and occasionally in public, he has already begun lowering expectations.\n\nThe former President, who was persuaded to endorse Vance by a slew of longtime allies – including Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk – has acknowledged to some in his circle that he is worried about Ryan, not because of the massive war chest he is likely to have at his disposal but because the Ohio congressman has made a point of reaching rural and white working-class voters whom Democrats have overlooked in past cycles. One recent campaign ad from Ryan also blamed America’s current economic woes on China, echoing Trump’s posture toward Beijing.\n\nNowhere, though, has Trump engaged more blatantly in expectation-setting than in the race for governor in Georgia.\n\nLess than a month before his PAC contributed half a million dollars to help defeat Kemp, who drew Trump’s ire in the wake of the 2020 election for refusing to indulge his voter fraud conspiracies, the former President told a right-wing news outlet that he endorses “a lot of people that are long shots” in response to a question about Perdue. Instead of stopping there, he went so far as to suggest that he could lose the Georgia gubernatorial primary – marking a rare acknowledgement of weakness by Trump.\n\n“Hopefully David Perdue is going to win. These are not sure things. If I lose one along the way, which you have to, right, they’re going to say, ‘This is a humiliating experience.’ I could be 100 wins and one loss, and they’d make it sound like this is humiliating,” Trump said in the March 29 interview with Real America’s Voice.\n\nShould the May primaries tarnish his endorsement record, some Republicans expect Trump to waste no time blaming everyone but himself for the unfavorable outcome. After all, when the former President announced his plan last month to withdraw his endorsement from Brooks in Alabama, he claimed the congressman had made himself unwinnable by refusing to spend the bulk of his campaign talking about the 2020 election.\n\n“Mo, you just blew the election,” Trump said he thought to himself after Brooks told a crowd in Culman, Alabama, last August to move on from 2020.\n\nThat’s the kind of reaction Perdue can expect if he loses his May 24 primary to Kemp, said Stutzman.\n\n“His (modus operandi) is to turn on all of these people. Look at Mo Brooks. He’ll blame others and none of it will be his fault,” Stutzman said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/28/politics/pete-buttigieg-future-presidential-run-chris-wallace-cnntv/index.html", "title": "Pete Buttigieg remains coy about WH aspirations as talk swirls of ...", "text": "Watch “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace?” on CNN TV Sundays at 7pm ET. New episodes with full-length interviews are available on HBO Max each Friday.\n\nWashington CNN —\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is declining to rule out a future presidential bid, offering only that he doesn’t “know what’s going to happen in the future” when asked about a potential White House run.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview on CNN’s “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace” that will air at 7 p.m. ET on Sunday, Buttigieg said he was “not ruling out” another White House campaign but maintained that he felt fulfilled in his current role.\n\n“I’m 40. I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future. I do know that. I’ve been entrusted with this amazing opportunity and responsibility to help shape the infrastructure we’re going to be living with and working with and counting on for the rest of our lives,” he said.\n\nButtigieg is widely expected to run to succeed President Joe Biden – whether an open race emerges in 2024 or 2028 – and he’s become the most requested surrogate on the campaign trail for Democratic candidates in the midterms, people familiar with the requests tell CNN.\n\nThe question of Biden’s political future will be front-and-center for Democrats after November’s midterm elections, in which the party is fighting to keep control of Congress. Already, the President’s responses to whether he will mount another bid for the White House have injected questions into the developing 2024 race.\n\nAt 79, Biden is already the oldest president in American history, and, as CNN previously reported, his public schedule has previously led to questions about how extensive a campaign he’d engage in if he runs.\n\n“The decision is very much above my pay grade,” Buttigieg said of another Biden White House bid. “There’s one person who gets to make that decision. But what I will say is that this President, this administration, have been repeatedly underestimated and have repeatedly delivered.”\n\nButtigieg had mounted a stout presidential campaign in 2019 and 2020, despite starting with very little national recognition or political experience. The former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, narrowly won the Iowa caucuses, becoming the first gay presidential candidate in American history to win primary delegates from a major party.\n\nHe ended his campaign shortly before Super Tuesday in March 2020, after his path to victory had clearly closed following a poor showing in South Carolina.\n\nReflecting on his decision to launch that campaign, Buttigieg explained, “I wanted to be president enough to run for president, although I didn’t ever run because it was a thing I wanted to have. I ran because there was a moment where I thought what I had to offer matched what the moment called for.”\n\n“And that’s how I think about running for office. I’ve used that process to run for office before. And I’ve used that process that decision process to decide not to run for office before. And I know it sounds like the right thing to say politically, it is the right thing to say politically is also true, that I don’t know what the future looks like, or whether those stars will ever align in the future,” he continued.\n\n“What I do know is I already have a job, and it’s a great job.”", "authors": ["Paul Leblanc"], "publish_date": "2022/10/28"}]}

But even as babies struggling to breathe fill hospital beds across the United States, there may be a light ahead: After decades of disappointment, four new RSV vaccines may be nearing review by the US Food and Drug Administration, and more than a dozen others are in testing.\n\nThere’s also hope around a promising long-acting injection designed to be given right after birth to protect infants from the virus for as long as six months. In a recent clinical trial, the antibody shot was 75% effective at heading off RSV infections that required medical attention.\n\nExperts say the therapies look so promising, they could end bad RSV seasons as we know them.\n\nAnd the relief could come soon: Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Task Force, told CNN that he’s “hopeful” there will be an RSV vaccine by next fall.\n\nCharlotte Brown jumped at the chance to enroll her own son, a squawky, active 10-month-old named James, in one of the vaccine trials this summer.\n\n“As soon as he qualified, we were like ‘absolutely, we are in,’ ” Brown said.\n\nBabies have to be at least 6 months old to enter the trial, which is testing a vaccine developed at the National Institutes of Health – the result of decades of scientific research.\n\nBrown is a pediatrician who cares for hospitalized children at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, and she sees the ravages of RSV firsthand. A recent patient was in the back of her mind when she was signing up James for the study.\n\n“I took care of a baby who was only a few months older than him and had had nine days of fever and was just absolutely pitiful and puny,” she said. Brown said his family felt helpless. “And I was like, ‘this is why we’re doing it. This single patient is why we’re doing this.’ “\n\nEven before this year’s surge, RSV was the leading cause of infant hospitalizations in the US. The virus infects the lower lungs, where it causes a hacking cough and may lead to severe complications like pneumonia and inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs called bronchiolitis.\n\nWorldwide, RSV causes about 33 million infections in children under the age of 5 and hospitalizes 3.6 million annually. Nearly a quarter-million young children die each year from complications of their infections.\n\nRSV also preys on seniors, leading to an estimated 159,000 hospitalizations and about 10,000 deaths a year in adults 65 and over, a burden roughly on par with influenza.\n\nDespite this heavy toll, doctors haven’t had any new tools to head off RSV for more than two decades. The last therapy approved was in 1998. The monoclonal antibody, Synagis, is given monthly during RSV season to protect preemies and other high-risk babies.\n\nLessons learned after grave setback\n\nThe hunt for an effective way to protect against RSV stalled for decades after two children died in a disastrous vaccine trial in the 1960s.\n\nThat study tested a vaccine made with an RSV virus that had been chemically treated to render it inert and mixed with an ingredient called alum, to wake up the immune system and help it respond.\n\nIt was tested at clinical trial sites in the US between 1966 and 1968.\n\nAt first, everything looked good. The vaccine was tested in animals, who tolerated it well, and then given to children, who also appeared to respond well.\n\n“Unfortunately, that fall, when RSV season started, many of the children that were vaccinated required hospitalization and got more severe RSV disease than what would have normally occurred,” said Steven Varga, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, who has been studying RSV for more than 20 years and is developing a nanoparticle vaccine against the virus.\n\nA study published on the trial found that 80% of the vaccinated children who caught RSV later required hospitalization, compared with only 5% of the children who got a placebo. Two of the babies who had participated in the trial died.\n\nThe outcomes of the trial were a seismic shock to vaccine science. Efforts to develop new vaccines and treatments against RSV halted as researchers tried to untangle what went so wrong.\n\n“The original vaccine studies were so devastatingly bad. They didn’t understand immunology well in those days, so everybody said ‘oh no, this ain’t gonna work.’ And it really was like it stopped things cold for 30, 40 years,” said Dr. Aaron Glatt, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai South Nassau in New York.\n\nRegulators re-evaluated the guardrails around clinical trials, putting new safety measures into place.\n\n“It is in fact, in many ways, why we have some of the things that we have in place today to monitor vaccine safety,” Varga said.\n\nResearchers at the clinical trial sites didn’t communicate with each other, Varga said, and so the US Food and Drug Administration put the publicly accessible Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System into place. Now, when an adverse event is reported at one clinical trial site, other sites are notified.\n\nAnother problem turned out to be how the vaccine was made.\n\nProteins are three-dimensional structures. They are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids that fold into complex shapes, and their shapes determine how they work.\n\nIn the failed RSV vaccine trial, the chemical the researchers used to deactivate the virus denatured its proteins – essentially flattening them.\n\n“Now you have a long sheet of acids but no more beautiful shapes,” said Ulla Buchholz, chief of the RNA Viruses Section at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n“Everything that the immune system needs to form neutralizing antibodies that can block and block attachment and entry of this virus to the cell had been destroyed in that vaccine,” said Buchholz, who designed the RSV vaccine for toddlers that’s being tested at Vanderbilt and other US sites.\n\nIn the 1960s trial, the kids still made antibodies to the flattened viral proteins, but they were distorted. When the actual virus came along, these antibodies didn’t work as intended. Not only did they fail to recognize or block the virus, they triggered a powerful misdirected immune response that made the children much sicker, a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement of disease.\n\nThe investigators hadn’t spotted the enhancement in animal studies, Varga says, because the vaccinated animals weren’t later challenged with the live virus.\n\n“So of course, we require now extensive animal testing of new vaccines before they’re ever put into humans, again, for that very reason of making sure that there aren’t early signs that a vaccine will be problematic,” Varga said.\n\nA breakthrough reinvigorates the field\n\nAbout 10 years ago, a team of researchers at the NIH – some of the same investigators who developed the first Covid-19 vaccines – reported what would turn out to be a pivotal advance.\n\nThey had isolated the structure of the virus’s F-protein, the site that lets it dock onto human cells. Normally, the F-protein flips back and forth, changing shapes after it attaches to a cell. The NIH researchers figured out to how freeze the F-protein into the shape it takes before it fuses with a cell.\n\nThis protein, when locked into place, allows the immune system to recognize the virus in the form it’s in when it first enters the body – and develop strong antibodies against it.\n\n“The companies coming forward now, for the most part, are taking advantage of that discovery,” said Dr. Phil Dormitzer, a senior vice president of vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline. “And now we have this new generation of vaccine candidates that perform far better than the old generation.”\n\nThe first vaccines up for FDA review will be given to adults: seniors and pregnant woman. Vaccination in pregnancy is meant to ultimately protect newborns – a group particularly vulnerable to the virus – via antibodies that cross the placenta.\n\nVaccines for children are a bit farther behind in development but moving through the pipeline, too.\n\nFour companies have RSV vaccines for adults in the final phases of human trials: Pfizer and GSK are testing vaccines for pregnant women as well as seniors. Janssen and Bavarian Nordic are developing shots for seniors.\n\nPfizer and GSK use protein subunit vaccines, a more traditional kind of vaccine technology. Two other companies build on innovations made during the pandemic: Janssen – the vaccine division of Johnson & Johnson – relies on an adenoviral vector, the same kind of system that’s used in its Covid-19 vaccine, and Moderna has a vaccine for RSV in Phase 2 trials that uses mRNA technology.\n\nSo far, early results shared by some companies are promising. Janssen, Pfizer and GSK each appear effective at preventing infections in adults for the first RSV season after the vaccine.\n\nIn an August news release, Annaliesa Anderson, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer of Vaccine Research and Development, said she was “delighted” with the results. The company plans to submit its data to the FDA for approval this fall.\n\nGSK has also wrapped up its Phase 3 trial for seniors. It recently presented the results at a medical conference, but full data hasn’t been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. Early results show that this vaccine is 83% effective at preventing disease in the lower lungs of adults 60 and older. It appears to be even more protective – 94% – for severe RSV disease in those over 70 and those with underlying medical conditions.\n\n“We are very pleased with these results,” Dormitzer told CNN. He said the company was moving “with all due haste” to get its results to the FDA for review.\n\n“We’re confident enough that we’ve started manufacturing the actual commercial launch materials. So we have the bulk vaccine actually in the refrigerator, ready to supply when we are licensed,” he said.\n\nEven as the company applies for licensure, GSK’s trial will continue for two more RSV seasons. Half the group getting the vaccine will be followed with no additional shots, while the other group will get annual boosters. The aim is to see which approach is most protective to guide future vaccination strategies.\n\nJanssen’s vaccine for older adults appears to be about 70% to 80% effective in clinical trials so far, the company announced in December.\n\nIn a study on Pfizer’s vaccine for pregnant women published in the New England Journal of Medicine this year, the company reported that the mothers enrolled in the study made antibodies to the vaccine and that these antibodies crossed the placenta and were detected in umbilical cord blood just after birth.\n\nThe vaccines for pregnant women are meant to get newborns through their first RSV season. But not all newborns will benefit from those. Most maternal antibodies are passed to baby in the third trimester, so preemies may not be protected, even if mom gets the vaccine.\n\nFor vulnerable infants and those whose mothers decline to be vaccinated, Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington, says the long-acting antibody shot for newborns, called nirsevimab, should cover them for the first six months of life. She expects it to be a “game-changer.”\n\nThat shot, which has been developed by AstraZeneca, was recently recommended for approval in the European Union. It has not yet been approved in the United States.\n\nHope on the horizon\n\nThe field is so close to a new approval that public health officials say they’ve been asked to study up on the data.\n\nChu, who is also a member of an RSV study group of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel that advises the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its vaccine recommendations, says her group has started to evaluate the new vaccines – a sign that an FDA review is just around the corner.\n\nNo companies have yet announced that process is underway. FDA reviews can take several months, and then there are typically discussions and votes by FDA and CDC advisory groups before vaccines are made available.\n\n“We’ve been working on this for several months now to start reviewing the data,” Chu said. “So I think this is imminent.”\n\nWatching this year’s RSV season unfold, Brown, the pediatrician who enrolled her son in the vaccine trial for toddlers, says progress can’t come fast enough.\n\n“The hospital is surging. We’re not drowning the way some states are. I mean, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina, they’re really drowning. But our numbers are huge, and our services are so busy,” she says.\n\nBrown says her son is mostly healthy. He doesn’t have any of the risks for severe RSV she sees with some of her patients, so she was happy to have a way to help others.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnd while it’s far too early to say whether the vaccine James is helping to test will prove to be effective, the trial was unblinded last week, and Brown learned that her son was in the group that got the active vaccine, not the placebo\n\nHe has done well through this heavy season of illness, she says. The NIH-sponsored study they participated in is scheduled to be completed next year.\n\nThe vaccine, which is made with a live but very weak version of virus, is given through a couple of squirts up the nose, so there are no needles. The hardest part for squirmy James, she said, was being held still.\n\n“If we can do anything to move science forward and help another child, like, sorry, James.

Pfizer’s vaccine candidate is administered to pregnant women who then make antibodies that cross the placenta and protect the baby after birth.\n\n“The [study data monitoring committee] recommended, based on the data that we have, that we should go ahead and file, that this offers the potential for a safe and effective vaccine that could really dramatically help to prevent RSV during the winter season,” Dr. William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, told CNN.\n\nIn the trial, the vaccine was given to pregnant people and appeared to be about 80% effective at preventing severe RSV disease in their infants in the first three months of life. It also cut a baby’s risk of needing to see a doctor for an RSV infection by half.\n\nPotential for first new product in decades\n\nIf approved, Pfizer’s inoculation will be the first against RSV and the first new product related to the infection in over two decades.\n\nIn March, the FDA designated Pfizer’s RSV vaccine a breakthrough therapy, a status that speeds its review.\n\n“That puts us in a very good position to essentially have something well in advance of next winter,” Gruber said, noting that both Pfizer and the FDA are conscious of the ongoing heavy RSV season in the US.\n\n“It will be up to them whether or not they can think of any other path that could allow this to come sooner,” he said.\n\nPfizer’s vaccine contains the virus’ F-protein, the site that it uses to attach to human cells. The protein is frozen into the shape it folds into before it fuses with a cell, so the immune system can build antibodies against it. Pfizer’s RSV vaccine is bivalent, containing F-proteins from both the A and B subgroups of the RSV virus, which are the two most commonly circulating strains.\n\nIn a study of 7,400 pregnant people and infants, the vaccine was 82% effective at preventing severe lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized babies for the first three months of life. It was about 70% effective at preventing severe RSV in hospitalized infants for six months.\n\nBabies were considered to have severe RSV if they were breathing very rapidly, over 70 breaths per minute in a 2-month-old; if their blood oxygen levels fell below 93%; if they required high-flow oxygen, or if they were admitted to the ICU; or if they lost consciousness.\n\nThe vaccine cut the need for infants to need to see a doctor because of RSV by an average of more than 50% compared with a placebo. That result did not fall within a statistical range that was specified by the FDA before the outset of the trial, however, so the company acknowledges that the vaccine missed that particular goalpost.\n\nGruber points out, however, that a 50% reduction in doctor visits due to RSV is still likely to be a noticeable and important benefit in the real world.\n\n“This is clearly sufficient and frankly, great news, for filing for our approval,” he said.\n\nPfizer also recently announced positive results in an ongoing trial of the same vaccine in older adults.\n\nLonger-term research\n\nThe drugmaker’s FDA filing would make it the first in a crowded field of companies developing vaccines against RSV. GSK had been testing a maternal vaccine but paused its study after learning of a safety problem.\n\nGSK said Monday that the trial remains stopped, though it did not share any details on the safety issue.\n\n“Further analysis to better understand safety data from these trials is ongoing,” spokesperson Alison Hunt said in a statement to CNN. “The relevant regulatory authorities and trial investigators have been informed. We’re committed to transparently sharing more data as we have it.”\n\nNo safety issues have been identified with Pfizer’s vaccine, Gruber said, and a panel of independent reviewers that looks over the study findings while the trial is progressing found no problems.\n\n“The vaccine is very tolerable, and no safety signals were identified,” he said, though the full results of the trial have not been published.\n\nAlthough Pfizer will suspend enrollment in the maternal vaccination trial, Gruber says it will continue to follow the infants who are enrolled.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“We know that children that have RSV end up having compromised lung status, and they become more susceptible, in many instances, to other respiratory infections that puts them back in the hospital.

Nonetheless, it is time to accept that the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is the new normal. It will likely circulate globally for the foreseeable future, taking its place alongside other common respiratory viruses such as influenza. And it likely will require similar annual consideration for vaccine composition updates,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research; Principal Deputy Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock; and new FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf wrote in a paper published in the medical journal JAMA on Monday.\n\n“During the 2022-2023 COVID-19 vaccine planning and selection process, it is important to recognize that the fall season will present a major opportunity to improve COVID-19 vaccination coverage with the goal of minimizing future societal disruption and saving lives,” they wrote. “With the plan for implementation of this year’s vaccine selection process, society is moving toward a new normal that may well include annual COVID-19 vaccination alongside seasonal influenza vaccination.”\n\nJune could be when FDA officials make a decision on the composition of Covid-19 vaccines for the fall and winter seasons – and what the vaccination plans might be.\n\nBy this summer, “decisions will need to be made” on who should be eligible for additional Covid-19 shots in the fall, and by June, the composition of the vaccines will need to be determined, Marks, Woodcock and Califf wrote.\n\nLast week, the FDA announced plans to convene its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on June 28 to discuss whether the composition of current Covid-19 vaccines should be modified, and if so, what updates should be selected for the fall.\n\n“In terms of practical considerations, at the recent meeting of the VRBPAC, there was relatively uniform agreement that a single vaccine composition used by all manufacturers was desirable and that data would be needed to inform and drive the selection of a monovalent, bivalent, or multivalent COVID-19 vaccine,” Marks, Woodcock and Califf wrote. “There was also general agreement that, should a new vaccine composition be recommended based on the totality of the available clinical and epidemiologic evidence, optimally it could be used for both primary vaccination as well as booster administration.”\n\nVRBPAC members met in April to discuss how the composition of Covid-19 vaccines could change to target any new and emerging coronavirus variants. The committee agreed that there needs to be a framework for how and when such changes take place. The advisers plan to continue their conversation in the coming months.\n\n“By summer, decisions will need to be made for the 2022-2023 season about who should be eligible for vaccination with additional boosters and regarding vaccine composition. Administering additional COVID-19 vaccine doses to appropriate individuals this fall around the time of the usual influenza vaccine campaign has the potential to protect susceptible individuals against hospitalization and death, and therefore will be a topic for FDA consideration,” Marks, Woodcock and Califf wrote.\n\nCertain immunocompromised people and adults 50 and older are eligible for additional booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine in the United States. The FDA officials added that for those who have yet to get vaccinated or boosted, getting a vaccine dose now will not have adverse effects that preempt getting an additional dose in the fall.\n\nThe composition of the current vaccines could be updated to target circulating coronavirus variants. Marks, Woodcock and Califf wrote that this coming fall and winter, three factors may come together to place the nation at additional risk of Covid-19: waning immunity, seasonal waves of more coronavirus spread, and the further evolution of the coronavirus, leading to new variants.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“The timeframe to determine the composition of the COVID-19 vaccine for the 2022-2023 season, to use alongside the seasonal influenza vaccine for administration in the Northern Hemisphere beginning in about October, is compressed because of the time required for manufacturing the necessary doses,” the officials wrote. “A decision on composition will need to be made in the US by June 2022.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/05/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/health/rsv-treatment-all-infants/index.html", "title": "Treatment approved in Europe to prevent RSV in infants could be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA preventive treatment for lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV got the go ahead from the European Commission on Friday, according to one of the companies that make it.\n\nThe treatment is the first of its kind to protect all infants in their first year of life.\n\nA spokesperson from drugmaker Sanofi says that they’ve also submitted their research to the US Food and Drug Administration for approval. The company said it hopes the treatment will be available in the United States for the 2023 - 2024 RSV season.\n\nThis year, RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, has overwhelmed pediatric hospitals all around the US. Nearly every child gets RSV prior to the age of 2, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While it can often be a milder respiratory infection for many children and most adults, studies show it is still a leading cause of hospitalization in all infants.\n\nGlobally, in 2019 alone, there were 33 million cases and more than 3.6 million hospitalizations. It’s estimated there were 26,300 in-hospital RSV deaths of children younger than age five and 101,400 deaths overall, according to a 2022 study published in the Lancet.\n\nThe new monoclonal antibody treatment is a joint project with AstraZeneca and Sanofi. It will be sold under the brand name Beyfortus (nirsevimab). Sanofi said it has been working in collaboration with AstraZeneca on the project for about five years.\n\nThe treatment is given to infants in a single dose shot at the time of birth or just before the start of the RSV season. And unlike with a vaccine where the body builds up its immunity in reaction to a vaccine over time, a monoclonal antibody works right away. The most common side effects are rash, injection site reactions and fever.\n\nIf approved in the US, Beyfortus would be the only single-dose RSV protective option for the general infant population. Sanofi said that broad protection is important, since 80% of infants that are hospitalized for RSV have no comorbidities.\n\nBeyfortus can also be used for a second RSV season in children that remain highly vulnerable to RSV infection, typically meaning children with underlying medical conditions.\n\nThere is another monoclonal antibody treatment approved in the US and Europe called palivizumab, or Synagis, that protects against infection in high-risk infants. With that treatment, infants get an intramuscular injection every month during RSV season and it usually requires 5 doses. The treatment was approved in 1998.\n\nApproval for Beyfortus from the European Commission was based on trial data that showed the treatment reduced the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV that needed medical attention by 70.1% compared to placebo in a Phase 2b trial, according to a news release from Sanofi. In a later stage Phase 3 trial conducted in 21 different countries, Beyfortus reduced the incidence of RSV-related bronchiolitis, inflammation of the tiny airways in the lungs, or pneumonia that needed medical attention by 74.5% compared to placebo.\n\n“The totality of the data that we have generated across population indicates that protection is around 80% in the all-infant population,” said Jon Heinrichs, the global project head at Sanofi Vaccines Research & Development. “We believe it will make a huge difference on RSV.”\n\nRSV has also placed a big burden on doctors office and hospitals even outside of a bad RSV season like the one the US is seeing right now.\n\n“Imagine a situation where 80% of that disease could be prevented,” Heinrichs added.\n\nFor vulnerable infants and those whose mothers decline to be vaccinated, Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Washington, says Beyfortus could be a “game-changer.”\n\nThe other advantage with a treatment like this is that if an RSV season were to start early like it did this year, with RSV hospitalizations shooting up to levels typically seen in December, it can deliver protection just in time for any infant.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBeyfortus would also protect the child directly. A vaccine given to a mother to offer passive protection to a child wouldn’t necessarily work for a child born after the RSV season is over. By then, the immunity would likely have worn off, Heinrichs said. Half of infants that are hospitalized with RSV are born outside of the RSV season.\n\n“So it’s really critically important in our minds at least to protect all infants from RSV disease, and we think this is the only way to do it,” Heinrichs said.\n\nIn the US, there are four new RSV vaccines that may be nearing review by the FDA, and more than a dozen are going through trials right now.

Getting boosted this fall is still an important way to renew protection, even among people who were previously infected or vaccinated.\n\nBut the hope was that by tweaking the vaccine recipe to include currently circulating strains of the Omicron variant, it would help broaden immunity against those variants and perhaps offer better and longer-lasting protection.\n\nWhen the researchers compared the immune responses of people who got a booster dose of the original shot to people who got the updated bivalent boosters, they looked about the same.\n\n“We see essentially no difference” between the old boosters and the new about a month after the shot, said Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, whose team authored one of the studies.\n\nImmunologists say a vaccine against two strains may not be better than a single strain shot because of a phenomenon called immune imprinting. Scientists say imprinting may complicate efforts to stay ahead of new variants as the coronavirus continues to evolve, and it adds urgency to the development of new vaccine technologies to fight the virus.\n\nWhen the US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for new bivalent Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna at the end of August, it did so on the basis of studies in mice and previous human trials with a different two-strain booster formulation. Little was known about the how protective the shots might be in people; full data from clinical trials testing the BA.4 and BA.5 bivalent vaccines in humans hasn’t yet been made public.\n\nBut modeling data suggested that getting the boosters out in September could save tens of thousands of lives if the country had another winter surge, so the FDA authorized the shots, ahead of results from clinical trials, in order to get them to the public more quickly.\n\nThe updated shots contain instructions that show cells how to make spike proteins from the original virus that caused Covid-19, as well as spikes from the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. These spikes get assembled by our cells and displayed to our immune system so it can make antibodies to fight the real thing during an active infection.\n\nThe original strain of the virus, sometimes called the ancestral or wild-type strain, is no longer circulating, however. When we boost, we are mostly boosting antibodies against a virus that’s long gone.\n\nAs the virus has evolved, the vaccines have not kept pace. Each new variant has become more and more resistant to the antibodies we make against it, increasing the risk of breakthrough infections, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nRight now, protection against infection begins to wane just a few months after each booster dose. Protection against severe outcomes – hospitalization or death from Covid-19 – lasts longer, but can also fade, especially for vulnerable groups such as people who are over 65, who have weakened immune systems or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nSimilar immune responses\n\nThe studies have important limitations, and they aren’t the final word on the updated boosters.\n\nBoth studies were small. Ho’s study looked at the immune responses of 19 people who were boosted with a fourth dose of the original recipe vaccine and 21 people who got a fourth dose of the updated boosters. The other study, from Dr. Dan Barouch, a professor at Harvard and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, looked at 15 people who got the original booster and 18 people who got bivalent shots.\n\nBoth reports were posted as preprints, before scrutiny by independent experts.\n\nThe studies also measured immune responses over a short period of time – about three to five weeks after the fourth doses. Ho says these results could change with time, as immune cells mature.\n\n“We can’t say that a few months from now, there won’t be any difference,” he said. “We won’t know that until these individuals are followed for a longer period of time.”\n\nDespite these caveats, experts who were not involved in the research say that two studies from well-regarded labs arriving at roughly the same conclusions about the vaccines gives them confidence that the results are correct.\n\n“At least at this time point, there’s no discernible benefit” over the older boosters, Ho said.\n\nClinical trials being conducted by vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna involve hundreds of people who have had the updated boosters and are being followed for longer periods of time. Data from those studies are still coming.\n\nBoth companies declined to comment on Ho and Barouch’s studies, citing company policies not to weigh in on research they have not been involved in.\n\nIn comparing the immune responses of people who got the old boosters with those who got the newer ones, the researchers found that neutralizing antibodies spiked after both shots to about the same high levels, which was good news.\n\nIn Barouch’s study, antibody concentrations were 15 times higher after the original boosters, rising from 184 to 2,829. They were 17 times higher after the updated shots, jumping from 211 to 3,693. The difference in antibody levels between shots didn’t pass a statistical test, however, so the results may have been due to chance.\n\nMore importantly, that slight difference in antibody levels probably wouldn’t protect people any better in the real world.\n\n“We would not expect this to be clinically significant,” said Barouch, who worked on the development of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nBut the bulk of the antibodies generated after either shot were ones that would bind the original virus, with fewer directed specifically against the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants.\n\nBarouch’s team also looked specifically at T cells, which help the body hold the memory of germs it has been exposed to. These cells are thought to play a key role in how long immune protection lasts. Antibody levels naturally drop off over time, but T cells stick around.\n\nThe numbers of T cells didn’t budge much after either vaccine.\n\n“Unfortunately, neither one increased T-cell responses very much, and we believe that T-cell responses in addition to antibody responses are important for protection against severe disease,” Barouch said.\n\n‘A booster is a booster’\n\nDr. Eric Topol, who directs the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said the study results “can be considered a disappointment,” especially because the US government raced to make them available and because there had been high hopes for an improved vaccine in time for a predicted winter Covid-19 surge.\n\nTopol also said it would be a mistake to skip these shots. They still work; they just may not be much of an improvement over the older ones.\n\n“A booster is a booster until proven otherwise and we are in great need of getting more of them in the US,” Topol, who was not involved in the new studies, wrote in an email to CNN.\n\nFewer than 20 million people – less than 10% of the population ages 5 and up – have gotten the updated booster, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAfter waiting the recommended three months since his last Covid-19 infection, President Joe Biden got an updated booster Tuesday and urged eligible Americans to do the same.\n\n“Your old vaccine or your previous Covid infection will not give you maximum protection,” Biden said.\n\nPublic health officials had hoped that the rollout of the updated boosters would mark a turning point, where Americans might be able to get annual Covid-19 shots instead of boosters every few months.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, recently told Stat that he wasn’t sure whether the country had reached that point.\n\n“I would be lying to you if [I said] it doesn’t keep me up at night worrying that there is a certain chance that we may have to deploy another booster – at least for a portion of the population, perhaps older individuals – before next September, October,” he said.\n\n“I’m not saying that’s what’s going to happen, but it’s what keeps me up at night, because we see how fast this virus is evolving.”\n\nImprinting may complicate quest for better immunity\n\nThe studies probably didn’t find any difference between the new and old boosters because of immune imprinting, says Michael Worobey, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies the evolution of viruses and the origins and control of pandemics.\n\n“Your body is on a hair trigger to create more antibodies of what it has a good memory of,” said Worobey, who was not involved in the new research.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, our immune systems were blank slates when it came to the coronavirus. By now, most of us have been exposed to one version of the virus or another through the vaccine, an infection or both. That exposure programs cells called B cells to make specific kinds of antibodies, and more B cells get this programming during their first exposure to the virus than they do in subsequent brushes with it.\n\nThat’s the reason some strains of the flu may hit certain age groups harder than others, too. When viruses look more similar to the first infection or vaccine you had, your body tends to do a better job fighting them off.\n\nWorobey said that both new studies have limitations, “but I think when you put them together, they paint a pretty clear picture that that antigenic imprinting is causing issues here, for sure.”\n\nIt’s possible to break through immune imprinting, he said. Certain kinds of vaccine ingredients, or adjuvants – “things that just happen to really wake up the immune system” – can do it.\n\nBut it’s not easy to add the kind of adjuvants he’s thinking about to mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna’s. In this case, he says, judging by the study findings, it probably would have been better to update the vaccine by including only the components against BA.4 and BA.5.\n\n“For me, the take-home message is, if you want to boost and provide protection against Omicron, leave the original variant out of the vaccine.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee, says the new studies bear out data that was presented to the FDA’s advisers in June.\n\nHe says it’s one of the reasons he voted against the FDA requiring companies to add an Omicron strain to the boosters used in the US.\n\n“Certainly, the hope that this would be significantly better in terms of protection against the circulating strains, I think, is unlikely to be realized,” said Offit, who was not involved in the new studies.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWorobey says that when the strains are combined as they are in the updated boosters, they actually end up competing. The body’s response to the original strain is so strong, it will end up blocking the updated portion of the vaccine from stimulating those blank slate B cells against the newer variants and reshaping the immune response.\n\nThus, imprinting will complicate efforts to keep up with the virus, he says. We may need different kinds of vaccine technologies if the virus ever changes so much that it outcompetes our immunity altogether.\n\nThat’s something the FDA’s Marks has considered, too.\n\n“I would love to see us have a very ecumenical look over all of the available vaccines and all of the vaccines in development to try to see what’s best moving forward,” he told Stat. “Not to diss the current mRNA vaccines but because we owe it to the population to see what might provide the greatest breadth, depth and duration of immunity against Covid-19.”", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/06/health/fda-vrbpac-covid-boosters-meeting/index.html", "title": "FDA vaccine advisers say a plan for updating Covid-19 shots is ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe future of Covid-19 vaccines – including when and how often booster doses might be needed – remains unclear and “complex,” according to advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) detailed in a meeting Wednesday how emerging coronavirus variants and the future use of Covid-19 booster shots would be approached and coordinated – and the advisers plan to continue their conversation in the coming months.\n\nThe meeting “was a good opportunity to show how complex the decision-making is going to be going forward,” Dr. Eric Rubin, editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine, who sits on the FDA’s VRBPAC, told CNN following Wednesday’s deliberations.\n\n“Right now, we don’t have a good idea of what the next-generation vaccine is going to look like,” said Rubin, who is also an infectious disease specialist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “And at the same time, we don’t know what the next strain is going to look like.”\n\nAs the VRBPAC panel – and other leading public health experts – work to answer some of those questions about the future, Rubin said that it is useful to get these issues “out there” now, and “start thinking about them.”\n\nA whole new vaccine\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccinations that people receive in the future could be completely different formulations than what are administered now – which are a composition based on the original version of the virus that emerged in late 2019.\n\nSome companies, including Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, are developing variant-specific vaccines that could target whatever variant of the coronavirus is circulating when that booster might be needed. For instance, Pfizer and Moderna have each said they are working on a vaccine that would specifically protect against the Omicron variant, even though it’s not clear whether one is needed.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla has said the company is also hoping to make a vaccine that will protect against Omicron as well as all other variants of the coronavirus.\n\nThe goal is to create “something that can protect for at least a year,” Bourla told CBS in March. “And if we are able to achieve that, then I think it is very easy to follow and remember so that we can go back to really the way [we] used to live.”\n\nModerna and the biotechnology company Novavax also are working on two-in-one combination vaccines that can offer protection against both flu and Covid-19.\n\n“Our goal is to be able to have a single annual booster, so that we don’t have compliance issues where people don’t want to get two to three shots a winter, but they get one dose where they get a booster for corona and they get a booster for flu and RSV, to make sure that people get their vaccines,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said at the World Economic Forum in January of a single vaccine for Covid-19, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus, a common virus that causes cold-like symptoms.\n\nVarious research teams from different institutions also are working to develop a “pan-coronavirus” vaccine – one that offers protection against multiple variants of the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\n\nThe hope is that such a vaccine could pave the way for the development of a universal coronavirus vaccine, which could head off any coronavirus and and even the menacing threat of novel coronaviruses we haven’t identified yet.\n\nThere are seven known coronaviruses that infect humans: four that cause common colds; Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS; severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS; and SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\n\nA possible universal vaccine, however, is going to take much longer to develop – likely several years – than a pan-coronavirus vaccine or so-called “multivalent” vaccine that could protect against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nBut while the composition of coronavirus vaccines could change in the future to target any new and emerging variants, there needs to be a “framework” for how and when such changes take place, according to VRBPAC members.\n\nTo start, the FDA would seek advice from the VRBPAC before any changes to the composition of coronavirus vaccines are made, Jerry Weir of the FDA’s Office of Vaccines Research and Review told the advisory committee in Wednesday’s meeting.\n\nOn some routine basis, “the FDA and VRBPAC would review the epidemiology of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in the US, the effectiveness of available vaccines in use, and the available clinical data and manufacturing concerns for modified vaccines, in order to determine whether to recommend an updated vaccine for use,” Weir said.\n\n“There should be some thought given to a collaborative plan – this is going forward – that includes manufacturers, the FDA and other public health agencies,” Weir added.\n\nSuch a plan “would provide the necessary clinical data needed for the future vaccine composition decisions,” he said. “These plans should be developed to respond to any emerging variant that escapes protection provided by currently available vaccines.”\n\nAfter all, as the coronavirus evolves, new variants are likely to emerge in the future.\n\nCoronavirus evolution is ‘remarkably fast’\n\nIn the two years since the start of the pandemic, the SARS-CoV-2 virus already has achieved about “five years” worth of virus evolution – and the virus will continue to evolve, experts told VRBPAC in Wednesday’s meeting.\n\nWhen compared with various types of flu viruses, “SARS-CoV-2 so far has been evolving about twice as fast as influenza H3N2, about four times as fast as influenza H1N1, and about 10 times as fast as B/Victoria,” Trevor Bedford, a scientist at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, told VRBPAC members.\n\n“This means that if you look here at Omicron-like viruses, in just two years’ time, since the start of the pandemic, we’ve accomplished about five years of equivalent evolution,” Bedford said. “The evolution has been remarkably fast so far.”\n\nAs the pandemic transitions into an endemic phase, “we really don’t know” whether “wildly divergent” variants of the virus will be common or rare, Bedford said. Endemic means a disease has a constant presence in a population but is not affecting an alarmingly large number of people, as typically seen in a pandemic.\n\nYet to respond to a fast-changing virus, coordinating the possible rollout of vaccines as variants emerge in the future remains complicated.\n\n“We have multiple manufacturers. We are talking about some vaccines in development that might not be authorized or approved yet that could also be coming into the mix. How do we essentially unify what we’re doing for a booster?” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, told VRBPAC members.\n\n“It might be better to have a unified approach with a strain selection or a variant selection, much the same as we do for influenza,” Marks said, referring to how flu vaccines are updated each year to match circulating strains. “Much like with flu, once we move to a new composition … it will also change the composition of the primary series.”\n\nThe way flu vaccines are updated each year could be a model for the future of coronavirus vaccines – but VRBPAC member Oveta Fuller, of the University of Michigan, emphasized that the nation had much more than two years to understand the flu.\n\n“Let me remind us that we didn’t get to understand influenza in two years. It’s taken years to get to a uniform – somewhat still imperfect but also useful – process for what we do with flu,” Fuller said in Wednesday’s meeting.\n\n“We need to remind ourselves and step back that we are very new in this pandemic, and we don’t have the answers,” Fuller said. “VRBPAC doesn’t have the answers. FDA doesn’t have the answers. The important thing here is that the public understands how complex this is.”\n\nWhat keeps an FDA official up at night\n\nEven once Covid-19 transitions from a pandemic to endemic, will enough people complete their coronavirus vaccinations so that the disease stays at endemic levels – or will they grow tired of getting their Covid-19 booster doses? That is a concern that Marks expressed Wednesday.\n\n“What really keeps me up at night is the knowledge that we can’t keep boosting and that we’re going to have vaccine exhaustion,” Marks told VRBPAC members.\n\n“I’m talking about physical exhaustion and people not going to get boosted,” he said.\n\nCurrently, about 66% of the US population is fully vaccinated with at least their initial series – including more than 75% of adults – and about 30% have received their booster. In March, the FDA authorized second booster doses for adults 50 and older. On Wednesday, Marks called that a “stopgap” measure.\n\n“I think we’re very much on board with the idea that we simply can’t be boosting people as frequently as we are, and I’m the first to acknowledge that this additional fourth booster dose that was authorized was a stopgap measure until we got things in place for the next potential booster, given the emerging data,” Marks said in Wednesday’s meeting.\n\n“It was done because of the amount of harm that has come to our older population in the United States with 1 in 100 individuals over the age 65 having died in the past two years of Covid-19, so we need to protect that population,” Marks said.\n\n“Moving forward, we will have this issue that coming into the fall season only half of the population overall – and granted it’s two-thirds of the population over age 65 are vaccinated with a third dose – but half of the population overall hasn’t received a third dose,” he added. “That means that they will not have the more durable protection.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nMarks expects to hold another meeting in early summer to discuss Covid-19 booster doses for the fall and winter, he told VRBPAC members.\n\nLooking ahead, he said, “Our goal here is to stay ahead of future variants and outbreaks and ensure that we do our best to reduce the toll of disease and death due to Covid-19 on our population.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/health/new-york-polio/index.html", "title": "New York adult diagnosed with polio, first US case in nearly a ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nA person from Rockland County, New York, has been diagnosed with polio, the first case identified in the United States in nearly a decade.\n\nThe unvaccinated young adult began experiencing weakness and paralysis about a month ago, county Health Commissioner Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert said Thursday.\n\nThe case comes nearly a month after the UK Health Security Agency warned that it had detected poliovirus in its surveillance of London sewage samples, indicating that there had been some spread between closely linked individuals in North and East London, although no cases had been identified there.\n\nPolio is an infection caused by the poliovirus. About 1 in 4 infected people have flu-like symptoms including sore throat, fever, tiredness, nausea, headache and stomach pain. As many as 1 in 200 will develop more serious symptoms that include tingling and numbness in the legs, an infection of the brain or spinal cord, and paralysis, according to the US Centers for the Disease control and Prevention.\n\nThere is no cure for polio. Treatment to address symptoms may include medication to relax muscles and heat and physical therapy to stimulate muscles. However, any paralysis caused by polio is permanent.\n\n“This patient did present with weakness and paralysis,” Schnabel Ruppert said.\n\nThis is the first polio case diagnosed in the United States since 2013, according to the New York Department of Health.\n\nState and county health officials are advising health-care providers to stay vigilant for additional cases, and they are advising county residents to get vaccinated for polio.\n\n“The risk to an unvaccinated community member from this event is still being determined,” Ruppert Schnabel said. “We strongly advise anyone who’s unvaccinated to get vaccinated.”\n\nPolio vaccine is part of the CDC’s standard immunization schedule and is required for school attendance. People who are vaccinated are not expected to be at risk.\n\nThe New York case was identified as a revertant polio Sabin type 2 virus, indicating that it was derived from someone who received the oral polio vaccine, which contains a live but weakened form of the polio virus.\n\nOfficials say this suggests that the virus originated outside the US, where the oral vaccine is still administered, but they are investigating the origins of this particular case.\n\nHealth officials said Thursday that the person had not traveled outside the US before or after they were diagnosed.\n\nTypically, people who catch polio can spread it to others for about two weeks. Officials said the individual is not expected to be contagious right now because they are past that window of time and have normal immune function. But others may have been exposed before the case was diagnosed.\n\nThe oral polio vaccine is no longer authorized for use in this country. In the US, only the inactivated polio vaccine has been given since 2000.\n\nHealth officials think the strain of the virus the individual contracted originated through shedding from the orgal vaccine. A person cannot get polio from the vaccine itself, but in recent years, cases of polio linked to shedding have arisen in communities that have low vaccination rates.\n\nWhen this weakened strain of the virus circulates in under-immunized populations – typically in areas with poor sanitary conditions – the virus can acquire mutations and revert to a form that causes paralysis. These vaccine-derived viruses are different from wild polioviruses, which now circulate only in Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nCounty health officials declined to give personal details about the case, but The New York Times reported that the patient is a man from the Orthodox Jewish community, citing unnamed local elected officials. Community newspaper New York Jewish Week also quoted multiple sources saying the same thing.\n\nRockland County is home to an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in which vaccination rates have historically been very low. In 2018 and 2019, Rockland County was the epicenter of a major measles outbreak that continued for nearly a year and sickened 312 people. County health officials reported at the time that only 8% of cases had been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella before the outbreak began.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“Based on what we know about this case, and polio in general, the Department of Health strongly recommends that unvaccinated individuals get vaccinated or boosted with the FDA-approved IPV polio vaccine as soon as possible,” State Health Commissioner Mary T. Bassett said in a statement Thursday. “The polio vaccine is safe and effective, protecting against this potentially debilitating disease, and it has been part of the backbone of required, routine childhood immunizations recommended by health officials and public health agencies nationwide.”\n\nPolio cases were once common in the United States and around the world. During one of the most severe outbreaks in 1952, the virus infected 58,000 people in the US, paralyzed more than 21,000 and killed more than 3,100. However, vaccination campaigns cut cases dramatically.

This will allow providers to get five doses out of a standard one-dose vial.\n\nThe new EUA also allows subcutaneous vaccination in people under 18 who are at high risk of infection.\n\nThe move could increase the number of vaccine doses in the national stockpile from 441,000 to over 2.2 million, officials said Tuesday.\n\nBut the EUA isn’t going to be a panacea as the outbreak continues to grow and vaccine demand remains high. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that at least 1.5 million people in the US are eligible for the two-dose vaccine.\n\n“I think we’re going to see that we will likely still run out of vaccines before we run out of arms,” Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the White House’s assistant national response coordinator, said Tuesday.\n\nThe CDC reports 9,492 probable or confirmed monkeypox cases in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia as of Tuesday evening.\n\nMoving “as quickly as possible”\n\n“In recent weeks the monkeypox virus has continued to spread at a rate that has made it clear our current vaccine supply will not meet the current demand,” FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in a statement. “The FDA quickly explored other scientifically appropriate options to facilitate access to the vaccine for all impacted individuals. By increasing the number of available doses, more individuals who want to be vaccinated against monkeypox will now have the opportunity to do so.”\n\nHe added at a briefing Tuesday, “we encourage jurisdictions to utilize alternative dosing method as quickly as possible, and we’ll be your partner in this step every step of the way.”\n\nThe move comes less than a week after the Biden administration declared monkeypox a public health emergency, which gives the FDA and other government health agencies more flexibility to fight the spread of the virus.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, US Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra issued a determination to pave the way for the FDA’s move.\n\n“Last week, I declared monkeypox to be a public health emergency to unlock additional tools that will help us contain and end this outbreak and to signal to the American people that we are taking our response to the next level,” Becerra said in a statement. “Today’s action will allow FDA to exercise additional authorities that may increase availability of vaccines to prevent monkeypox while continuing to ensure the vaccine meets high standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality.”\n\nPrevention remains important\n\nThe CDC is launching an outreach program to ease the transition to the new strategy, expanding its education and information efforts for public health officials and health care providers. Vaccine equity will be a key part of this message, as will training and outreach on how to use the special needle for intradermal vaccination.\n\nOfficials also emphasized that people should continue to take steps to protect themselves from the monkeypox virus even after they’re vaccinated, especially those in the hard-hit population of gay and bisexual men and other men who have sex with men. This includes avoiding skin-to-skin contact with someone who may be infected and limiting the number of sex partners.\n\n“Really, prevention for monkey pox is multidomain,” Daskalakis said. “And so as people are working to get vaccinated … we really want to give people options and clear guidance of what to do between the first and second dose and also to be aware that it does take time after the second dose to also achieve adequate protection.”\n\nJynneos is given as two doses at least four weeks apart. Officials said Tuesday that people who have gotten a first dose subcutaneously can get the second intradermally.\n\nResearch will continue\n\nUsing a smaller dose with intradermal injection has been done with vaccines for flu and rabies, epidemiologist Dr. Jay Varma told CNN in an email. Intradermal shots are also used for the tuberculosis skin test.\n\n“The skin has special cells that are very good at helping a vaccine stimulate the body’s immune system,” he wrote.\n\nThese cells, called dendritic cells, are better able to produce an immune response, said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University.\n\n“They live in the skin, and they’re better at teaching the immune system what they need to respond to,” he said.\n\nA 2015 study found a similar immune response when the vaccine was given intradermally in doses one-fifth the size of those given subcutaneously. Side effects like redness, itchiness and swelling were more common with the intradermal method, but there was less pain.\n\nJynneos has also been found to be safe and effective in people with conditions that weakened their immune system, Califf said Tuesday.\n\nHowever, the existing research on the vaccine focuses on recipients’ immune response, not on whether it actually prevents cases of monkeypox.\n\n“There is no traditional assessment of this vaccine … because there weren’t smallpox cases, and the monkeypox outbreaks before this were not large enough to really do a clinical trial,” Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said Tuesday. “We want to collect outcome data, as we do with all vaccines.

The hope is that these shots will improve protection against the currently circulating viruses that cause Covid-19.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the new bivalent boosters and who can get them.\n\nHow are these new bivalent vaccines different?\n\nThe new bivalent vaccines carry instructions to help our cells make defenses against two strains of the virus that causes Covid-19. The shots direct cells to make antibodies that bind to certain parts of the spike proteins from both the original strain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants, which share an identical spike.\n\nBA.4 and BA.5 are the dominant variants in the United States, where there’s an average of 91,000 new infections each day.\n\n“These are vaccines that are made, manufactured and delivered identically to the Covid mRNA vaccines that most of us have already gotten,” said Dr. Gregory Poland, who leads the vaccine research group at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “In a sense, you’ve just changed the blueprints.”\n\nHaving twice the blueprints doesn’t mean you’re getting twice the dose of active ingredients, though.\n\n“The total mRNA content – the business part of the vaccine – that leads to the immune response is the same amount,” said Dr. William Gruber, senior vice president of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, which makes one of the updated vaccines.\n\nPfizer’s booster is a 30-microgram dose that contains 15 micrograms of mRNA against the ancestral strain and 15 micrograms against the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It is authorized for people as young as 12.\n\nModerna’s bivalent booster is a 50-microgram dose, with 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the ancestral strain of the coronavirus and 25 micrograms of mRNA designed to fight the BA.4 and BA.5 variants. It’s authorized for people 18 and older.\n\nThe earlier mRNA shots are still the first two shots a person will get, but they’re no longer authorized for use as boosters in people age 12 and older.\n\nWhere can I get an updated Covid-19 booster?\n\nMillions of vaccines are now shipping to tens of thousands of sites across the country. These include community health centers, health departments and pharmacies.\n\nCVS and Walgreens have started offering the shots. Both chains are scheduling appointments online, and say more slots will be added as they get shipments of the vaccines.\n\nThe Biden administration expects appointment availability to ramp up over the first several days, with broad availability in a few weeks. People will be able to find locations at Vaccines.gov.\n\n“You’ll start seeing some places start giving some shots in arms over the weekend, but very relatively few because [of the] Labor Day weekend. And my expectation is over next week, or certainly over the next 10 days, you’re going to start seeing these bivalent vaccines become widely available across the country,” Dr. Ashish Jha, who leads the White House Covid-19 Response Team, told CNN.\n\nAs with past Covid-19 vaccines, these shots will be available free of charge. But they may be some of the last Covid-19 freebies from the government, which has said it’s going to start commercializing treatments and vaccines this fall.\n\nWho should get an updated booster?\n\nAmericans ages 12 and older are recommended get the new boosters as long as they’ve already had their primary series of vaccines.\n\nExperts say everyone needs one as protection from both vaccination and infection wanes considerably over time and in all age groups.\n\n“I do believe there will be benefit, essentially for everyone, with clearly more benefit for the elderly and those who have underlying conditions,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN on Friday.\n\nAdults age 18 and older can get either a Pfizer or Moderna shot. Adolescents ages 12 and older can get an updated Pfizer shot.\n\nWhen should I get an updated booster?\n\nYou should wait two months after your last vaccine dose to get an updated booster.\n\nFor those who have recently recovered from a Covid-19 infection, the CDC recommends waiting at least until the illness has passed and a person is no longer contagious. For best results, it may be better to delay a booster for at least three months after symptoms started. Infection itself probably already acted like a booster; studies have shown that people have a relatively low risk of getting sick again for about three months after they recover.\n\nYou may not want to wait as long as three months if Covid-19 levels are already high in your community or if you are reduced immune function.\n\n“Myself as an example, I was vaccinated, doubly boosted and infected, and I will be getting the updated BA.4/5 bivalent vaccine within three months of my having gotten infected, exactly the way the FDA has authorized and the CDC has recommended,” Fauci said.\n\nCan people get other vaccines at the same time as the updated booster?\n\nUS health officials have recommended that providers offer the seasonal flu vaccine and Covid-19 vaccines at the same visit if a patient is eligible for the vaccinations. This upcoming fall and winter could host a high spread of flu and Covid-19, and administering both vaccinations at the same time has been found to be safe.\n\nThe government is also preparing to launch a campaign that will urge Americans to get their annual flu shot along with an updated Covid-19 booster.\n\nOne vaccine for which there are no data on administering it at the same time as others is the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine, according to the CDC’s guidance. The agency recommends that people, particularly adolescent or young adult men, might consider waiting four weeks after receiving monkeypox vaccination before receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, “because of the observed risk” for myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the tissue surrounding the heart.\n\nThe CDC adds that monkeypox vaccination “should not be delayed” due to recently receiving a Moderna, Novavax or Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nWhen can younger children get an updated booster?\n\nChildren ages 5 through 11 can still be boosted with the older, single-strain vaccines.\n\nVaccine manufacturers are updating boosters for younger children now. Pfizer said it’s retooling its shots for children ages to 5 through 11 and will ask the FDA for authorization of those updated boosters in early October. It’s working with the FDA to update vaccines for children ages 6 months through 4 years.\n\nUntil those are ready, the best way to protect babies, toddlers and gradeschoolers is to get eligible family and friends an updated shot.\n\nCan immunocompromised people get an updated booster?\n\nYes, but that’s not all. If a health condition or a medication has lowered your immune function, the CDC recommends a two-pronged approach to boost your protection against Covid-19 – vaccination and preventive treatment with a type of passive immunity called Evusheld. Passive immunity is when antibodies are made in a lab and then given by injection or infusion to help people who can’t make enough of this protection on their own.\n\nEvusheld can be taken every six months and is available for immunocompromised people ages 12 and up. It requires a doctors prescription, but the treatment itself is free. The CDC estimates 7 million people may be eligible to take Evusheld, but most haven’t gotten it because they don’t know about it.\n\nIf you need Evusheld, you should wait at least two weeks after getting a Covid-19 vaccine to take it. But after a person has taken Evusheld, there’s no waiting period for getting an updated booster.\n\nAre the updated Covid-19 boosters safe?\n\nA recent review of adverse events after mRNA booster vaccinations in adults the United States found that side effects were less common after booster doses than after second doses of the vaccine, and most were mild. About 1 in 8 adults reported a headache, fever or pain after a booster. In children and teens, commonly reported side effects after boosters were pain at the site of the injection, fatigue, headache and muscle aches.\n\nVery rarely, mRNA vaccines can cause myocarditis, or swelling in or around the heart. After more than 80 million booster doses given in the United States, the government safety surveillance systems received 37 verifiable reports of myocarditis. Most of these were in men.\n\nThe highest rates of myocarditis in adults were in younger men – ages 18 to 24. For every million booster doses given to men this age, the CDC expects about that about will have myocarditis. For adolescents, the rate is slightly higher but still extremely low: about 11 cases of myocarditis for every million doses.\n\nDr. Peter Marks, who directs the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that to minimize this risk, officials are directing that the vaccines be given at least two months after a previous dose.\n\n“It seems to be associated when they’re given closer to one another,” he said.\n\nHow do we know the updated Covid-19 vaccines work?\n\nThe evidence for these updated vaccines is a bit different than what was behind earlier versions. These are the first Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in people after being tested only in mice, following much the same process used each year when annual flu shots are updated.\n\nThe FDA allowed companies to submit data from animal tests in order to speed these shots to the public. Studies in people are underway. FDA’s Marks said he expects that it will be a month or two before data on humans is available.\n\nOfficials say urgency with these boosters is warranted going into the fall, when Covid-19 is still circulating at high levels and influenza is expected to make a return. But some vaccine experts feel that animal studies don’t provide sufficient evidence for these vaccines at this stage in the pandemic.\n\n“You’re asking people to get a new product for which there’s no data,” Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the vaccine education center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. “Mice data are not adequate to launch 100-plus-billion-dose effort.”\n\nOffit says it makes sense to use data from animal studies for updates to annual flu vaccines because we’ve used those shots for decades, and we understand what biomarkers to look for when gauging whether they work. These so-called correlates of protection are not as well understood for the Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nIt’s not just the shots that are different, Poland said. At this point in the pandemic, our immune systems are, too. Nearly all Americans have been infected with the coronavirus, vaccinated or both. Some people have had four or five doses of vaccine.\n\n“So if you say to me, ‘can you assure me that getting dose five or dose six of this new vaccine in the background of having received these previous doses is absolutely safe?’ I’d say ‘no, I can’t.’ We’re extrapolating. And I think we ought to be clear about that,” Poland said.\n\nFDA officials point out that animal studies weren’t the only data they reviewed to make their decision. They considered two other lines of evidence.\n\nThe first is the vaccines’ track records. The same basic vaccines have now been given to hundreds of millions of people around the world. They have been shown to be extremely effective at preventing severe disease and death from Covid-19. Risks associated with mRNA vaccination are very, very low.\n\nThe second line of evidence comes from bivalent vaccines that may soon be used in Europe and Canada.\n\nEarlier this year, Pfizer and Moderna presented an independent panel of experts who advise the FDA with data on a bivalent vaccine designed to target the original strain of Omicron, BA.1. That data showed that the vaccines boosted antibody responses and were well-tolerated. Other countries have authorized these vaccines, but they will not be available in the US.\n\nThe BA.1 strain isn’t circulating any more, and the FDA asked the manufacturers to update their US shots to include BA.4 and BA.5 instead. Some evidence suggests that the BA.4 and BA.5 strains generate a stronger immune response than BA.1, which is another reason officials wanted to include them in the updated shots.\n\nFDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said he understands that people may want to know more, but he’s confident that these vaccines are safe and effective.\n\n“It’s fair for people to raise questions. But this really is the best consensus that we have among the experts that this is the best way to go. … It’s just painful to see people dying unnecessarily when there’s a free treatment that would prevent their death,” he said.\n\n“I will be at the front of the line at the pharmacy getting my vaccination,” said Califf, who will turn 71 next month. “I’m very confident about this.”\n\nIn the past, tests of variant-specific vaccines have had lackluster results. It’s hard to know how effective these bivalent vaccines could be.\n\nIn a recent preprint study, published ahead of peer review, scientists tried to estimate this with a meta-analysis, or a study of studies. The gathered estimates of antibody levels after booster doses against the ancestral strains, as well as against specific variants, and tried to use those levels to predict how well the shots would work.\n\nThey found that people got the biggest benefits from getting boosted, period. A booster against the ancestral strain increased neutralizing antibodies 11-fold. The scientists estimated that would increase a person’s protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months from 50% to 86.5%.\n\nVariant-specific boosters worked a little better, but the difference wasn’t dramatic. After those shots, protection against symptomatic infection over the next six months rose to 90.2%, just a 4.6% increase.\n\nWhy were the shots updated?\n\nThe Covid-19 vaccines were due for an update.\n\nAs the coronavirus has been circulating, it has changed a lot. These changes have helped it slip past the antibodies that we made against older versions of the virus and older versions of the vaccine. As a result, it has gotten better at causing reinfections and breakthrough infections.\n\nThe hope is that giving people updated vaccines will improve their ability to fight off the infection and shore up protection against severe disease that causes hospitalization or death.\n\nThere is also some hope that updated boosters may slow the spread of the virus – and thus the speed at which vaccine-busting variants appear.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe coronavirus is changing at blistering speed. In a meeting with FDA vaccine advisers last June, Trevor Bedford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Reserach Center in Seattle, compared the speed of evolution of the viruses that cause Covid-19 to that of the viruses that cause influenza.\n\nAmong the faster influenza viruses, he said, it takes about three years for a new strain to emerge and start showing up in testing in significant numbers. Among the variants of the virus that causes Covid-19, the Delta variant pulled off this feat in a year. Omicron did it in three to four months.\n\nSo there is genuine concern that without something to slow transmission of the infection, we’ll be forever stuck in catchup mode, waiting for faster and potentially more dangerous variants to emerge.", "authors": ["Brenda Goodman"], "publish_date": "2022/09/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/03/health/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-fda/index.html", "title": "Covid-19: FDA advisers to weigh risks and benefits of Novavax's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAfter more than a year with two types of Covid-19 vaccines in use in the United States, another will be up for consideration by the US Food and Drug Administration next week.\n\nThe FDA’s vaccine advisers are set to meet Tuesday to consider Novavax’s coronavirus vaccine for the nation.\n\nBased on data included in an agency briefing document posted Friday, an FDA review found that the vaccine’s efficacy was 90.4% overall against mild, moderate or severe Covid-19 for a period of 2½ months after completing the two-dose primary series. The document notes that, in a primary analysis, the vaccine efficacy fell to 78.6% among adults 65 and older.\n\nThose efficacy numbers were collected before the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant. It remains unclear how long protection lasts or how well the vaccine will protect against Omicron.\n\nIn an announcement published in December, the company reported that the vaccine had “broad cross-reactivity against Omicron and other circulating variants from a primary 2-dose regimen, with responses that increased following a third dose at six months.”\n\nNovavax’s vaccine, called NVX-CoV2373, is given as two doses three weeks apart for the primary vaccination series.\n\nAlthough most adverse reactions to the vaccine were mild to moderate and lasted just a few days, the FDA did describe rare events of myocarditis and pericarditis – inflammation of the heart muscle and inflammation of tissue surrounding the heart – associated with the vaccine.\n\n“Multiple events of myocarditis/ pericarditis were reported in temporal relationship to NVX-CoV2373 administration, similar to myocarditis following mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and raising concern for a causal relationship to NVX-CoV2373,” the FDA’s briefing document says.\n\nThe document describes six cases that happened after vaccination with Novavax. Five were among males ranging in age from 16 to 67. Of the six cases, five were hospitalized but have since recovered.\n\nAn increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis has been identified among people who received the mRNA Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines now used in the United States.\n\nIn a statement Friday, Novavax addressed the heart inflammation concerns specifically: “We have learned that we can expect to see natural background events of myocarditis in any sufficiently large database, and that young males are at higher risk. Myocarditis is most often caused by nonspecific viral infections.” It said that the rate of myocarditis in vaccinated participants was similar to the placebo group: 0.007% and 0.005%, respectively.\n\nThe company added, “we believe there is insufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship. We will continue to monitor all adverse events, including myocarditis and pericarditis.”\n\nThe most common adverse reactions to the vaccine were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache and muscle ache. Reactions were reported more commonly in younger participants in the vaccine’s clinical trials.\n\nIn its briefing document, the FDA summarized, “The known benefits among vaccine recipients 18 years of age and older relative to placebo are reduction in the risk of mild to severe COVID-19 occurring at least 7 days after the second primary series vaccination.”\n\nIn Tuesday’s meeting, the FDA’s vaccine advisory committee members will vote on the question “Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine when administered as a 2-dose series outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?”\n\n‘We believe our vaccine offers a differentiated option’\n\nIn late January, Novavax announced that it had submitted a request for the FDA to authorize its coronavirus vaccine for emergency use in the United States.\n\nIn November, Indonesia became the first country to grant emergency use authorization of Novavax’s vaccine. It has since been authorized in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Canada, South Korea, Australia, India, the Philippines and New Zealand, among other countries.\n\nEven though most adults in the United States have been vaccinated against Covid-19, the head of the company has said that it sees Novavax’s vaccine as a potential option for booster doses, regardless of which type of vaccine was given for a person’s initial doses.\n\nNovavax’s vaccine was developed as a protein subunit vaccine, a more traditional type of technology than the mRNA used for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. Other examples of subunit vaccines are the hepatitis B and pertussis vaccines.\n\n“We believe our vaccine offers a differentiated option built on a well-understood protein-based vaccine platform that can be an alternative to the portfolio of available vaccines to help fight the Covid-19 pandemic,” Novavax CEO Stanley Erck said in a statement in January.\n\nNovavax’s protein-based coronavirus vaccine relies on something called recombinant nanoparticle technology and Novavax’s adjuvant, called Matrix-M, to stimulate an immune response and high levels of neutralizing antibodies.\n\nProtein-based vaccines like Novavax’s work by getting the body’s immune system to recognize little modified pieces of the virus it’s targeting. In Novavax’s case, that means pieces of the coronavirus spike protein.\n\nWhen the genetic sequence for the virus that causes Covid-19 was published, scientists around the world quickly identified it as a coronavirus because of the “spike proteins” on its surface. These spikes form large protrusions, giving coronaviruses the appearance of wearing crowns, and “corona” is the Latin word for “crown.”\n\nNovavax scientists identified the gene for the spike protein and created a modified version of that gene. The researchers cloned the genes into a baculovirus that infects insects. They then infected moth cells – specifically, cells from the fall armyworm – prompting them to produce the coronavirus spike protein.\n\nThese virus-like nanoparticles were harvested to make Novavax’s vaccine.\n\n“The whole idea of the vaccine is to show the immune system something that looks, tastes and acts like a virus, with the exception that it doesn’t make you sick. So we made the spike protein. We put it in a particle – basically, like a soap bubble – and it’s the size of the virus,” Dr. Gregory Glenn, president of research and development for Novavax, told CNN last year.\n\n“It’s not infectious. We never touch the coronavirus itself,” Glenn added. “Then that is given to people, and they make an immune response that’s very much focused just on the spike – and I would say, the hallmark of our vaccine is, it gives a very strong immune response with very few side effects, and the dose is very small and the vaccine can be stored with normal refrigerated temperatures.”\n\nNovavax starts Phase 3 trial of Omicron-specific booster\n\nAs Novavax seeks emergency use authorization of its NVX-CoV2373 vaccine, it also is studying a separate vaccine that specifically targets the Omicron variant, called NVX-CoV2515. The company announced this week that it has started a Phase 3 trial of this vaccine, assessing its safety and efficacy as a booster shot.\n\n“The trial will also seek to determine the antibody responses to a bivalent vaccine, containing both NVX-CoV2373 and NVX-CoV2515, administered in participants who have received a booster series of an mRNA vaccine,” Novavax said in a news release.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nThe trial will analyze the Omicron-specific vaccine and a bivalent vaccine in more than 1,000 participants in Australia.\n\nTwo doses of either the Omicron-specific vaccine or the original NVX-CoV2373 vaccine will be given after three doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech and/or Moderna vaccines that were received at least three months before participants joined the trial.\n\nSimilarly, two doses of the Omicron-specific vaccine or the original NVX-CoV2373 will be given after two doses of either mRNA vaccines received at least six months before joining the trial.\n\nTwo doses of the bivalent vaccine will be administered in participants vaccinated with three doses of either mRNA vaccine at least three months before joining the trial.\n\nThe trial will last about 10 months, and initial results are expected in the second half of this year.", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard Nadia Kounang", "Jacqueline Howard", "Nadia Kounang"], "publish_date": "2022/06/03"}]}

It could have involved moving you to another seat to achieve proper center of gravity. Or bumping your baggage due to weight restrictions. Or maybe even bumping you. What you need to know is that under certain conditions, balancing a full aircraft presents operational challenges that can affect your flight.\n\nMore:Southwest Airlines under FAA investigation for aircraft weight, balance calculations\n\nA delicate balance\n\nDuring my airline career I was a loadmaster on cargo aircraft and later was involved in dispatching passenger flights. Both roles mandated that airplanes were safely loaded within maximum weight limits. Is it really a safety issue?\n\nMost definitely — an improperly loaded and/or overloaded airplane is a danger to everyone on board. Depending upon how deeply you care to dive into the whys, the FAA offers a comprehensive online \"Weight and Balance Handbook.\" But the takeaway is simple: “Because of abnormal stresses placed upon the structure of an improperly loaded aircraft, or because of changed flying characteristics of the aircraft, loss of life and destruction of valuable equipment may result.” Such errors have contributed to more than a few fatal airline accidents over time.\n\nThe challenge for airlines is to fill airplanes with as many passengers and as much baggage (and cargo) as possible, while not exceeding weight limits that can be affected by weather and takeoff restrictions such as short runways. And such conditions can require additional fuel, which means a higher takeoff weight, so that delicate balance can be elusive.\n\nBaggage is individually weighed at some airlines, but methodologies vary. Passenger weights are generally estimated and averaged; in addition, some carriers modify such averages seasonally to accommodate for heavier clothing by using “winter weights” in certain climates.\n\nWhat follows is a rundown of typical scenarios in which weight and balance requirements may affect your travel plans, along with advice on how to respond. It’s neither practical nor possible to compensate for such issues in all cases, but knowledge can help you make better decisions.\n\nSmaller aircraft\n\nTo underscore the severity, the National Transportation Safety Board reported that 136 general aviation accidents in nine years were due to improper or missing calculations. You’re more likely to encounter weight issues when flying on smaller airplanes, particularly codeshare regional flights.\n\nDelta’s Contract of Carriage states that among the conditions for which you will not be entitled to compensation if denied boarding is when a flight is operated by aircraft designed to hold 60 or fewer passengers, and Delta is unable to accommodate you “due to weight/balance restrictions when required by operational or safety reasons.” United’s Contract of Carriage and American’s Conditions of Carriage provide almost identical language, right down to 60-passenger capacity.\n\nIf you’re uncertain what size aircraft will operate your flight, check the site or travel agent before booking, then visit the airline’s fleet data. For example, Delta’s online “Our Aircraft” page specifies the Bombardier CRJ-200 is configured for 50 passengers. On some routes, you may be able to rebook to larger aircraft.\n\nBut a word of warning: Nearly every airline reserves the right to “swap” aircraft right up until departure time. So the aircraft type scheduled to operate a given flight may not necessarily be the aircraft assigned to that flight. Passenger rights in the U.S. are heavily restricted by such contracts.\n\nMore:Contracts of carriage: Deciphering murky airline rules\n\nNatural and structural restrictions\n\nAircraft engine performance can be negatively affected by high-altitude airports, high temperatures and high winds, so flight planning needs to account for such factors with additional fuel — which could mean fewer passengers and/or bags. Geography and infrastructure can affect takeoff weight in other ways; shorter runways can necessitate lighter loads, as can mountainous terrain or other obstructions that limit usable runway length. Keep in mind that some of the shortest runways are at two of the nation’s busiest airports, New York’s LaGuardia and Washington National, and subsequently those two facilities restrict larger widebody aircraft.\n\nTraveling with wheelchairs\n\nUnited’s contract specifically states the airline will refuse large wheelchairs or other assistive devices that would “cause a load imbalance in a small baggage compartment and violate weight and balance safety requirements.” That said, United says it will “use reasonable efforts” to “identify” a flight that can accommodate the wheelchair — but that’s no guarantee, particularly for such a vital accessory, so plan in advance.\n\nHelicopters/air taxis\n\nWeight and balance problems are particularly acute on helicopters and small aircraft used for sightseeing and island-hopping, particularly in leisure destinations such as Hawaii and the Caribbean. If you’re planning such trips, consider weather and other factors by contacting the operator the day before to ensure your flights are still scheduled.\n\nIt’s important to remember that even the most technologically sophisticated aircraft are still subject to the laws of physics, so modifications that may seem arbitrary can in fact be critical to your safety.\n\nBill McGee, a contributing editor to Consumer Reports and the former editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter, is an FAA-licensed aircraft dispatcher who worked in airline operations and management for several years.

The survey is both “essential to the safe and efficient operation of the aircraft” and required by the Civil Aviation Authority, the airline said in a media advisory.\n\n“We weigh everything that goes on the aircraft – from the cargo to the meals onboard, to the luggage in the hold,” Air New Zealand Load Control Improvement Specialist Alastair James said in the advisory. “For customers, crew and cabin bags, we use average weights, which we get from doing this survey.”\n\nCruising Altitude:Here's what United Airlines' former CEO told me about flying coach\n\n$250 for an airplane bed?Skynest will let economy passengers sleep\n\nThe airline previously weighed customers on its domestic network in 2021.

I was stuck in row 28, two rows from the back of the Boeing 737, thanks to a lowly C boarding pass. (Southwest doesn't assign seats. It assigns boarding positions in A, B and C groups, and passengers pick any open seat when they get on the plane.)\n\nThe secret to the quick exit: the back door. Southwest lets passengers exit – and enter – from the front and back of the plane at Sacramento International Airport.\n\nThe airline has tested dual boarding and deplaning in Sacramento and a couple of other cities on and off for the past few years to gauge how much faster it gets passengers on and off planes and reduces the turnaround time between flights.\n\nSouthwest's so-called turn times – a measure of the time from when the plane locks at the gate and leaves again – were as low as 10 minutes in the scrappy carrier's early days and have long been a financial boon and competitive advantage for Southwest.\n\nToday, they average 42 minutes. The airline's flights in Burbank and Long Beach, California, older airports where dual boarding and deplaning has long been the standard for airlines due to the airport facilities, have among the quickest turnaround times in the company.\n\n\"We're trying to see how much you can regularly get out of the turn by doing this,'' said Andrew Watterson, Southwest's executive vice president and chief revenue officer.\n\nSouthwest won't divulge time-saving specifics or other metrics from \"dual-door operations,'' as they are formally known, in Sacramento beyond saying it is quicker than traditional boarding and has been a success. It is now the norm at the airport, and passengers are disappointed when it's not offered due to high winds or heavy rain.\n\n\"If we get the kinks out ... you could see this consistently done in a large number of stations,'' Watterson said.\n\nExecutives say no decision is imminent on whether to expand dual boarding and deplaning to other airports without major weather issues or facility limitations. The airline is weighing costs, safety and customer satisfaction.\n\n\"It's just not as easy as pulling up another set of stairs (to the plane) and saying, \"Get off or get on,'' said Steve Goldberg, Southwest's senior vice president of operations and hospitality.\n\nGoldberg said the Sacramento experiment is just one piece of a puzzle Southwest is working on to make its operation more efficient as it approaches its 50th birthday in a couple of years.\n\n\"There are other opportunities within the turn we need to work on to gain the maximum potential,'' Goldberg said.\n\nIn October, the airline studied passenger behavior during boarding and deplaning on hundreds of flights in and out of Denver International Airport to see where and when bottlenecks occur. A company memo announcing the study cited the case of a passenger who gets out of his seat to retrieve something from the overhead bin, slowing or stopping boarding in the process. The airline has also been cracking down on passengers who bring more than one carry-on bag and one personal item.\n\nGoldberg suggested Southwest will begin to announce some changes in early 2020. One thing not on the table: assigned seats.\n\n\"We want to be bold,'' he said.\n\nUSA TODAY checked out dual boarding and deplaning in Sacramento and Long Beach in late October to see how it works and to gauge customer reaction.\n\nHere's how Southwest's dual boarding works\n\nBoarding for Southwest Airlines flight 6466 to Baltimore started with the usual routine.\n\nThe gate agent called for preboarders, followed by passengers in the front of the A boarding group, and scanned their boarding passes as they headed toward the jet bridge.\n\nAnd then things took a turn. Literally.\n\n\"We've opened up the door to the left here,'' the agent at Gate B17 announced. \"You're welcome to go outside to the left, to the rear of the aircraft to board it that way if you'd like. It does involve some stairs up and down.''\n\nTravelers suddenly had to do some quick calculus after their boarding pass was scanned: board the usual way or head outside in hopes of a shorter line and, possibly, a better seat.\n\n\"It's like you’re at the grocery store; which line should you go in?'' Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest to those boarding at the back: Please don't rush to the front\n\nSouthwest employees make one request of passengers heading outside, especially early in the boarding process.\n\n\"If you do go outside,'' the gate agent working the Baltimore flight said, \"please try not to run all the way to the front (of the plane). Kind of defeats the purpose.''\n\nHe issued another reminder a few minutes later.\n\nDuring dual boarding for a Sacramento to Phoenix flight, the gate agent asked passengers to \"please not rush the front.''\n\n\"It'll just slow the boarding process down,'' she said.\n\nSouthwest is taking these and other steps on flights with dual boarding to preserve what it calls its boarding integrity. With no assigned seats, passengers are fanatic about preserving their boarding position on the airline and have no patience for those who try to game the system.\n\nOne passenger who was notified their Sacramento flight would have dual boarding this summer immediately raised a flurry of concerns about it on Southwest's online community forum. The unnamed traveler usually purchases Southwest's EarlyBird Check-In, which automatically assigns travelers boarding positions ahead of the airline's normal 24-hour online check-in, giving them a better spot in line.\n\n\"Does this mean that purchasing EarlyBird will no longer provide a relatively good assurance of a great boarding position? Will I end up having to compete with folks running down the tarmac to dash up the rear-door stairs to beat me to 'the good seats'? How will Southwest manage its traditional boarding-position-based system, when two doors are used for boarding?\"\n\nIn addition to the announcements about not rushing to the front, Southwest deliberately waits to open the side door to the ramp until the first group of passengers is called to board.\n\nPassengers at the front of Southwest's boarding line earned priority boarding by buying the airline's priciest fare, through their loyalty to the airline or its credit card, or paid a fee to jump the line.\n\nFlight attendants don't police where passengers sit once they board, but the airline says most passengers boarding from the back settle into seats in the middle or back of the plane.\n\n\"They see that people are coming (from the front entrance), so they generally sit in the back,'' said Bob Churchill, Southwest's operations manager in Sacramento.\n\n'No wait if you go out the side door'\n\nSouthwest employees in Sacramento make repeated announcements about the dual boarding option as the B and C boarding groups are called.\n\n\"Folks, there's a slight wait in the jet bridge. No wait if you go out the side door.''\n\nThe number of passengers heading outside in Sacramento varies by flight, with between 25 to 30% of passengers selecting it on flights during our two-day visit. Passengers preboarding are not eligible, and those unable to handle stairs or lugging heavy bags or small children generally opt out.\n\nDual boarding is most beneficial to, and popular with, Southwest passengers holding B or C boarding passes since they are farther back in line, and seats and overhead bins in the front fill up first.\n\nCharlotte Lawrencewas holding boarding pass C12 on a flight to Nashville last week. It was the first time she'd seen dual boarding offered on Southwest, and she opted in.\n\nThere were two draws: \"To get outside and not have to sit in a middle seat, preferably.''\n\nSouthwest frequent flier Terry Hackelman can sit almost anywhere on the plane given his top-tier status in Southwest's frequent flyer program gives him an A boarding pass, but he selects outside boarding about half the time when its offered on his flights out of Sacramento.\n\nHow does he decide? He surveys the passengers in line ahead of him, including preboarders.\n\n\"Sometimes it just takes them longer to get situated,'' he said. \"You can quickly get to the back.''\n\nHackelman said he hopes Southwest expands dual boarding and deplaning to other airports. Watterson said it'll never be rolled out at every airport due to weather and facility limitations.\n\nKaren Meris had A24 on her boarding pass and still headed outside, with her 14-year-old son Quinn, for the novelty. The pair took a photo in front of the plane.\n\n\"I thought it would be a good opportunity for him to see something,’’ she said, adding that she probably wouldn't do it on her own because she felt safer boarding through the jet bridge.\n\nSelfie stations on the way?\n\nSouthwest has learned a lot during its study in Sacramento. One of the most interesting things: passengers love to take photos or videos on their way to and from the plane.\n\nSouthwest ramp agent Sam Lal says he's frequently asked to snap photos for passengers. He asks them to share the photos on Instagram.\n\n“We’ve had people turn around and do the presidential wave,'' Churchill said. \"It's pretty funny to watch.''\n\nIt's free marketing for Southwest, but snap-happy travelers can delay outside boarding and deplaning and create potential safety issues. The airline says it is considering a dedicated area for travelers to take photos. Call it a selfie station.\n\n\"Otherwise you hold up everybody,'' Watterson said.\n\nExiting from the back of the plane: 'It's a lot quicker'\n\nWith Southwest's lack of assigned seats, passengers in the back of the boarding line usually end up in the back of the plane unless someone saved them a seat or they plop down in an empty middle seat near the front. That makes for a long wait when the plane lands.\n\nWhen two doors are used for deplaning, the back of the plane suddenly turns into a sweet spot for passengers.\n\nSharon Navarro had to sit in the back on her flight to Sacramento because she was running late and missed the A boarding group. (She paid for EarlyBird Check-In.)\n\nShe didn't know Southwest offered dual deplaning in Sacramento. When the flight attendant announced passengers could get off at the rear of the plane, she just figured there was something wrong with the front door.\n\nShe loved it.\n\n\"It's a lot quicker, and I like being out on the tarmac.''\n\nSacramento travelers used to the rear exits immediately stand up and look back when their plane lands.\n\nHoustin Sarrels and his girlfriend, Haylee James, were up and ready for a quick exit when their flight from Long Beach landed last week.\n\nThe rear door never opened due to high winds.\n\n\"I thought they were going to open the back,'' Sarrels said as he sat back down and waited his turn to get off.\n\nIt took nearly 10 minutes.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2022/08/03/plane-seats-too-small-faa-begins-taking-public-comment-dimensions/10223532002/", "title": "Plane seats too small?

According to Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay, the Alice is just weeks away from its first flight.\n\nWith battery technology similar to that of an electric car or a cell phone and 30 minutes of charging, the nine-passenger Alice will be able to fly for one hour, and about 440 nautical miles. The plane has a max cruise speed of 250 kts, or 287 miles per hour. For reference, a Boeing 737 has a max cruise speed of 588 miles per hour. The company, focused exclusively on electric air travel, hopes that electric planes that can fit 20 to 40 passengers will be a reality in seven to 10 years.\n\nA prototype of the aircraft, which debuted in 2019, has been going through low-speed taxi tests since December and will attempt a high-speed taxi test in the next few weeks. In these tests, the aircraft is sent down the runway at different speeds to test its own power and allow ground teams to monitor systems like steering, braking and anti-skid. Though the company initially aimed for the Alice to take flight before 2022, poor weather conditions in the Pacific Northwest at the end of the year hindered testing.\n\nEviation has developed three versions of the prototype: a “commuter” variant, an executive version, and one specialized for cargo. The commuter configuration in testing holds nine passengers and two pilots, as well as 850 pounds of cargo. The executive design has six passenger seats for a more spacious flight, and the cargo plane holds 450 cubic feet of volume.\n\nAll of this is possible while reducing maintenance and operating costs of commercial jets by up to 70%, according to the company.\n\nThe electric aviation space is already growing more crowded with both startups and established aviation companies. NASA gave $253 million in September 2021 to GE Aviation and magniX to bring the technology to US fleets by 2035. Boeing is investing $450 million in Wisk Aero, a company building an all-electric, autonomous, passenger aircraft, and Airbus has been working on its own electric aviation endeavors since 2010.\n\nAccording to industry experts, the largest obstacle for electric aviation becoming the norm in passenger jets is the battery.\n\n“The stumbling block is the battery technology just like with cars, but more so in airplanes. This is because with airplanes, the concern is the weight,” said Ross Aimer, CEO of Aero Consulting Experts. “As soon as we have better battery technology, which I suspect will be in two or three years, that’s when all these electric airplanes will eventually come.”\n\nTwelve Alices are on order by international shipping company DHL, anticipated to be delivered in 2024. These planes, out of DHL Express’s global fleet of more than 280 aircraft, are set to be used as cargo carriers making shorter distance trips. “Our aspiration is to make a substantial contribution in reducing our carbon footprint, and these advancements in fleet and technology will go a long way in achieving further carbon reductions,” said Mike Parra, CEO of DHL Express America, in an interview with CNN Business.\n\nEviation has announced purchases of its proposed fleet by DHL and commuter airline CapeAir and says there are several more to be announced once Alice’s first flight occurs. CapeAir’s proposed fleet of Alices are expected to enter service in 2023 on routes connecting Boston, Martha’s Vineyard, Nantucket and Hyannis.\n\nWhile we seem to be getting closer to battery-powered air travel for some functions, not everything is nearly ready to go. Cross-ocean flights and jumbo jets are still years beyond the current science, for one. But the most pressing concern for electric aviation is regulation. The FAA has yet to put forward any clear guidelines or regulatory framework for electric airplanes, which fall under the category of Advanced Air Mobility, though Eviation says its is actively working with the FAA to achieve certification for production by 2024. “Some certifications could require the FAA to issue special conditions or additional airworthiness criteria, depending on the type of project. Determining qualifications for these aircraft is an ongoing process,” according to an FAA spokesperson.\n\nElectric aviation proponents predict Alice and electric planes like it becoming as commonplace as any other means of transportation. “It really integrates aviation into the fabric of transportation, of our commuter life. It does so while being sustainable, and through being economically viable,” said Bar-Yohay. “Once we start seeing planes like this, the entire way we look at where we live, how we commute, how we go on vacation, will change. It will be a high-speed train without the rail.”\n\nBut electric aircraft big enough to rival large passenger jets may still be a ways off.\n\n“The first step would be to try these in a commuter market or charter market,” said Aimer. “Then eventually, if that works well, you’re going to have passenger jets. For that we need Boeing or Airbus to come out with a actual electric airplane. I would see that in about 10 years.”", "authors": ["Jennifer Korn"], "publish_date": "2022/01/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/lifestages/2018/03/02/what-every-first-time-flyer-needs-to-know/110871774/", "title": "7 Must-Know Tips for First-Time Flyers - NerdWallet", "text": "Claire Tsosie\n\nNerdWallet.com\n\nFlying on an airplane for the first time — or the first time in a long while — can be an exciting, life-changing adventure. But it can also be incredibly stressful.\n\nYou want to head for the gate with the swagger of a seasoned traveler, but that’s hard to pull off when you don’t know how much it costs to check a bag, or what to expect when you go through airport security.\n\nSo how can you deal? Reviewing these steps before takeoff can boost your confidence, making your trip easier and more worry-free.\n\nHow much you can pack and how much it will cost\n\nIt’s easy to overpack — but if you do, it could cost you. Before your flight, visit your airline’s website to review luggage size and weight restrictions, as well as baggage fees. While these vary by airline and fare paid, here’s what you can typically bring with a standard fare on a major airline:\n\nTwo carry-on items for free: one full-size carry-on the size of a small rolling suitcase or smaller, and one small personal item, such as a purse or backpack\n\nOne checked suitcase (often, one weighing under 50 pounds) for $25 to $30; checking additional bags could cost more\n\nIf your carry-on bag is too bulky, you may have to pay to check it. Likewise, if your checked bag is over a certain size, you may have to pay a higher-than-usual fee to check it. It’s best to avoid these surprises, if possible.\n\n“If you’re a nervous flyer, little things can really set you off,” says Jackie Sills-Dellegrazie of New York City, founder of the travel blog The Globetrotting Teacher. “Even if it’s not a big deal, and you get to the check-in counter, and they say, ‘Oh, by the way, there’s a $30 bag fee,’ and you weren’t expecting that, that could just be something that rattles you.”\n\nRemember, if you pack light enough, you could avoid baggage fees altogether.\n\nHaving an airline credit card can mean waived checked baggage fees, as well.\n\nWhat you should put in a carry-on\n\nIf you’re packing anything that’s hard to replace — say, prescription medicine, contacts or glasses, or important paperwork — put it in your carry-on bag. This way, you won’t be without that item in the rare event your checked bag goes missing. You’ll also want to pack some in-flight entertainment, such as your laptop, headphones and a book or magazine.\n\nJust make sure you’re following the Transportation Security Administration’s rules for what you can pack. You can’t, for example, bring a big bottle of contact lens solution in your carry-on, but you can bring a 3.4-ounce bottle. And keep in mind that if your carry-on bag is too big to fit under the seat in front of you, you may have to check it. More rules may apply if you’re flying internationally.\n\n“The overhead compartments fill up quickly,” says Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com, an online travel agency based in Calabasas, California. “If you’re in the back of the plane, you might find that there’s no more room, and you’ll have to do a gate check of your bag at the last minute, which isn’t particularly fun.” Checking your bag at the gate means your full-sized carry-on bag will travel with the other checked bags during the flight, rather than in the overhead bin.\n\nWhat time to get to the airport\n\nCatching a plane isn’t like catching a bus; it’s a much longer process. In fact, the TSA recommends showing up at least two hours before takeoff for domestic travel, and three hours for international travel.\n\nUltimately, you need to give yourself enough time to get your boarding pass, check your bags and go through security before your plane starts boarding. Sometimes, that takes 10 minutes. Other times, especially during peak travel times, it can take much longer.\n\nIt’s worth keeping in mind that boarding the plane isn’t a free-for-all, either. Airlines typically start boarding passengers 30 minutes before takeoff in groups. Generally, a boarding time will be printed on your ticket.\n\nWhen to have your ID ready\n\nDecades ago, airport security was relatively lax. “There was one point where you could just walk up to a gate, whether you were flying or not, whether you had ID or not,” Klee says. Nowadays, TSA agents check IDs for passengers over 18.\n\nSave time by having your ID card, driver’s license or passport handy as soon as you step foot into the airport. You’ll need it when checking bags and going through security, and you don’t want to hold up the line while rummaging through your wallet.\n\nWhat to expect when going through security\n\nGoing through airport security might be the most stressful part of flying — but if you know what to expect, the whole rigmarole can feel much less taxing. Typically, unless you have TSA PreCheck or Global Entry, you have to:\n\nRemove your shoes (unless you’re 12 and under or 75 and older)\n\nEmpty the contents of your pockets and remove your hat, belt, jacket, wallet and bulky jewelry\n\nRemove your laptop and liquids from your bag\n\nSend these items — and your carry-on bag — through an X-ray machine\n\nWalk through a metal detector or a body scanner (or opt for a pat-down)\n\nPreparing for this — say, by wearing shoes you can easily slip on and off and making sure the items in your carry-on are TSA-compliant — can make the process faster.\n\nHow to be considerate during a flight\n\nThese days, flights are generally fully booked, and most seats offer limited legroom. This might stress out your fellow flyers, so be sensitive.\n\n“If any of your stuff or body parts are going into another space that’s not yours, you really have to be mindful of that,” Sills-Dellegrazie says. “It can be as simple as, you put your ponytail over the top of the seat and now it’s hanging … across someone’s TV screen, and you don’t even realize it.”\n\nSimilarly, if you wear perfume or cologne, eat smelly foods or listen to loud music, you might unintentionally upset the person sitting next to you. Of course, you can’t plan for everything — maybe you’re traveling with an upset child, for example — but do what you can to avoid an in-flight faux pas.\n\nWhat to do if you miss a flight\n\nNow for a game of “worst-case scenario,” first-time flyer edition: What happens if you miss your flight?\n\nFirst, take a deep breath. If you miss your plane because of unforeseen circumstances, such as a major traffic delay, the airline will often put you on standby for the next flight without charging extra. Just remember that you generally need to notify the airline within a couple of hours of missing your flight to get rebooked for free.\n\nIf it looks like you’ll miss a connecting flight, check the smartphone app offered by your airline or the screen in the airport to find out which gate your flight departs from, and whether you’ve actually missed it. If the flight is delayed, you may still have a chance to board. But if you miss the connection and the airline was responsible, you can generally also rebook that flight free of charge — and maybe even get some free meal or hotel vouchers for the hassle.\n\nThe key in both cases: Be proactive. Have the airline’s customer service phone number handy in case you get stuck in traffic, so you can call as soon as possible. Or if you’re already at the airport, go to the customer service desk and asking about rebooking. Missing a flight can be a setback, but it doesn’t have to derail your travel plans.\n\nMore From NerdWallet\n\nClaire Tsosie is a writer at NerdWallet. Email: claire@nerdwallet.com.

Here's a guide to all the rules", "text": "Updated federal rules for flying with service animals took effect in January 2021 and the changes have caused confusion for travelers and airlines. In some cases, people's service dogs were denied boarding.\n\nTwo women told The Arizona Republic that Allegiant Air wrongfully denied their service dogs. One of them had been unaware prior to her flight that the rules had changed.\n\nIn December 2020, the U.S. Department of Transportation revised the Air Carrier Access Act. The DOT issued a final ruling that outlines how airlines must accommodate passengers traveling with service animals. The changes included:\n\nNo longer allowing emotional support animals as service animals.\n\nNarrowing the definition of a service animal to only include dogs.\n\nRequiring airlines to treat psychiatric service animals the same as other service animals without additional documentation.\n\nAllowing airlines to require passengers to submit paperwork before boarding with their service dog.\n\nThe full 122-page document can be found at https://www.transportation.gov.\n\nIf you travel with a service dog, here's what you should know before booking a flight.\n\nExclusive:NewThese women's service dogs were denied boarding under the new rules\n\nWhat are the new rules for flying with service dogs?\n\nAmong the changes that took effect on Jan. 11, 2021, are:\n\nAirlines can require a traveler with a service dog to complete a DOT Service Animal Air Transportation Form and a Service Animal Relief Attestation Form at least 48 hours prior to departure.\n\nAirlines are no longer required to recognize non-task-trained animals such as emotional support animals, comfort animals and service animals in training as service animals.\n\nAirlines can limit passengers to two task-trained service animals per person.\n\nMiniature horses, cats, rabbits and other animals are no longer considered service animals.\n\nAirlines cannot require passengers with psychiatric service animals to provide a letter from a licensed mental health professional.\n\nPassengers traveling with service animals cannot be required to physically check in at the airport.\n\nService animals can be required to fit within the handler’s foot space on the plane.\n\nWhat is a service animal?\n\nAccording to the DOT, “A service animal is a dog, regardless of breed or type, that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of a qualified individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual or other mental disability.”\n\nAirlines “are prohibited from refusing to transport a service animal based solely on breed or generalized physical type, as distinct from an individualized assessment of the animal’s behavior and health,” the final rule states.\n\nService dogs, according to the DOT, do not run around freely, bark or growl repeatedly, injure people or urinate or defecate outside of allowed areas.\n\nA trained service animal will remain under the control of its handler,” the final rule reads. “An animal that engages in such disruptive behavior demonstrates that it has not been successfully trained to behave properly in a public setting and carriers are not required to treat it as a service animal without a carrier in the cabin, even if the animal performs an assistive function for a passenger with a disability.”\n\nCan you fly with emotional support dogs?\n\nThe DOT’s final rule “excludes all non-task-trained animals, such as emotional support animals, comfort animals and service animals in training.”\n\nHowever, airlines are allowed, at their discretion, to transport emotional support animals without extra charge. Many airlines, such as United Airlines and American Airlines, treat emotional support animals the same as other pets, which are usually required to be confined to their carriers and incur extra fees.\n\nIntroducing TSA Cares:The program for travelers who need extra help at airports\n\nWhat do I need for my service dog to fly?\n\nThere are two forms that airlines can require of passengers with service animals. These are the DOT's Service Animal Air Transportation Form and Service Animal Relief Attestation Form.\n\nCarriers can choose to not require any forms from these travelers.\n\nThe Service Animal Air Transportation Form is intended to \"allow airlines to receive direct assurances from service animal users of their animal’s good behavior and training,\" according to the DOT's final rule. It educates passengers on how their service dog is expected to behave and potentially deters \"individuals who might otherwise seek to claim falsely that their pets are service animals.\"\n\nFlights that are eight hours or longer can require a Relief Attestation Form, which confirms that the service dog “can relieve itself on the aircraft without creating a health/sanitation issue.”\n\nAirlines can require that these forms be submitted at least 48 hours in advance of departure, and most have adopted this rule. If a last-minute flight is booked, the traveler can submit the forms at the airport. One form covers all segments of a round-trip flight.\n\nThe DOT’s final rule reads: “If a passenger’s reservation was made less than 48 hours in advance of the first originally scheduled departure time on the passenger’s itinerary, you may not require that passenger provide advance notice of his or her intent to travel with a service animal. You may require that the passenger complete the forms … and submit a copy of the form to you at the passenger’s departure gate on the date of travel.”\n\nIt is a federal crime to give false information on the forms. If an airline suspects fraud, it can notify the Office of Aviation Consumer Protection, which may refer reports to the Office of the Inspector General for investigation and prosecution.\n\nThe forms can be found at https://www.transportation.gov.\n\nCan you list yourself as your service animal’s trainer on the DOT form?\n\nYes. On the Service Animal Air Transportation Form, service dog users are asked to fill in the name of the animal trainer or training organization and the trainer's phone number. If you task-trained your dog yourself, you are permitted to write your own name.\n\nAccording to the final rule, “service animal users are free to train their own dogs to perform a task or function for them.”\n\n“While DOT provides space on its form for a service animal handler to state the organization or individual that trained the service animal to do work or perform tasks to assist the handler, DOT does not require that individuals with disabilities have their animal trained or evaluated by an accredited organization as a condition of transport,” the final rule reads.\n\nExtra resources:Need a little extra help navigating the airport? Here's how to let staff, TSA know\n\nDoes your service dog need certification to fly?\n\nNo. Your service dog does not need to be task-trained by an accredited dog-training organization.\n\nHowever, a service dog must be “both trained to perform a task or function for the passenger with a disability” and “trained to behave in public.”\n\nDoes a service dog need to wear a vest or other identifier?\n\nService dogs are not required to wear anything that identifies them as a working dog. However, service dogs must be harnessed, leashed or otherwise tethered at all times, whether in the airport or on an aircraft.\n\nAirline employees are allowed to ask “whether the animal is required to accompany the passenger because of a disability and what work or task the animal has been trained to perform,” observe its behavior and look for physical indicators such as harnesses and vests in order to verify a dog is a service animal.\n\nAccording to the final rule, air carriers “are free to view such paraphernalia as evidence that an animal is a service animal; conversely, they are also free to give the presence or lack of presence of such paraphernalia little weight.”\n\nHow many service dogs can you bring on a flight?\n\nAirlines are not required to accept more than two service animals per passenger.\n\nTips for flying with your service dog\n\nArrive as early as possible. For example, Allegiant Air recommends arriving at least two hours before your departure time.\n\nSubmit your DOT form as early as possible. A representative for the airline may ask you for more information about your service dog, such as the tasks it performs. It’s not uncommon for passengers to receive denial letters, and you will need time to resolve the issue before your departure.\n\nAlert the airline that you have a service dog. While booking a flight, look for a way to indicate that you have a service dog. For example, on Allegiant’s website, this can be done by clicking on “special assistance.”\n\nMake sure your dog is up to date on vaccinations. The Service Animal Air Transportation Form has a section attesting to the dog's health, including the date of your dog's last rabies vaccination and the expiration date.\n\nYour dog doesn't have to be small to fly. If your service dog does not fit in the space under the seat in front of you, don't fret.\n\nAccording to the final rule, \"The Department further emphasizes that larger service animals are not automatically prohibited from an aircraft if they do not fit in their handler’s foot space. The final rule continues to require carriers to accommodate such animals by moving them to another seat location within the same class of service where the animal can be accommodated, if available, such as a seat next to an empty seat on the aircraft, if available.\"\n\nYou can purchase a seat for your dog to ensure that it has sufficient space.\n\nWhy did the DOT change its service animal rules?\n\nThe changes were prompted in part by inconsistent definitions among federal agencies on what constitutes a service animal and an increase of travelers fraudulently claiming their pets were service animals.\n\n“It is reasonable to predict that the Department’s definition will result in an overall reduction in the number of uncrated animals onboard aircraft, thereby reducing the overall number of animal misbehavior incidents (and the overall number of potential allergic reactions) onboard aircraft,” the final rule reads.\n\nThe final rule more closely aligns the DOT’s definition of a service animal with the Department of Justice’s definition under the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nAccording to the final rule, the Service Animal Air Transportation Form “would have the potential to serve as a deterrent for individuals who might otherwise seek to claim falsely that their pets are service animals, as those individuals may be less likely to falsify a federal form and thus risk the potential for criminal prosecution.”\n\nThe two DOT forms are also intended to help service animal handlers as they “will no longer have to navigate different forms propounded by different airlines.”\n\nHow to find an airline’s pet and service animal policies\n\nHere are the links for some of the air carriers that fly out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport:\n\nAlaska Airlines: https://www.alaskaair.com.\n\nhttps://www.alaskaair.com. Allegiant Air: https://www.allegiantair.com.\n\nhttps://www.allegiantair.com. American Airlines: https://www.aa.com.\n\nhttps://www.aa.com. Delta Air Lines: https://www.delta.com.\n\nhttps://www.delta.com. Southwest Airlines: https://www.southwest.com.\n\nhttps://www.southwest.com. United Airlines: https://www.united.com.\n\nCan an airline deny boarding to your service dog?\n\nYes. The DOT allows airlines to refuse service dogs under certain circumstances. These include if the traveler does not provide any required DOT service animal forms.\n\nHowever, if you book your flight less than 48 hours before departure, the airline “must still provide the accommodation if you can do so by making reasonable efforts, without delaying the flight.”\n\nAirline personnel can “make an individualized assessment based on reasonable judgement and objective evidence” and deny a service dog if it causes a “significant disruption in the aircraft or at the airport” or poses a direct threat to people’s health or safety.\n\nAirlines “must not deny transportation to the service animal if there are means available short of refusal that would mitigate the problem (e.g., muzzling a barking service dog or taking other steps to comply with animal health regulations needed to permit entry of the service animal into a domestic territory or a foreign country),” according to the final rule.\n\nAlso, “The final rule allows airlines to preclude transport of a service animal if doing so would violate applicable safety, health or other regulations of a U.S. federal agency, a U.S. territory or a foreign government.”\n\nWhat can you do if an airline denies your service dog?\n\nTravelers who experience disability-related problems can call the DOT's toll-free hotline at 800-778-4838 or 800-455-9880 (TTY). The hotline can provide general information about your rights and assist with time-sensitive, disability-related issues from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern time on weekdays, with the exception of federal holidays.\n\n“If you encounter a disability-related issue about an airline accommodation or service, ask to speak to the airline’s Complaint Resolution Official. A CRO is the airline’s expert in disability related issues in air travel and has the authority to resolve complaints on behalf of the airline,” the DOT’s page for air travel complaints reads.\n\nA spokesperson for the DOT told The Republic, “If a consumer believes that an airline has discriminated against him or her on the basis of his or her disability, which includes not providing required accommodations, the consumer can quickly and easily file a complaint with the Department’s Office of Aviation Consumer Protection through its online complaint form.”\n\nThe complaint will be forwarded to the airline for response, at which point an analyst at the DOT will review both statements and determine whether the airline violated the traveler's rights. A DOT attorney will then review the case, and an analysis of their findings will be mailed to the complainant.\n\nFor more information, go to https://www.transportation.gov.\n\nIf an airline denies transportation to a service animal, it is required to provide a written statement of the reason for refusal.\n\nAccording to the final rule, “This statement must include the specific basis for the carrier’s opinion that the refusal meets the (DOT’s) standards.” The airline should provide this written explanation either at the airport or within 10 days of refusal.\n\nAccording to the DOT's website, \"You may be able to seek recourse through small claims court.\" A separate page explains that \"You may file a complaint in small claims court when you can show that a person or a business owes you money or has harmed you financially and will not pay.\"\n\nCorey Lovato, a staff attorney at the Arizona Center for Disability Law, told The Arizona Republic that options for recovery are limited because the ACAA “does not allow for, essentially, a person to file a lawsuit against the airline.”\n\n“All they can do is file a complaint with the Department Transportation that they may or may not investigate, and if they don't (investigate), (the person’s) only remedy is to file a lawsuit against the Department of Transportation,” he said.\n\nReach the reporter at kimi.robinson@gannett.com.

Masks are required (over your mouth and nose) throughout the trip, from Uber rides to airport car rental shuttles. Expect to be bombarded with nonstop mask reminders, starting with online check in for your flight and continuing throughout the airport and on the plane. Airlines are monitoring mask usage during flights, allowing them to be removed only briefly while eating or drinking. And they are banning people who won't wear them from flying during the pandemic. Delta Air Lines has placed nearly 700 people on its list.\n\nEtiquette experts weigh in: What to do if your seatmate won't mask up\n\n2. Some airlines and airports are doling out sanitizing wipes, but bring your own for added protection. Airlines have touted their pandemic cleaning and safety protocols for months, but travelers who want to wipe down their own tray tables, seats, arm rests and other surfaces and regularly sanitize their hands should stash some wipes and sanitizer in a carry-on. Note that the Transportation Security Administration's liquid limits don't apply to hand sanitizer during the pandemic, so you can can bring more than a travel-size bottle. The limit is 12 ounces.\n\n3. U.S. airlines aren't requiring COVID-19 test results to fly but will ask you some health questions during online check-in or at an airport kiosk. The questions vary by airline, but in general they ask you to acknowledge or pledge that you haven't had a recent COVID-19 diagnosis or exposure and don't have symptoms. Frontier Airlines takes the added step of passenger temperature screening during boarding. Don't make the mistake of thinking no one will find out if you tested positive recently. A Hawaii couple was arrested for knowingly boarding a United flight after testing positive, and Maryland police stopped a mother and her COVID-19-positive son from boarding a flight after being alerted by local health authorities. Local and state public health officials who become aware of a person with a known or suspected to have a contagious disease can report the person to CDC, agency spokeswoman Belsie González said. That might land you on the Public Health Do Not Board list, which means airlines won't issue you a boarding pass. The list is enforced by the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nCDC advice: Don't travel for holidays but if you do get a COVID-19 test before and after.\n\nCOVID travel tests: 8 Do's and Don'ts\n\n4. You will likely be thisclose to other passengers at the airport and on the plane. Planes that were largely empty in the spring are slowly filling up as travel demand rebounds, even with COVID-19 cases surging and CDC recommendations not to travel. Airlines set pandemic passenger records during the Thanksgiving travel rush, and photos of crowded airports across the country freaked out people who haven't been to an airport since the pandemic began.\n\nMost airports and airlines have stickers on the floor and every other chair in the gate area to spread people out, but that's not always an option, especially during peak times.\n\nOn the plane, you're likely to have seatmates. Airlines blocked seats for a while in the name of social distancing (United execs called it a PR stunt), but all but Delta have abandoned the practice or will soon.\n\nSome airlines will let you know if your flight is going to be full and will give you rebooking options. United Airlines alerted me about a potentially full flight in November via its mobile app, and Alaska Airlines announced in the gate area before boarding that a few passengers might be seated next to someone not in their traveling party. It called those passengers to the podium and said they could rebook on another flight if they were uncomfortable.\n\nSouthwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly said recently that few passengers have taken the airline up on moving to a less-full flight.\n\nBye empty middle seat: Southwest to start filling planes in December\n\nMore room: Delta says it will block middle seats through March\n\n5. Boarding is different as airlines aim to reduce crowds, but bottlenecks aren't avoidable. Southwest is boarding in groups of 10 passengers instead of 30 and encouraging everyone else to stay seated until their group is called. (It doesn't always work.) Delta, United, JetBlue, Hawaiian and others are boarding passengers from the back of the plane to the front of the plane (after first class, of course) so travelers have to pass fewer passengers. Habits are hard to break though, and passengers tend to still crowd the gate areas.\n\n6. In-flight food and drink service is lacking. Airlines are keeping service at a minimum to reduce contact between flight attendants and passengers and to prevent passengers from keeping their masks off for long periods of time. Some major airlines are serving soft drinks and coffee again, but others are still just handing out water. Snack offerings are minimal and buy-on-board food hasn't resumed on most airlines. Eat before your flight or bring your own food on board, especially for long flights.\n\nFancy an alcoholic beverage to toast your vacation? Forget about it in regular economy unless you’re flying discounters Spirit or Allegiant, which are still selling alcohol. And don't think about sneaking your own on.\n\nUnited Airlines resumed the sale of food and beer and wine on some flights out of Denver as a pandemic test, but the plan has been criticized by flight attendants worried passengers will keep masks off too long. The airline said it will limit passengers to one beer or wine during each beverage-cart service.\n\n7. Airport dining and drinking options are limited, too, leading to lines or longer-than-usual waits. Many airport restaurants, shops and bars remain closed or have reduced their hours. Airports have added signs on what's open and where. Places that are open have fewer seats and tables in a bid to promote social distancing. Want Starbucks, a meal or a cocktail before your flight? Arrive at the airport earlier than normal and be prepared to traverse terminals in some cases.\n\n8. Deplaning is (mostly) still a mess. When a flight lands these days, flight attendants on several airlines now ask passengers to avoid clogging the aisles, with some even calling groups of rows to depart and telling other passengers to stay seated. Occasionally it goes off flawlessly, but more often than not, passengers jump up to retrieve their bags as soon as the plane parks at the gate\n\n9. Clueless passenger behaviors continue. Anyone who's flown this year knows some things never change. Travelers still watch videos and movies without headphones (we're not just talking about kids), take off their shoes during the flight and jump the line like a VIP when getting off the plane.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/12/18"}]}

But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers.

The latest news is at the top.\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough and breathing trouble. Most develop only mild symptoms. But some people, usually those with other medical complications, develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, which can be fatal.\n\nTuesday, July 21, 2020\n\nDespite the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial outlook for the Burlington International Airport is stable, the airport announced Tuesday.\n\nMoody's Investors Service affirmed the airport's Baa2 credit rating with the stable outlook earlier this month. The rating, according to Moody's, means the airport's obligations are medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk, but that it has a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.\n\n________________\n\nProperty taxes for Williston residents will be a bit higher than expected this year due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic delayed construction in the town, which impacted property values, the town stated in a news release. As a result, grand list increases were less than initially estimated.\n\nThe new rate is set to $0.2750, meaning that for every $100,000 in property value, municipal taxes will be $275, the town said. The deadline for the first property tax payment has been postponed from Aug. 15 until Sept 15. The other two deadlines will remain the same.\n\n________________\n\nMonday, July 20, 2020\n\nThree full-time staff were laid off at Colchester Parks and Recreation due to diminished demand for camps and recreation programs during the pandemic, Town Manager Aaron Frank announced last week.\n\n\"Please do what you can to help towards positive changes in COVID outcomes that will allow us to bring back these valuable programs and staff that help make Colchester a great place to live, work and play,\" Frank wrote in a newsletter.\n\nOn a more upbeat note, the town announced that rehabilitation work on the Colchester Causeway is moving along ahead of schedule.

Scott's Friday news conference include the following:\n\nVermont's Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine gave an update on the Manchester situation (with 59 people who had positive antigen tests): 17 had PCR tests, \"which is recommended to confirm the positive antigen result.\" Of this group, two tested positive .\n\nSchool re-openings: Scott said he expects Vermont will use a hybrid model featuring remote and in-person learning. Dr. William Raszka with the UVM Health Network noted children seem less likely to transmit the virus that causes COVID-19. State Epidemiologist Dr. Patsy Kelso named strategies like: daily screenings; testing symptomatic people; contact tracing; using physical distancing and facial coverings.\n\n\n\n___________\n\nThe Fletcher Free Library announced updated services in a July 16 news release.\n\nThese include allowing scheduled computer time, \"brief visits to collect materials and receive library support\" and outdoor seating (\"when staffing allows\").\n\nThe library has a Kids' Open Air Hours service that will allow youth to pick and chat about books.\n\n\"Weather permitting, the FFL Youth Department will staff a table on the library lawn in front of the historic Carnegie building at 235 College Street on Saturdays from 10:30 am to 12:30 pm and Wednesdays from 1 to 3 pm,\" the news release stated. \"FFL requests that participants wear masks and maintain social distance.\"\n\nThe library also has mystery bags with youth books.\n\n\"The bags are available at Open Air Hours and at the front desk and the list of themes is on the Kids’ webpage at fletcherfree.org,\" the news release stated. \"There is no bag limit.\"\n\n___________\n\nThursday, July 16, 2020\n\nNine new cases of COVID-19 were reported to the Health Department.

Imposter fraud has been on the rise across the country, according to the labor department.\n\n\"Individuals may ask the Department’s call center representative to provide further information to identify themselves, or if they do not feel comfortable providing information to the representative, the claimant can call the trusted Claimant Assistance Line at 877-214-3332 and select ‘Identity Confirmation’ from the menu options to connect with a call center representative,\" the release states.\n\nThose who do not validate their identity when contacted may see a delay in payments.\n\n__________\n\nThe Burlington city building at 625 Pine St. is open for limited, in-person services.\n\nBurlington residents can do business with Public Works, Permitting & Inspections and Parks, Recreation & Waterfront Tuesday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nVisitors are required to wear masks, not to exceed four customers in the lobby and sign a log book.\n\n\"While the City still encourages the public to conduct as much business over the phone or internet as possible in the interest of public health, we also recognize the value of serving the public directly,\" the news release says.\n\nHow to contact (online, email and phone):\n\n__________\n\nTuesday, July 14, 2020\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that Vermont's Health Care Provider Stabilization Grant Program will launch on Friday, July 17. The program utilizes up to $275 million from the federal Coronavirus Relief Fund to provide direct cash grants to eligible health care and human service providers who have lost revenue or incurred increased expenses because of the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe Agency of Human Services and the Department of Vermont Health Access will host a webinar on Monday, July 20, to explain the grant application process, eligibility requirements and the documents providers should plan to submit when applying for a grant.

Eight hospitalizations are under investigation. Deaths remain at 56.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,099 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease, with a total of 77,624 people have been tested.\n\n_________\n\nA preliminary outbreak of COVID-19 cases in Windham County was announced by state officials Tuesday during Gov. Phil Scott's weekly news conference.\n\nOver 30 \"presumptively positive\" cases have been reported by Manchester Medical Center, said Health Commissioner Mark Levine, after the center's urgent care conducted a series of antigen tests to regional residents.\n\nThose that test positive on antigen tests, which differ from PCR tests, are \"not considered to be a lab-confirmed test\" said Levine. Antigen tests tend to not be included in Vermont's number of cases, and those that were either confirmed positive or \"false negatives\" would need to be tested by the Health Department.\n\nLevine stated that the Health Department has already set up a pop-up site in Londonderry for July 15, and he encouraged those that tested positive, as well as others in the region to attend it.\n\nIn regards to the outbreak, Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services, cautioned Vermonters against failing to quarantine after traveling to \"hotspots\" outside of the state's designated safe areas. He further went on to recommend residents should not attend social events or gatherings following those trips where they know they are \"bound to have close contacts\" with other people.\n\n\"It is a pattern that I'm starting to get a little concerned about,\" said Smith.\n\n\"We all need to do our part. Risky behavior can lead to outbreaks.\"\n\nBoth Levine and Smith were hesitant to call it \"the Manchester outbreak\", citing that where people were getting tested did not reflect where they had contracted the virus.\n\n_________\n\nGov. Phil Scott announced Tuesday that he would be extending Vermont's state of emergency through August 15. The action will not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but will provide a mechanism through which the administration can update guidelines as necessary.\n\n_________\n\nTwo statewide grant programs — aimed at providing relief to Vermont's dairy industry and health care system — were announced Tuesday.\n\nThe Vermont COVID-19 Agriculture Assistance Program will be offering a total of $25 million in federal funding to dairy producer and processors stating Friday, July 17.\n\nThose eligible include dairy farmers and processors who were operating as of March 1 and were subsequently impacted by the pandemic, either through income loss, additional expenses or market disruption of dairy prices.\n\nAn estimated 25 Vermont dairies have closed operations since March 1, according to Anson Tebbetts, secretary of the sate's Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, during the governor's news conference. Prior to the pandemic, the state saw a loss of 1.5 farms per month.\n\n\"This has been a direct result of what happened when the markets went away for our dairy farmers,\" Tebbetts said.\n\nApplications are available via the Agency's website, and must be completed by Oct. 1.\n\n--------------\n\nThe Health Care Stabilization Grant Program is additionally set to launch this Friday, intended to give $275 million of financial assistance to Vermont health care providers.\n\nApplications must be completed by August 15, and will be evaluated and distributed based on \"demonstrated need\", as opposed to a first come, first serve basis.\n\nThe program is intended to cover a wide variety of providers, organizations and small-scale practices including health centers, dentists, mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, physical therapists, and emergency medical service providers.\n\n\"We want to continue to meet the needs of providers during and after this time of crisis,\" said Mike Smith, secretary of the state's Agency of Human Services. \"If providers are not certain if they are eligible, we want them to apply anyway.\"\n\nCash grants for the first round of this program will cover expenses between March 1 and June 15. The second round is expected to launch in October, and will cover between June 16 to Sept. 30.\n\n_________\n\nBurlington School District will host a series of town hall meetings this week, inviting community members to learn about and participate in the district's plans to reopen schools this fall.\n\nThe meetings will be conducted virtually via Zoom and split between two days to allow both families and staff the opportunity to ask questions and hear from school administrators about the reopening.\n\nThe town hall meeting for families will meet 7 p.m. on July 15, whereas a meeting for staff will be conducted the following day, at 7 p.m. on July 16.\n\n“This is a key moment in our planning process,\" said Tom Flanagan, the new superintendent for Burlington School District when began his tenure on July 1st.\n\n\"We need to hear from the community in order to finalize our plans and inform our families so they can start planning their lives.\"\n\nFor more information, those interested can visit the district's website via this link. The meeting will also be aired live through the district's YouTube and Facebook pages. Interpreters will be available to translate the meeting.\n\nMonday, July 13, 2020\n\nSix new cases of COVID-19 were reported Monday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,301.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day. Eight hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,096 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n76,581 people have been tested for the virus.\n\nNOTE: The Free Press noticed the numbers regarding new and total case counts didn't align from July 11 to July 13 and subsequently reached out to the Health Department. Ben Truman with the department said in an email that this is why there is a notice that this data is preliminary. He provided an example: A person who tested positive might no longer get counted if it is learned that they don't live in Vermont.\n\n_________\n\nSunday, July 12, 2020\n\nFourteen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,296.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same number as the previous day. Fifteen hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,089 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n75,851 people have been tested for the virus.\n\n__________\n\nSaturday, July 11, 2020\n\nSix new cases of COVID-19 were reported Saturday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,283.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — the same as yesterday. Sixteen hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,066 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n75,032 people have been tested for the virus.\n\nFriday, July 10, 2020\n\nThe Governor announced $30 million in housing assistance for those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe money would be allocated Federal CARES Act funding: $25 million for renters and landlords and $5 million for homeowners behind on making payments. Those interested in receiving assistance can begin applying online starting Monday July 13 for the rental assistance program or mortgage assistance program.\n\nRenters' assistance money could be used for rent or security deposits as well as make up for landlord losses from the period starting March 1, 2020. Funding can be re-applied for and is given out on a first-come, first-served basis. Proof of payment delinquency will be required.\n\nThe mortgage assistance program prioritizes the lowest income, highest risk of foreclosure homeowners who have missed at least two payments. Homeowners could apply for up to three missed mortgage payments; funds will be paid directly to the mortgage lender.\n\n__________\n\nKinney Drugs and a Walgreens in Essex will soon begin COVID-19 testing at their pharmacies.\n\nGov. Phil Scott asked other local companies to join the effort. Health Commissioner Mark Levine said having testing locations at local pharmacies takes some of the burden off the health department so they can focus on outbreaks and vulnerable populations.\n\n___________\n\nFive new cases of COVID-19 were reported Friday by the Vermont Department of Health, which brings the cumulative total for the state to 1,277.\n\nTwo people were hospitalized with the virus — down one from yesterday. Nine hospitalizations are under investigation.\n\nDeaths remained the same at 56. There has not been a COVID-related death in Vermont since June 18.\n\nThe health department is reporting 1,066 Vermonters who have recovered from the disease.\n\n74,098 people have been tested for the virus.\n\n__________\n\nThe ECHO, Leahy Center for Lake Champlain will be regularly open starting July 10, Fridays through Mondays from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Timed tickets are required for two different time slots, 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 1 to 3 p.m.\n\n_________\n\nIn a news conference Friday afternoon, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said Vermont is doing well combatting the coronavirus, but emphasized that we are only in the second inning of a nine inning game, using a baseball analogy to make the point that there’s a long way to go before the crisis is over.\n\nWeinberger echoed the same point made during the call by Dr. Stephen Leffler, president and chief operating officer of University of Vermont Medical Center, who said, “There’s a lot of coronavirus in front of us.” Leffler said he understands that people are fatigued by the effort to deal with the virus, but “we have to be in this for the long term.”\n\nLeffler used a different spots analogy, saying we just finished the first quarter of the effort to fight the disease.\n\n_________\n\nAirport Director Gene Richards also joined the mayor’s call to give an update on measures being taken Burlington International Airport against COVID-19.

According to Levine we are \"clearly on a downward and stable slope.\" He said it takes time for numbers to peter out because of the 7 to 14 day incubation perid.\n\nRutland County cluster: A Rutland County employer in the Fair Haven area has 12 cases within its population. Testing is being performed on employees and community wide testing is expected to be announced soon. Levine would not identify the business but said it was not of the type where consumers would be coming in and out.\n\nWindham County family cluster: one family in Windham County has multiple cases. Testing is being performed today in Brattleboro. Levine said the number of cases there is less than 10 but would not give an exact number as to not inadvertently identify the family.\n\nLevine said a cluster is when cases are confined to one main source such as a family, household or business and not distributed across the population. The term outbreak is used when transmission is beyond one particular source, he said.\n\n__________\n\nThere were 20 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the state cumulative total to 1,184. Hospitalizations increased to four (from two) and those hospitalized under investigation decreased from 17 to 9 over the last 24 hours.\n\nDeaths remained at 56.

The demographic with the largest growth in positive cases is people aged 18 to 44.\n\nLevine said the spikes in these states have been widely attributed to “a breakdown in the willingness of the public to adhere to the simple precepts of avoiding mass gatherings, hence an inability to physically distance; and to wear facial coverings.”\n\nResidents must still follow these guidelines despite the hot weather and Vermont’s success so far in lowering the number of new cases per day, Levine said. Guidelines also recommend regular hand-washing and staying home when sick.\n\n“We can’t lose track of the fact that the virus hasn’t gone anywhere,” Levine said.\n\n_____________\n\nAn inmate who was being brought into the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington has tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAgency of Human Services Secretary Mike Smith said officials believe the inmate had contact with some staff members and some other inmates before the test came back positive on Saturday. It is unclear whether the inmate was in contact with others in the general population. Health Department officials are conducting contact tracing.\n\nCorrections officials have been testing inmates for COVID-19 upon intake to facilities throughout the state, Smith said. All inmates and staff in the South Burlington prison will be tested.\n\nAnother inmate last week tested positive after being brought into the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility in Rutland. Smith said that testing over the weekend turned up no other positive cases at the facility. A second mass-test of the Rutland facility will be conducted next week.\n\nIn late May and early June, the Department of Corrections had tested all staff and inmates in its facilities and reported no new positive cases. An outbreak in March at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans Town was the only recorded spread of the virus in a Vermont prison.\n\n___________\n\nThe number of cases associated with an outbreak of COVID-19 in Winooski and Burlington has risen to 110, Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Monday.\n\nLevine said he believes health officials have been successful in identifying those who could have been affected to try to suppress the outbreak, but the outbreak will not be over until there is no new activity that can be connected back to those involved.\n\n“It’s so common to use the forest fire analogies these days, so I would use the term ‘smoldering,’” Levine said. He added, “We’re doing what we can to contain it, and we’re doing a great job actually, but the bottom line is, to say that it’s fully contained. It’s not quite there yet.”\n\nLevine gave the following breakdown of the cases associated with the Winooski outbreak:\n\nThe median age of those affected is 24.\n\n65% of the cases were adults, and 35% were children.\n\n30% of the 110 cases reported having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n126 people have been contacted by contact tracers. 19 of those contacts have gone on to be positive cases.\n\n____________\n\nThe VNA & Hospice of the Southwest Region (VNAHSR) is re-opening its outpatient therapy clinic in Manchester, the health group reported Monday.\n\nAppointments physical and occupational therapy will be staggered to minimize coronavirus exposure to patients and staff, according to a news release.\n\nPatients who seek appointments are encouraged to contact their health providers, or call the clinic directly at (802) 362-6509.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 21, 2020\n\nA dozen new cases of COVID-19 were reported Sunday by the Vermont Department of Health, bringing the total cases in Vermont to 1,159.

A month later, after 35 deaths, Scott ordered flags to be lowered on the eighteenth of every month until the end of the year.\n\nFifty-six people in Vermont have died from the disease; the most recent death was reported on June 18.\n\n____________\n\n============\n\nWednesday, June 17, 2020\n\nNo new cases have been reported in Vermont, which currently has 1,129 cases, according to the Vermont Department of Health's dashboard Wednesday.\n\nSo far, about 915 people have recovered from the virus and 53,663 people have been tested.\n\nOne person is in the hospital for COVID-19 and four are hospitalized under investigation.\n\nNo additional deaths have been reported — that total remains at 55, according to the data.\n\n_________\n\nThe Farmers To Families nutrition assistance program has been extended through August, Vermont's congressional delegation announced Wednesday.\n\nA pair of Vermont-based organizations, Willing Hands and the Abbey Group, secured contracts to continue the food box-delivery program for two more months, according to news release from Sen. Patrick Leahy, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nThe program will bring an additional $8.5 million in aid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Vermont and the Upper Valley with New Hampshire, much of which will go toward buying produce and dairy from local farms, the news release stated.\n\nDetails on how to sign up to receive food boxes can be found on the Vermont Department of Emergency Management’s website: https://vem.vermont.gov.\n\n_________\n\nThe recent decline in new cases of COVID-19 after an oubreak in Winooski and Burlington's Old North End earlier this month is a positive sign, Burlington Mayor Miro Weinberger said during a press briefing Wednesday afternoon.\n\nParticularly for Burlington, Weinberger noted, the low number of new cases in the past week bodes well that an influx of college students moving in on June 1 didn't lead to an additional surge in cases.\n\n“If they were bringing the virus with them and infecting others I think we’d be seeing that now reflected in these numbers,\" Weinberger said.\n\nDr. Stephen Leffler, president of the UVM Medical Center, said he was \"sure there were asymptomatic people that came\" to Burlington during that time period but Vermont's efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus — unlike other states —probably limited the impact.\n\n\"Vermont’s still really doing it right,\" Leffler said. \"People are in general all masking, we’re social distancing well. We’re being smart about how we open up our businesses.\n\n“There’s pretty good evidence now that shows each of us wearing a mask helps us prevent spread to someone else,\" he said. \"It’s a relatively small sacrifice that each of us can make and we can keep transmission down.\"\n\n_________\n\nAlso during Wednesday's briefing, Weinberger explained Burlington's plans to allocate resources to \"racial equity and police transformation” effforts.\n\nOn top of an immediate commitment of $300,000 to the city's Fund for Racial Equity and Police Transformation, paid for via cuts to the police department, Weinberger said he's confident similar savings could expand that amount closer to $1 million during the next fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally, the city has another $300,000 in small business relief and rental assistance that it will look into spending \"through the lens of racial justice,\" he said.\n\nAnd the city will explore using an anticipated $1 million in federal funds marked for community investment next year to serve anti-racism efforts, Weinberger said.\n\n“I think there’s some real opportunity looking at all these funds about how to make progress with racial justice,\" the mayor said.\n\n_________\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2020\n\nThe Working Lands Enterprise Board, affiliated with the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food & Markets, has announced that 16 businesses will receive over $250,000 in COVID-19 Response Business Development Grants in agriculture and forestry. The awards will focus on business response, shifting marketing strategies, or other activities that may improve business recovery.\n\nOne grant recipient, The Royal Butcher of Braintree, intends to respond to the surge in demand for slaughter and meat processing. Current bottlenecks in processing will require urgent need to meet the local demand for this butcher’s services.\n\n“These dollars will allow us to expand our business while helping farmers who need our services during the pandemic,” Justin Sauerwein of The Royal Butcher said in a news release. The Royal Butcher, established in 2003, is a USDA inspected slaughterhouse and meat processor, attending to the needs of local livestock and dairy farms.\n\n_________\n\nThe New England Foundation for the Arts announced the launch of the New England Arts Resilience Fund, part of the nationwide United States Regional Arts Resilience Fund, an initiative of the U.S. Regional Arts Organizations and The Andrew W.

The Fund was created in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the nation’s arts infrastructure and will support New England nonprofit arts and cultural organizations with recovery and planning capital for a post-pandemic future.\n\nThe New England Arts Resilience Fund will provide approximately 50 non-matching grants, generally in the range of $10,000-$75,000, with potential for a small number of grants up to $100,000. The fund prioritizes organizations, communities, populations and art forms that have historically had less access to major financial resources for sustainability and seeks in particular to support organizations that are led by and deeply engage communities of color.\n\n_________\n\nTravelers looking to make a trip to Canada or Mexico will have to wait at least another month after the Department of Homeland Security extended border closures with both countries due to the coronavirus pandemic, USA Today reported.\n\nThe borders, including Vermont's border with Quebec, will remain closed to nonessential travel until July 21.\n\n\"Based on the success of the existing restrictions and the emergence of additional global COVID-19 hotspots, the Department will continue to limit non-essential travel at our land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico,\" Chad Wolf, acting Secretary of Homeland Security, said in a statement. \"This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy.\"\n\n“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight COVID-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.\n\n_________\n\nVermont State Treasurer Beth Pearce announced the launch of the Municipal Emergency Statewide Education Property Tax Borrowing Program to assist municipalities as they manage their finances and cash-flow needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBased on eligibility, the program will cover interest incurred for short-term borrowing meant to manage the effects of statewide education property-tax delays as a direct result of COVID-19.

Phil Scott extended a state of emergency through July 15. That action does not roll back opening-up procedures, Scott said — but provides a mechanism by which guidelines can be updated (relaxed or tightened, as needed) in an orderly, methodical way.\n\n_________\n\nOutdoor camping facilities may operate at 100% capacity, beginning today, the governor announced.

Tests with “real-time” results might conceivably be required for entrance to large sports or entertainment venues.\n\nThe “Sara Alert” app used by the Health Department is a tool for communication between Vermonters and the Department of Health – and is not a “tracking app” that reports the user’s location, Levine said. The state has no plans to implement detailed case-tracking software.\n\n_________\n\nUpcoming governor's news conference topics this week:\n\nWednesday: Long-term health facilities.\n\nFriday: Health guidance on K-12 school re-openings.\n\n============\n\nSunday, June 14, 2020\n\nTwo additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Saturday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,127, according to Vermont Department of Health data.\n\nAt the same time, 909 people have recovered from the virus and 50,982 people have been tested, the data showed.

Phil Scott and members of his cabinet announced a proposed $90 million in economic relief on Friday — phase two of a relief package he has proposed to restart the economy following the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFunds from the first phase are being considered by the Vermont Legislature currently. Scott had proposed $250 million in relief for businesses impacted by the pandemic, but expressed frustration at seeing the Legislature reducing the amount he asked for in his proposal. The Vermont House of Representatives announced Friday that it had fast-tracked a $93 million coronavirus relief package to Scott's desk for his signature.\n\n\"They're only including about a third of the money we recommended,\" Scott said during a news conference Friday. He added, \"While this pandemic has impacted everyone in the state, this crippled small businesses — the folks who provide the jobs that families rely on and generate the revenue we need for the services we provide in state government.\"\n\nThe second phase money, which will also be reviewed by the Legislature, provides assistance for long-term economic recovery, housing and community recovery, broadband expansion, and modernizing Vermont's regulatory programs.\n\nThe money being put toward relief from the pandemic was granted to the state through the federal CARES Act.\n\n__________\n\nNine additional positive cases of COVID-19 were reported in Vermont on Friday, bringing the pandemic total to 1,119, Vermont Department of Health data showed.\n\nAt the same time, 907 people have recovered from the virus, while 48,634 people have been tested, the data showed.

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Tuesday, the 30th of May 2023. Today, the latest from Russia and Ukraine's drone exchanges. Plus, there's a shortage of cancer drugs, and the story of Reality Winner hits the screen.\n\n♦\n\nRussia says that drones damaged buildings in Moscow early this morning, blaming Ukraine for the attack. The Russian Defense Ministry said other drones were shot down and called the incident a terrorist attack carried out by Kyiv. Moscow's mayor said the attack caused insignificant damage and two people were injured. For its part, Russia has continued to bombard Ukraine's capital in a wave of drone attacks since Monday. Meanwhile, Russia has issued an arrest warrant for Sen. Lindsey Graham after he said during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, \"The Russians are dying.\"\n\n♦\n\nA short supply of cancer drugs has both doctors and patients worried. USA TODAY Health Reporter Karen Weintraub, explains. Hello, Karen.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nHi.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo, tell me about this shortage of critical drugs for cancer patients.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nYeah, it's really stunning, about 14 drugs are in shortage. Several of them are really crucial for a number of cancers. Two in particular that I take a look at, cisplatin and carboplatin, they're platinum-based drugs and they're used for a wide variety of cancers. A researcher told me, at least 100,000 patients in America are affected by the shortage of all these drugs, but particularly these two. And they're also especially used for cancers that affect women disproportionately, reproductive cancers, gynecologic cancers.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd why is this shortage happening?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo, it's a variety of reasons, but basically our drug supply system is very challenged at the moment. So, the very expensive drugs, there's a lot of reason to have redundancy in the supply chain because you're making a lot of money on these drugs. Cisplatin and carboplatin are $15 and $23 each a vial, very cheap drugs. They've been around forever. They are the backbone of cancer therapy for a lot of treatments, as I said. And because they're so inexpensive, there's very little incentive for the companies to have backup plans if they run short and to have alternative suppliers, that sort of thing.\n\nSo, there are five companies that make cisplatin, for instance, all over in Europe and in India, but they had a common supplier of raw materials and that supplier was shut down for a time in India over the winter, and that set everybody back and they're trying to catch up now.\n\nBut one of the other issues apparently is communication. So, the hospitals don't know when the manufacturers are running short and they don't really know when the raw material suppliers are running short. So, nobody can prepare. And that that's one of the things that cancer advocates would like Congress to help them fix, to create a more open, more communicative supply chain system, so that each arm of the supply chain knows what's going on in the other and can prepare if there's a shortage.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKaren, does this shortage have a tangible effect on the outlook and the prognosis for some of these types of cancers?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo, it's not entirely clear. Right now, hopefully, it's mostly just making people nervous. Right now, people are rounding down or giving patients the minimum amount of drug that's been shown effective rather than the amount that they typically give or that they want to give. So, a patient I spoke with got five bags of carboplatin yesterday instead of six, because they wanted to conserve the drug. Will that affect her lifespan? Nobody knows. Again, the studies have shown in general that five is okay, but she would sure rather have six.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Karen, what are the solutions here?\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nSo, short term, there are people working on trying to solve this immediate problem. One company made supply of carboplatin ... A little bit more became available as of last week, which will hopefully help resolve at least this immediate crisis. Longer term, we really need to address the supply chain issue, the information gap that people have in the supply chain issue. The cancer folks I spoke with said they would really like an emergency supply kept in this country and some more manufacturing in this country, rather than relying on an international supply chain.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right, Karen Weintraub, thanks as always.\n\nKaren Weintraub:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nLiberté, egalité, fraternité. Liberty, equality, fraternity. Born out of the French Revolution, those values are shared in the US, too, and help define the close relationship between the two countries. But relations have gotten a bit more complicated over the past year. And amid that, a new French ambassador, Laurent Bili, has emerged. I spoke with USA TODAY White House Correspondent Francesca Chambers to learn more. Hi, Francesca.\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nHi. Thanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThanks for hopping back on the podcast. So, you wrote about France's new ambassador to the US. Interesting guy. What can you tell us about his background, Francesca?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nWell, prior to being the French Ambassador to the United States, he was actually France's Ambassador to China. And it is very interesting, he got there just a few months before the COVID-19 pandemic began. So, he spent a lot of his time in China in the lockdown, and then he wasn't even looking to be ambassador to the United States. In fact, he thought that he'd be in China for at least another six months when he got the call to come to the United States.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd I'm curious, what does he say about how being ambassador to the US compares to some of the other countries where he's worked? You mentioned China.\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nHe's also been ambassador to Turkey, as well as the ambassador to Brazil. I think coming out of lockdown in China to a vibrant city like Washington, D.C., where the French ambassador has typically in the past put on a number of parties and events, was a little bit overwhelming for him in the beginning. He was only here for just a few days and he was already hosting a stream of events. So, what he wants to do now is have parties with a purpose, where they focus on something really specific. For instance, one event that he did was focused on the First Amendment and another on International Women's Day.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nUS-France relations are in a complicated place right now, Francesca. Where do things stand for US-France relations as he takes over this job?\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nSo, they've certainly improved from where they were after President Joe Biden convinced Australia to get out of a nuclear-powered submarine deal with France and instead partner with the United States. Partly, that is because of Russia's invasion into Ukraine and France has been a major ally of the United States, and of course, the G7 has stuck together on that. And so, the relationship between the US and France has absolutely improved over the last year, but President Joe Biden held a state visit and a fancy dinner for President Macron of France as well, at the end of last year. So, he certainly comes into a much better situation.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFrancesca Chambers, thanks so much.\n\nFrancesca Chambers:\n\nThank you.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThe story of Reality Winner is hitting the screen.\n\nTrailer:\n\nYou've had a good career. I don't think you're a big, bad master spy. I think you just messed up.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIn HBO's new thriller, Reality, Sydney Sweeney of Euphoria and White Lotus fame plays former Air Force linguist and National Security Agency contractor, Reality Winner. She was arrested in 2017 on suspicion of leaking a confidential document to nonprofit news site, The Intercept. She was found guilty and spent more than five years in prison for the data breach, which helped expose Russian interference in the election of former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe movie is adapted from Tina Satter's Broadway play, Is This A Room, which itself is scripted word for word from the FBI transcript of Reality Winner's interrogation and arrest. Reality is streaming now on Max.\n\n♦\n\nHundreds of people have descended on a rural Missouri town to a convent that recently exhumed the remains of its founder. Four years after the death and burial of Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster at age 95, the Benedictine Sisters of Mary, Queen of the Apostles, made a surprising discovery when sisters exhumed her coffin and found her remains mostly intact. In Catholicism, a body that resists normal decay is considered incorrupt. The Catholic Church may raise the late nun's title to that of a saint, but an area bishop said that process has not been initiated yet.\n\nAnd before we go, on this day in history, the British Royal Air Force dispatched more than 1,000 bombers in Cologne, Germany during World War II, 81 years ago today.\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things.

No place. None, never, period. I’m opposed to defunding the police. I’m also opposed to defunding the FBI.”\n\nThe FBI has seen heightened threats against bureau personnel and property in the wake of the Mar-a-Lago search, including some against agents listed in court records as being involved in executing the search warrant. Several Republicans in recent weeks have issued calls to “defund the FBI,” signaling Trump’s grip on the party.\n\nThe President also offered scathing criticism of Republicans in Congress who are aligned with Trump and refuse to condemn the violent January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\n“Let me say this to my MAGA Republican friends in Congress: Don’t tell me you support law enforcement if you won’t condemn what happened on (January 6). Don’t tell me. Can’t do it. For God’s sake, whose side are you on?” Biden said.\n\nThe President said, “You can’t be pro-law enforcement and pro-insurrection. You can’t be a party of law and order and call the people who attacked the police on January 6 patriots. You can’t do it.”\n\nBiden criticized comments made over the weekend by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who said in an interview with Fox there would be “riots in the streets” if Trump were to be prosecuted.\n\n“The idea you turn on a television and see senior senators and congressmen saying, ‘If such and such happens, there’ll be blood in the street?’ Where the hell are we?” Biden said.\n\nTuesday’s remarks built on Biden’s unofficial midterm campaign kickoff that took place last week, in which he offered one of his sharpest rebukes of MAGA Republicans and told a group of Democratic donors that the “entire philosophy that underpins” the Make America Great Again agenda is “semi-fascism.”\n\nBiden was in Pennsylvania to promote his proposal to bolster police forces across the nation and reduce crime, which includes hiring and training 100,000 police officers over the next five years.\n\n“When it comes to public safety in this nation, the answer is not defund the police, it’s fund the police,” Biden said.\n\nBiden said, “I’m tired of not giving the kind of help they need. Folks, look, we’re in a situation in this country where we have to give them additional resources they need to get their job done.”\n\nThe President dedicated a significant portion of his speech to calling for a federal ban on assault weapons.\n\nHe spoke of his trip to Uvalde, Texas, after a mass shooting at an elementary school left 19 children and two teachers dead, and he said parents had to provide DNA to identify their children, “because the AR-15 just rips the body apart.”\n\n“And a 20-year-old kid can walk in and buy one?” Biden said, raising his voice. “DNA to say, ‘That’s my baby.’ What the hell’s the matter with us?”\n\nCongress passed the first major federal gun safety legislation in decades earlier this summer, but Biden said more needs to be done.\n\nThe President was initially scheduled to unveil his “Safer America Plan” last month in Pennsylvania but his trip was postponed after he tested positive for Covid-19 the morning he was slated to fly to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe plan asks Congress to appropriate more than $10 billion in funding over five years for the COPS Hiring Program in order to help fund the hiring and training of the additional police officers.\n\nThe President has repeatedly rejected calls from some Democrats and activists to “defund the police” and cut budgets to police departments and reallocate funding to social services to respond to non-violent crimes. The movement grew to national prominence following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020.\n\nThe President’s Tuesday visit to Pennsylvania was the first of three appearances in the key battleground state over the next week.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said a few buildings suffered minor damage in the \"terrorist attack\" but no deaths or injuries were reported.\n\nAt a public event, Russian President Vladimir Putin said the Ukrainian government \"attempts to intimidate Russia, Russian citizens and strikes at civilian buildings. ... It is, of course, a clear indication of terrorist activity.” He added that Moscow's air defenses would be bolstered.\n\nUkrainian presidential Mykhailo Podolyak denied his country was behind the air attack but predicted more would follow. \"We are pleased to watch events,\" he said.\n\nThe strike came as Ukraine's capital of Kyiv came under multiple waves of blistering Russian attacks. Several other cities also were hit, and acting Ukrainian Internal Affairs Minister Ihor Klymenko said four people were killed and 34 hospitalized after overnight attacks across the country.\n\nRussian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said a Patriot air defense system was struck during a Russian missile attack in Kyiv, but Ukraine denied the claim.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∙ Ukraine's Armed Forces estimated that more than 207,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since the war began.

Because of International Criminal Court charges related to war, South Africa would otherwise be obliged to arrest Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n∙ In his relentless campaign to acquire armament, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the Korean newspaper Chosun that he hopes South Korea will supply Ukraine air defense systems, arguing such a move would not run counter to South Korea's opposition to provide weapons.\n\n'One day our luck will run out,' UN nuclear head says of Zaporizhzhia plant\n\nThe United Nations' nuclear chief presented Tuesday a five-point safety plan for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine, emphasizing that good fortune has helped prevent a disastrous accident and it would be foolish to rely on that element while a war is being waged near Europe's largest nuclear facility.\n\nRafael Grossi reiterated to the U.N. Security Council what he told the International Atomic Energy Agency’s board of governors in March: “We are rolling a dice and if this continues then one day our luck will run out.”\n\nRussian forces took over the plant weeks into the conflict, and seven times since then fighting around it has disrupted critical power supplies. Grossi asked the warring parties to observe the principles of his plan, which call for:\n\n− A ban on attacks from or against the plant, especially targeting reactors and spent-fuel storage areas.\n\n– A ban on the storage of heavy weapons or presence of military personnel that could be used for an attack.\n\n– Ensuring the security of an uninterrupted off-site power supply to the plant.\n\n– Protecting “all structures, systems and components” essential to the plant’s operation from attacks or acts of sabotage.\n\n– Taking no action to undermine those principles.\n\nRussia has attacked Ukrainian health care 1,000 times, WHO says\n\nIt took Russia a mere 15 months to launch the highest number of attacks on healthcare facilities and services the World Health Organization has ever recorded in a conflict.\n\nThat figure stood at 1,004 on Tuesday, when the WHO said those verified attacks against Ukrainian health care had killed at least 101 people, \"including both health workers and patients, and injured many more.\"\n\nThe vast majority of the assaults (896) were perpetrated on health facilities, the WHO said, but the tally also included attacks on transport, personnel and warehouses.\n\nRussia issues arrest warrant for Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nRussia’s Interior Ministry issued an arrest warrant for Sen. Lindsey Graham after the South Carolina Republican's comments related to the fighting in Ukraine. In an edited video of his meeting Friday with Zelenskyy, Graham noted that “the Russians are dying” and described the U.S. military assistance to the country as “the best money we’ve ever spent.”\n\nGraham dismissed the warrant on Twitter: \"Good news: While I don’t expect to be tried by Russia anytime soon, I found the services of a great lawyer who works cheap.

He warned European countries to think about whom they sponsor and to whom they provide weapons.\n\n\"Responses to such attempts to attack should not be harsh − they should be brutal,\" he said in a Telegram post. \"We protect our citizens, and there is no need to show off and stand on ceremony.

In his speech, Biden sought both to encourage action and threaten opponents of new gun laws with the wrath of voters, majorities of whom support some type of new action to prevent mass shootings.\n\nIn addition to reinstating a ban on assault weapons, Biden urged Congress to expand background check requirements for gun purchases, create new rules for safely storing weapons, enact new “red flag” laws that would prevent gun sales to those with criminal records, repeal liability shields for gun manufacturers and provide more mental health services for students.\n\nMost, if not all, of those items currently appear unlikely to gain approval in the evenly divided Senate, where a bipartisan group of senators is currently determining where action might be possible.\n\nStill, Biden sought to use the moment – with Americans rattled by a seemingly unending spree of killings – to rally the nation behind a plan that most Republicans oppose.\n\n“My God, the fact that the majority of the Senate Republicans don’t want any of these proposals even to be debated or come up for a vote, I find unconscionable,” Biden said in his remarks, a rare evening address meant to reach the largest number of viewers.\n\n“We can’t fail the American people again,” he continued.\n\nFifty-six candles burned behind him to represent victims of gun violence in all US states and territories.\n\nThe remarks amounted to Biden’s most fulsome speech about guns since a massacre at a Texas elementary school last week. He said the recent spate of horrific mass shootings must impel the nation to take action to prevent further massacres by passing gun restrictions.\n\nAfter meeting families mourning their slain loved ones in Buffalo and Uvalde, Biden said the message from them was clear: “Do something.”\n\n“Nothing has been done,” Biden said. “This time that can’t be true. This time we must actually do something.”\n\nIn the little more than a week since the Uvalde shooting, a string of additional mass shootings have unfolded in states across the country, including in Tulsa on Wednesday. That shooting left five dead, including the gunman.\n\nIt was the second time Biden has delivered an emotional evening speech at the White House on mass shootings, also speaking in the wake of the Robb Elementary School assault. Since then, however, Biden has only selectively waded into the debate over gun control, stopping short of endorsing any specific legislative action to prevent further carnage.\n\nHe offered more specific calls Thursday, including saying the age to purchase assault weapons must be raised from 18 to 21 if lawmakers cannot agree on an outright ban on those firearms.\n\n“We must at least raise the age to be able to purchase one to 21,” the President said.\n\n“For the children we’ve lost, the children we can save, for the nation we love, let’s hear the call and the cry. Let’s meet the moment. Let us finally do something.”\n\n'A big change': Bash reacts to Biden's shift in response to recent mass shootings 02:18 - Source: CNN\n\nBoth Biden and his advisers have suggested they have exhausted their options on executive action to address guns, though continue to explore avenues for unilateral action.\n\nSpeaking a day after consoling families in Texas, Biden expressed limited hope that certain Republicans, like Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and one of his top allies, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, could be convinced to support some type of new gun laws.\n\nMcConnell has deputized Cornyn to begin talks with Democrats on some type of legislation to prevent further mass shootings, though the discussions are still in their preliminary stages.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut Democrat who participated in a Wednesday bipartisan meeting on gun safety, said he and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham are in talks over changes to red flag laws and there still is “significant” work to do.\n\nSenators are looking at strengthening state laws allowing authorities to take away weapons from individuals deemed a risk, known as red flag laws.\n\nBlumenthal called the conversation “productive and encouraging” and said negotiators are “all speaking multiple times a day.”\n\nMeanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring legislation to ban military-style assault weapons to the floor next week as the chamber moves to address gun violence.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments on Thursday.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Kaitlan Collins", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/03/19/lindsey-graham-comments-dangerous-vladimir-putin-assassination/7065075001/", "title": "Lindsey Graham called for Putin's assassination.

It’s likely to deepen polarization in an already deeply divided nation. And Trump’s return to the spotlight probably means next month’s midterm elections and the early stages of the 2024 presidential race will be rocked by his characteristic chaos.\n\nControversies that are coming to a head underscore that the nation and its political and legal systems are still far from dealing with and moving on from the shock and awe fallout of Trump’s turbulent single White House term. GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, alluded to that reality when she said on Sunday that the panel wants to avoid Trump turning his potential testimony into a “circus.”\n\nThose controversies also show that given the open legal and political loops involving the ex-President, a potential 2024 presidential campaign rooted in his claims of political persecution could create even more upheaval than his four years in office.\n\nAnd while fierce differences are emerging between Democrats and Republicans over policy on the economy, abortion, foreign policy and crime in the 2022 midterms – while concerns about democracy often rank lower for voters – there is every chance the coming political period revolves mostly around the ex-President’s past and future.\n\nA flurry of controversies is coming to a head\n\nTrump is, for instance, now locked in a subpoena showdown with the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. More and more Trump aides are being brought before a grand jury as the Justice Department gets closer to a fateful decision over whether to charge the ex-President over the mob riot.\n\nIn a separate probe, the department is investigating whether Trump broke the law by hoarding highly classified information at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Any prosecutions of the ex-President and those around him would set off an extraordinary political conflagration especially if Trump – already the GOP frontrunner for 2024 – is by then a declared candidate for president.\n\nTrump’s men and women are also stepping up their activity. His political guru Steve Bannon, whose own grassroots movement is seeking to infiltrate school boards and local election machinery, is vowing to expose the Biden “regime” in an appeal against a prison sentence handed down last week for defying a congressional subpoena. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is calling on the Supreme Court to block an attempt to force him to testify in an investigation in Georgia over Trump’s election stealing effort.\n\nIn Arizona, one of the ex-President’s favorite candidates, GOP gubernatorial hopeful Kari Lake – a serial spreader of voter fraud falsehoods – is again raising doubts about the election system. “I’m afraid that it probably is not going to be completely fair,” Lake told AZTV7 on Sunday.\n\nThere’s a rising prospect next month’s election will install a Republican majority in the House that will effectively mean a return of Trumpism to political power given the hold the ex-President maintains over the House GOP. Some leading “Make America Great Again” Republicans are already speaking of a possible drive to impeach Biden and have already signaled they will use their powers to investigate to rough up Biden for a possible clash with Trump in 2024.\n\nOne of the most powerful pro-Trump Republicans, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the party’s number three leader in the House, told the New York Post last week that impeachment of Biden was “on the table.” South Carolina GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, however, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” Sunday she did not want to see tit-for-tat impeachment proceedings after Trump was twice impeached. She said she was against the process being “weaponized.” But when asked whether Biden had committed impeachable offenses, she said: “That is something that would have to be investigated.”\n\nAn already pro-Trump Republican presence in Washington is likely to expand after the midterms. Scores of Trump-endorsed candidates are running on a platform of his 2020 election fraud falsehoods, raising questions over whether they will accept results should they lose their races in just over two weeks.\n\nOn another politically sensitive front, the Trump Organization’s criminal tax fraud and grand larceny trial begins in Manhattan on Monday. The ex-President hasn’t been personally charged but the trial could impact his business empire and prompt fresh claims from him that he is being persecuted for political reasons that could inject yet another contentious element into election season. In a separate civil case, New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, has filed a $250 million civil suit against Trump, three of his adult children and the Trump Organization, alleging that they ran tax and insurance fraud schemes to enrich themselves for years.\n\nDemocrats have made their own attempts to return Trump to the political spotlight. President Joe Biden equated MAGA followers with “semi-fascism” and some campaigns have tried to scare critical suburban voters by warning pro-Trump candidates are a danger to democracy.\n\nBut raging inflation and spikes in gasoline prices appear to be a far more potent concern before voters head to the polls, which could spell bad news for the party in power in Washington.\n\nAn unprecedented political hangover from an ex-president\n\nTrump’s current prominence on the political scene was already highly unusual. One-term presidents typically fade fairly fast into history. But it is a testament to the firm hold he maintains over much of the GOP that he’s still a key player nearly two years after losing reelection. And while there is growing talk about whether his thicket of legal and political controversies could convince some GOP primary voters it’s time to move on, Trump still seems to have plenty of juice.\n\nThe ex-President told supporters at a rally in Texas on Saturday regarding the possibility of a new White House bid, “I will probably have to do it again.”\n\nHis most immediate clash with the institutions of accountability went to another level Friday when the House January 6 committee issued a subpoena for documents and testimony. Trump has a long history of challenging such requests and of trying to delay or frustrate investigations into his conduct. But the subpoena also raised the possibility that he might opt to testify in order to claim the political spotlight – even though giving evidence under oath could cause him more legal exposure.\n\nCheney warned on Sunday that Trump wouldn’t be allowed to turn an appearance into a political opportunity.\n\n“It may take multiple days, and it will be done with a level of rigor and discipline and seriousness that it deserves,” Cheney told NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n\n“This isn’t going to be, you know, his first debate against Joe Biden and the circus and the food fight that that became. This is a far too serious set of issues.”\n\nTrump offered a glimpse of how he might use an appearance before the committee to create a political extravaganza after the panel announced it would send out the subpoena. In a 14-page letter, he made multiple false and debunked claims about election fraud, and lashed out at the panel itself, branding members “highly partisan political Hacks and Thugs whose sole function is to destroy the lives of many hard-working American Patriots, whose records in life have been unblemished until this point of attempted ruination.”\n\nThe committee has taken most depositions behind closed doors and on video and used testimony throughout its highly produced presentations. Only its most sympathetic witnesses have appeared in person. While this has helped create a powerful narrative that has painted a picture of shocking derelictions of duty by Trump on January 6, it has also deprived viewers of seeing witnesses under cross examination. This has made it difficult to assess whether the committee’s case would stand up to more rigorous evidentiary requirements in a court of law.\n\nThe prospect of video testimony over an intense period of days or hours is likely to be unappealing to the former President because it would be harder for him to dictate the terms of the exchanges and control how his testimony might be used.\n\nThis could all become academic anyway. Given the possibility of a Trump legal challenge to the subpoena, the issue could drag on for months and become moot since a possible new Republican House majority would likely sweep the January 6 committee away as one of its first acts.\n\nThe panel is debating whether to make criminal referrals of Trump and those around him to the Department of Justice over their actions around January 6. But the most significant potential areas of criminal liability for the ex-President are in the hands of Attorney General Merrick Garland – over the January 6 case and the classified documents storm – and prosecutors in Georgia, who are investigating attempts by Trump and his allies to overthrow the 2020 election in the key swing state.\n\nIf there is evidence a crime was committed, Garland would face a dilemma over whether the national interest lay in implementing the law to its full extent or whether the consequences of prosecuting a former commander in chief in a fractious political atmosphere could tear the country apart.\n\nA decision to charge an ex-president running for a non-consecutive second White House term would undoubtedly cause a firestorm. But sparing him from accountability if there’s evidence of a crime would send a damaging signal to future presidents with strongman instincts.\n\nSince everything about Trump’s political career has been unprecedented, it’s hardly surprising that his political reemergence is posing new questions with the potential to further challenge and damage the country’s political institutions.", "authors": ["Stephen Collinson"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/31/politics/donald-trump-capitol-riot-pardons-2024-republicans/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Donald Trump offers chilling glimpse into possible second ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFormer President Donald Trump conjured a vision of a second term that would function as a tool of personal vengeance, and become even more authoritarian than his first, when he vowed to pardon US Capitol insurrectionists if he runs for the White House again and wins.\n\nHis pledge at a Texas rally Saturday was accompanied by a call for demonstrations if prosecutors in New York, who are probing Trump’s business practices, and those in Georgia, looking into his attempts to reverse his election loss in the state, do anything that he defined as wrong or illegal. The comments underscore Trump’s obsession with delusional lies that he won the 2020 election, and his determination to put that falsehood at the core of the Republican worldview. As was often the case during his four years in office, Trump’s pardons threat shows that he still makes no distinction between his personal goals and the national interest or rule of law.\n\nBut the former President’s new rhetorical outburst also at times hinted at concern with his own legal position, and comes at a moment when various criminal and congressional lines of investigation seem to be tightening around him. The House select committee probing the January 6, 2021, riot has now penetrated deep inside Trump’s West Wing inner circle, and he lost a Supreme Court bid to keep key documents secret. The likelihood of a damning accounting from the committee, bristling with new details about Trump’s attempt to destroy American democracy, is growing, though the GOP has sought to thwart it at every turn.\n\nAs well as further threatening US democracy on Saturday night, Trump was preoccupied with his personal legal exposure. He fired off a wild attack, which looked to be racially-motivated, on two Black New York prosecutors investigating whether his business empire deliberately falsified accounts to get preferential treatment on loans and income taxes. He also alluded to potential legal peril he’s facing in Fulton County, Georgia, where a Black district attorney has been granted a special grand jury to examine his attempt to steal President Joe Biden’s win in the state.\n\nIn a sign of the potential impact of Trump’s incitement, District Attorney Fani Willis wrote to the FBI on Sunday asking for an immediate risk assessment for the Fulton County Courthouse and government buildings. She said that “security concerns were escalated this weekend” by the former President’s speech and added that her office had already received “communications” from people unhappy with the investigation before Trump’s rally.\n\nTrump’s pressure on investigators prompted Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who sits on the House committee probing the insurrection, to warn that the ex-President had issued a “call to arms.”\n\n“Calling out for demonstrations if, you know, anything adverse, legally, happens to him, is pretty extraordinary. And I think it’s important to think through what message is being sent,” the California Democrat told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Sunday.\n\nIn yet another sign of Trump’s incessantly consuming inability to accept his election loss, he issued a statement that same evening slamming former Vice President Mike Pence for refusing his demands to overturn the result of the democratic election in 2020, and falsely claimed that the then-vice president had the power to do so.\n\nWith Trump and his fans already referring to him as the 45th and the 47th President, his fixation with the 2020 election may also represent a growing problem for the Republican Party. In the midterm elections in November and beyond, the GOP wants to build a case that Biden is weak, flailing at home and abroad and has lost his grip on inflation. But Trump, who wants to use the elections to demonstrate his hold on the GOP grassroots, threatens to detract from that simple Republican message. While the ex-President remains wildly popular with the “Make America Great Again” crowd, his loss in 2020 poses the question of whether Republicans – and independents and suburban swing voters – want to get stuck forever in Trump’s unhinged 2020 feedback loop. Some other potential 2024 presidential candidates, like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, are meanwhile demonstrating that Trump’s populist nationalism and assault on what supporters view as liberal elites will be waged long after the 45th President has left the scene.\n\nDemocrats failed in their attempt to make Trump the bogeyman in last year’s Virginia gubernatorial election, when Republican Glenn Youngkin kept his distance from the ex-President and tapped into voter concerns about education, Covid exhaustion and rising prices. But it will be an easier case for Democrats to make when Trump is holding wild rallies in swing states and again makes himself the face of the party in 2022, spreading his lies, spewing increasingly racist rhetoric and behaving like an autocrat in waiting.\n\nTrump signals possible new abuse of power\n\nTrump’s latest comment on pardons was in line with his attempt to whitewash the truth of a day when his mob, incited at his Washington rally, invaded the Capitol to try and disrupt the certification of Biden’s win, beat up police officers and sent lawmakers running for their lives. Throughout his presidency, he used the chief executive’s pardon power to shield his political cronies.\n\n“If I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly,” Trump said on Saturday. “And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons. Because they are being treated so unfairly.”\n\nPeople dragged into the criminal justice system because they tried to stage a coup based on lies about a stolen election are not being treated unfairly. But it is characteristic of Trump’s democracy-threatening brand of politics to play up a sense of grievance and victimhood. He spent four years of his twice-impeached presidency sowing a narrative that opponents and subordinates who tried to check him were in fact the ones guilty of abusing power. And he repeatedly sought to force the Justice Department to embrace his anti-constitutional schemes.\n\nSeveral high-profile Republicans quickly dismissed Trump’s offer to help January 6 insurrectionists. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Chris Sununu, who disappointed the national party by passing on a Senate bid, said on Sunday that those responsible for the insurrection must be held accountable. Asked by CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union” about the possibility of a pardon for such Trump supporters, Sununu, who is emerging as a standard bearer for a possible post-Trump GOP, said: “Of course not. Oh my goodness, no.”\n\nOne of Trump’s closest enablers, Sen. Lindsey Graham, also dismissed Trump’s promise in an appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “I think it’s inappropriate. I don’t want to reinforce that defiling the Capitol was okay. I don’t want to do anything that would make this more likely in the future,” the South Carolina Republican said. His comments were notable since he has previously warned that the GOP needs to find a way to work with Trump if it wants to wield power. Another Republican senator, Susan Collins of Maine, also condemned Trump’s remarks. “I do not think … President Trump should have made that pledge to do pardons. We should let the judicial process proceed. January 6 was a dark day in our history,” said Collins, who just won reelection in 2020, speaking on ABC’s “This Week.” She also said it was “very unlikely” that she would support Trump if he does officially decide on a third presidential run.\n\nWyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the party’s most vocal critics of Trump and his hold on the Republican Party, tweeted Monday that “Trump uses language he knows caused the Jan 6 violence; suggests he’d pardon the Jan 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy; threatens prosecutors; and admits he was attempting to overturn the election. He’d do it all again if given the chance.”\n\nThis must have been a case of déjà vu for Republicans who often had their talking points overshadowed by the ex-President’s extremism when he was in power. But it is one thing for key Republicans to criticize the ex-President now. On every previous occasion when the GOP faced a choice between appeasing Trump to keep or win power and standing up for American democracy and the rule of law, it has chosen the first option. In a sense, Trump’s demagoguery this weekend was a fresh sign that he is convinced that his personality cult still holds his party in thrall.\n\nThe House Republican conference has already demonstrated that it would act as a vessel of Trump’s power and vengeance if it wins the majority in November. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has put the ex-President at the center of his efforts to become speaker of the House and has been put on notice by pro-Trump members like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene that departures from the ex-President’s dogma could doom his hopes. And former Speaker Newt Gingrich encapsulated the extremism of the House GOP when he suggested last week that a new majority should throw members of the January 6 committee in jail.\n\nTrump fires off racist attack on New York prosecutors\n\nThe ex-President’s speech was also notable for an extraordinary assault on prosecutors in New York who are investigating allegations of fraud at his business empire. The ex-President called for “the biggest protests we have ever had” if the prosecutors “do anything wrong or illegal.” New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr. are both leading investigations into Trump’s business empire. And both are Black, a point that Trump hinted at in his complaints about his treatment.\n\n“These prosecutors are vicious, horrible people. They’re racists and they’re very sick – they’re mentally sick,” he said. “They’re going after me without any protection of my rights from the Supreme Court or most other courts. In reality, they’re not after me, they’re after you,” he told his crowd.\n\nIt was the second recent occasion when Trump has sought to stir up racial hatred as part of his increasingly dangerous rhetoric. He claimed at a rally in Arizona two weeks ago that White people could not get Covid-19 treatment or vaccines in New York, grossly distorting a policy that says that race should be one factor in the use of limited therapies for a disease that disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic populations.\n\nTrump’s speech once again presented a conundrum about how much attention should be paid to an ex-President who is using his high profile to stir division and outrage in order to stay politically relevant. Yet given his power in the Republican Party and the intensity of those who follow a once and possible future President who has already incited a coup to overthrow an election, it would be unwise to ignore the implications of his rage.\n\nEven out of office, Trump has convinced millions of Americans that the election was stolen and Biden is an illegitimate president. Multiple Republican-run states have passed laws that make it harder to vote and easier for political officials to interfere in election results rooted in his false claims of voter fraud.

US, Mexican leaders have ...", "text": "Karol Suárez\n\nFor the Louisville Courier-Journal, USA TODAY Network\n\nMEXICO CITY ― Skyrocketing fentanyl overdoses in the United States and the latest high-impact attacks against Americans on Mexican soil have again led to demands that the U.S. designate drug cartels as terrorist organizations.\n\nSeveral congressional Republicans are behind the push. They say designating Mexican cartels as terrorist organizations would give U.S. authorities the tools they need to take them down.\n\nIt may seem to be a simple designation. But it is anything but that.\n\nHere’s what representatives from each side, and the experts who study the issue, are saying:\n\n‘Cartels in our crosshairs’\n\nSix Republican U.S. senators introduced a bill on March 29 called the NARCOS Act. It would add the “foreign terrorist organization” label to nine notorious Mexican cartels, including the powerhouse Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels. A similar bill was also introduced in the House of Representatives.\n\n“Despite what the president of Mexico says, drug cartels are in control of large parts of Mexico,” Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said in a prepared statement.\n\n“They are making billions of dollars sending fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States, where it is killing our citizens by the thousands. Designating these cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations will be a game-changer. We will put the cartels in our crosshairs and go after those who provide material support to them, including the Chinese entities who send them chemicals to produce these poisons.”\n\nChina, and more recently, India, are sources of “precursor” chemicals used by drug cartels to produce fentanyl and methamphetamine for shipment north of the border.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. authorities charged dozens of Sinaloa cartel members and sanctioned Chinese entities in a major fentanyl-trafficking crackdown.\n\nIn a press conference, Attorney General Merrick Garland noted the Sinaloa cartel has already been designated a transnational criminal organization. He said the designation of a foreign terrorist organization is up to the State Department. “As this case shows, we have an enormous number of tools already,” he said.\n\nThe terrorist designation would give law enforcement and prosecutors more power to freeze cartel assets and deny their members' entry to the United States, Graham’s office said. It would also open the door to charging those who support a terrorist organization.\n\nMexican leaders have said it would violate Mexico’s sovereignty and lead to a breakdown in diplomatic relations between the nations.\n\nAssociate Professor Nathan Jones at the College of Criminal Justice at Sam Houston State University concurs.\n\n“It’s a bad idea, in part because of the impact it will have on U.S.-Mexico relations,” said Jones, who studies organized crime in Mexico.\n\nAny benefit that might be gained “would be wiped out by a lack of cooperation that would likely result,” he said.\n\nMore:Ignoring cartel danger, Mexican families scour wilderness for missing loved ones' remains\n\n‘Politicking here and there’\n\nIn early March, four Americans were kidnapped, and two of them killed after they crossed into Matamoros, Mexico, for a medical procedure.\n\nThe Gulf Cartel later took responsibility and turned over its members who had committed the acts.\n\nThe crimes ramped up calls for the terrorist designation, which was debated during the Trump administration, and opened the door to additional criticism of President Joe Biden’s border policies.\n\n“The Mexican government is being held hostage by tens of thousands of paramilitary members of terrorist organizations that effectively control Mexico,” former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr told Fox News. “They can use violence and oceans of cash to corrupt the government...”\n\nMexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the criticism around the situation was purely political.\n\n“There was politicking here and there, but we have to work together respecting our sovereignties,” said López Obrador, who has blamed the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. on the “lack of hugs, of embraces” given out in American families.\n\nAnother professor who studies security and intelligence, Javed Ali at the University of Michigan, wonders what it's going to take for the American government to take the terrorist-designation step.\n\n“After what happened to the four Americans, at what point is the U.S. going to start to explore some of these other tools and options that we have available to put more pressure on the cartels?” Ali asked.\n\n“Would it be controversial? Absolutely. But look how bad things are right now. I'd be willing to at least take a little bit of risk to try to put pressure on the groups that are threatening both countries the most and see if that leads to better results.”\n\nAli said it shouldn’t fall to the U.S. to act unilaterally, though.\n\n“There is way more violence on the Mexican side of the border than there is on the U.S. side of the border, so I think it's in Mexico's interest to take sort of a new approach on this, as well, and in partnership with the U.S.,” he said.\n\nGarland said Friday that Mexican law enforcement and security personnel met with U.S. officials at the Department of Justice on Thursday.\n\n\"Together, we renewed our commitment to working closely in the fight against fentanyl and firearms trafficking,\" Garland said.\n\nMore:Will El Chapo son's arrest slow export of drugs to US? Next steps crucial, experts say\n\nSovereignty at stake\n\nMexican officials have continued to push back over the strong language coming out of Washington, D.C.\n\nMexico’s foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard traveled to Washington to meet with Mexican diplomatic staff and to start a campaign “to defend Mexico in the U.S. after the unacceptable attacks by legislators and former officials of the Republican Party.”\n\nGraham has called for using the terrorist designation to allow for military action against the cartels.\n\n“It's time now to get serious and use all the tools in our toolbox, not just in the prosecution way, not just in the law enforcement lane, but in the military lane, as well,” he said during a press conference following the Matamoros kidnappings.\n\nEbrard opposed any U.S. military intervention in Mexico to defeat the cartels, saying, “over my dead body,” and “we are not going to allow Mexico to be pushed around.”\n\nWhile experts on both sides of the border were quick to agree it would be a violation of Mexican sovereignty, they acknowledged more cooperation is needed to confront drug trafficking.\n\n“It is indeed a violation of sovereignty, but in the fight against global problems such as climate change, the pandemic, and in this case, drug trafficking, all countries have to concede some sovereignty in order to face global challenges,” David Saucedo, a Mexico-based security analyst, said.\n\n“I agree with binational cooperation to be able to confront drug trafficking. I don't even rule out the possibility of more DEA agents in Mexico collaborating and dismantling criminal cells, investigating drug leaders in Mexico.”\n\nSam Houston University’s Jones also said sovereignty would be at stake, “and because of that intangible sovereignty, (the Mexican government is) going to have to react on some level diplomatically.\n\n“And what will likely happen is there would be even reduced law enforcement cooperation. And that's the real shame because that gets people on both sides of the border killed and reduces the likelihood that we can solve important crimes to prevent violence on both sides of the border.”\n\nIs the Mexican government in control?\n\nGraham pushed his contention about the Mexican government’s lack of control during a March 22 congressional hearing appearance by Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nWhen Graham asked if there are places in Mexico where the government doesn’t have control, Blinken said, “I think that’s fair to say, yes.”\n\nPresident López Obrador responded that Blinken was coerced to say those words.\n\n“There is no place in the national territory where there is no presence of authority. I can tell Mr. Blinken that he knows we are constantly destroying clandestine laboratories everywhere,” the president said.\n\nMore:Outbreak of Mexican cartel violence targeting innocents raises worries of what’s to come\n\nBut there are places in Mexico where the government has no presence, a bishop from Michoacán state told the Mexican newspaper Proceso.\n\nA security report made by a group of bishops in Mexico, which will be delivered to Pope Francis at the Vatican, states organized crime has advanced so far it has control of specific parts of Mexico and that collusion with authorities of all levels of government exists.\n\n“If you leave your town, your land where you are living to attend to a commitment, you don't know what might happen during the day when you go across the border,” Bishop Carlos Garfias told Proceso, referring to both national and some state borders within Mexico.\n\nThe definition of terrorism\n\nDo the activities of Mexico’s drug cartels fit the criteria for terrorism?\n\n“A terrorist group carries out violent acts with religious motives, with political motives to reinforce governments to adopt measures or not to apply certain policies,” Saucedo said.\n\n“Drug trafficking groups have political and economic-criminal motivations. Their goal is not to destroy a government, but rather to force them to take positions of respect for their interests. Indeed, they also have committed acts of narcoterrorism on the civilian population,” Saucedo explained.\n\nMore:City hall massacre: Local Mexican leaders risk lives to stay in office in cartel territory\n\nAccording to the U.S. State Department, the legal criteria are that it must be a foreign organization, must engage in terrorist activities and must threaten the security of individual U.S. citizens or national security.\n\n“You can make a compelling argument that (cartel) activity fits these three criteria,” said the University of Michigan’s Ali, who has a background that includes the FBI and National Counterterrorism Center.\n\nMexican government and military leaders’ maintain cartel activity is criminal activity, not terrorism, and the designation would have a negative impact on Mexico as a whole.\n\nBoots on the ground?\n\nAccording to the daily narrative in Mexico, the designation would mean American boots on the ground in Mexico.\n\nHowever, the security experts that spoke with The Louisville Courier-Journal, a member of the USA TODAY Network, don’t anticipate that.\n\n“There are conservatives making those calls about direct military intervention in Mexico. I find that unlikely, in part because of what it would do to relations between the U.S. and Mexico, and overall,” Jones told The Courier Journal.\n\n“Absent some exigent circumstance, I don't think any U.S. president is going to launch a military operation into Mexico against a cartel in the aftermath of something terrible happening ― not without the partnership of the Mexican government,” Ali said.\n\nSaucedo said the U.S. and Mexican militaries do not have the information and investigative capabilities needed in the battle against drug cartels.\n\n“Only civil institutions can do it, such as the DEA, the FBI, the Attorney General's office and the Mexican federal police. From a practical operational standpoint, boots on the ground can’t be done,” Saucedo said.\n\nGrace Hauck of USA TODAY contributed reporting.

My life has been blessed beyond measure and I do know that one can only come this far by faith,” Jackson said.\n\n“Among my many blessings, and indeed the very first, is the fact that I was born in this great country,” she added. “The United States of America is the greatest beacon of hope and democracy the world has ever known. I was also blessed from my early days to have had a supportive and loving family. My mother and father, who have been married for 54 years, are at their home in Florida right now and I know that they could not be more proud.”\n\nRELATED: Republicans attack Biden Supreme Court pick as pawn of ‘radical Left’\n\nThough historic, the choice of Jackson will not change the ideological makeup of the court. The court currently has six conservative justices and three liberal justices – and the retiring Breyer comes from the liberal camp. The court is already poised to continue its turn toward the right with high-profile cases and rulings expected from the court in the coming months on abortion, gun control and religious liberty issues.\n\nBiden met with Jackson for her Supreme Court interview earlier this month, a senior administration official said, in a meeting that the White House managed to keep secret. Jackson received and accepted Biden’s offer in a call Thursday night, a source familiar with the decision told CNN, yet was present for DC Circuit Court hearings Friday morning.\n\nThe White House considered delaying the announcement, given the Russian invasion in Ukraine, but believed it was critical to get the second phase of the confirmation process moving, the official said.\n\nChance to excite Democrats\n\nBiden’s pick is a chance for him to fire up a Democratic base that is less excited to vote in this year’s midterm elections than it has been over the past several election cycles. The selection gives Biden a chance to deliver on one of his top campaign promises, and he’ll hope that the Black voters who were crucial to his election win will see this as a return on their investment.\n\nWhile Jackson was the leading contender, the official said the President gave “considerable weight” to other finalists, including Judge J. Michelle Childs and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger.\n\nFor more than a year, the President had familiarized himself with her work, reading many of her opinions and other writings, along with those of other contenders.\n\nBut Biden was also was impressed by her life story, including her rise from federal public defender to federal appellate judge – and her upbringing as the daughter of two public school teachers and administrators.\n\n“Her parents grew up with segregation, but never gave up hope that their children would enjoy the true promise of America,” the President said Friday.\n\n“Her opinions are always carefully reasoned, tethered to precedent and demonstrate respect for how the law impacts everyday people,” Biden said. “It doesn’t mean she puts her thumb on the scale of justice one way or the other. But she understands the broader impacts of her decisions, whether it’s cases addressing the rights of workers or government service. She cares about making sure that our democracy works for the American people. She listens. She looks people in the eye – lawyers, defendants victims and families – and she strives ensure that everyone understands why she made a decision, what the law is, and what it means to them. She strives to be fair, to get it right, to do justice. That’s something all of us should remember. And it’s something I’ve thought about throughout this process.”\n\nNomination process\n\nEyes will now turn to the Senate, where Biden’s Democratic Party holds the thinnest possible majority. The President will hope that Jackson can garner bipartisan support, but Democrats will need all their members in Washington to ensure her confirmation.\n\nUnlike for most major pieces of legislation, Democrats do not need Republican help to confirm a Supreme Court justice and can do it with their 50 votes and Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a deadlock. When Jackson was confirmed to the appellate bench, she had the support of three Republican senators. Harris, whom the White House said played an active role in the selection process, was working the phones Friday morning, calling senators as the news was reported.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has indicated that he wants to push a nominee through the process quickly, using Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett’s Senate proceedings as a model for Jackson’s confirmation timeline. And Sen. Dick Durbin, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN recently that he expects to have a hearing within a few weeks of the selection.\n\nThe goal of the leadership is to have the nominee confirmed by the April 11 recess.\n\nJackson is expected to have her courtesy meetings with senators next week, according to a person familiar with the plans. It’s common for Supreme Court nominees to meet with the leadership on both sides, then members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nBiden first committed to nominating a Black female US Supreme Court justice when he was running for president in 2020. On a debate stage in South Carolina, Biden argued that his push to make “sure there’s a Black woman on the Supreme Court” was rooted in an effort to “get everyone represented.”\n\nThough there are currently no Black women serving in the United States Senate in a position to vote for the nominee, Black female House members, all Democrats, applauded Biden for “fulfilling his campaign promise.”\n\nCongressional Black Caucus chair Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio said the nomination is “something that I will remember forever.” Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman of New Jersey said Jackson will “bring a new, necessary perspective” to the court and “will also be an inspiration to Black women and girls everywhere.” Rep. Frederica Wilson of Florida said she “never dreamed that, in my lifetime, I would see a Black woman nominated” to the Supreme Court.\n\nPersonal history\n\nJackson was born in the nation’s capital but grew up in the Miami area. She was a member of the debate team at Miami Palmetto Senior High School before earning both her undergraduate degree and law degree at Harvard.\n\nShe also previously clerked for Breyer and served as a federal public defender in Washington – an experience that her backers say is fitting, given Biden’s commitment to putting more public defenders on the federal bench. She was also a commissioner on the US Sentencing Commission and served on the federal district court in DC, as an appointee of President Barack Obama, before Biden elevated her to the DC Circuit last year.\n\nJackson thanked Breyer in her speech.\n\n“Justice Breyer, in particular, not only gave me the greatest job that any young lawyer could ever hope to have, but he also exemplified every day, in every way, that a Supreme Court justice can perform at the highest level of skill and integrity, while also being guided by civility, grace, pragmatism and generosity of spirit,” Jackson said. “Justice Breyer, the members of the Senate will decide if I fill your seat, but please know that I could never fill your shoes.”\n\nAt her 2021 confirmation hearing for the appellate court, she connected her family’s professions – her parents worked in public schools – to her decision to work as a public defender.\n\n“I come from a background of public service. My parents were in public service, my brother was a police officer and (was) in the military,” she said at the time, “and being in the public defenders’ office felt very much like the opportunity to help with my skills and talents.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, is a relative by marriage and introduced her at the 2013 hearing for her district court nomination.\n\nRyan also congratulated Jackson Friday.\n\n“Janna and I are incredibly happy for Ketanji and her entire family. Our politics may differ, but my praise for Ketanji’s intellect, for her character, and for her integrity, is unequivocal,” Ryan said.\n\nAt the White House Friday, Jackson noted that an uncle was previously given a life sentence on drug charges, an issue of which she hasn’t previously spoken about publicly.\n\n“You may have read that I have one uncle who got caught up in the drug trade and received a life sentence,” Jackson said. “That is true, but law enforcement also runs in my family. In addition to my brother, I had two uncles who served decades as police officers, one of whom became the police chief in my hometown of Miami, Florida.”\n\nIn 2008, when Jackson was in private practice and well before she became a judge, Jackson referred her uncle’s file to WilmerHale, a law firm that handles numerous clemency petitions, according to a spokesperson for the firm.\n\nThe firm submitted the petition on Brown’s behalf on October 7, 2014, and Obama commuted his sentence on November 22, 2016. According to the firm, Jackson had “no further involvement in the matter” after making the referral. Jackson’s chambers said she would decline comment on the issue.\n\n“I am standing here today by the grace of God as testament to the love and support that I’ve received from my family,” Jackson added Friday.\n\nRepublicans signal potential opposition\n\nAs a judge in DC – where some of the most politically charged cases are filed – Jackson’s issued notable rulings touching on Congress’ ability to investigate the White House. As a district court judge, she wrote a 2019 opinion siding with House lawmakers who sought the testimony of then-White House Counsel Don McGahn. Last year, she was on the unanimous circuit panel that ordered disclosure of certain Trump White House documents to the House January 6 committee.\n\nAs a judge, some other notable cases she has in her record are a 2018 case brought federal employee unions where she blocked parts of executive orders issued by Trump, and a case where she ruled against Trump policies that expand the categories of non-citizens who could be subject to expedited removal procedures without being able to appear before a judge.\n\nJackson penned more than 500 opinions in the eight years she spent on the district court.\n\nThough Biden has said that he’d pick a nominee with bipartisan appeal who is “worthy of Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence and decency,” his decision to name the first Black woman to the court is already facing Republican opposition. Several Senate Republicans have told CNN they disagreed with the President’s decision to name a Black woman to the court rather than judging a nominee squarely on their credentials, even though Ronald Reagan and Trump both said they’d name a female justice to the Supreme Court when they were on the campaign trail.\n\nEven before Biden nominated Jackson, GOP senators and Senate candidates were already concluding that she’d be far left, throwing cold water on the names floated as being on Biden’s potential short list and calling for a slow confirmation process. Still, Republicans are limited in their ability to block a Supreme Court nominee, and Jackson may win the support of some GOP senators.\n\nSens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine all voted for Jackson last summer when she was confirmed as a circuit court judge on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, the second most important court in the country.\n\nCollins touted Jackson’s “impressive academic and legal credentials” following the announcement. But Graham, who had expressed support for Childs, suggested Jackson does not have his approval, saying in a tweet that the choice of Jackson “means the radical Left has won President Biden over yet again.” Graham added that he expects a “respectful but interesting hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called for a “rigorous, exhaustive” review of Jackson in a statement.\n\n“I also understand Judge Jackson was “impressive academic and legal credentials the favored choice of far-left dark-money groups that have spent years attacking the legitimacy and structure of the Court itself,” McConnell said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments, reaction and background information.", "authors": ["Jake Tapper Ariane De Vogue Jeff Zeleny Betsy Klein Maegan Vazquez", "Jake Tapper", "Ariane De Vogue", "Jeff Zeleny", "Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez"], "publish_date": "2022/02/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/24/impeachment-democrats-wrap-up-opening-arguments-trump-trial/4557691002/", "title": "Impeachment updates: Democrats wrap up Trump trial opening ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – House Democrats completed their three days of opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump by itemizing his alleged misconduct, but without clearly recruiting Republicans to support subpoenaing witnesses or convicting the president to remove him from office.\n\nThe lead manager, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., charged that Trump abused the power of his office by withholding $391 million in vital military aid for Ukraine in a scheme to cheat in the 2020 election by pressuring the country to investigate his rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nBut Schiff warned that the second accusation of obstruction of Congress will echo beyond impeachment – if Trump isn’t convicted and removed from office – because the president defied all subpoenas during the House inquiry.\n\n“In the history of the republic, no president ever ordered the complete defiance of an impeachment inquiry,” Schiff said. “Ukraine will survive and so will we, but that will be an unending injury to this country because the balance of power that our founders set out will never be the same.”\n\nTrump’s defense team will have up to 24 hours spread over three days to make their case starting Saturday. Jay Sekulow, a private lawyer defending Trump, said the team will refute the Democratic arguments and make an argument supporting the president.\n\n“We’re going to put on I believe without question a compelling case,” Sekulow said.\n\nTrump’s conviction has always been unlikely because it would require a two-thirds vote in a chamber with 53 Republicans and 47 Democrats. But Democrats had hoped to win support from at least four Republicans joining them in a 51-vote majority to subpoena witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.\n\nVotes on witnesses are expected after the Trump team’s presentation and then up to 16 hours of written questions posed by senators to both sides. But no Republicans stepped forward to support subpoenas after the arguments from the seven House prosecutors, who are called managers.\n\n“I’m not going to be requesting any additional witnesses, especially when they say the evidence is overwhelming and the facts are undisputed,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “In the world I've grew up in, that means there's no need for additional witnesses.”\n\nRather than take more time in the trial to call witnesses, Republicans turned their attention to acquitting Trump and moving on.\n\n“I personally am in favor of a motion to acquit or convict,\" said Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind. \"I think the former is what’s going to happen because the case has not been made.\"\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nGOP senators slam Schiff speech\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., made an impassioned plea to Republicans to put country over party and to think about their own values rather than politics, but some of his points drew mixed reactions from the senators.\n\nWhen Schiff referenced a CBS report that a Trump confidante had told senators not vote against him or \"your head would be on a pike,\" Republican senators audibly voiced their disapproval, one of the first times in the trial.\n\n\"That's not true,\" Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, could be heard saying, along with several other senators.\n\nShe shook her head in disapproval.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., laughed at the remark, pulled out his fidget spinner, and started twirling it.\n\nSen. James Lankford, R-Okla., denied that Republicans had been told by Trump that their heads would be on a pike.\n\n“That is completely, totally false,” Lankford said. “All of us were shaking our heads.”\n\nLankford said it was an example of Schiff weaving facts and fiction together for his narrative of the case.\n\n“To cap it off that all these Republicans live in fear of the president, that their head will be on a pike,” Lankford said. “Not true.”\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, told reporters that Schiff \"lost me there\" when he brought up the pike comment, according to National Public Radio. But she said she did not mean that Schiff had lost her vote on whether to call witnesses or on the verdict. She said she is waiting to hear Trump's defense team before making her decisions.\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, said Schiff “could have used a different metaphor.” He said all his friends and colleagues across the aisle said it was not true, so “I believe them.\"\n\n– Nicholas Wu and Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff expects to be attacked by defense team\n\nWhen President Trump’s team takes the floor, Rep. Adam Schiff expects the defense to go after Schiff’s dramatic representation of Trump’s July phone call that he gave during a House hearing on the whistleblower complaint.\n\nIn Schiff’s closing remarks Friday, he said the defense team will likely attack the impeachment managers as terrible people, “especially that Schiff guy” who “mocked the president.”\n\nSchiff said he learned something significant by distilling Trump’s call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into what he called “the essence of what the president communicates.”\n\n“For a man who loves to mock others, he does not like to be mocked,” Schiff said. “Turns out he has a pretty thin skin. Who would have thought it?”\n\nAfter Schiff’s rendition at that September hearing, Trump suggested that Schiff should be arrested for “treason” and charged with “lying to Congress.”\n\nSchiff told senators that when they hear attacks on him and other managers, they should ask themselves “from what do they want to distract my attention?”\n\nWhat they don’t want you to do, Schiff said, is to “consider the president’s misconduct.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nThune: 'neither side wants any kind of closed session'\n\nDuring a break in trial proceedings, Republican senators suggested closed sessions would be kept to a minimum next week.\n\nThe resolution setting up rules for the trial allowed for senators to deliberate behind closed doors.\n\nSen. John Thune, R-S.D., the number-two Republican, told reporters, “neither side wants any kind of closed session.”\n\nSen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said he hoped there would be no closed sessions.\n\n“Going into closed session sort of invites suspicion and skepticism,” Cornyn said. “I think one of the advantages of this process compared to what the House did is, everything's transparent and the American people can see everything.”\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nLofgren: Nixon allowed witnesses to testify, unlike Trump\n\nHow much has President Trump stonewalled Congress? None of the other presidents who faced impeachment took the “extreme step” of stopping witnesses, argued California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, one of the House impeachment managers.\n\nEven President Richard Nixon let his senior staff testify, she said. She displayed a quote from Nixon saying all members of the White House staff would appear voluntarily, when requested, and will “answer fully” all proper questions.\n\nTrump, by contrast, called the impeachment inquiry invalid and directed executive branch employees to defy subpoenas, she said.\n\n“No president ever used the official power of his office to prevent witnesses from giving testimony to Congress in such a blanked and indiscriminate manner,” Lofgren said. “There is no telling how many government officials would have come forward if the president hadn’t issued this order.”\n\nFor example, Lofgren said, Trump stopped the testimony of officials in the budget office who were at the center of the president’s efforts to block congressionally approved aid to Ukraine.\n\n“If the Senate is prepared to accept that,” Lofgren said, “it will mean that not only President Trump, but all presidents after him will have veto power over Congress’ ability to conduct oversight.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nAfter interview, Pompeo cursed at NPR reporter, yelled\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo used the \"F-word\" and other expletives after a testy interview with a National Public Radio host on Friday, the news outlet said Friday.\n\nPompeo unloaded on NPR's Mary Louise Kelly after an interview in which she questioned him on Ukraine, Iran, and a host of other hot-button issues. He grew extremely irritated by Kelly's Ukraine questions, according to NPR.\n\n\"'Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?'\" Pompeo apparently shouted at Kelly after the interview.\n\nPompeo is scheduled to travel to Ukraine next week for a meeting with that country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a central figure in the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. Ukraine is a pivotal U.S. ally in the effort to counter Russian aggression.\n\nThe State Department said Pompeo is going to Kyiv to \"highlight U.S. support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" The Eastern European country is at war with Russia.\n\nIn an account released with the interview transcript, Kelly said she was taken to the secretary of State's private living room after the interview, where Pompeo was waiting for her. \"He shouted at me for about same amount of time as the interview itself. He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine,\" Kelly said.\n\nShe said he used the F-word and \"many others\" when he asking her if Americans cared about Ukraine. He then asked her if she could find Ukraine on a map.\n\n\"I said yes, and he called out for aides to bring us a map of the world with no writing. I pointed to Ukraine,\" she recounted.\n\nThen he said: \"'People will hear about this.'\"\n\n- Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nYou say FOIA, I say...lawyer?\n\nTexas Democrat Sylvia Garcia, one of the House Impeachment managers, made a point Friday of enunciating each letter of the acronym FOIA, which stands for the \"Freedom of Information Act,\" instead of the much shorter and commonly used \"FOIA\" (pronounced foy-ya).\n\nShe used the acronym in her presentation about attempts to obtain documents from the White House and other federal agencies related to Trump's impeachment investigation.\n\nIt may have been to prevent any confusion with the phrase “lawyer lawsuits,” which became a thing on Tuesday after a rant by White House lawyer Jay Sekulow.\n\n\"And by the way — lawyer lawsuits?\" Sekulow said during Tuesday’s 11-hour debate about trial rules and procedures.\n\n\"Lawyer lawsuits? We're talking about the impeachment of a president of the United States, duly elected, and the members — the managers are complaining about lawyer lawsuits? The Constitution allows lawyer lawsuits. It's disrespecting the Constitution of the United States to even say that in this chamber — lawyer lawsuits.\"\n\nHis comments, which drew blank stares, arched eyebrows and quizzical looks, came in response to a presentation by impeachment manager Val Demings, D-Fla., who mentioned “lawsuits under the Freedom of Information Act, a.k.a. FOIA lawsuits.”\n\nIn his rebuttal to Sekulow, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), said he had no clue whatsoever about what Sekulow meant.\n\nWhile some observers posited that Sekulow had confused “FOIA lawsuits” with “lawyer lawsuits,” White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland told reporters that Sekulow did not make a mistake.\n\n- John D’Anna\n\nTrump recording reignites debate on witnesses\n\nThe recording of President Donald Trump appearing to want to get rid of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, reignited the Senate debate Friday about whether to subpoena witnesses or documents in Trump’s impeachment trial.\n\nHouse Democrats have argued that Trump removed Yovanovitch, who was heavily criticized by the president’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to clear the way for Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. The recording published Friday by ABC News was of Trump with Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Giuliani.\n\n“I want to ask about the recording that has been released today because President Trump has said that he didn’t know Parnas and obviously he’s in a conversation with him about taking out one of his ambassadors,” said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. “We obviously have a right to that information. Hopefully we will have access to it.”\n\nThe recording:Recording shows Trump called for firing of former Ukraine ambassador, report says\n\nGillibrand said two witnesses she wanted most to hear from are former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Other officials have said Bolton opposed the pressure for Ukraine investigations and Mulvaney said such pressure is routine in diplomacy.\n\n“I would like to hear directly from him when he understood that, under what context and how many conversations he had with President Trump about it,” Gillibrand said. “I do think we’re getting closer to witnesses.”\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Friday it was more likely that witnesses would be called. “Yes,” she said.\n\nRepublicans such as Sen Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., have said more witnesses aren’t necessary. The Senate rejected subpoenas for Bolton and Mulvaney on party-line votes of 53-47, although more votes could called after opening arguments from House Democrats and Trump’s legal term.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff to senators: 'The next time, it just may be you’\n\nCalifornia Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead manager in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, tried to get senators to put themselves in the shoes of Joe Biden and Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nHow would they feel if the most powerful person in the world were asking a foreign nation to conduct a sham investigation into them? How would they react if, like Yovanovitch, they had devoted their life to public service, served in dangerous places around the world, only to be hounded out of their post? Schiff asked while speaking on the Senate floor Friday.\n\n“Because I will tell you something,” Schiff said. “The next time, it just may be you.”\n\nNo matter how close a senator may be to Trump now, he prodded them, do they have any doubt that Trump would investigate them if he felt it was in his interest?\n\n“If somewhere, deep down below, you realize that he would, you cannot leave a man like that in office,” he said. “It shouldn’t matter it was Joe Biden. It could be any of us. It may be any of us.”\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nSchiff: Trump's policy is 'Trump first, not America first'\n\nThe lead House impeachment manager, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., summarized the accusation that President Donald Trump abused the power of his office by arguing that withholding military aid from Ukraine hurt an ally, emboldened an adversary in Russia and undermined efforts to fight corruption abroad.\n\n“This is Trump first, not America first,” Schiff said.\n\n“The Constitution does not permit it because that conduct is the quintessential abuse of power,” Schiff added. “The use of official power for personal gain, putting personal interest over the national interest and putting personal benefits over our nation’s security.”\n\nSchiff said Americans might not understand why Ukraine, a small country, is important to the U.S. But he argued that Ukraine is hungry for reform after emerging from the former Soviet Union, which collapsed in what Russian President Vladimir Putin called the greatest catastrophe of the 20th Century.\n\nTrump’s willingness to pursue a political investigation of his rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, rather than the U.S. interest in helping an ally maintain its independence from Russia justifies removing the president from office, Schiff argued.\n\n“If someone sacrifices the national interest in favor of his own, and is not removed from office, our democracy is in jeopardy. It’s just that simple,” Schiff said. “The grave consequences of President Trump’s misconduct demand our attention.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nSchiff plays John McCain interview on Ukraine\n\nExplaining the importance of Ukraine to national security interests, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., brought in an interesting voice.\n\nSchiff played a clip of a television interview with the late Sen. John McCain, whom he called a war hero and statesman “who is no stranger to this body.”\n\nMcCain, Schiff said, recognized the threat posed when Russia took over parts of Ukrainian Crimea.\n\n“We are all Ukrainians,” McCain said at the time.\n\nIn the TV clip Schiff showed, McCain said that it would make Russia very nervous if Ukraine is able to thrive.\n\nShowcasing McCain may have been an attempt to appeal to Republicans who were close to him.\n\nOne of those Republicans, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham, has been one of Trump’s most vocal defenders.\n\nDuring the video of McCain, Graham seemed to show some emotion. He looked down at his desk and up at the video, before looking up towards the ceiling and blinking several times.\n\nRepublican senators were mostly stone-faced during the video. Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., told reporters the video strengthened a Democratic point that Republicans didn't need.\n\n“I don’t think they need to convince us that Ukraine is really important,” Cramer said. “I think it’s all to play for TV.\"\n\nSen. Any Klobuchar, D-Minn., also a Democratic presidential candidate, said the video had a “strong” message for her colleagues.\n\n“I kept thinking if John McCain was in the chamber today, or if he had heard the aid had been withdrawn, it might have been a different story,” she told reporters.\n\n- Maureen Groppe and Nicholas Wu\n\nJeffries asks: 'Who ordered the cover-up?'\n\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., raised the specter that someone directed the National Security Council’s top lawyer to put a transcript of President Donald Trump’s July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on a secure server.\n\nDid anyone senior to attorney John Eisenberg direct him to hide it? Why did it remain on the server even after this so-called error was discovered? Jeffries asked rhetorically.\n\n“Who ordered the cover-up of the call record?” he asked senators. “The American people deserve to know.”\n\nJeffries, who is helping make the House manager’s argument that Trump obstructed Congress, said there are many outstanding questions because Eisenberg refused to testify. Other officials testified that Eisenberg ordered that access to the transcript be restricted after he was told what it contained, Jeffries said.\n\nThat strongly suggests, Jeffries continued, that senior officials attempted to conceal, rather than address, Trump’s misconduct. The cover-up continued, he said, after a whistleblower filed a complaint about the call. That prompted a two-part strategy to block Congress and the public from learning about the call while trying to convince Trump to lift his hold on military assistance to Ukraine before anyone could find out what was happening, Jeffries argued.\n\nAfter Eisenberg and White House counsel Pat Cipollone reportedly briefed Trump on the whisteblower’s complaint, Jeffries said, the White House’s Office of Legal Council issued a secret opinion concluding that the complaint did not have to be shared with Congress.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nDemocrats stress importance of delaying aid to Ukraine\n\nDemocratic House impeachment manager Jason Crow, D-Colo. said President Donald Trump’s defenders might argue that the suspension in $391 million in military aid wasn’t important because it was short-lived and the money was eventually released.\n\n“This defense would be laughable if this issue wasn’t so serious,” said Crow, a former Army Ranger. “No, the delay wasn’t meaningless. Just ask the Ukrainians sitting in trenches now.”\n\nUkraine needed the funding because it had been invaded by Russia and was fighting for its territorial integrity. Crow played a video of Jennifer Williams, a State Department aide assigned to Vice President Mike Pence’s office, who attended a Sept. 1 meeting between Pence and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n“President Zelensky explained that equally with the financial and fiscal value, that it was the symbolic nature of that assistance that really was the show of U.S. support for Ukraine and for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Williams said, in her testimony during the House inquiry. “He was stressing that to the vice president, to really underscore the need for the security assistance to be released.”\n\nCrow argued that Trump only released the money to use it as leverage to pressure Ukraine into investigating his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n“The scheme was unraveling,” Crow said. “He only released it after he got caught.”\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nFinal day of Democrat's opening arguments begins\n\nHouse Democrats prosecuting the Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump resumed their arguments Friday.\n\nOn the final day of impeachment managers' opening arguments, they'll focus on the charge of obstruction of Congress, and how rejecting witnesses in the trial would further obstruct Congress.\n\nThe lead manager, Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said if Trump or his legal team claimed executive privilege to block testimony from witnesses such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, that would add to the obstruction.\n\nThe Senate rejected proposals to subpoena witnesses before the opening arguments on party-line votes of 53 to 47. The rules from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., call for more votes on witnesses after the opening arguments from the House and White House lawyers are over, and after up to 16 hours of questions from senators.\n\nFact-check:Fact-checking the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump\n\nSchiff urged senators not to reject witnesses at that point.\n\nTrump and some congressional Republicans have said he could block testimony from top aides such as Bolton and Mulvaney under executive privilege, to protect confidential advice for future presidents. But Schiff said executive privilege can’t be used to hide misconduct.\n\nThe House managers are expected to finish their argument about abuse of power by early afternoon and then conclude their opening argument on its third day with a discussion of obstruction of Congress, Schiff said.\n\n- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump team to begin defense Saturday at 10 a.m. EST\n\nRight before the House managers began their final day of arguments, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., announced that the president’s team would begin its defense at 10 a.m. EST on Saturday and the session will run “for several hours.”\n\nLike the House managers, the defense team has up to 24 hours spread over three days to make their case.\n\nJay Sekulow, one of Trump’s private lawyers, later told reporters his team will stop around 1 p.m. EST Saturday, at the request of senators, and resume Monday.\n\n“The Senate asked for an accommodation,” he said. “We were prepared to go as long as they wanted us to go tomorrow.”\n\nSekulow said he hasn’t determined how much overall time they’ll need.\n\n“Trust me,” he added. “There’ll be plenty to cover.”\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, one of eight House lawmakers who are part of Trump's defense team, told reporters Friday that the team is “very confident” because all of the facts are on the president’s side.\n\n“I think this case is open and shut for the president,” Jordan said.\n\n--Maureen Groppe\n\nThe witness question:Senators worry that asking for new impeachment trial witnesses could create lengthy executive privilege debate\n\nGraham: ‘I admire Joe Biden’ but …\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., had some kind words for former Vice President Joe Biden. Sort of.\n\nThe staunch Trump ally questioned his former Senate colleague’s judgment for allowing his son, Hunter, to join the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014 as the Ukraine gas company was under investigation because of its oligarch owner.\n\n“As much as I like Joe Biden — and I do respect him and I do admire him. I’ve traveled the world with him,\" Graham began.\n\n\"I think it’s bad foreign policy, if you’re going to be in charge of dealing with corruption in Ukraine, that your son hook up with the most corrupt company in the Ukraine and turn Ukraine into an ATM machine,” Graham said during a Friday morning news conference on Capitol Hill.\n\nBiden has often cited his role in rooting out corruption in Ukraine during the Obama administration.\n\nWhen you put your family member in that situation, it’s not good folks,” Graham continued. “The vice president said he didn’t know anything about it. That questions how hard he was looking.”\n\nOne of the impeachment managers, Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, spent her presentation Thursday trying to poke holes in that Republican argument.\n\nShe argued that Trump urged Ukraine to investigate a debunked theory that Biden was protecting his son from an anti-corruption effort because Biden was leading polls as the Democratic challenger to Trump.\n\n“The entire premise of the investigation that the president wanted Ukraine to pursue was false,” Garcia said. “There is simply no evidence – nothing, nada – in the record to support this baseless allegation.”\n\n- Ledyard King\n\nAlexander says he'll wait to decide on witnesses, documents\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., a potential Republican swing vote on subpoenaing witnesses and documents, said Friday that he'll wait to decide on whether additional evidence should be compelled until after the first stage of the trial.\n\nSpeaking after a briefing with health officials on the coronavirus outbreak, Alexander said that once the initial presentations from both sides are over, his question would be “do we need more evidence? Do we need to hear witnesses? Do we need more documents? And I think that question can only be answered then.”\n\n“As the house managers have said many times, they presented us with a mountain of overwhelming evidence so we have a lot to consider,” he said.\n\nRepublicans control the Senate by a 53-47 majority, meaning at least four Republicans would have to join all Democrats to vote to call more witnesses and documents in the trial.\n\nAlexander is one of a handful of GOP senators that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer presumably was appealing to Friday when he made a pitch to allow more witnesses and documents.\n\n“We’re seeking the truth at a momentous time in the American republic,” Schumer said. “It is on the shoulders of four Republican senators to join us in demanding it. We’ve made the argument forcefully. The American people have made the argument forcefully that they want to truth. Will four Republican senators, just four, rise to the occasion, do their duty to the constitution, to their country to seek the truth?”\n\nSchumer did not name names, but the Republican senators seen as potentially open to more witnesses and documents include Alexander, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah.\n\n– Nicholas Wu and Ledyard King\n\nTrump not happy with Saturday TV slot for his team's opening arguments\n\nWASHINGTON – President Donald Trump's beef with the impeachment schedule? His lawyers must start presenting his case on a Saturday – a bad day for television ratings.\n\nIn one of a series of Friday morning tweets slamming the Senate impeachment trial, Trump took aim not only at Rep. Adam Schiff, D-CA, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, but the timing of his side's arguments.\n\n\"After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud & deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer & their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V.,\" Trump said in an early morning round of tweets Friday.\n\nThe former star of The Apprentice is no novice when it comes to understanding television ratings.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n'Truth matters': Schiff sets up Friday arguments\n\n\"Right matters. And the truth matters. Otherwise, we are lost.\"\n\nWith those words, House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff Thursday night tried to drive home the abuse of power charge the House filed against President Donald Trump that's at the center of the Senate impeachment trial. The trial resumes Friday at 1 p.m. with the California Democrat and other House managers laying out their case for the second impeachment article: obstruction of Congress.\n\nUnbiased jury:Can senators who have already voiced opinions do 'impartial justice' at Trump impeachment trial?\n\nClosing words:What was the Senate chamber like while Rep. Adam Schiff made his final Thursday speech?\n\nIn his closing speech Thursday, Schiff drew from U.S. Army Col. Alexander Vindman’s gripping testimony that he delivered to the House in November. In that hearing Vindman, a National Security Council official expressed deep concerns about the president's efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including Joe Biden.\n\n“If right doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter how good the constitution is,” Schiff told the rapt chamber. \"The framers could not protect us from ourselves if right and truth don’t matter. And you know what (Trump) did was not right.\"\n\nFriday's argument: Trump obstructed Congress\n\nHouse Democrats will focus on the accusation that President Donald Trump obstructed Congress when they resume and complete their opening argument Friday in the Senate trial.\n\nThe seven prosecutors, who are called managers, spent Wednesday outlining the two articles against Trump and detailing the evidence they gathered for the accusations of abuse of power and obstruction. They spent Thursday outlining the legal and constitutional reasons that they said the evidence justified the charge of abuse of power.\n\nImpeachment player:The middleman: How Lev Parnas joined Team Trump and became Rudy Giuliani's fixer in Ukraine\n\nOn Friday, the managers will explain how the law and Constitution apply to the evidence for obstruction. Schiff, the lead manager, said Thursday that the arguments condensed hundreds of hours of depositions and testimony, but that there might be repetition in the presentations as more context is provided.\n\n“We will now show you these facts and many others and how they are interwoven,” Schiff said. “You will see some of these facts and videos therefore in a new context, in a new light, in the light of what else we know and why it compels a finding of guilt and conviction. So there is some method to our madness.”\n\nThe third session of up to eight hours will complete the opening argument from House Democrats. Trump’s legal team is expected to begin Saturday up to 24 hours of opening argument spanning three sessions.\n\n“We’re going to respond of course to what the House managers have put forward,” Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s private lawyers, told reporters Wednesday. “And we’re going to make an affirmative case defending the president.”\n\nRepublican senators eager to hear from Trump’s defense team.\n\n“There’s all kinds of allegations that have been thrown up in the air and so they'll have a chance to lay out their timeline, their version of events,” said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.\n\nIn focusing on abuse of power Thursday, another manager, Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Trump could have been impeached just for asking Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. But Nadler said Trump went further, withholding $391 million in vital military aid and a White House meeting.\n\n\"Since President George Washington took office in 1789, no president has abused his power in this way,\" Nadler said. \"No president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections.\"\n\nNadler said the accusation of obstruction stems from Trump directing his administration to defy all subpoenas for testimony and documents during the investigation.\n\n“The articles are overwhelmingly supported by the evidence amassed by the House, notwithstanding the president’s complete stonewalling, his attempt to block all witnesses and all documents from the United States Congress,” Nadler said. “It puts even President Nixon to shame.”\n\nContributing: David Jackson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/24"}]}

It's often associated with black or dark magic, but not all practitioners of witchcraft use it with \"bad\" intentions. In fact, most practices are benign and often used as a form of empowerment.\n\nAs a practice, witchcraft dates back as early as the 10th century, and it grew around the 15th century, Fabrizio Conti, Ph.D., historian and lecturer in history at John Cabot University in Rome, told USA TODAY in 2022.\n\nConti said scholars are divided on how witchcraft is represented in different areas; some believe all witchcraft shares the same elements and beliefs everywhere, while others think certain mythologies in witchcraft are found in specific geographical locations and not in others, defining witchcraft as more individual, cultural and regional.\n\nWicca, which is among the largest pagan groups whose followers often practice witchcraft, has exploded in recent decades, the USA TODAY Network reported in 2021. The numbers of Americans who identify with Wicca or paganism has risen from 134,000 in 2001 to nearly 2 million, Helen Berger, a resident scholar at Brandeis University's Women's Studies Research Center, told the USA TODAY Network at the time.\n\n'We're in the middle of a witch moment':Hip witchcraft is on the rise in the US\n\nWhen and how did witchcraft become a crime?\n\nIn the 15th century, Heinrich Kramer wrote the \"Malleus Maleficarum,\" which translates to \"The Hammer of Witches.” The book popularized the idea that witchcraft was the act of performing evil acts and spells, particularly against men.\n\nThe book caused witch-hunts and trials in Europe, where witchcraft was a crime.\n\nIn the U.S., more than 200 people were accused of practicing witchcraft in the Salem witch trials between 1692 and 1693, which led to 19 people being hanged.\n\nMore coverage from the USA TODAY Network\n\nAre witches real?Of course!

Reed said the two-month process leading to the vote showed that he was wrong to tell companies how far the city has come. If the vote failed, he said, he would be forced to tell businesses that value diversity and inclusiveness that “maybe this isn’t the place for that project because I can’t stand behind it. Maybe this isn’t the place for what your employees are looking for because I can’t tell you in good faith that this city ... shares your values and your vision.” He also threatened to give Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin’s cellphone number to those businesses. Birmingham’s council passed a similar ordinance in 2017. “They’ve learned from their mistakes,” Reed said. Councilwoman Audrey Graham, who voted against the Montgomery ordinance, asked Reed if he’s serious about that threat. He responded: “Those individuals that ask me an honest question, then I’m going to give them an honest answer.” The ordinance would have made it illegal to discriminate against a range of groups in the areas of public accommodation, housing and employment, as well as in all city practices, including contracting.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A federal judge on Wednesday threw out Trump administration approvals for a large planned oil project on Alaska’s North Slope, saying the federal review was flawed and didn’t include mitigation measures for polar bears. U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason in Anchorage vacated permits for ConocoPhillips’ Willow Project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska in a 110-page ruling. The Trump administration approved the project in late 2020, and the Biden administration defended the project in court. Rebecca Boys, a ConocoPhillips spokesperson, said the company would review Gleason’s decision “and evaluate the options available regarding this project.” Spokespersons for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Interior Department said their agencies had no comment. The Bureau of Land Management conducted the environmental review of the project that Gleason found flawed. Conservation groups and Sovereign Inupiat for a Living Arctic, described as a grassroots organization, had challenged the adequacy of the review process. Karlin Itchoak, Alaska director for The Wilderness Society, in a statement called the ruling “a step toward protecting public lands and the people who would be most negatively impacted by the BLM’s haphazard greenlighting of the Willow project.”\n\nArizona\n\nBullhead City: Employees in a northwestern Arizona school district cannot discuss vaccination status or mask-wearing with students under a motion approved unanimously by the local school board. The edict from the Colorado River Union High School District Governing Board carries no repercussions for administrators, staff or teachers who violate it. That would be up to Superintendent Monte Silk, who supported the motion. The debate over masks and vaccines in schools has been heated. At least 26 school districts in Arizona have enacted their own mask mandates, even as Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has tried to prevent them and threatened schools with a loss of funding. Those school districts account for nearly 300,000 students and 450 schools, mostly around Phoenix and Tucson. The Colorado River Union High School District’s gag rule, however, is rare. Board member Ashley Gerich, who calls herself a “non-vaxxer,” requested the item be put on the board’s agenda this week. She said a couple of students, including her daughter, told her conversations about the vaccine made them feel uncomfortable, the Mohave Daily News reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Three parents are suing over a northwest Arkansas school district’s decision to require face masks after a judge blocked the state’s mask mandate ban. The lawsuit filed Wednesday over the Bentonville School District’s mandate argues the local school board had no authority to impose the requirement. The parents are asking a Benton County judge to temporarily block the district from enforcing the ban while they challenge it. The parents are “forced to choose either to exercise their fundamental liberty interests in refusing to place face coverings on their children against their will or for the children to face expulsion from school,” the lawsuit said. Public health officials have urged schools to require masks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus due to the highly contagious delta variant. Arkansas ranks fourth in the country for new cases per capita, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University researchers. More than 70 public school districts and charter schools have imposed mask mandates since Arkansas’ ban against them was blocked. The requirements cover more than half of the state’s public school students. “Our legal counsel is currently reviewing the matter and we look forward to a vigorous defense of our district,” Leslee Wright, a spokeswoman for the Bentonville School District, said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A major Southern California water agency has declared a water supply alert for the first time in seven years and is asking residents to voluntarily conserve. The Los Angeles Times reports the board of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California took the step Tuesday, hoping to lessen the need for more severe actions such as reducing water supplies to member agencies. The move came a day after U.S. officials declared the first-ever water shortage on the Colorado River, a key water source for Southern California. “This is a wake-up call for what lies ahead,” said Deven Upadhyay, chief operating officer for the district that supplies water to 19 million Californians, from the Los Angeles area to U.S.-Mexico border. “We cannot overstate the seriousness of this drought,” he said. “Conditions are getting worse, and more importantly, we don’t know how long it will last.” Gov. Gavin Newsom last month asked Californians to scale back water use, and many of the state’s counties, mostly in Central and Northern California, are already under a state of drought emergency. Concern about water supplies spread to the state’s heavily populated southern region following a winter of low precipitation and shrinking reservoirs throughout the West.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: Forest Service officials said Wednesday that Hanging Lake Trail, a popular tourist destination in western Colorado, will be closed for the rest of the summer season and likely beyond because of extensive damage caused by large mudslides in late July. The announcement came after a preliminary assessment earlier in the week that revealed damaged and destroyed bridges, as well as large sections of the trail blocked by debris and mud. “The Hanging Lake Trail is not safe and impassable in some areas and will remain closed for the foreseeable future,” said White River National Forest Supervisor Scott Fitzwilliams. “The debris flows we saw in July are probably not the last we will see, so there could be additional damage in the weeks and months ahead.” The trail leads to the emerald-colored Hanging Lake, which is designated as a National Natural Landmark and is about 1,000 feet up a side canyon of Glenwood Canyon. The lake was discolored by mud flows that resulted from a wildfire that torched the area last summer. “The good news is that the water in Hanging Lake is clearing from the debris flow, the boardwalk at the lake wasn’t damaged, and the fish are still swimming,” Fitzwilliams said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nAshford: Ground was broken Wednesday at the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp for seriously ill children to replace buildings that burned to the ground in a February fire. The Feb. 12 blaze at the camp founded by the late actor Paul Newman destroyed a section of the eastern Connecticut camp that was made to look like the center of an Old West town. It had housed the camp’s woodworking shop, the arts and crafts area, the camp store, and its educational kitchen. Camp officials said they have received 4,500 donations for the rebuild, including a $1 million match from Travelers and the Travelers Championship golf tournament and a $1 million gift from Newman’s Own Foundation. That will allow the camp to build a new, accessible single-level “creative complex” that will not only replace what was lost but also include new features, such as a quiet sensory area for campers and dedicated space for parents and caregivers. “We want to dedicate this moment to everyone who helped us heal and made us whole again,” said Jimmy Canton, the Hole in the Wall Gang Camp’s chief executive officer. “Your kindness was the bridge that brought us from grief to gratitude, and your friendship is why we are able to celebrate this milestone.”\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Police are investigating after photos of two officers who appear to be sleeping in their patrol vehicles were posted on social media. Police said in a Facebook post Tuesday that the department was looking into the matter and that such “behavior is unacceptable to our agency, unfair to our citizens, and certainly outside of department policy.” One photo shows an officer leaned back in his driver’s seat with his eyes shut and his mouth partially open. The other shows an officer leaned back in a police SUV driver’s seat facing away from the car window and toward a computer screen. The officers, who have not been named, were scheduled to meet with command staff late Tuesday, police spokesman Sgt. Mark Hoffman said. The department’s code of conduct states that the health, well-being and overall safety of officers is a top priority. Police said in a statement that officers are encouraged not to operate vehicles when fatigued and urged to speak with a supervisor “so proper measures can be taken” if they feel unwell or unusually fatigued. “With that being said, there is no language that allows such activity,” the department said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Canceled because of the pandemic 16 months ago, Honor Flights to Washington resumed Wednesday, WUSA-TV reports. The program brings veterans from around the nation to D.C. to see the memorials built in their honor. The flights and tours are free. At the World War II Memorial, 113 veterans were visiting Wednesday from the Honor Flight hub in Chicago. “Probably the most touching moments are watching watching the veterans reflect as they look at the Wall of Stars,” said David Smith, president of the Honor Flight Network. “There are over 400,000 stars there; it represents those that were lost.” Wednesday’s visit honored three veterans from World War II, 34 who served in the Korean War, and 76 veterans of the Vietnam conflict.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The number of U.S. tourists who came to Sunshine State in the second quarter of this year has returned to pre-pandemic levels, though the international market is still lagging, according to figures released Thursday. Florida received about 30.6 million domestic visitors from April through June, a 6% increase over the same time in 2019 and a 216% jump from the same time last year, during the height of COVID-19 pandemic closures, state tourism marketing firm Visit Florida said in a news release. Overall, the state had 31.4 million visitors in the second quarter of this year, an increase of 220% from the same period a year earlier. Florida’s international market has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels due in part to restrictions on entering the United States. Florida welcomed only 1.1 million visitors from overseas and Canada in the second quarter of this year, compared to 3.5 million visitors in the second quarter of 2019. During the spring of 2020, Florida’s major theme parks and hotels around the state were either shuttered or had limited operations due to the pandemic. As of Thursday, though, Walt Disney World is tweaking its face mask policy, allowing visitors to choose whether to wear face coverings in outdoor lines, outdoor theaters and outdoor attractions. Masks had been required previously.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Health care providers at some of the state’s largest hospital systems warned Thursday about the increasing toll of the latest coronavirus surge on younger patients, hospital staffs and health care capacity as they implored people to get vaccinated, wear masks and avoid large gatherings. The guidance came as the state’s hospitals – already struggling with rising patient numbers – brace for even higher COVID-19 case counts that could surpass a winter peak. “The unfortunate thing is we don’t have the luxury of saying, ‘We’re full, and we’re closed,’ ” said Robert Jansen, chief medical officer at Atlanta’s Grady Health System. “We’re not a hotel, so people will continue to come and our staff will continue to cope, and we’ll continue to find places to take care of these patients, but it is going to be difficult, and it’s not going to be easy, and it won’t make people happy.” Jansen said the hospital’s emergency room is facing a “tsunami” of patients infected with the delta variant of the coronavirus, forcing staff to divert ambulances to other hospitals for quicker care. As at other hospitals in the state, the influx is primarily people who are unvaccinated.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: Officials on the Big Island are considering closing beaches and canceling the Ironman World Championship in response to a surge of coronavirus cases. “Right now our numbers are skyrocketing. It’s a shame because we as a county have been doing a great job,” Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth told County Council members. “But we let down our guards – I let down my guard.” The administration is revising its emergency rules and will submit the changes to Gov. David Ige for approval, West Hawaii Today reports. That revision could include a return to restrictions at parks and beaches that allow people to cross the sand only to get to the ocean to surf, swim or fish but not to gather or sit. Similar restrictions were enacted across Hawaii during the peak of the pandemic last year. The Ironman World Championship is currently set for Oct. 9 in Kailua-Kona. Roth said a decision would be made soon about whether the event could go on. “Unfortunately, it doesn’t look too positive for Ironman this year,” the mayor said. “The question with Ironman is what do you do with all the people who come to spectate.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Students across the state lost some academic ground during the coronavirus pandemic, with standardized testing scores dropping in math and language arts compared to 2019. The Idaho Department of Education released the Idaho Standardized Achievement Test scores Tuesday. The test – required under federal rules – is typically administered to students in third through eighth grades and 10th grade each spring. But the 2020 test was canceled after the federal requirement was temporarily lifted as schools closed amid the coronavirus pandemic. For the 2021 round of testing, students showed the biggest decline in math skills, with 39.6% of students testing at “proficient” or “advanced” levels this spring, compared to 44.4% two years ago. English language arts skills had a smaller drop, with just over 54% of students scoring as proficient or advanced compared to 55% in 2019. “The onset of the pandemic in spring 2020 disrupted the ISAT along with all Idaho school operations, so we weren’t surprised that scores did not continue the gradual upward trend of the previous few years of testing,” Superintendent of Public Instruction Sherri Ybarra said in a statement. “We expected an impact, and now we can use these results to move forward to rebuild academic performance.”\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: Some residents are crying foul over a proposed museum for women’s baseball in a city that had one of the sport’s most successful teams in the 1940s. A zoning board postponed a decision Tuesday on a permit for the project at Beyer Park. The Rockford Park District is willing to sell an acre of the park to the International Women’s Baseball Center. A group called Friends of Beyer Stadium said it supports the concept but has acquired land directly west of Beyer Park.“Shame on you,” said Greg Schwanke, president of Friends of Beyer Stadium. “I spent 14 years out there building this place and turned it into a national attraction for the city of Rockford. We’re not going down. We’re fighting all of the way.” The Rockford Peaches of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League played at Beyer Stadium. The team was featured in the 1992 movie “A League of Their Own,” with Tom Hanks, Madonna and Geena Davis. The International Women’s Baseball Center is launching a $10 million fundraising campaign for construction of a museum and activity center. “We’ve had people already calling us from outside the area asking us when the museum is going to open,” said Rosemary Collins, a retired judge involved with the group. “They will travel here to see it. It will have an economic boon for the entire area.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Facing a pandemic unlike any his predecessors have seen, Gov. Eric Holcomb on Wednesday announced the formation of a public health commission that will spend the next year finding ways to improve the overall health of Hoosiers. While COVID-19 response will figure into the work of the 15-person commission, Holcomb said the panel’s scope would go far beyond this latest crisis. “We’ve got our game plan right now to continue to work through the pandemic,” he said. “That’s not what this commission or this task force is about. This is a long-term look at where we want our state to be decades from now.” Holcomb tapped longtime Republican politician Luke Kenley and former state health commissioner Dr. Judy Monroe to co-chair the body. The group will convene for the first time next month and is expected to issue a report by next summer, in time for 2023 budget discussions, Holcomb said. Over the past year, Holcomb has weathered criticism from all sides for his handling of the pandemic. Some have complained that he has not done enough to halt the spread of the coronavirus, lifting restrictions like the mask mandate too soon. Others have complained that he overreached his authority in taking steps such as that mask mandate.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds said the state would welcome refugees from Afghanistan who want to resettle in Iowa, saying their situation is much different from the immigrants coming across the U.S.-Mexico border whom the Republican governor refused to accept in April. Reynolds and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst discussed plans to take refugees while attending the Iowa State Fair on Wednesday. “We’re working with the State Department right now; we’re offering our opportunity to settle here in Iowa,” Ernst said. The Republican senator said she is working with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., to push the U.S. Department of State to allow as many people as possible to qualify for the Special Immigrant Visa Program, designed to aid people who worked with the U.S. military as interpreters or translators in Iraq or Afghanistan. The U.S. Bureau of Refugee Services has said Iowa could take as many as 2,000 refugees a year, and Reynolds didn’t disagree with that number. “We’ll work with them to determine what that looks like and just make sure we have a process in place and we have families and homes for them to go,” she said. “We want to be a partner, we want them here, and we want them to know that.” In April Reynolds said she rejected a federal request to accept migrant children from the U.S.-Mexico border, saying that “is the president’s problem.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Officials in some communities are battling a rise in COVID-19 cases by mandating masks for kids, issuing emergency orders and requiring vaccines. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Kansas has risen over the past two weeks from 605.14 new cases per day Aug. 3 to 797.14 new cases per day Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In the Lawrence area, Douglas County leaders approved a health order Wednesday that will require children ages 2 to 12 to wear masks while in indoor public spaces. The decision followed four hours of public comment that included jeering and interruptions from a largely maskless crowd, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. Douglas County’s health officer, Dr. Thomas Marcellino was momentarily drowned out by laughter and heckling from the crowd when he tried to explain the reasoning for the order. One person called him a liar and disgusting, and some in the crowd started chanting “no more masks.” One public commenter even compared maskless children being excluded from activities to racial segregation. There are various exceptions to the proposed order, including youth with a medical condition, mental health condition or disability that prevents wearing a face covering.\n\nKentucky\n\nPine Top: During a five-year span that ended last year, Kentucky State Police fatally shot at least 41 people – more than any other law enforcement agency in the commonwealth, according to a published report. Police declined to release the numbers, but the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting and the Marshall Project built a database using a combination of publicly available data and state police records, according to an article the entities published in partnership with the Lexington Herald-Leader. The report said Kentucky troopers killed more people in rural communities than any other department in the nation, according to the partnership’s analysis of data compiled by the Washington Post. None of the 41 fatal shootings resulted in troopers being prosecuted. Of those killed, about 75% were armed, and a majority were suffering from addiction or mental health problems, according to the investigation. Kentucky State Police investigate shootings with no outside oversight, a practice some experts and prosecutors say is problematic. “I don’t think it should be done,” said Dave Stengel, the former commonwealth’s attorney in Louisville. He said there is potential for conflicts of interest. “Everybody knows everybody else.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A civilian Pentagon official ordered the Army Corps of Engineers on Wednesday to conduct a full environmental assessment of a $9.4 billion Formosa Plastics complex planned in the state, drawing praise from environmentalists. Jaime Pinkham, the Army’s acting assistant secretary for civil works, ordered the review after a virtual meeting with opponents of a Corps wetlands permit that allowed Formosa Plastics Group member FG LA LLC to build 10 chemical plants and four other major facilities on the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Critics praised the decision. “The Army Corps has finally heard our pleas and understands our pain. With God’s help, Formosa Plastics will soon pull out of our community,” said a statement by Sharon Lavigne, who founded the local group Rise St. James to fight the planned complex announced in 2018. Formosa, based in Taiwan, wants to produce polyethylene, polypropylene, polymer and ethylene glycol on 2,400 acres in St. James Parish. Dubbed the Sunshine Project because it’s near the Sunshine Bridge, the project is expected to provide 1,200 permanent jobs and up to 8,000 construction jobs, the state has said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Several music venues plan to require vaccinations for concertgoers. State Theater, Thompson’s Point and Portland House of Music are among those in the city requiring COVID-19 shots or a negative test for the coronavirus. Elsewhere, the Opera House at Boothbay Harbor and Stone Mountain Arts Center in Brownfield are also requiring proof of vaccination. The marquee sign above State Theater says: “Vaccines are a gateway drug to concerts.” “We hope we can keep our doors open, and we need your support and understanding to do so,” the Portland House of Music said. The announcements come amid a surge in the delta variant of the coronavirus, which now accounts for virtually all infections in Maine. Meanwhile, the University of Maine System is requiring all students, faculty, staff and visitors to wear wear face coverings inside its buildings. The new policy applies to all, regardless of vaccination status. “With our classrooms and other indoor spaces no longer set up to impose social distancing, face coverings are an important strategy we can employ to effectively control the transmission of COVID, regardless of an individual’s vaccination status and testing participation,” Chancellor Dannel Malloy wrote. Bates College has adopted a similar requirement at its Lewiston campus.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has filed a lawsuit against Shore Transit after the public transit agency refused to display PETA advertisements on its buses. The animal rights group applied to display two advertisements on Shore Transit buses in May 2020. Both advertisements read: “No One Needs to Kill to Eat. Close the slaughterhouses: Save the workers, their families, and the animals.” Shore Transit denied the application, saying the advertisements violated its advertising policy. The agency prohibits advertisements that are “political, controversial, offensive, objectionable or in poor taste,” according to the suit. However, PETA claims Shore Transit does not have any written guidance for following these terms. PETA alleges that by denying the application, Shore Transit violated the First and 14th Amendments. In July 2021, PETA renewed its application to advertise, and it says it has not received a response. PETA filed the lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court. The American Civil Liberties Union is representing PETA. The suit names Shore Transit, Shore Transit Director Brad Bellacicco and the Tri-County Council for the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland as defendants. Shore Transit offers public transportation in Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset counties.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: More than three centuries after a woman was wrongly convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to death, she’s finally on the verge of being exonerated, thanks to a curious eighth grade civics class. State Sen. Diana DiZoglio, D-Methuen, has introduced legislation to clear the name of Elizabeth Johnson Jr., who was condemned in 1693 at the height of the Salem Witch Trials but never executed. DiZoglio said she was inspired by sleuthing done by a group of 13- and 14-year-olds at North Andover Middle School. Civics teacher Carrie LaPierre’s students painstakingly researched Johnson and the steps that would need to be taken to make sure she was formally pardoned. “It is important that we work to correct history,” DiZoglio said Wednesday. “We will never be able to change what happened to these victims, but at the very least, we can set the record straight.” If lawmakers approve the measure, Johnson will be the last accused witch to be cleared, according to Witches of Massachusetts Bay, a group devoted to the history and lore of the 17th-century witch hunts. In the 328 years since a frenzy of Puritan injustice that began in 1692, dozens of suspects officially were cleared, including Johnson’s own mother, the daughter of a minister whose conviction eventually was reversed. But for some reason, Johnson’s name wasn’t included in various legislative attempts to set the record straight.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: In need of quick cash and find yourself in a forest? Well, you may have an opportunity on your hands. The state Department of Natural Resources is offering $75 for bushels of pine cones for the month of September. The agency is in need of these for replanting purposes, refilling forests with new conifer trees. But the DNR is requesting a specific kind of cone: the red pine cone, marked by its craggy, reddish bark and 4- to 6-inch needles that grow in pairs. The DNR notes that Scotch and Austrian pine cones will not be accepted. Scotch cones are marked by their flayed and thick bark, while Austrian cones are more orb-like than red cones. Cones should be picked off the tree, as fallen cones are usually too old or wet. And one can tell the age of the cone from the way the scales are arranged. The scales should be closed with a hint of green or purple. All brown and they’re too far gone. The correct kind of bag is being distributed at select DNR locations. The cones will be processed in machines that harvest their seeds, which will be used to replenish the in-high-demand red pine, among other initiatives to refill Michigan forests.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: A wildfire in the Superior National Forest that crews have been fighting since the weekend has grown to 61/ 4 square miles, but U.S. Forest Service officials said Thursday morning that it grew little overnight. The Forest Service said lightning caused the fire first spotted Sunday near Greenwood Lake, about 25 miles southwest of Isabella. It grew from 5 square miles to 61/ 4 by Wednesday evening, after what officials described as a “very active” afternoon of expansion on its western flank. But in an update posted Thursday morning, Forest Service officials said there was no significant change overnight, which is often the case with forest fires. Thursday’s forecast in the area called for continued hot, dry weather, with thunderstorms expected Friday night and Saturday. The fire led authorities to evacuate about 75 homes Monday near McDougal Lake, just north of where the fire started. Many dwellings in the area, which is deep in the forest, are seasonal cabins. Some small portions of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area to the north and northeast have been closed as a precaution due to the blaze, and two smaller fires spotted over the weekend in the wilderness. No injuries or damage to structures has been reported. Crews are also fighting several smaller wildfires in northeastern Minnesota.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s only pediatric hospital is treating its largest number of COVID-19 cases so far during the pandemic, the hospital said Thursday. Children’s of Mississippi is part of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. “Today, Children’s of Mississippi and the University of Mississippi Medical Center reported 28 children with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, the highest number of pediatric COVID-19 patients at the state’s only children’s hospital since the beginning of the pandemic,” the hospital said on Facebook. “Of these hospitalized children, 100% are unvaccinated. This number includes eight children in the ICU, including five who are too young to receive the vaccine.” Meanwhile, state health officials say almost 1,000 hospital beds that could be used to treat patients during the latest surge of coronavirus are unstaffed because of a shortage of health care workers. Mississippi is facing a record number of people hospitalized with the virus – 1,633 on Tuesday, according to the state Department of Health – and has the highest per capita rate of new COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 case tracker.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Two employees are suing Springfield Public Schools over the district’s mandatory racial equity training, which they contend violates their rights and is an “unconstitutional condition of employment.” The federal lawsuit was filed Wednesday by Jennifer Lumley, a records secretary for the special services department, and Brooke Henderson, who works on plans for students with disabilities. Henderson is a member of Back on Track America and has frequently accused the district of inserting critical race theory into its training. Critical race theory, which studies America’s history through the lens of racism, is not mentioned in the lawsuit. But the women allege the term “equity” and other phrases used during the training are code for the theory, which they contend conditions “individuals to see each other’s skin color first and foremost.” All employees were required to take the training during the 2020-21 school year or lose pay. As part of the training, they were required to commit to equity and becoming “anti-racist educators,” according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed against the district, its school board and four district officials. Stephen Hall, spokesman for the district, said the district is prepared to defend its equity efforts and is confident the court will find the lawsuit is without merit.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana State University and the University of Montana are telling everyone to wear masks indoors on campus. Montana State University President Waded Cruzado and University of Montana President Seth Bodnar both cited the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus as one reason for their requests and also urged people to get COVID-19 vaccinations. Cruzado said Montana State’s decision would last through Oct. 1 but said in a message to students, staff and faculty that mandates “foment dissension and division.” She also said she understands people find pandemic-related mandates “odious,” and they require enforcement, so she is asking people to voluntarily wear their masks because it is the right thing to do. Bodnar also said UM is urging but not requiring masks, and he said the university will revisit its stance Sept. 20. He noted the uptick in cases in Missoula County had placed it in a “high risk” zone based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and he pointed to advice from health officials that says masks can help slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials are dealing with a COVID-19 outbreak at a state correctional facility as coronavirus cases surge statewide. After 33 inmates tested positive for the virus at the Diagnostic and Evaluation Center in Lincoln, officials paused all visits and volunteer activities there and asked county jails to delay sending new inmates if they can. All adult men who enter the state prison system go through the facility. Officials said all inmates who test positive for the virus are being housed away from other inmates to limit the spread of COVID-19, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The state Department of Correctional Services has also started providing bars of soap, which inmates had to purchase before the pandemic, and masks to inmates who request them. Officials say they have also stepped up efforts to disinfect spaces where people live and congregate in prisons. Department Director Scott Frakes said the increase in cases in the prison system – which lists 36 active cases – follows an increase in the community. “It is not a surprise that we have an uptick in cases now, especially at DEC which serves as the intake facility for all male inmates who are new admits or returning to us from the community,” Frakes said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The U.S. debut of a long-established international food and beverage industry trade show could make Las Vegas a magnet for foodies and food product retailers, distributors and wholesalers, event producers and tourism officials said. An announcement Tuesday by Emerald Holding Inc. and Comexposium, owner of the SIAL brand of worldwide food shows, was timed as a topper to Emerald’s ongoing International Pizza Expo now at the Las Vegas Convention Center. “This partnership underscores the ever-increasing importance of creating a single event for the food industry,” Jessica Blue, Emerald executive vice president, said in a statement. SIAL, for Salon International de L’Alimentation, has a 50-year history and says it draws some 16,000 exhibitors and 700,000 visitors from 200 countries to 10 shows in France, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. “We plan to bring a new international food exhibition to life in Las Vegas to enable comprehensive sourcing of new products,” said Nicolas Trentesaux, SIAL Network Global CEO. The announcement hosted by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority puts the SIAL America show on the Convention Center schedule for March 2022.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A billionaire software company CEO has given a former hermit $180,000 to rebuild his cabin in a new location. Alexander Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, gave David Lidstone a personal check last week, Lidstone’s friend, Jodie Gedeon said on Facebook. A spokesperson for the data analytics software company confirmed the donation to the Concord Monitor. “How can I express myself and my gratitude towards something like that? I start to tear up whenever I think about it,” Lidstone told the Monitor. “For an old logger who always had to work, for anyone to give you that type of money, it’s incredibly difficult for me to get my head around.” There has been an outpouring of support for Lidstone since he was jailed July 15 and accused of squatting for nearly 30 years on property owned by a Vermont man. His cabin burned down this month shortly before his release, but he recently secured temporary housing through the winter. The location is being kept secret to protect Lidstone’s privacy, Gedeon said. But supporters will have a chance to meet Lidstone at a “thank you” event in Warner, New Hampshire, on Saturday. Lidstone has said he doesn’t think he can go back to being a hermit. “Maybe the things I’ve been trying to avoid are the things that I really need in life,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nManasquan: Huge gates that could be slammed shut when major storms approach would be built across the mouths of three inlets in New Jersey, closable barriers would cut parts of two bays in half, and 19,000 homes would be raised as part of a $16 billion plan to address back bay flooding, one of the major sources of storm damage at the Jersey Shore. After five years of study, federal and state officials unveiled recommendations Thursday that would drastically change the appearance of some iconic spots at the shore. It also would be one of the most ambitious and costly efforts any U.S. state has yet taken to address back bay flooding. The term refers to floods that are not primarily caused by waves crashing over ocean barriers but by stealthily rising water levels in bays along inland shorelines. Although ocean waves caused severe damage during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, back bay flooding also caused extensive damage in that storm. In numerous places, it was the primary source of property damage during Sandy. “To better protect New Jersey’s residents, communities, and economy, we must plan and prepare today for the climate change risks of tomorrow,” said Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environmental protection commissioner.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm heard from industry officials Wednesday about what it will take to boost renewable energy development in the state and across the nation as the Biden administration pushes its initiatives to reduce emissions and address climate change. Developers and policy experts said without more transmission infrastructure and a cohesive grid, renewable energy will be stranded in remote spots like rural New Mexico, and opportunities for economic development will be hampered as a result. “This stuff is as important as building highways. It’s as important as building hospitals and schools,” said Fernando Martinez, executive director of the New Mexico Renewable Energy Transmission Authority. “The only way we’re going to accomplish this … is that we really do need a predictable regulatory landscape.” He and others told Granholm about permitting bottlenecks that have slowed the development of major transmission projects in New Mexico. They said if the Biden administration wants to reach its goals, the U.S. can’t afford to take decades to site and build transmission lines. A major line to connect wind farms in eastern New Mexico to the grid, for example, is almost complete but needs the approval of more than 430 easements from ranchers and other landowners.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A group of restaurants asked a judge this week to block the city’s latest effort to curb the spread of COVID-19, calling the city’s mandate that customers show proof of vaccination “arbitrary, irrational, unscientific and unlawful.” The group argued that the new rules would severely harm their businesses and livelihood. The city’s proof-of-vaccination edict went into effect Tuesday and requires anyone dining indoors at restaurants, going to museums, attending concerts, working out at a gym or entering many indoor public venues show proof that they have been inoculated against COVID-19. The group of restaurateurs that filed the lawsuit in Richmond County, which encompasses Staten Island, said restaurants and other establishments included in the city’s vaccine mandate were unfairly targeted because many other places such as grocery stores, hair salons, churches, schools and office buildings were excluded from the mandate. “This vaccine mandate is arbitrary and capricious due to the fact that it targets certain establishments but not others with no rational whatsoever,” the lawsuit says. Mayor Bill de Blasio first announced the new rules Aug. 3. He said enforcement won’t begin until Sept. 13 to give businesses more time to prepare and people an opportunity to get vaccinated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nChapel Hill: A college tradition has come under scrutiny after pictures the school posted on social media showed hundreds of students gathered at a campus landmark waiting to get a drink of water in the midst of a COVID-19 surge. Pictures posted to Twitter by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill showed a line of students approaching the Old Well on Wednesday waiting to get a drink and a picture. According to tradition, students who drink from the fountain at the well on the first day of classes will get good grades for the entire school year. It was first reported by The News & Observer of Raleigh. The tradition was canceled last year because of the pandemic. The resumption brought a thread of negative reactions. “Tradition aside, you couldn’t just find a couple paper cups for this? In the middle of the fourth wave of a global pandemic?” said one response. “It would have been a great idea to put this tradition on hold,” said another response. According to the newspaper, the university issued a statement saying it had consulted with public health experts who agreed it was OK to proceed with the tradition since there is little to no evidence of surface transmission of the coronavirus. Students who chose to participate were encouraged to wear a mask and maintain distance while waiting in line.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: There are no current plans to bring any of the people fleeing the conflict in Afghanistan to the state, officials said. The North Dakota Department of Human Services, who oversees the Refugee Resettlement Program, said the process is actually quite extensive. It takes eight different government agencies and six background checks for a person to gain clearance for the Refugee Resettlement Program in North Dakota, officials said. The state’s refugee coordinator said the people being transported to the U.S. are classified as Special Immigrant Visa Holders. Each person will be resettled in an area of the country in which Afghans have already settled, KXNET-TV reports. “There are strong communities that have already been set up for individuals that have a successful history of gaining employment, assimilating within the community, learning English and, you know, really developing successful relationships with a variety of different community members,” Holly Triska-Dally said. The Pentagon said that over the prior 24 hours about 2,000 people, including 325 American citizens, had been flown out of the Kabul international airport on 18 flights by U.S. Air Force C-17 transport planes.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Whether because of a lack of computer access, lack of awareness or mistrust, about 180,000 children in the state are not benefiting from the government’s enhanced Child Tax Credit program. That’s the conclusion drawn by Alex Coccia, a senior policy analyst at the Center for the Study of Social Policy, a national nonprofit organization. On a conference call with several members of local and national nonprofits this week, Coccia said that through the first two months of the program, 2.151 million Ohio children have received the tax credit’s advance payments, but he estimated that 2.33 million children are eligible. The monthly payments of either $250 or $300 per child began in July and will continue through December, with another six months’ worth of money available upon filing a tax return in 2022. The payments go out automatically to the roughly 90% of eligible Americans who filed a tax return this year, but the concern is that the “non-filers” still may be unaware of the benefit. Those who do not file a tax return, because of very low incomes or several other reasons, must “opt in” through an online portal on the IRS website. And that’s where access issues begin. “We’re worried about non-English speakers, those who lack secure housing, and those with limited internet access,” Coccia said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s school districts should have “the autonomy” to enact mask requirements, which are banned by state law, according to the superintendent of schools. “School districts deserve the autonomy to enact policies that protect our schoolchildren and staff from COVID exposure and infection,” Oklahoma Superintendent Joy Hofmeister said in a statement Wednesday. Hofmeister’s comments came after U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in letters to her and Gov. Kevin Stitt that the ban may violate the American Rescue Plan Act that provided $123 billion to the nation’s schools to help them return to the classroom. Cardona sent similar letters to several other states with similar mask bans. Stitt’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday. A spokesperson for Stitt told the Tulsa World on Wednesday that the governor had not yet seen the letter. Hofmeister, whose recommendation for a statewide mask mandate in schools was rejected in July 2020 in a 4-3 vote by the state Board of Education, said vaccinations and mask wearing are key to keeping schools open for in-person classes. “I think Ronald Reagan was right when he said those closest to the problem are the ones best suited to address it,” Hofmeister said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: President Joe Biden on Wednesday nominated Oregon resident and tribal citizen Charles F. “Chuck” Sams III to head the National Park Service. If confirmed by the Senate, Sams would be the first Native American to hold the position. He is Cayuse and Walla Walla and a citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation. Sams has worked in state and tribal governments and the nonprofit natural resource and conservation management fields for over 25 years, White House officials said. “The diverse experience that Chuck brings to the National Park Service will be an incredible asset as we work to conserve and protect our national parks to make them more accessible for everyone,” U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American Cabinet secretary, said in a news release. “The outdoors are for everyone, and we have an obligation to protect them for generations to come.” Currently, Sams is a member of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council, a role appointed by Gov. Kate Brown. The Democratic governor said in a statement Wednesday that it was a proud day for Oregon. She described Sams as a “passionate student and teacher of the history and culture of our lands and our people.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Mister Rogers’ deliveryman’s son, who’s now a real-life mail carrier, briefly appeared this week on an episode of a children’s show based on one of Mister Rogers’ puppets. Alex Newell, 39, is the son of David Newell, who played Mr. McFeely on “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.” Alex Newell had a cameo on “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports. In Wednesday’s episode, Newell appears as a mail carrier ensuring a little girl’s care package has been delivered to a friend, according to the newspaper. David Newell said Rogers was the first person who came to visit him at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital after each of his three children were born, including Alex. “In a way, Alex grew up in Mister Rogers’ neighborhood, in reality and in pretend,” his dad said. “He watched the program as he was growing up, and now he’s making a delivery on (‘Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood’). And that makes me so proud.” “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood” features 4-year-old Daniel Tiger, son of the original show’s Daniel Striped Tiger.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The cost of running the city’s guaranteed-income pilot program will be more than the total of cash payments given to low-income families. The 110 households selected to take part in the pilot will receive $500 monthly, adding up to $6,000 over the course of the one-year experiment. In total, $660,000 will be given away in no-strings-attached cash grants. Meanwhile, expenses associated with administering the program and researching its effectiveness are already expected to top $723,000, according to an estimate provided by Mayor Jorge Elorza’s office. While that means that the total cost of the pilot program will exceed the $1.1 million that Elorza had originally anticipated, none of that is taxpayer money. The pilot program is being fully funded by private donors, including Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey. Joining a growing number of Democratic mayors nationwide, Elorza has championed the idea that a guaranteed income can help lift people out of poverty, pointing to Stockton, California, which found that many recipients used the money for basic needs and that they were more likely to be employed full time after taking part in the program. Providence is now encouraging anyone who makes less than 200% of the federal poverty level to apply before the Saturday deadline.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: The Myrtle Beach International Airport has been the busiest airport in the Palmetto State this summer. The airport set a record for passenger traffic with more than 500,000 total passengers in July, WBTW-TV reports. That’s the highest monthly passenger count ever recorded at an airport in South Carolina’s history. Total passenger traffic for July totaled nearly 550,000 – a 49% increase over July 2019, airport officials said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The head of the South Dakota National Guard says Gov. Kristi Noem didn’t tell him she would use a private donation for the deployment to the U.S. border with Mexico until after the mission was already planned. Noem’s decision to accept a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire last month was met with hefty criticism from those who said it allowed a private donor to commandeer a military force. But Maj. Gen. Jeffery Marlette told a legislative budgeting committee Wednesday that the donation was not a factor in planning the deployment. “Our National Guard is not for hire,” he told lawmakers. “Nowhere in this planning process was there a discussion of, ‘I’ll go send the Guard if I can find somebody to pay for it.’ ” The Republican governor last month described the $1 million donation offer from billionaire Republican donor Willis Johnson as a “surprise” that came as she was deciding whether to send police officers or National Guard troops, as well as how to fund the deployment. The state was responding to a request from Texas and Arizona to send law enforcement officers under an agreement between states to assist during emergencies\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Hospitals warned Thursday that the intensive care units are full in nearly every hospital in the state’s major metropolitan areas, pleading with Tennesseans to get vaccinated and wear masks while not going so far as to criticize Gov. Bill Lee’s executive order allowing parents to opt their children out of mask mandates in K-12 schools. Meanwhile, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona warned Tennessee in a letter Wednesday that the order might violate federal law. The Tennessee Hospital Association said in its statement that the hospitals in metropolitan areas with full ICUs are the same ones that normally accept transfers from smaller hospitals of the sickest patients. “This means that if you or a loved one need treatment for any type of serious healthcare problem like a severe injury, heart attack, or stroke, you may not be able to access the care you need, when you need it,” the statement says. It cites Tennessee Department of Health data from May and July that found “at least 88% of these COVID hospitalizations and 94% of COVID deaths are among unvaccinated individuals.” And a Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt School of Medicine report released Thursday found hospitalizations have increased more than tenfold in a little more than a month, the fastest rate of increase of the pandemic.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Austin City Limits Music Festival announced plans Thursday to require a negative coronavirus test or proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all patrons attending the event, scheduled to take place Oct. 1-3 and 8-10 in Zilker Park. While the festival will still admit children 10 and younger for free with a ticketed adult, the popular Austin Kiddie Limits section of festival programming has been paused for the 2021 event. Families attending the festival will be required to provide a negative virus test result for unvaccinated children. The festival also has added a “fan health pledge” to the website. It requests that fans skip the festival if they have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus within 14 days of the beginning of the festival or if they experience symptoms consistent with COVID-19 within 48 hours of the festival. It also requests that fans do not attend if they “have travelled to any international territory identified by federal or applicable state or local governments as being subject to travel or quarantine advisories due to COVID-19.” The move comes as Austin grapples with rising coronavirus hospitalizations in the area. Music venues and industry leaders have been trying to figure out how to increase safety measures right as large events return.\n\nUtah\n\nLehi: A teacher is no longer employed at a high school after a video of her sharing political opinions in class began circulating online, school district officials said Wednesday. The teacher at Lehi High School was initially placed on administrative leave after the video surfaced, but Alpine School District officials confirmed she no longer works there. District spokesman David Stephenson declined to say whether the teacher was fired or resigned. Video that appears to be surreptitiously recorded by a student in the classroom shows the teacher criticizing people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The video was shared online by conservative activists who have led demonstrations against mask mandates and vaccines throughout the state. “I don’t have to be happy about the fact that there’s kids coming in here with their variants that could possibly get me or my family sick,” the video showed the teacher saying. “That’s rude, and I’m not going to pretend like it’s not.” She can also be heard saying that most students are smarter than their parents and that they don’t need to believe everything their parents believe. The Alpine School District, which declined to identify the teacher, said in a statement that the district disavowed her comments.\n\nVermont\n\nColchester: The state’s largest utility is reminding customers that they can apply for grant money to get caught up on past-due utility bills related to the pandemic. A total of $55 million in free grant money is available to help renters, homeowners, businesses and farms pay overdue utility bills tied to the pandemic, Green Mountain Power said in a statement Tuesday. “More than 20,000 GMP customers have fallen at least two months behind on their accounts during the pandemic, yet only about 2,000 have applied for these new assistance programs,” said Steve Costello, a GMP vice president. The Vermont Department of Public Service is taking grant applications through Oct. 25. The money, which does not have to be repaid, can go toward past-due landline phone, electric, natural gas and water service bills, the utility said.\n\nVirginia\n\nNewport News: A school board has voted to ignore state guidelines on protecting transgender students rather than change its policies as the law requires before the school year starts. The Newport News School Board voted 5-1 against the change with one member abstaining at a crowded meeting Tuesday, The Daily Press reports. Newport News is one of the largest districts in the state and among the first in Hampton Roads to refuse to follow the law passed last year. Under the law, school districts must adopt policies consistent with or more comprehensive than the model policies. They include allowing students to use school bathrooms and locker rooms that conform to their gender identity and allowing students to use pronouns and a name that reflect their gender identity. Most board members said they wanted more information, citing their discomfort with parts of the guidelines. Before the vote, Chair Douglas Brown said there’s nothing stopping the district from spending more time on the matter before revisiting it. Still, Brown said the law violates the rights of Christian parents like him who believe kids aren’t capable of making choices about their gender.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities say there are more people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state than at any time during the pandemic. Cassie Sauer, president of the Washington State Hospital Association. said as of Thursday morning there were 1,240 people with the coronavirus in state hospitals. The previous highest number was about 1,100 in December. “Hospitals are still really, really full across the state,” Sauer said at a news conference. Hospitals are also seeing more people due to the effects of recent heat waves, smoke from wildfires and injuries due to summer activities. Sauer said until the recent uptick in cases and hospitalizations due to the delta variant, the COVID-19 hospitalization rate in the state had been holding steady at about 300 to 350 people. The numbers began increasing in early July and have been doubling about every two weeks. There has been a slight slowing in COVID-19 admissions recently, but Sauer said it’s too early to say if that’s a trend. To help free up capacity, Sauer said hospitals have been working with the state to move other patients who can be discharged into places like long-term care facilities. “We will have plenty of capacity if we can move patients out,” she said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh toured an underground coal mine for the first time, joining U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin at a northern West Virginia facility Wednesday. Walsh did his best to signal that Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration won’t be an enemy of the coal industry as he and Manchin visited American Consolidated Natural Resources’ Golden Ridge Portal Mine near Wheeling. “It was quite the experience, I’ll tell you that,” Walsh said in a telephone interview on his way back to Washington, D.C. He described donning the proper safety equipment, taking an elevator ride down to the mine, and then a mantrip ride by rail to the longwall to watch a machine grind and extract coal from the seam. Walsh’s agency oversees the Mine Safety and Health Administration as well as the administration of benefits for coal miners disabled by black lung disease. “I felt it was really important for me to go down and get a feel for what mine workers do,” Walsh said. “I have a different understanding and appreciation of the work.” Democratic candidates for president have struggled in recent years to connect with voters in West Virginia, in part due to a push toward clean energy under the Obama administration. Still, despite his promises, coal did not come roaring back under Republican President Donald Trump.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWisconsin Dells: The Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park is building the nation’s first rotating waterslide as part of a $23 million expansion. The project includes a new 22,500-square-foot building attached to the indoor waterpark. The rotating waterslide, named Medusa’s Slidewheel, is a four-person raft ride that combines the rotation of a Ferris wheel with the propulsion of a waterslide, according to a news release from architecture and engineer firm Ramaker and Associates, which is working on the project. Outside the United States, the only other rotating waterslides are in China and Poland, the news release said. Mount Olympus announced the project on its Facebook page Aug. 6. Construction began in July and is scheduled to be completed by Memorial Day 2022. “It will be the coolest slide that ever hit the waterpark industry,” Mount Olympus CEO and owner Nick Laskaris told WiscNews. “Not just the Dells, but the industry as a whole.” In addition to Medusa’s Slidewheel, the indoor waterpark expansion project will include a large swimming pool area, Laskaris told WiscNews. The existing indoor waterpark will be remodeled to match the new addition, he said.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Marijuana advocates plan to begin circulating petitions in September for two proposed ballot measures – one asking if the state should legalize medical marijuana, and the other if it should decriminalize pot. The Wyoming Attorney General’s Office this week approved the wording of the proposed questions. The Secretary of State’s Office has now begun the process of seeking bids for printing the petitions. The process ends Aug. 25. The Wyoming chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws plans to begin gathering signatures on or soon after Sept. 1. “We’ll be hitting events, going door to door. We intend to get it all wrapped up by February,” Wyoming NORML Executive Director Bennett Sondeno said Wednesday. The group has a “big list” of Wyoming events where it plans to gather signatures in the next few months, Sondeno said. February is the deadline to submit enough valid signatures to the Wyoming secretary of state to get the measures before voters in the 2022 general election, Sondeno said. Wyoming is among a minority of states that don’t allow cannabis in some fashion.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/20"}]}

The CNN Original Series airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET.\n\nCNN —\n\n“Succession” drops viewers into the high-stakes world of running a media empire and all the top-secret deals, attempted coups and shocking scandals that comes with it.\n\nThe actors and creators of the award-winning series, which will compete for more statues at Monday’s Emmy Awards, insist that the characters are inspired by a long list of family-run dynastic enterprises – both past and present. Showrunner Jesse Armstrong said in one behind-the-scenes interview that the writers pulled from “famous media families like the Hearsts, to modern-day Redstone, John Malone, Robert Fitz of Comcast, Murdoch, and Robert and Rebekah Mercer, who founded Breitbart.”\n\nBut of all the influences, the fictional Roys, led by patriarch Logan Roy (Brian Cox), who plays the CEO of media company and entertainment conglomerate Waystar Royco, seem to overlap most with the real-life Murdochs, the family of Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\n\nHere’s why:\n\n(Major spoilers ahead from season three of “Succession.”)\n\nA patriarchal family-run business\n\nActor Brian Cox in \"Succession\" Season 3. Macall Polay/HBO\n\nThe premise of the series, which airs on HBO, which like CNN is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, is practically ripped from the Murdoch playbook.\n\nRupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corp and co-chairman of 21st Century Fox, in 2018. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nLogan Roy, a ruthless dealmaker and a friend of presidents, certainly possesses a Murdoch-ian vibe.\n\nRupert Murdoch grew the small newspaper company that he inherited from his father in 1952 into one of the most powerful conservative media empires in history. News Corp, with a market cap of $13.50 billion, is one of the most influential companies on the planet.\n\nHe always intended to pass down his company to one of his children, but the 91-year-old has never named a successor.\n\nFamily structure\n\nJeremy Strong and Brian Cox in Season 2 of \"Succession.\" Graeme Hunter/HBO\n\nLike Roy, Murdoch has several children from two marriages.\n\nPrudence Macleod is Rupert’s oldest child from his first marriage. Prudence never showed much of an interest in running the family business, so she has largely stayed out of the succession battle that ensnares her siblings.\n\nRupert Murdoch’s oldest son from his second marriage is Lachlan Murdoch, who rose quickly through the ranks and became chairman and chief executive of News Ltd in 1997.\n\nAt the time, his father described Lachlan as his heir apparent, “the first among equals.” Then, in 2005 he abruptly quit after a battle with Fox News Channel CEO Roger Ailes over the direction of the cable news network – effectively taking himself off the heir apparent track. Lachlan returned to the family business in 2014.\n\nThe family also includes Rupert Murdoch’s youngest son, James Murdoch, who dropped out of Harvard in 1995 to start his own hip-hop record label.\n\nJames Murdoch joined News Corporation and was increasingly seen as the new heir apparent after Lachlan Murdoch quit in 2005. But he stepped down in 2011 after he was engulfed in a phone hacking scandal. After several years of hiatus, he rejoined the family business before ultimately resigned in 2020, citing “disagreements over certain editorial content published by the Company’s news outlets and certain other strategic decisions.”\n\nElisabeth Murdoch is the only daughter of their father’s second marriage.\n\n“She’s very savvy, very cunning. She is perhaps the most like Rupert,” New York Times writer Jim Rutenberg says of Elisabeth in the new CNN Original Series “The Murdochs: Empire of Influence,” which premieres on CNN September 25 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nRupert Murdoch flanked by his sons Lachlan (left) and James (right) in 2016. LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images\n\nRupert Murdoch has been dismissive of her attempts to take the throne, saying she needs to figure out how many children she wanted to have before planning further advancement at the company, Sky High author Mathew Horsman said in the series.\n\nIn 2000, she left the family business and founded one of the UK’s biggest independent production companies.\n\nOn “Succession,” Logan Roy has four children. Eldest Connor Roy (Alan Ruck) is mostly removed from the business and, in the most recent season, set his eyes on the presidency. Kendall Roy (Jeremy Strong) initially sits as the ostensible heir apparent to his father, but after a series of blows, he falls from his father’s graces.\n\nRoy family youngest, quick-witted Roman Roy (Kieran Culkin), has had a hard time proving himself worthy of the top spot. Sarah Snook’s Siobhan (or Shiv), meanwhile, has the skills and her father’s favor (even when they’re at bitter odds), but has been met resistance.\n\nThe media empire and network\n\nAshley Zukerman and Sarah Snook on the set of ATN in \"Succession.\"\n\n“Succession’s” Waystar Royco and the Murdoch’s News Corp. have more than a few points of overlap.\n\nOn “Succession,” Waystar Royco’s assets include conservative cable news network ATN, the show’s version of Fox News.\n\nThroughout the series, Logan Roy speaks with the president and his advisers about the network’s coverage of the White House and flexes their access.\n\nFox News is a tool of influence for Rupert Murdoch, Jonathan Mahler, who co-wrote “How Rupert Murdoch’s Empire of Influence Remade the World,” says in “The Murdochs: Empire of Influence.”\n\n“Rupert had always fantasized about having a close relationship with an American President,” says Mahler.\n\nMajor scandal\n\nJeremy Strong and Brian Cox testify about the cruiseship scandal in \"Succession.\" Zach Dilgard/HBO\n\nIn Season 2 of “Succession,” news leaks that Waystar’s cruise ship division buried internal reports of sexual harassment, assault and possibly murder. The scandal forced Logan Roy and his son Kendall Roy to testify before a US senate subcommittee – another strike in Kendall’s pursuit of power.\n\nJames and Rupert Murdoch speak at a Parliamentary Select Committee about the UK phone hacking scandal in 2011. ANDY BUCHANAN/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe debacle shares similarities with the News Corp.’s hacking scandal in 2011. The company’s British newspaper, News of the World, came under scrutiny when it was discovered reporters were hacking the phones of royals, celebrities and crime victims to get their stories. Like a mirror image of the show, Rupert Murdoch, alongside his son James, testified before Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee.\n\nIn the fallout, James gave up his title as executive chairman of News Corp’s UK publishing unit.\n\n“You would imagine, in a situation like this, a father’s instinct might be to protect his son, but James is really thrown under the bus by his father,” said Mahler. “It’s a humiliating and devastating period for him.”\n\nSelling off the empire\n\nKieran Culkin, Jeremy Strong, Sarah Snook and Brian Cox in the finale of season three of \"Succession.\" Graeme Hunter/HBO\n\nBoth Rupert and Logan pulled off a move that left people stunned: Selling off their self-made empires.\n\nIn the finale of Season 3, Logan announces his plan to sell Waystar Royco to streaming company GoJo and give tech founder Lukas Matsson control of the company.\n\n“This is the best moment to sell. If I don’t do the best deal at any given point, what’s the point of anything? I don’t get out, I leave $5 billion on the table,” Logan told his children. “Make your own pile. This is an opportunity for you kids to get an education in real life.”\n\nRupert also chose to cash out in 2018, selling off most of 21st Century Fox to Disney.\n\n“Once the Disney deal closed, Fox was left a shell of its former self. Gone was the movie studio, gone was the cable networks like FX. What was left was the Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Sports, and Fox News – the thing that Rupert cares about more than anything,” Matthew Belloni, former editorial director of The Hollywood Reporter and founding partner of Puck News, says in the Murdoch series.\n\nRudenberg says this move was seen as a no-confidence vote in his children.\n\n“By making his family the business, and the business his family, Rupert left his family just as broken up as his company was when he sold to Disney,” said Rutenberg. “It was ripped apart by this decades-long battle for succession which, at the same time, was a zero-sum seeming battle for their father’s love.”\n\nToday, Lachlan Murdoch is the CEO of Fox Corp and his father serves as co-chairman. Both James and Elisabeth have left the family business.\n\nThe future of Logan’s children is very uncertain as the series heads into its fourth season.\n\nA premiere date has not been announced.", "authors": ["Janelle Davis"], "publish_date": "2022/09/10"}]}

Officials ruled that Elliott acted intentionally when he made contact with Hamlin in Monday's Coca-Cola 600.\n\nElliott was racing side-by-side with Hamlin at Charlotte Motor Speedway when both drove tight to the top of the turn on Lap 186 before Hamlin squeezed Elliott, who brushed the wall. Elliott swerved left in his No. 9 Chevrolet and hit the rear of Hamlin's No. 11 Toyota, sending him headfirst into the outside wall. Hamlin then spun out and ended up in the grass.\n\nHamlin's car was totaled and Elliott's beyond repair after the incident, leaving both cotenders out for the remainder of NASCAR's longest race.\n\nHAMLIN:Fumes at Elliott after wreck in Coca-Cola 600: 'He shouldn’t be racing'\n\nCOCA-COLA 600:Ryan Blaney survives chaos to snap long winless streak\n\nElliott will miss the Enjoy Illinois 300 at World Wide Technology Raceway on Sunday. It will be the seventh race the Hendrick Motorsports driver has missed this season. NASCAR's most popular driver missed six races earlier this year after breaking his tibia following a snowboarding accident in Colorado, prior to the March 5 race at Las Vegas.\n\n“We understand NASCAR’s need to maintain consistency in its officiating. The penalty will not be appealed, and we will submit a formal request for a playoff waiver,\" Hendrick Motorsports said in a statement. \"Corey LaJoie, 31, will drive the No. 9 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 this weekend at World Wide Technology Raceway. We are grateful to Corey for stepping in and to the team at Spire Motorsports for making him available.”\n\nAfter the race, which Ryan Blaney won, Hamlin voiced his extreme displeasure with Elliott's action.\n\n“I got right-rear hooked in the middle of the straightaway,\" Hamlin told reporters on Monday. \"It’s a tantrum, and he shouldn’t be racing next week. Right rear hooks are absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nHamlin compared his incident to the October one between Bubba Wallace and Kyle Larson where the former was suspended for one week for intentionally wrecking the latter in the Las Vegas playoff race.\n\nElliott, the 2020 Cup Series champion, denied his action was intentional saying Monday, \"The 11 (Hamlin's car) ran us up in the fence there, and once you tear the right side off these things, it's kind of over. Once you hit the wall in these things, you can't drive them anymore. Just an unfortunate circumstance.\"\n\nWhat did NASCAR say about the suspension\n\nNASCAR senior vice president of competition Elton Sawyer said Tuesday on Sirius NASCAR Radio that officials determined “it was an intentional act by Chase in our opinion, in our view after reviewing all of the available resources.\"\n\nNASCAR suspended Elliott under a section of rulebook covered under “Member Code of Conduct.” Among the rules covered in that section is “removing another competitor from championship contention in a dangerous manner when not racing for position based on the available evidence and specific circumstances of the incident.”\n\nWhat did Hamlin say before the suspension was handed down\n\nHamlin said Tuesday on his podcast “Actions Detrimental\" that the act by Elliott was absolutely deliberate payback for earlier contact between the two.\n\n“There’s no explanation that he could possibly give, which he didn’t have a reason for hanging left. You know he obviously didn’t want to admit it,” he said.\n\nHamlin tweeted out images of the data from Elliott's car on Monday night to prove his point – data that NASCAR considered when determining whether Elliott's actions were intentional.\n\nHamlin explained that he “pointed out in the data that I tweeted that once he got into the wall, there was nothing wrong with his car. He’s turned the wheel back straight, like he was going down the straightaway, and you can tell by data whether you’ve got toe link damage or not.\n\n\"Everyone hits the wall. But he threw a hissy fit and he just hung the left on us in the most dangerous part of the racetrack that you possibly could and it ended my day and his.”\n\nWhat does the suspension mean for Elliott\n\nBecause Elliott had already missed six races this season, Hendrick Motorsports had to request a waiver from NASCAR to allow Elliott to be playoff eligible – which the series granted. Drivers would normally have to participate in every race to be eligible for the postseason, but NASCAR can grant waivers due to injuries or other circumstances.\n\nHendrick Motorsports said in their statement Tuesday that the team will submit another formal request for a playoff waiver for Elliott following the suspension.\n\nSixteen drivers make the 10-race Cup Series playoffs, and a win in any one of the 26 regular-season races would clinch a playoff berth – unless there are more than 16 winners, in which case points would be the determining factor. Drivers can also point their way into the playoffs if there are less than 16 winners, but because Elliott has missed so many races, he would almost certainly fail to rank in the top 16 in points.\n\nAfter serving his suspension, Elliott would return on June 11 for the road-course race at Sonoma Raceway. Including Sonoma, Elliott would have 11 races to try to reach victory lane.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2023/05/29/ryan-blaney-wins-coca-cola-600-charlotte/70267339007/", "title": "Ryan Blaney wins NASCAR Coca-Cola 600 to snap long Cup ...", "text": "The Associated Press\n\nCONCORD, N.C. – Jumping into the crowd to celebrate a big race victory appears to have become a Team Penske thing.\n\nRyan Blaney held off William Byron to win the rescheduled Coca-Cola 600 on Monday at Charlotte Speedway, giving team owner Roger Penske a sweep of the Memorial Day weekend’s top races in the United States.\n\nJosef Newgarden won a record-extending 19th Indianapolis 500 on Sunday for Team Penske. Like Newgarden, Blaney jumped out of his car and climbed into the crowd to celebrate the win with fans.\n\n“I only did it because Josef did it,” Blaney said. “I was pretty fired up. I don’t get that excited very often, but I was super pumped. I loved how Josef did it Sunday. … I said, ‘I am going to go in the stands like Josef did and have some human contact.’”\n\nNEWGARDEN:Shares his ecstasy with fans after elusive Indy 500 win\n\nOPINIONFor all the Indy 500 provides, the raw emotion is what makes it most special\n\nBlaney compared it to jumping into a mosh pit at a metal concert.\n\nA few moments later, he tried to hold back tears with the weight of 59-race winless streak lifted from his shoulders.\n\n“You start to get to feel like you can’t win anymore,” Blaney said. “We hadn’t won in awhile and that can get hard. I want to thank the 12 (team) for believing in me.”\n\nBlaney took the lead from Byron on a restart and led the final 26 laps to win his first Cup Series race since the Coke Zero Sugar 400 at Daytona in August of 2021.\n\nByron finished second, followed by Martin Truex Jr., Bubba Wallace and Tyler Reddick.\n\n'HE SHOULDN'T BE RACING':Hamlin fumes at Elliott after wreck in Coca-Cola 600\n\nTruex said Blaney’s emotions are understandable.\n\n“He’s under a lot of pressure to perform,” Truex said. “They’ve won a lot of races since his last race. I’m sure he questioned himself through some point during that streak that he was on. He’s had many opportunities to win and they’ve slipped away. Those are the hardest to think about so he’s probably thinking, ‘we finally did it.’”\n\nIt is the first time Team Penske has swept the Indianapolis-Charlotte doubleheader.\n\n“The pressure was on us to try to sweep the weekend,” said Blaney, who said he texted Newgarden after the Indy 500 win. “So that was the goal. Fortunately we executed well enough to get it done.”\n\nBlaney’s win came just days before Penske hosts a weekend of racing on the downtown streets of Detroit. The return of racing in downtown Detroit is Penske’s gift to the city he calls home. Then, the 86-year-old heads to the 24 Hours of Le Mans, one of the very few events he’s yet to win.\n\nThe 5½-hour race included five wrecks in the final 50 laps, including one with 26 to go when last week’s All-Star race winner Kyle Larson spun and took out defending Cup champion Joey Logano, Kyle Busch and Christopher Bell.\n\nBlaney had passed Byron on the previous restart, and then got the jump on him again on the final restart and ran away with the checkered flag.\n\nIt was a rain-soaked weekend at Charlotte, which washed out practice and qualifying and postponed the race to Monday. That meant drivers began the race without ever having turned a lap in the NextGen cars at the 1.5-mile oval for the first time in Coca-Cola 600 history.\n\nMore rain caused the race to be red-flagged for nearly an hour after 158 laps, making the longest Cup race of the year even longer.\n\nDefending race champion Denny Hamlin was left fuming after his day ended with a wreck on lap 186, prompting him to call for NASCAR to suspend its most popular driver Chase Elliott.\n\nHamlin claimed the Hendrick Motorsports driver intentionally wrecked him by hooking his right rear bumper following a dust-up earlier in the race.\n\n“It’s a tantrum and he shouldn’t be racing next week,” Hamlin said of Elliott. “Right rear hooks are absolutely unacceptable. I don’t care.”\n\nElliott denied intentionally wrecking Hamlin in retaliation.\n\nHamlin wasn’t the only one fired up.\n\nDuring the rain delay television cameras caught Aric Almirola throwing punches at Wallace after the two exchanged words. Wallace refused to say what sparked the altercation, and said he wasn’t surprised at what unfolded.\n\n“When you walk around with two faces, that’s what you get,” Wallace said.\n\nJOHNSON’S TEAM STRUGGLES\n\nIt was a rough night for Jimmie Johnson and his new Legacy Motor Club team.\n\nAfter saying he has never been more ill-prepared for a race due to his inexperience in the NextGen car, Johnson spun out on lap 78 in a single-car crash. He took his No. 84 Chevy behind the wall a few laps later and was joined by there by Legacy teammates Erik Jones and Noah Gragson, who suffered radiator damage.\n\nAfter Johnson returned, he crashed into Gragson and spun out a second time and went behind the wall again. He finished last.\n\n“I think I learned a lesson with this aero package that I didn’t know about,” Johnson said. “Much different than the car I have driven in the past.”\n\nHARVICK’S LAST RUN\n\nKevin Harvick finished 11th in his final Coca-Cola 600.\n\nHarvick, who is retiring after the season, won the race in 2011 and 2013. He started Monday’s race on the front row, but quickly fell back to the mid-20s and was never a major factor in the race.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Cup Series heads to Madison, Illinois, on Sunday, where 2022 Cup champion Joey Logano outdueled Kyle Busch in overtime to win the inaugural race at World Wide Technology Raceway.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2022/10/22/nascar-set-for-homestead-while-wallace-watches-from-afar/50861431/", "title": "NASCAR set for Homestead, while Wallace watches from afar", "text": "AP\n\nHOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) — Bubba Wallace is missing Sunday’s NASCAR race, and that’s evidently not his only sanction after losing his cool in Las Vegas last weekend.\n\nDenny Hamlin — who, along with Michael Jordan, co-owns the 23XI racing team that Wallace drives for — said Saturday that the team has dealt with matters in a way that goes “above and beyond” the penalties handed down by NASCAR.\n\nHamlin didn’t say what that means, choosing to keep those matters in-house.\n\n“He understands where I stand, where the team stands, the values that we want to present on the racetrack, and he just didn’t represent it that well last week,” Hamlin said. “But, you know, in the grand scheme of things, we’re very happy with his progress. And he knows he’s still got some stuff to work on when he gets out of the race car.”\n\nIt’s not just Wallace in the spotlight right now.\n\nTwo weeks ago, NASCAR issued $200,000 in fines after finding that Stewart-Haas Racing driver Cole Custer slowed on the backstretch of the final lap of a race in Charlotte and helped teammate Chase Briscoe move up enough to reach the next round of the playoffs. Custer and his crew chief, Mike Shiplett, were both fined $100,000 after NASCAR determined Custer’s slowdown was deliberate.\n\nAnd last week, Wallace intentionally wrecked reigning Cup champion Kyle Larson at Las Vegas in a dangerous act of retaliation. Wallace got suspended for this week at Homestead-Miami, and playoff contender Christopher Bell got caught up in that wreck — smashing his car and denting his chances of becoming NASCAR champion. Bell remains in the playoffs, but needs to rally.\n\n“NASCAR’s like your parents a lot of times,” playoff leader and title contender Joey Logano said. “There’s a line of, you know, you’ve got to let the boys figure it out sometimes, and they’ll figure it out together and move on — or mom and dad has to step in a little bit and control the situation because it’s gotten out of hand. So, I believe NASCAR kind of decided it’s getting out of hand.”\n\nDrivers tended to agree with NASCAR on these calls.\n\n“In my opinion, those moves were extremely, extremely dumb — both of them,” driver Daniel Suarez said of the decisions made by Custer and Wallace. “And with both of them, I was going to be extremely surprised if they were not penalties. ... You have to be smarter. I don’t know what those guys were thinking.”\n\nThat question — “what was he thinking?” — has been a storyline for much of this NASCAR season, with no shortage of temper-flaring incidents.\n\nRoss Chastain, who has had a big first season for Trackhouse Racing, has been featured prominently in a few of those. He has clashed with Hamlin, had a starring role in a wreck that put a good dent in Kevin Harvick’s title chances, and his name was converted to a verb by Kyle Busch. Getting wrecked by Chastain is now, in NASCAR parlance, getting “Chastained.”\n\n“Look, some of the things I did throughout the summer were just not ... looking back, I would do them different,” Chastain said. “Some of it would just be my stance after the race. I would prefer it be different. But a lot of on-track stuff, I could definitely clean up.”\n\nWallace isn’t at Homestead this weekend, even to watch. He’ll be in the team garage, and Logano said he doesn’t think Wallace owes his fellow drivers an explanation.\n\n“It’s kind of all in front of us. We all see,” Logano said. “I’m not looking for anything. He didn’t do it to me. If he did it to me, yeah, we’d have big problems.”\n\nQUALIFYING\n\nWilliam Byron’s playoff push will start from the ideal spot Sunday. He won the pole in Saturday’s qualifying laps at Homestead-Miami, turning in a lap of 32.454 seconds.\n\nThat was 0.049 seconds ahead of fellow playoff entrant Bell. Another driver still in the playoff, Chase Elliott, will start third.\n\n“Anywhere in that top 10 is a good place to start here,” said Byron, who got the first pole of his season and the eighth of his career.\n\nAmong the other drivers still in the playoff: Ryan Blaney will start 13th, Hamlin 14th, Logano 17th, Briscoe 19th and Chastain 20th.\n\nMost drivers don’t expect to see much correlation between qualifying and what’ll happen over 267 laps on Sunday.\n\n“The car drives tremendously different and the lines are different around the racetrack, too,” Bell said. “It’s completely two different animals.”\n\nCOMFORTS OF HOME\n\nSuarez is from Mexico, not Miami, but he feels the comforts of home this weekend in a place where most people speak at least some Spanish and the Latin flavor is just about everywhere.\n\n“Everything starts, I would say, driving to the racetrack,” Suarez said. “If you turn on the radio and you start flipping stations, everything is in Spanish. Then we get to the racetrack and most of the security people speak Spanish. So, the energy just feels different, and they make me feel like home. And that feels very amazing.”\n\nIt’s not uncommon for Suarez to go to tracks and hear plenty of Spanish — he cited Texas and “every single race on the West Coast” as such locales.\n\n“I really feel more like home in coming to places like this,” Suarez said. “And I know that there are going to be a lot of fans speaking to me in Spanish and bringing some Mexican flags. We have a lot of support and that is something that I really enjoy a lot.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2016/08/07/denny-hamlin-wins-watkins-glen-first-road-course-victory-career/88369514/", "title": "Denny Hamlin battles back spasms, wins at Watkins Glen", "text": "Brant James\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nWATKINS GLEN, N.Y. -- Here's what you need to know from Sunday's Cheez-It 355 at Watkins Glen International, the final Sprint Cup race on a road course this season:\n\nWINNER: Denny Hamlin won his first race since he took the season opening Daytona 500, holding off Martin Truex Jr. and Brad Keselowski after a final restart with four laps left. Hamlin notched a mistake-free final lap, after missing the final turn at Sonoma Raceway in June and allowing Tony Stewart to win there. It is the first road course win of his career.\n\nHamlin led Joey Logano, Truex, Kyle Larson and Keselowski on the restart. Truex moved up to second after passing Logano, but Keselowski appeared to tag his bumper coming out of the final turn. Hamlin climbed gingerly from his No. 11 Toyota after doing an extensive burnout, and said in victory lane he woke up with back spasms. The driver broke his back in a March 2013 crash with Logano, but had suffered from back issues before that injury.\n\n\"Really doubted being in the race car today,\" Hamlin said. \"I finally have won at all the racetracks.\"\n\nHe called the final restarts ''hectic'' and said he didn't want to give other drivers such as Truex and Keselowski a chance in the closing laps like he did Stewart at Sonoma.\n\nHamlin now has won at superspeedways, intermediate and short tracks, and road courses. Along with his Daytona 500 victory, he also has won the Southern 500 and an All-Star race.\n\nDUST-UP: Keselowski walked over to Truex's car and the two talked on pit road. \"Obviously, it's my fault,\" Keselowski said. \"I wanted to be outside and make a crossover and see if I could get both (Hamlin and Truex). I didn't think he'd come back up (the track). He got the bad end of it.\" Keselowski ended up third, Truex seventh.\n\nSaid Truex: \"He said it was his fault; I said 'I knew that.' Simple as that. It's just hard racing. I wanted him to know I wasn't happy after the race. I thought I had a run on the 11 (Hamlin), but I got spun around.\"\n\nDUST-UP II: A.J. Allmendinger got into the back of Kyle Larson coming toward the finish line, booting Larson hard into the inside wall. Both drivers were uninjured and Allmendinger took the blame for the hit. \"I just cost Kyle a good finish and I'm pissed off at myself.\"\n\nRED FLAG: Keselowski led for much of the latter half of the race and his attempts to save fuel were helped with 14 laps left when Alex Kennedy’s race car had an engine expire on the front stretch, prompting a caution after it bled fluids onto the track. The second red flag of the race was thrown with seven laps left when Kevin Harvick, Danica Patrick, David Ragan and Chris Buescher wrecked after a restart. After a red flag that lasted for 16 minutes, 44 seconds, the race restarted on Lap 86.\n\nRED FLAG II: Ricky Stenhouse Jr.’s loss of control over a curb in Turn 7 on Lap 53 promoted a multi-car accident that cued a red flag. Stenhouse swept right across the track attempting to save his No. 17 Ford, mashed headlong into a metal barrier and was plowed from behind by Jimmie Johnson. Greg Biffle and Austin Dillon also were involved. The red flag period lasted 13 minutes, 19 seconds.\n\n“The cars started checking up in front of me and they all moved out of the way and the (Stenhouse Jr.) was sitting there, stopped,” Johnson said. “I remember seeing a door number and I was so thankful it was the passenger-side door and not the driver-side door because I plowed him. I really hit the car hard. I was afraid that I might have injured him. But, thankfully he’s okay and everybody is all right.”\n\nSTEWART'S LAST RUN: Tony Stewart finished fifth in his final appearance in a Cup race at Watkins Glen, where he has won five times.\n\nHow Tony Stewart has fared at Sprint Cup tracks\n\nDOUBLE DOWN: Johnson was penalized twice on a Lap 14 pit sequence, for an uncontrolled tire and speeding. He was forced to return to pit road because his No. 48 Chevrolet crew fueled the car, which is not allowed during pass-through penalties. He recycled 38th.\n\nUP FRONT: Danica Patrick led 11 laps on a green flag cycle after running up front for just 10 total laps entering the 22nd race of the year. Kyle Busch reassumed the lead when she pitted on Lap 44.\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr. says he isn't thinking retirement, plans to return\n\nBUMP: Jeff Gordon bumped Dillon off the bus stop on Lap 3, crinkling the hood of the No. 88 Chevrolet. The four-time series champion was in his third start replacing Dale Earnhardt Jr., who sustained a concussion at Michigan International Speedway in June and is out indefinitely. Gordon, a four-time winner at Watkins Glen, immediately slumped from 18th to 26th. Crew chief Greg Ives waited for a Lap 13 caution to repair the car, intentionally pitting early, trading repair time for a penalty.\n\nALMOST THERE: Buescher finished 30th and sits three points out of 30th in driver points. The Front Row Racing driver won a fog-shortened race at Pocono Raceway last week to check one box for Chase for the Sprint Cup qualification, but began the race six points out of 30th place and the minimum position for a berth. He rallied from a penalty, while Ragan finished 33rd. Four races remain in the Sprint Cup regular season.\n\nBuescher arguably benefited from the final red flag period as he had time to be checked and released from the infield care center and return to the garage, where his car had been towed after coming to a stop in the grass. The team was not allowed to work on the car during the red but was prepared to do so promptly when the race went back to yellow.\n\nROUGH STOP: Leader Carl Edwards, second place Busch and third-place Allmendinger pitted together on Lap 26 but Edwards (uncontrolled tire) and Allmendinger (speeding) were both penalized. Busch recycled seventh as the top car with the potential to finish on one more stop. Logano pitted off the lead on Lap 33 but was also nabbed for speeding.\n\nFollow James on Twitter @brantjames\n\nSUNDAY'S RESULTS\n\nLap length: 2.45 miles\n\n(Start position in parentheses)\n\n1.

It's all very ambient and yet rewards the listener who doesn't let it slip into the background.

They’re taking turns topping the bill on the tour, with Bad Company doing the honors here. Both artists have already promised to deliver certain hits. For Walsh, those songs are “Rocky Mountain Way,” “Walk Away,” “Life’s Been Good,” “Funk #49” and “Life In the Fast Lane.” Bad Company promises “Shooting Star,” “Feel Like Makin Love,” “Bad Company,” “Can’t Get Enough” and “Rock ‘n’ Roll Fantasy.”\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Sunday, May 22.

Granted, singer Bobby Liebling is the only member of the current lineup who's been involved from the beginning, but guitarist Victor Griffin, whose playing plays as big a role in defining the brilliance of \"Curious Volume\" as Liebling, has been there, on and off, since 1983. Kerrang! says the album is \"proof that when it comes to enormo-doom heaviness, few do it better. Still.\"\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Monday, May 23. Nile Theater, 105 W.

Now imagine that he's also really into Hall & Oates. It may not do much pushing of the envelope. But as PopMatters said in reviewing the new album, \"Man About Town\": \"Like it or not, there aren’t many people who can pull off what Mayer Hawthorne does best these days as well as Mayer Hawthorne does it. It fills a very real void in an increasingly crowded and grossly jaded pop music world. It is, in essence, important work.\"\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Tuesday, May 24. Crescent Ballroom, 308 N.

He took home his first of two Grammy Awards for the 1997 album “Senor Blues,” and his latest album, “2008’s “Maestro,” was another strong addition to the catalog.\n\nDetails: 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 24.

And he was looking set to be the breakout artist of that Wolf pack until Frank Ocean hit the blogosphere with “Channel Orange.” But Tyler did bring home a major MTV Video Music Award nomination for “Yonkers,” which memorably ends in him hanging himself, but only after dining on a Madagascar hissing cockroach and puking in silhouette. His latest album, \"Cherry Bomb,\" became his third consecutive release to debut in the Top 5. He's never had a proper hit but there's no reason to believe he needs one, either.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Wednesday, May 25. Marquee Theatre, 730 N.

And that name didn't stop them from placing a song called \"Rawnald Gregory Erickson the Second\" in a Target ad. That same song turned up on an episode of \"Weeds,\" where it's doubtful their name was as much of an issue. When \"Miracle Mile,\" their latest album, arrived in 2013, Paste magazine praised it as \"one of the prettiest party records you'll hear this year.\" They were among the highlights of McDowell Mountain Music Festival in 2015, their dance beats topped by the haunted ethereal sighing of bandleader Joshua Hodges. They even threw in a spirit cover of the Cyndi Lauper song \"Girls Just Want to Have Fun,\" which they were pleased to announce they had recently done with Lauper herself.\n\nDetails: 8 p.m. Thursday, May 26.

A 19-year-old fan, who reportedly rushed the stage three times before Blythe pushed him off, sustained head injuries upon hitting the concrete floor below and, after two weeks in a coma, died. Blythe, who faced five years in prison, was released eventually acquitted and went back to work, releasing “VII: Sturm und Drang” last summer. A punishing onslaught of groove-metal riffing topped primarily by tortured howls and growls from Blythe, the album features two songs written in a Pankrac Prison cell.\n\nDetails: 7:30 p.m. Friday, May 27.

After two more EPs — “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites” in late 2010 and “More Monsters and Sprites” in 2011 — he was nominated for five Grammys, including best new artist, winning three (best dance/electronica album, best dance recording and best remixed recording, non-classical) in 2012. He picked up three more Grammys in 2013 and two more earlier this year, bringing his total Grammy wins to eight, the most any EDM artists has won. His most successful solo records in the States are the double-platinum singles “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites\" and \"Bangarang.\" But he and Diplo scored a triple-platinum smash last year as Jack U when they called in Justin Bieber to supply lead vocals on the song \"Where Are U Now?\"\n\nDetails: 11 a.m -7 p.m., Saturday, May 28.

But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T. Barnum.\n\n12. 1852: Construction of St. Peter's Catholic Church begins.\n\n13. 1853: The first synagogue in Tennessee, B'nai Israel, is established by Jewish German immigrants. In 1943 it adopts its current name: Temple Israel.\n\n14. July 15, 1853: Elmwood Cemetery opens for business, so to speak, when the late Mrs. R.B. Berry is laid to rest as its first occupant. The 75,000 interred since then have included slaves, suffragists, yellow fever victims and author Shelby Foote.\n\n15. \"May God bless Memphis, the noblest city on the face of the earth.” — Mark Twain, in an 1858 letter to his sister, after visiting the Memphis hospital where his brother Henry was taken after a steamboat explosion that took \"hundreds of lives.\"\n\n16. June 6, 1862: The Mississippi River churns as Union gunboats defeat Confederate naval forces at the first Battle of Memphis.\n\n17. Also June 6, 1862: To avoid \"Yankee\" takeover, the presses and plates of the pro-Confederacy newspaper, The Appeal, are loaded into a boxcar and moved to Grenada, Mississippi, where the newspaper resumes publication. Keeping one step ahead of Union confiscators, The Appeal later journeys to Jackson, Mississippi; Meridian, Mississippi; Atlanta; Montgomery, Alabama; and Columbus, Georgia.\n\n18. Aug. 21, 1864: Nathan Bedford Forrest's troops raid the Union-occupied city but ultimately withdraw; this incursion becomes known as the second Battle of Memphis.\n\n19. Bright kid, promising future: In 1865, 18-year-old Thomas Edison works as a telegraph operator in Memphis.\n\n20. April 27, 1865: The greatest maritime disaster in U.S. history occurs on the Mississippi River at Memphis when the boilers of the overloaded Sultana explode. Close to 1,800 of the 2,400 people aboard the 260-foot wooden steamboat are killed or drowned (about 50 more than will be lost in the sinking of the Titanic). The boat's legal capacity was 376.\n\n21. Forty-six black people and two white people are killed when white civilians and police officers rampage through black neighborhoods for two days of mob violence, May 1-3, 1866. The event becomes known as the \"Memphis Massacre.\"\n\n22. 1869: The foundation stone is laid for Beale Street Baptist Church (also known as First Baptist Church — Beale Street), a congregation organized by freed slaves.\n\n23. The city's oldest degree-granting collegiate institution, Christian Brothers University, is established in 1871 (as Christian Brothers College) by members of a Catholic congregation founded by France's St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, the patron saint for \"teachers of youth.\"\n\n24. 1875: Walter Burke Sr. opens the original Burke's Book Store at 180 N Main. Now located at 936 Cooper, the store has remained independent and Memphis-owned ever since.\n\n25. Jan. 15, 1877, becomes known as \"The Day It Rained Snakes.\" According to newspaper reports that inspired an investigation by Scientific American, a \"torrential downpour\" left behind great numbers of snakes in the area of Vance and Lauderdale. The Monthly Weather Review reported the snakes were dark brown or black and \"very thick in some places, being tangled together like a mass of thread or yarn.\" Whether the reptiles were driven from subterranean hiding places or deposited on the Bluff City via some sort of storm-driven snakenado remains a mystery.\n\n26. Aug. 13, 1878: Restaurant owner Kate Bionda becomes the city's first recorded victim of yellow fever, having contracted the disease from a man who had escaped a quarantined steamboat. She would be followed by close to 5,000 others by the end of the year, as the epidemic devastates the city.\n\n27. One of the most significant figures to ever call this city home, former slave Ida B. Wells moves to Memphis in 1882 at the age of 20. A few years later, she launches her anti-lynching campaign through her newspaper, the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight.\n\n28. Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl. She hails from Memphis, Tenn. She is not going back there just now, because the white people are anxious to hang her up by the neck in the market place, and burn the soles of her feet, and gouge her beautiful dark eyes out with red-hot irons.'' — The London Sun, 1894.\n\n29. An estimated 50 men, women and children, are killed on March 30, 1882, when a broken lantern causes a fire aboard the steamer Golden City, as the boat is about to dock. According to a newspaper account, the \"howls of a burning menagerie ... mingled with shrieks of women and children.\"\n\n30. 1887: Artesian well water becomes available for the first time, establishing Memphis as a city with notably pure drinking water.\n\n31. On Oct. 15, 1887, Grover Cleveland becomes the first president to visit Memphis while in office. Thousands lined the streets (and were infiltrated by gangs of pickpockets, according to The Commercial Appeal), but the joy gives way to shock when a prominent local citizen, Judge Henry T. Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32. A Memphis community designed expressly for black residents, Orange Mound — named for the area's many Osage orange trees — begins to be developed in 1890, on former plantation property. For much of its history, the neighborhood is said to represent the largest concentration of African Americans outside of Harlem.\n\n33. Feb. 23, 1892: \"Tomboy\" Alice Mitchell, 19, uses her father's razor blade to cut the throat of her former Higbee School for Young Ladies classmate, Freda Ward, 17; the sensational murder trial that follows exposes what the one newspaper calls \"the Perverted Affection of One Girl for Another.\" Alice — who apparently had dreamed of dressing as a man and marrying Freda — is sentenced to what was then called the Western State Hospital for the Insane in Bolivar, Tennessee.\n\n34. The city's first public library, the Cossitt Library, opens on April 12, 1893. However, a public campaign for donations is necessary to stock its shelves with books.\n\n35. Memphis' first skyscraper, the 10-story Porter Building at 10 N. Main, is constructed in 1895.\n\n36. A May 1901 reunion of Confederate troops ends with a parade of 15,000 veterans, according to The Commercial Appeal. \"Never before in the history of Memphis were the people so enthused as they were yesterday,\" the newspaper reported, while also praising \"the survivors of the most superb soldiery that ever bore a part in making world's history.\"\n\n37. In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902. Although she \"dashed to the floor a glass of liquor just as a thirsty person was turning it down his throat,\" according to The Commercial Appeal, she delivered tongue-lashings and temperance lectures instead of her so-called \"hatchetations.\"\n\n39. 1906: One of Memphis' most influential citizens, Robert R. Church, known as the South's first African American millionaire, becomes founding president of Solvent Savings Banks, Memphis' first \"black\" bank, vital to the development of black-owned business.\n\n40. Marion Scudder Griffin in 1907 becomes the first woman to be granted a license to practice law in Tennessee; then, in 1923, she is the first woman elected to the state legislature. She practices law in Memphis for 40 years.\n\n41. The nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, the Church of God in Christ is organized by \"disfellowshipped\" black Baptist preachers and formally incorporated during a 1907 meeting in Memphis. The church's founding bishop is a Memphis advocate of Holy Ghost-inspired \"speaking in tongues,\" Charles Harrison Mason.\n\n42. The city's first speed limit is instituted in 1910. It is 8 mph.\n\n43. Edward Hull Crump is elected mayor of Memphis in 1909. He serves only one full term but he nevertheless essentially runs the city until the mid-1950s, as was known throughout the nation. In 1946, he appears on the cover of Time, identified as \"Memphis' Boss Crump.\"\n\n44. The Memphis Zoo begins to establish its reputation as the \"Hippo Capital\" of America with the 1914 arrival of its first hippopotamuses, Venus and Adonis. Enthusiastic parents, the proud pachyderms produce 16 calves.\n\n45. In 1914, the LeMoyne Normal and Commercial School — which traces its origins to a movement to provide education for free black people and runaway slaves — relocates to the Walker Avenue address where it remains, now greatly expanded and known as LeMoyne-Owen College.\n\n46. 1916: The Memphis Brooks Museum of Art opens in Overton Park.\n\n47. \"I'd rather be here/ Than anywhere I know.\" — W.C. Handy, 1916, \"The Beale Street Blues.\"\n\n48. Clarence Saunders, Part 1: A Virginia-born grocer who moved to Memphis in 1904, Saunders creates the self-service grocery store when the first Piggly Wiggly opens at 79 Jefferson Ave. on Sept. 11, 1916.\n\n49. In December 1919, the city fire department auctions off its 37 horses to make way for motorized vehicles. The horses, according to newspaper accounts, have full names: Among the veteran hay-burners to find buyers are Charlie Fitz, Mike Haggerty and Mike Fitzmorris.\n\n50. In 1923, The Commercial Appeal is awarded the Pulitzer Prize for public service for \"the publication of cartoons and the handling of news in reference to the operations of the Ku Klux Klan.'' Leading the charge in the newspaper's battles with the Klan are editor C.P.J. Mooney and cartoonist J.P. Alley.\n\n51. May 8, 1925: Immortalized as \"a very worthy Negro\" on an obelisk in the park that bears his name, 39-year-old levee worker Tom Lee — who could not swim — makes four trips in his small skiff, the Zev, to rescue 32 of the 72 people in danger of drowning in the swift currents of the Mississippi after the 1925 sinking of the M.E. Norman, a steamboat. Lee's effort remains Memphis' most famous act of heroism.\n\n52. \"The Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel,\" journalist David Cohn wrote in 1935. And that lobby has been at 149 Union Avenue since Sept. 1, 1925, when \"The South's Grand Hotel\" reopened at its second and still current location.\n\n53. Founded in Clarksville in 1848 as the Masonic University of Tennessee, the school that in 1984 would become known as Rhodes College relocates to Memphis in 1925.\n\n54. Operating out of a Midtown house on Poplar Avenue, infamous black market baby trafficker Georgia Tann makes millions selling thousands of infants from the 1920s until her death in 1950, which preceded the public revelation of her scam. Tann used pressure tactics and legal threats to dupe single mothers into giving up their babies, which she sold to wealthy or desperate couples through her \"adoption\" agency.\n\n55. Billed as one of the largest stores in the U.S., the Crosstown neighborhood Sears-Roebuck opens on Aug. 27, 1927, attracting a crowd of 2,000 before its art-deco doors are even unlocked.

Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing. It is a barbaric symphony of passion and hatred, spilling from a blood-tinted screen. It is mental and physical putrefaction.\"\n\n57. Aviator Charles Lindbergh, 25, visits Memphis in October 1927, some five months after his solo flight across the Atlantic makes him one of the world's most celebrated men.

Welcome Wagon, a company that attempts to connect new homeowners with local stores and businesses, is launched by Memphis entrepreneur Thomas Briggs in 1928.

A globe-trotting Indiana Jones of the 1920s and '30s whose adventures spellbound millions of newspaper readers, Memphian Richard Halliburton (namesake of Halliburton Tower on the Rhodes College campus) disappears in 1939 while attempting to cross the Pacific Ocean in a Chinese junk.\n\n67. 1934: Written by local political leader George Washington Lee, \"Beale Street: Where the Blues Began\" becomes the first book by a black author to be a Book-of-the-Month Club selection.\n\n68. 1937: The Goldsmith's department store on Main Street becomes one of the first major Memphis stores to adopt \"all-the-year-round air-conditioning,\" in the form of an old-school refrigeration system installed by an ice company.\n\n69. 1939: Memphis Light, Gas and Water is born after the city purchases a private electrical system, to augment its 37-years-earlier purchase of a private water delivery system.\n\n70. 1940: Struggling entertainer Amos Muzyad Yakhoob Kairouz — known professionally as Danny Thomas — enters a church in Detroit, falls to his knees, and prays \"specifically\" to St. Jude Thaddeus. \"If he was supposed to be the saint of the hopeless, that certainly included me,\" Thomas wrote in his autobiography. \"I blurted out those words, 'Help me to find my way in life, and I'll build you a shrine.'\" Twenty-two years later, Thomas — by then a top TV and nightclub star — founds St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, which becomes the world's leading institute in the battle against childhood cancer.\n\n71. The notorious \"Goat Gland Doctor,\" John Romulus Brinkley, earns a fortune and international fame by transplanting the testicular glands of goats into the testicule sacs of men, to restore the recipient's \"potency.\" Buried in Forest Hill Cemetery, Brinkley lives much of his life in Memphis, but performs most of his quackery in Kansas; he is bankrupted by lawsuits a few years before his 1941 death.\n\n72.

It soon becomes Memphis' top radio station, with a staff of disc jockeys that includes B.B. King and Rufus Thomas.\n\n74. A decade after TV came to New York, it arrives in Memphis when WMC — then co-owned by The Commercial Appeal — signs on the air on Dec. 11, 1948.

WHBQ-TV Channel 13 followed in 1953, then WREC-TV (now WREG) Channel 3 in 1956.\n\n75. Memphis businessman Kemmons Wilson opens the first Holiday Inn — a single-story motor court — in August 1952, at 4925 Summer. The name is inspired by the title of the 1942 Bing Crosby movie that introduced the song \"White Christmas.\" In 1965, the growing chain introduces a centralized reservation system, and by 1968 Wilson is operating 1,000 Holiday Inns across America. A 1972 Time magazine cover story labels Wilson \"The Man with 300,000 Beds.\"\n\n76. Broadcasting at \"1,000 Beautiful Watts,\" radio station WHER AM-1430 — \"The First All-Girl-Radio-Station in the World\" — goes on the air in October 1955, from a South Third studio dubbed \"The Doll Den,\" decorated with nylon stockings draped over clotheslines.

A mere satellite compared to the nuclear furnace of Sun, Cordell Jackson's Moon Records label in 1956 releases Jackson's double-sided holiday single, \"Rock and Roll Christmas,\" backed by \"Beboppers' Christmas.\" The latter song contains perhaps the most memorable introduction of St. Nick since Clement Moore's: \"He had white fuzz all over his chin/ He came boppin' up and said, 'Give me some skin.'\"\n\n78. Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage? It is certainly smooth and damp-looking, but who ever heard of a 172-pound sausage, 6 feet tall? Is it a Walt Disney goldfish? It has the same sort of big, soft beautiful eyes and curly lashes, but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns?\"\n\n79. Known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip, movie cowboy Lash LaRue is arrested for buying and concealing stolen property — sewing machines — in connection with car thefts that occur while he is a \"Wild West\" performer at the 1956 Mid-South Fair. Acquitted of the charges, LaRue returns to Memphis frequently in the 1970s and '80s as a guest of the nostalgia-oriented Memphis Film Festival.

A prime example of 1950s Polynesian exotica, the Luau restaurant opens at 3135 Poplar in February 1959.

Jan. 13, 1960: Striking a body blow against the establishment, professional wrestler Sputnik Monroe is arrested on a disorderly conduct charge for what an officer describes as the crime of \"drinking in a negro cafe with negros,\" according to The Commercial Appeal.

Sugarmon Jr., the future General Sessions judge. Sputnik was fined $26.\n\n82.

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins. During its late-1960s heyday, the Merrymobile company operates dozens of the iconic vehicles, which — with their striped canopy roofs — resemble circus tents or fairground carousels on wheels.\n\n90. On Christmas Eve 1963, Memphis earns the distinction of being the coldest spot in the nation when the city records a temperature of 13 degrees below zero; this remains the record low for Memphis.\n\n91.

Opening night movies include \"The Glass Bottom Boat,\" with Doris Day, and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.\"\n\n97. 1967: Inspired by Oakland's Black Panthers, young Memphis militants organize a \"black power\" group called the Invaders.

A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993. In The Commercial Appeal, critic Fredric Koeppel writes that the Arkansas-born Cloar \"drew on memories of rural life to compose canvases whose realism was tempered with touches of whimsy, folklore and mystery.\" Many of Cloar's paintings are on display at the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art.\n\n169. Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet. This is the humble origin of what is now the region's largest film event, the Indie Memphis Film Festival.\n\n174. Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals. Columnist Geoff Calkins calls it \"the first day of the rest of our baseball lives.\"\n\n175. 2001: A community gathering place and headquarters for the Memphis Public Libraries system, the new five-story $70 million \"main library\" opens at 3030 Poplar, replacing the old central library at Peabody and McLean. It is renamed the Benjamin L. Hooks Central Library in 2005.\n\n176. Ben Affleck, Michael Jordan and Donald Trump are among the 15,327 who reportedly attend the Mike Tyson-Lennox Lewis heavyweight boxing match at the Pyramid on June 8, 2002. Lewis knocks out Tyson in the 8th round in what at the time was the highest-grossing event in pay-per-view history.\n\n177. In 2002, former Shelby County Public Defender A C Wharton is elected the first black mayor of Shelby County. In 2009, he is elected the 63rd mayor of Memphis, but he loses his 2015 re-election bid to Jim Strickland.\n\n178. During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181. His fur was brown and shaggy, his belly was round and saggy: A slobby Everybear, the original version of Grizz, the Memphis Grizzlies mascot, is retired for the current blue-furred Superbear when the team moves from the Pyramid to FedExForum in 2004.\n\n182. A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184. March 5, 2006: Thirty-four years after Stax legend Isaac Hayes earned an Oscar in the same category for \"Theme from Shaft,\" Memphis hip-hop artists Jordan Houston (Juicy J), Paul Beauregard (DJ Paul) and Cedric Coleman (Frayser Boy) win the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \"It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp,\" their contribution to writer-director Craig Brewer's made-in-Memphis \"Hustle & Flow.\"\n\n185. Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W. Bush. \"Hold me close, hold me tight,\" sang Koizumi, as he put his arm around Elvis' daughter, Lisa Marie Presley.\n\n186. An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat. Reports of the marine mammal's meanderings transfixed Memphians for several days, but the docile creature eluded capture and came to a sad end: It was found dead in December in McKellar Lake.\n\n187. Farewell to the Ape Girl, water-skiing squirrels and a life-sized Dolly Parton sculpted from butter: The last Mid-South Fair at the old Fairgrounds is held in 2008.\n\n188. A second printing of more than 40,000 copies quickly disappears as Memphians descend on The Commercial Appeal offices on Nov. 5, 2008, seeking souvenir editions of the newspaper that reported Barack Obama's presidential victory with a front-page headline that proclaimed \"Yes He Did\" — a play on the Obama campaign slogan, \"Yes We Can.\"\n\n189. Sept. 22, 2009: Memphis Mayor Pro Tem Myron Lowery greets the Dalai Lama with a fist bump and the comment: \"I've always wanted to say, 'Hello, Dalai!'\"\n\n190. Crews in January 2010, dismantle Elvis' favorite roller coaster, the 80-year-old Zippin Pippin, marking a definitive end to decades of amusement park rides at the Fairgrounds. The nerve-wrackingly rickety old-school wooden roller coaster is re-created at the Bay Beach Amusement Park in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\n\n191. April 9, 2011: Funeral services are held for former University of Memphis basketball player and coach Larry Finch, 60, arguably the most significant sports figure in local history. Finch led Memphis State to the 1973 NCAA title game against victorious UCLA that — however briefly — united the city.\n\n192. After a decade of planning, Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid opens to the public on April 29, 2015, bringing camo boots, duck decoys and live gators to the 14-year-old pyramid-shaped arena that had hosted the Tigers, Grizzlies, Bruce Springsteen and Prince.\n\n193. May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196. According to city records, there currently are about 9,850 street names in Memphis, including Saint Nick Drive and North Pole Cove; Elvis Presley Boulevard and Elvis Cove; Danny Thomas Boulevard and Uncle Remus Road; Nottingham Place, Maid Marian Lane, Friar Tuck Road, Robin Hood Lane and Zorro Cove; Nightingale Drive, Parrot Cove, Parakeet Road and Mockingbird Lane; Panda Lane, Otter Drive and Doberman Cove; and, perplexingly, Sea Shore Road.\n\n197. Long distance information, give me Memphis, Missouri: Memphis, Tennessee, population 646,889 (according to the 2010 Census), may be the biggest Memphis in the United States, but it isn't the only one. Some others include Memphis, Florida, pop. 7,848; Memphis, Texas, 2,290; Memphis, Missouri, 1,822; Memphis, Nebraska, 114; Memphis, Mississippi, 70; and Memphis, Alabama, which, according to a 2017 estimate, has 28 residents.\n\n198.

You know you’re covered now, but I might have to look for a new policy next year yet again.” Michitsch says he’s never made a claim on his insurance and never had fire damage.\n\nThousands of homeowners like Michitsch have lost their insurance policies in the last few years as insurers pull out of areas that are at risk of fire damage or stop insuring homes altogether. They’ve been forced to scramble to find coverage from regular insurance providers or to turn as a last resort to a government sanctioned plan that at the moment only provides fire coverage.\n\nMore:Sanctuary provides a home to unwanted wild horses\n\nState Farm, the largest in the state, and Allstate and other insurers declined to renew roughly 350,000 policies in areas at high risk for wildfires since 2015 the California Department of Insurance said back in August, and the department has gotten “record numbers” of requests this year from insurers to increase the rates they charge property owners. The data also shows 33,000 policies were not renewed by insurers in zip codes affected by the major wildfires.\n\nWhile the insurance industry says the California property insurance market is resilient, state lawmakers and officials have had to scramble to keep the market from grinding to a halt from the unexpected additional risk.\n\nThe California legislature passed a law earlier this year giving the Department of Insurance emergency powers to keep policies in effect for those in fire-prone areas. This month California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara put a one-year moratorium on non-renewals, in hopes that lawmakers, insurance companies and other stakeholders can reach a more substantial solution for the roughly 1 million homeowners in zip codes adjacent to previous wildfires.\n\nMore:California auditor faults counties, state for lack of wildfire disaster planning\n\n“This wildfire insurance crisis has been years in the making, but it is an emergency we must deal with now if we are going to keep the California dream of home ownership from becoming the California nightmare, as an increasing number of homeowners struggle to find coverage,” Lara said in a statement.\n\nThe fires of 2017 and 2018 caused a combined $25.3 billion in damages according to the California Department of Insurance. That’s exponentially higher than the previous wildfires in 2015 and 2008, which caused $1.1 billion and $719 million in damages, respectively.\n\nThe insurance industry has yet to release an estimate of damages from this year’s wildfire season, but the costs are expected to be high. The most significant wildfire this year was the Kincade fire, which is started October 23 and has burned 78,000 acres in Sonoma county. It destroyed 374 buildings and damaged another 60, according to the California Department of Forestry & Fire Protection.\n\n“The wildfires in California will likely make it more difficult for California homeowners to buy insurance,” Stu Ryland, senior vice president of the Pacific Region at Sedgwick, an insurance claims management company. “Premiums are likely to go up, particularly in areas that are prone to wildfires and in some cases, it may be difficult for consumers to find an insurer willing to write their insurance.”\n\nMore:Destined to Burn: Wildfires threaten California — are we prepared?\n\nWhile some insurers are pulling out and others are reconsidering how they price property insurance, it is still available in one form or another to every homeowner, according to the Insurance Information Institute.\n\nHowever, those not insurable by regular insurance providers are having to turn to what’s known as the California FAIR Plan, which is a government-sanctioned association of insurers who pool together to cover the highest risk properties. FAIR Plan insurance currently only covers $1.5 million in damages, although Lara has ordered that starting in April 2020 it will cover $3 million in damages. Currently the FAIR Plan only covers fire, not other forms of risk, but California regulators have announced that FAIR Plan insurers can start doing comprehensive coverage.\n\nEarlier this month, the California FAIR Plan Association sued to block those changes, arguing Lara’s order is illegal.\n\nKarl Susman, owner of Susman Insurance Agency in Los Angeles, says the average annual premium on a homeowner policy plus FAIR to cover fire now costs around $2,500 a year, which is three times higher than it was three years ago.\n\n“These wildfires are not sustainable for these companies. They aren’t going to go bankrupt but they are just going to stop writing policies.”\n\nSusman said he worries that without a longer-term solution the California insurance market will repeat the experience after the 1994 California Northridge earthquake, which caused many insurance carriers to stop offering earthquake insurance. He’s already seen insurance companies limiting their risk to certain zip codes as well.\n\n“I haven’t seen anything like this in the 28 years I’ve been doing this,” he said.\n\nMore:17-year-old Siamese cat missing 15 months after fire is back with his Redding family\n\nFortunately, those who still do have insurance have been able to start rebuilding their lives after the fires.\n\nMaggie and Dan London of Santa Rosa lost their home in the massive and fatal Tubbs fire of 2017. They worked quickly after the fire, filing a claim and reaching out to their contractor that same day. But it took them two years to rebuild and move back in.\n\nLike many who tried to rebuild after the fire, they ran into obstacles — higher costs for labor and materials and ongoing talks with their insurer. All the same, Dan London feels his insurance company has done a fair job. And while they bought their home in 1979, he has not seen a sharp jump in insurance costs over time. The cost to insure their new home is slightly more, but Dan felt it reflects the increased value of the property.\n\n“I was expecting something triple, but it’s not at all,” he said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/30/business/florida-homeowners-insurance-ian/index.html", "title": "Florida's home insurance market was a mess before Ian. It's about to ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nFlorida homeowners were already facing an expensive and difficult market for home insurance before Hurricane Ian. The devastating storm is about to make things worse — even for those fortunate enough to escape any damage.\n\nFor the better part of two decades, the nation’s major insurers have wanted as little to do with Florida as possible, as least when it comes to insuring homes.\n\nThat has left the market in the hands of small, in-state insurers with limited resources. Six of those companies were declared insolvent this year, even before Ian. And homeowners in the state were already paying nearly triple the national average for insurance — $4,231 a year per policy, compared to a US average of $1,544, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute.\n\nNational insurers may be reluctant to compete for business in Florida because of the risks from hurricanes and tropical storms, said Matthew Carletti, an insurance industry analyst for JMP Securities.\n\n“When was the last time you had a $30 billion to $40 billion loss in Illinois?” he said. “Never.”\n\nClimate change and increased vulnerability to storms are only part of the issue. The insurance industry also blames Florida’s “tort” laws, which it says encourages far more lawsuits against insurers than in other states, for driving up costs.\n\n“There were 116,000 property claim lawsuits in 2021. We’re on pace for 130,000 this year, even before Ian,” said Mark Friedlander, spokesperson for the III, who is based in Florida. “In other states you might see only a few hundred. California, which is much larger, had 3,500 last year.”\n\nThe trade group for Florida’s trial lawyers says the problem is not the number of lawsuits but a lack of proper regulation. Rates have continued to rise even as the Florida legislature passed new restrictions on lawsuits, and they claim that the state is letting the industry call the shots on rates and the amount of coverage offered.\n\n“Florida’s Insurance Commissioner, David Altameir, has given them handouts in the form of rate increases and changes that slice coverage to the bare minimum for policyholders in the interest of preserving the insurance industry’s profits,” said Amy Boggs, head of the property insurance division of the Florida trial lawyer’s association. “With Hurricane Ian barreling down on Floridians, policyholders have a weaker and harder-to-use insurance product. This storm will expose the true effect of diminishing insurance products in Florida.”\n\nState-owned insurer no longer a “last resort”\n\nThe largest home insurer in Florida is a state-run company, Citizens Property Insurance Corp., which was set up in 2002 as an insurer of last resort for those who couldn’t find coverage in the private market. It has seen its number of policies more than double in the last two years, to 1.1 million, or 13% of the state market. The company’s market share is even greater in some large counties – 39% of policies in Miami-Dade and 36% in Monroe County, which includes the Florida Keys. Pinellas County, home of St. Petersburg, which was hit hard by Ian, has 27% of its policies with Citizens.\n\n“That’s not what ‘insurer of last resort’ is supposed to be,” said Carletti.\n\nState Farm covers just 8% of Florida’s home insurance market, and no other major national insurer has more than 4%. That’s just a fraction of their share of the state’s car insurance market, where the top five national insurers issue about 75% of the policies.\n\nCitizens says it believes it has the resources to pay the expected claims for damage from Ian. If those claims exceed its resources, the company can add assessments that could raise the premiums for all of its customers, and then, if necessary, place additional assessments on all insurance customers statewide.\n\nBut if the other financially strapped insurers based in the state also run into problems paying claims from Ian, some could tip into insolvency. That is a serious concern given the financial state of the industry in Florida.\n\n“It doesn’t matter how big a storm it is, it will be an issue because they’re already on shaky ground,” Carletti said Wednesday, just before Ian came ashore.\n\nHomeowners whose insurers are declared insolvent have their claims turned over to the Florida Insurance Guaranty Association, which backs claims the same way the FDIC insures deposits in failed banks. But that could also raise the cost of insurance for customers at all the other insurers in the state.\n\nFlood damage not covered by homeowner policies\n\nOne way Florida homeowners are no different from those in other states is that damage from flood waters is not covered by homeowners’ insurance. Those claims must be filed with the National Flood Insurance Program, a federal insurer operated by FEMA.\n\nFlorida has far more homes covered by the NFIP than any other state — nearly two out of three such policies written nationwide, said the III’s Friedlander. But that still represents only about 13% of the homes in Florida.\n\nMost homeowners get flood insurance only if they live in a designated flood plain and their mortgage lender requires it, so few residents get it unless they are required to do so.\n\nThere are growing concerns that the excessive rain and big storm surge from Ian could cause flooding in many areas that are not designated flood plains.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore"], "publish_date": "2022/09/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/17/business/west-drought-farmers-survey-climate/index.html", "title": "American farmers are killing their own crops and selling cows ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nNearly three quarters of US farmers say this year’s drought is hurting their harvest – with significant crop and income loss, according to a new survey by the American Farm Bureau Federation, a lobbying group that represents agricultural interests.\n\nThis year’s drought conditions are taking a harder toll than last year’s, as 37% of farmers said they are plowing through and killing existing crops that won’t reach maturity because of dry conditions. That’s a jump from 24% last year, according to the survey.\n\nJuly was the third-hottest on record for the US and ranked in the top 10 for every state in the West except for Montana, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information. The US Department of Agriculture’s weekly weather and crop bulletin ending the week of August 6 reported “rapidly intensifying drought gripped the central and southern Plains and mid-South, depleting topsoil moisture and significantly stressing rangeland, pastures, and various summer crops.”\n\nThe AFBF estimates nearly 60% of West, South and Central Plains are experiencing severe drought or higher this year.\n\n“The effects of this drought will be felt for years to come, not just by farmers and ranchers but also by consumers. Many farmers have had to make the devastating decision to sell off livestock they have spent years raising or destroy orchard trees that have grown for decades,” said Zippy Duvall, AFBF president.\n\nThe AFBF survey was conducted across 15 states from June 8 to July 20 in extreme drought regions from Texas to North Dakota to California, which makes up nearly half of the country’s agricultural production value.\n\nIn California – a state with high fruit and nut tree crops – 50% of farmers in the state said they had to remove trees and multiyear crops due to drought, the survey revealed, which will affect future revenue. And 33% of all US farmers said they’ve had to do the same, nearly double the number from last year.\n\nSelling off herds\n\nFarmers in Texas are being forced to sell off their cattle herds earlier than normal due to extreme drought – as water sources dry out and grass burns up. Farmers in the Lone Star state reported the largest reduction in herd size, down 50%, followed by New Mexico and Oregon at 43% and 41% respectively.\n\n“We haven’t had this kind of movement of cows to market in a decade, since 2011, which was our last really big drought,” said David Anderson, a professor of Agricultural Economics at Texas A&M told CNN last month.\n\nAccess to water for livestock has been a key issue for farmers and ranchers this year, with 57% reporting local restrictions on water use, compared to 50% of farmers last year. Key water sources in places like Lake Mead and Lake Powell – which are running below 30% of their full capacity – typically provide water to 5.5 million acres of land in seven western states according to the AFBF.\n\nOn Tuesday, the federal government announced the Colorado River will operate in a Tier 2 shortage condition for the first time starting in January. That means means Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will have to further reduce their water usage from Colorado River.\n\nHigh inflation makes it harder for ranchers to salvage their land. The cost of diesel is falling but is still high, making it significantly more expensive to truck in additional water than in years past. The price of fertilizer for grass and crops and feed for animals also remains expensive.\n\nConsumer impact\n\nUS consumers can expect to spend more on certain food products because of the drought, according to the report.\n\n“For cattle and beef, once the market processes the excess animals sent to slaughter and has a smaller breeding herd to operate off of- [price increases] could be six months to well over a year. For specialty crops it could be immediate upon harvest,” said Daniel Munch, an economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n\nFruits, nuts, and vegetables overwhelmingly come from states that with high levels of drought. But farmers have been forced to forgo planting or destroy orchards. This will “will likely result in American consumers paying more for these goods and either partially relying on foreign supplies or shrinking the diversity of items they buy at the store,” the report states.\n\nFor example, California grows 80% of the world’s supply of almonds – limiting other places US consumers can buy the popular nut. And shifting where almonds can grow is not easy – as the crop needs a specific climate and soil.\n\n“In general, the outlook for the 2022 crop volume is more pessimistic than a month ago and much more than two months ago,” a July report from The Almond Board of California notes. The key culprits were drought, low water supply, and the removal of orchards.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistic’s August inflation report shows US consumers are spending 9.3% more on fruits and vegetables from a year ago.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the American Farm Bureau Federation.

Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built.

Will it be ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe United States government is pulling out all the stops to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing, injecting billions of dollars into the beleaguered sector and flexing all policy muscles available to give it a leg up over competition from Asia.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, firms initially curtailed orders for these micro building blocks needed for smartphones, computers, cars and many other products. Then, as people began working from home, demand soared for information and communication technology – and the chips that power them. A chip shortage ensued, and auto plants had to stop production because they could not obtain chips. This contributed to skyrocketing new and used vehicle prices, a major driver of the painful inflation Americans were feeling.\n\nIn a statement earlier this year, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo dubbed the semiconductor shortage a “national security” issue because it exposed the dependency of US manufacturing on imports of semiconductors from abroad. Chips also serve critical military applications and are necessary for cybersecurity tools.\n\nThe Biden administration and lawmakers rallied in response, passing the CHIPS and Science Act into law in August. The legislation includes $52 billion to strengthen semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Of this, $39 billion is earmarked for manufacturing incentives, $13.2 billion for research and development and workforce training, and $500 million for international information communications technology security and semiconductor supply chain activities.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, several prominent companies have announced significant investments in US manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), a powerhouse in the industry committed at least $12 billion to build a semiconductor fabrication plant in Arizona, with production expected to begin in 2024. At the start of the year, Intel said it planned to build a $20 billion semiconductor manufacturing plant in Ohio, and groundbreaking for the new chip plant took place just last month. And this month, Micron said it would invest up to $100 billion over the next two decades to build a massive semiconductor factory in upstate New York.\n\nIn a flurry of tweets earlier this month President Joe Biden pledged: “America is going to lead the way in microchip manufacturing.”\n\nBut the US has much catching up to do. US-based fabs, or chip manufacturing plants, currently only account for 12% of the world’s modern semiconductor manufacturing capacity, according to data from the Semiconductor Industry Association trade group. Some 75% of the world’s modern chip manufacturing is now concentrated in East Asia – a majority of that in geopolitically-vulnerable Taiwan. And even with these renewed efforts, the United States does not currently have the same talent and supply chain pipeline as some Asian markets do to support a robust homegrown industry.\n\nA chip by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is seen at the 2020 World Semiconductor Conference in Nanjing in China's eastern Jiangsu province on August 26, 2020. STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTo complicate matters, the surge in public and private investments comes at a questionable time, as concerns over the global chip supply shortage have eased. Pandemic-related supply chain blockages are letting up somewhat and a worsening economic outlook has hampered demand.\n\nIn an earnings call last week, TSMC CEO C.C. Wei warned it expects the “semiconductor industry will likely decline” in 2023. “TSMC also is not immune,” Wei added, but said it expects “to be more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry.”\n\nPromoting semiconductor manufacturing in the United States now may risk leading to overcapacity and excess supply. And with demand weakening, it isn’t immediately clear if government subsidies will be enough to overcome other obstacles the country faces in developing a competitive semiconductor manufacturing hub.\n\nUnderstanding the US problems\n\nTo understand the latest US efforts, it’s important to be clear on where the country stands – not just in the overall chip industry, but in relation to specific, valuable pockets of it.\n\n“The US is very unlikely to increase its share of global production because even as the US brings online more fab capacity; TSMC, Intel and others are announcing fabs in other places and building them even more quickly,” said Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“But I don’t necessarily think that’s really a huge problem,” he added. He noted that measuring manufacturing based on pure output lumps together the lower-end chips and the cutting-edge, higher-end chips that are a more realistic and significant measure of chip manufacturing success. “The US does need to expand chip production for a specific kind of chips, that are directly related to American national security,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration last Friday imposed sweeping new export curbs designed to restrict China’s access to advanced semiconductors made with US equipment, in a move that targets the manufacturing of advanced weapons systems.\n\nWhile only “about 10% to 14% of chips sold [globally] come from US manufacturing facilities,” according to Columbia Business School professor Dan Wang, the United States does have other strengths. “In terms of design expertise, a lot of that still resides in the U.S.”\n\nTechnicians inspect a piece of equipment during a tour of the Micron Technology automotive chip manufacturing plant Feb. 11, 2022, in Manassas, Va. Steve Helber/AP\n\nStill, the shortcomings are real. “When it comes to foundries, which are the manufacturing side of semiconductors, the U.S. has not really been a major player for many, many years,” said Wang. While it very much used to be, manufacturing began migrating to Asia during the 1980s and ’90s, Wang said. “One of the big reasons for this is that the cost of labor is lower, and it’s just far cheaper to produce at a very massive scale, integrated circuits and chips, in those parts of the world,” Wang added. Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, said that it costs 50% more to manufacture chips in the U.S. than in Taiwan.\n\nNow, simply having the facilities already set up to produce or expand chip manufacturing gives Asia a big advantage. Wang said he thinks that might be why you see the U.S. “axe-throwing so much money at companies to set up plants in the United States.” It’s not just to respond to demand and become more self-reliant, “but also because you need to get these things up and running very, very quickly, in order to even be in the race at all.”\n\nWhat it takes to build up a domestic chip industry\n\nBuilding new chip fabs itself is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. “A modern fab is something like half a million square feet,” said Bob Johnson, an analyst at Gartner, and requires “monstrous clean rooms that have massive air handling capabilities.” He added that these massive buildings require “exceptionally strong foundations.” As he put it, “you cannot have any vibration in the fab because it can wreck the manufacturing process.”\n\nIn addition, a single extreme ultraviolet lithography machine, required to map out the circuitry of chips, costs about $150 million, and Reuters reports “a cutting-edge chip plant needs 9-18 of these machines.”\n\nMoreover, the manufacturing of semiconductors requires a range of specialized inputs, including pure chemicals such as fluorinated polyimide, and etching gas, chip etching machines, and more. In places like Taiwan and Fukuoka, Japan, supply chains have developed where the providers of these products are located close to the semiconductor factories. There are also one or two companies that produce vital inputs and that have been trustworthy suppliers to companies in Asia for a long time. This is not yet the case in places like Arizona and Ohio, where plans to build massive chip manufacturing plants are already underway.\n\nYou also need a labor force willing and able to do the work.\n\nIn the United States, there is both a shortage of new graduates and experienced workers with the technical and engineering knowledge necessary to manufacture semiconductors. Many of those who might have the right experience instead prefer to work in trendier industries, according to Kennedy.\n\n“If we were to today, snap our fingers and have ten new fabs with the world’s leading chips, we probably wouldn’t have enough people to staff them,” Kennedy said. “That’s the biggest bottleneck to the expansion of America’s fab capacity, not capital.”\n\nIntel has tried to establish close relations with Arizona State University to recruit engineers, but it is unclear whether it and other companies building fabs in America will be able to hire enough trained engineers and technicians. If not, even the billions of dollars committed by the private and public sector may not be enough to reshore semiconductor manufacturing.", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/18/politics/treasury-extreme-weather-insurance-rates-climate/index.html", "title": "Treasury Department will assess how extreme weather is increasing ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Treasury Department announced on Tuesday it is launching an assessment of worsening extreme weather and its impact on the cost of insurance.\n\nAs climate change is making storms stronger and more destructive, Treasury officials told CNN they want to take a hard look at how climate-related disasters are driving up insurance rates around the country.\n\nThe department’s Federal Insurance Office is requesting zip-code level data from US insurance companies regarding their policies and prices. This is the first time the department has used its authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to ask insurance companies for such high-resolution data on its policies.\n\nTreasury intends to combine that information with climate data to “assess the potential for major disruptions of private insurance coverage in regions of the country that are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,” according to a news release.\n\nInsurance companies are regulated by the states and Treasury officials have been receiving some data from state regulators. But what’s lacking is consistent and granular data that federal and state officials can use to understand how climate change is impacting insurance risk and rates, officials told CNN.\n\n“We need a consistent, comparable granular set of data in order to understand the scale and scope of the problem and the risks we’re facing,” said Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions Graham Steele. “The goal here is to get a granular, zip-code level picture of what’s happening and where, and what the impacts are on households and on the economy and financial system writ large.”\n\nThe data could ultimately be used to determine whether changes are needed in the US insurance market, Treasury officials told CNN, which has been reeling from back-to-back years of intense hurricanes in the Eastern US and wildfires in the West.\n\nEven before Hurricane Ian slammed into Florida, homeowners in the state were paying three times the national average for their insurance premiums, CNN has reported – $4,231 a year, compared to a US average of $1,544, according to report from the Insurance Information Institute. Six insurers in Florida have gone insolvent this year, pulling out of the market and canceling their customers’ policies, leaving property owners with fewer and more expensive insurance options as they look to rebuild.\n\nAnd much of the damage caused by Hurricane Ian and other tropical storms comes from flooding, which is not covered under standard homeowners’ policies and is primarily covered only by the National Flood Insurance Program run by FEMA. Hurricane Ian caused an estimated $17 billion of uninsured flood damage according to an estimate from CoreLogic, which estimates losses from natural disasters.\n\nTreasury’s data collection could bring new transparency to an opaque market that millions of Americans rely on to insure their homes against weather-related risks, one expert said.\n\n“We will see how brittle and unstable these markets are and really how arbitrary the pricing is at the end of the day,” Jesse Keenan, a professor of sustainable real estate at Tulane University’s School of Architecture, told CNN. “The scale of [climate change] and its impacts are so great; they’re extending beyond state borders.”\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement that Tuesday’s announcement “is an important step in determining how Americans are being affected by the increasing costs of climate change.”\n\n“The recent impacts in Florida from Hurricane Ian demonstrate the critical nature of this work and the need for an increased understanding of insurance market vulnerabilities in the United States,” Yellen said.\n\nTreasury is requesting public comments on the proposed data collection before it moves forward with the project.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/24/us/atlanta-public-safety-training-center-plans-community/index.html", "title": "Atlanta wants to build a massive police training facility in a forest ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nWhen Ram moved to the Boulder Walk neighborhood just southeast of Atlanta five years ago, it felt like finding a hidden gem: It was a diverse, affordable and family-friendly community just steps away from the local high school, bordering a forest but still a short drive from the big city; perfect for her family of five.\n\nBut she hasn’t been able to get used to hearing the daily sprays of gunfire.\n\n“When I first moved here, it increased my anxiety,” Ram, who did not want her full name used due to privacy concerns, said. “It messed up my nerves.”\n\nThe sound comes from a nearby Atlanta police firing range. It’s unnerving, residents from several nearby neighborhoods told CNN. Worse, they worry it’s just a glimpse into what could come when local officials begin building a massive police and fire training center in their backyards. “I absolutely want the police to be well-trained,” said Joe Santifer, who lives in another neighborhood, roughly a mile away from where the facility is slated to be built. “But if they’re not being good neighbors now, what will give us the confidence that they’ll be good neighbors in the future?”\n\nJoe Santifer poses for a portrait at Glen Emerald Rock Garden in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 22, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThe expected $90 million, 85-acre center, announced and approved by the city of Atlanta last year, will include a shooting range, mock city and burn building, among other facilities. The Atlanta Police Foundation says the center is needed to help boost morale and recruitment efforts, and previous facilities law enforcement has used are substandard, while fire officials now train in “borrowed facilities.” The police foundation, a nonprofit established in 2003, helps fund local policing initiatives through public - private partnerships. Among those sitting on its board of trustees are leaders of UPS, Wells Fargo, The Home Depot, Equifax and Delta Air Lines.\n\nBut the plan has been met with fierce resistance from a community still reeling from monthslong demonstrations protesting police brutality and racial injustice. Some locals say the city’s announcement blindsided neighbors and the development process since has largely been a secretive one with limited input from the most affected communities.\n\nFor others, the facility poses environmental concerns at a time when the deadly impacts of climate change have become hard to ignore: The training center would carve out a chunk of forested land Atlanta leaders previously seemed to agree to preserve, though the city says officials are committed to replacing trees destroyed in construction.\n\nActivists determined to stop the project have camped out in the forest’s trees and, despite a permit which could soon signal the start of construction, say they have no plans to leave.\n\nA promise unkept\n\nAtlanta and then-Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms were in the national spotlight in 2020 as protests erupted across the country over police killings of Black people, including Rayshard Brooks, a Black man fatally shot in the back by Atlanta police.\n\nThe city’s police chief resigned and Bottoms denounced the “chaos” she said was unfolding on the city’s streets, adding she was trying to strike a “tough balance” between criticizing police officers and supporting the ones who protected the city.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, following mounting pressure over a demoralized police force, Bottoms announced plans to build a new police training academy in an unincorporated part of neighboring DeKalb County on a controversial parcel of land owned and used as a prison farm by the city for much of the 1900s, sprawling across more than 300 acres. Prisoners there were subject to harsh punishments and bleak conditions, including poor sanitation and nutrition and overcrowding, according to the Atlanta Community Press Collective, a local group of researchers and writers.\n\n“We knew that (the training facility) was a direct response to the uprisings that took place in 2020,” said Kwame Olufemi, of Community Movement Builders, a Black member-based grassroots organization opposing the project.\n\nThe site of the proposed project, the Old Atlanta Prison Farm – where graffitied ruins now sit entwined with weeds and vines surrounded by forested land – is a “cultural landscape of memory,” say local advocates, who have long called for it to be turned into a park and memorial.\n\nIt’s also less than half a mile away from a tributary of the South River, which is one of America’s most endangered, according to nonprofit conservation group American Rivers. That’s a result of decades of neglect and pollution the area, which is overwhelmingly Black, has endured, local advocates say.\n\nIn 2017, a report authored by Atlanta’s city planning department which envisioned the prison farm as a key part of a larger effort to protect green spaces around the river was adopted into the city charter. It felt like a “unanimous promise” from city leaders to protect the land, said Joe Peery, with local volunteer group Save The Old Atlanta Prison Farm.\n\nBut in September 2021, after hearing roughly 17 hours of public comment – the majority of which was against the training center – the Atlanta City Council approved a ground lease agreement with the Atlanta Police Foundation, allowing for 85 acres of the prison farm site to be turned into the training facility while the other 265 is slated to be preserved as greenspace. (For comparison, the NYPD’s training academy is a roughly 32-acre campus; the LAPD training campus is about 20 acres.) Andre Dickens, Atlanta’s current mayor, was among the council members who voted for the lease.\n\n“Everybody was floored,” said Jacqueline Echols, board president for the South River Watershed Alliance, an organization working to protect the river. “Just in 2017 they’d said this would be a park and a community investment.”\n\nJacqueline Echols stands for a portrait outside of Intrenchment Creek Park in Atlanta, Georgia, on August 3, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThough the land is in unincorporated DeKalb County, it’s long been owned by the city, and residents in the surrounding area don’t have a say in city elections or vote for the leaders who made this decision. “It was kind of foisted upon us,” Santifer, who lives in Glen Emerald Park, said. “That’s part of the issue: the lack of transparency, the lack of engagement with this community because frankly, they know the community doesn’t want it.”\n\nThe police foundation has said the city went through an “exhaustive review of its properties” before selecting the site, adding it is the only one owned by Atlanta big enough to accommodate the two departments’ needs. And even if another privately-controlled site was identified, the foundation has said, preparing it for development would take “decades and present taxpayers with an unwarranted financial burden.”\n\nCity spokesperson Bryan Thomas told CNN the prison farm site was “a pragmatic choice, given its adjacency, its ownership by the City and its former and continued use” by Atlanta’s police and fire rescue departments.\n\nOther sites were explored over several years, Thomas said, adding the city engaged with a group of designers, architects and engineers about what a “first-rate training center” would require. The group eventually focused on the prison farm site since it has previously hosted training facilities, like the firing range, Thomas added.\n\nCNN also reached out to the police foundation for comment.\n\nAfter the September 2021 vote, Bottoms said she was aware of widespread opposition to the facility, but the city did not have any other site options to choose from, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The center was a move to support the city’s fire and police officers “while also focusing on sensible reform,” Bottoms, who did not run for reelection, said in a September 2021 news release.\n\nThe White House had no comment from Bottoms, who serves as senior adviser to the President for public engagement.\n\nActivists living in trees to stop ‘Cop City’\n\nPerhaps the loudest voices of opposition come from activists and organizers who have dubbed the plan “Cop City” and called on Mayor Dickens to cancel the lease.\n\n“Tree sitters” and other members of the “Defend the Atlanta Forest” movement built shelters in trees to prevent the facility’s construction and have also called attention to the forest’s history, saying a police center will continue a legacy of oppression on the land. Before it was a prison farm, White settlers established slave-based plantations in the area after forcing off the Muscogee Creek tribe, according to anthropologist Mark Auslander. Forest defenders refer to it today by its Muscogee name, Weelaunee Forest, as a nod to its original inhabitants.\n\nMembers of the movement have been accused by local officials and some neighbors of using violent tactics in related opposition efforts, including allegedly setting a tow truck on fire. In May, eight protesters were arrested after a Molotov cocktail was allegedly thrown at police as authorities tried to remove them from the area, according to CNN affiliate WSB. But it did not deter their efforts. The Defend the Atlanta Forest Twitter account posted a letter in August it said was from a tree sitter. “I’ll be here keeping up the struggle,” the letter said. “My question to the (Atlanta Police Foundation) is: When will you give up?”\n\nA person walks near the entrance to Intrenchment Creek Park in Atlanta, Georgia, on August 3, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThe Community Movement Builders group, which also opposes the plan, would have liked to see the financial resources instead be put toward mental health, food and housing programs for south Atlanta communities, according to Olufemi.\n\nTaxpayers will fund about $30 million of the facility’s cost in total, with the rest coming from private philanthropic and corporate donations, the city has said. Among those backing the center is the Atlanta Committee for Progress, a partnership between the mayor and the city’s top business, civic and academic leaders. Its former chairman, Alex Taylor, Chairman and CEO of Cox Enterprises, led the initial private funding campaign for the center at then-Mayor Bottoms’ request. (Cox owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the city’s major daily newspaper.)\n\nCox Enterprises spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs told CNN in a statement, “The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has always operated with complete editorial independence, and the newspaper, in its coverage of the police training facility, has repeatedly disclosed that it is owned by Cox Enterprises.”\n\nAtlanta Police Foundation President and CEO Dave Wilkinson wrote in a 2021 Atlanta Journal-Constitution op-ed a surge in violent crime across Atlanta since the summer of 2020 called for “more effective law enforcement,” but the city had struggled to build morale and retain employees in recent years.\n\nResidents who are in support of the facility told CNN they wanted police to be able to train properly and hoped the development would make their communities safer and help spur economic development.\n\nSpence Gould, a marine and resident of the Boulder Walk community for roughly a decade, said he sees the need for a training center. “I want my police force very well-trained, I want them to have all the resources that they need,” Gould told CNN. “But I also see the (Defend the Atlanta Forest) concerns because we are really wrecking the planet.”\n\nOnce the foundation has a land disturbance permit (which is still under review, according to DeKalb County) and construction begins, a fence will be put up around the site and anyone on the property “will be arrested,” Wilkinson told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in March.\n\nConstruction is expected to begin in the late fall and the first phase of the facility is expected to open before the end of 2023, the city spokesperson said.\n\nAmid climate crisis, advocates urge city not to cut trees\n\nTrees are seen with hearts placed on them near the planned police development in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 22, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nBefore the mayor’s sudden announcement, the prison farm site had been a key centerpiece in another vision: the South River Forest.\n\nThe forest is a 3,500-acre network of connected green spaces across parts of Atlanta and DeKalb County, which advocates say is desperately needed. Despite being known as the “city in a forest,” Atlanta has massive disparities in green space, with fewer and smaller parks in predominantly Black areas like this one. And with a population size expected to sharply increase in the coming decades, the benefits the forest can provide – floodplain restoration, habitat expansion and tree canopy protection, among others – will be critical, the Nature Conservancy has said.\n\nIn August 2021, more than a dozen environmental organizations, including the Sierra Club’s Georgia Chapter, wrote an open letter to city leaders urging them not to lease the prison farm site to the police foundation, arguing fragmenting the South River Forest will leave surrounding communities vulnerable to adverse impacts, like stormwater flooding – a problem already worsening because of climate change.\n\n“The forest serves as the city’s lungs,” said Nina Dutton, chair of the Sierra Club Metro Atlanta Group. “Forests capture carbon, they clean the air … they mitigate flooding and prevent erosion and they help keep the city cool. Breaking up this area of forest would reduce the amount of forest that’s available to help us in those ways.”\n\nThe forest vision could also spur economic development in long neglected areas and reconcile decades of environmental injustice with investment, said urban planner Ryan Gravel. “If you live in a community in the South River Forest, you’re more likely to live within walking distance of a landfill or a prison than anywhere else in metro Atlanta, by far,” he said. “You’re talking about an area that has historically been treated as a dumping ground.”\n\nDiscarded bags of trash are seen along a hole in a fence that leads into a proposed police development in Atlanta on August 15, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThomas, the city’s spokesperson, said training facilities will make up less than half the site, while the rest will be green space open to the public and include walking trails and picnic areas.\n\nMuch of the land to be developed has previously been cleared of trees and the parts including forest cover are “overwhelmingly dominated by invasive species,” devoid of thick forest, Thomas added. The Atlanta Police Foundation has committed to replace any hardwood tree destroyed in construction with 10 new ones and replace any invasive species with hardwood trees, the spokesperson added.\n\nBut advocates with Save the Old Atlanta Prison Farm argue most of the land has been reforested and reducing the forest in any way would also reduce the economic opportunities for the surrounding communities. “The noise and smoke coming from the Police Training Facility would further erode that impact,” the group has said.\n\nAlthough the training center will put a dent in advocates’ plans, many are still determined to see the South River Forest come to life. An ongoing initiative by the Nature Conservancy and the Atlanta Regional Commission is collecting community input about the forest’s future and is slated to wrap up in the coming weeks.\n\n“This could be the first step in starting to reverse some of the discrimination that this part of the city has seen over the last decades,” Santifer, who is among the project managers of that initiative, said.\n\n‘Violations of our environment and our neighborhoods’\n\nDeKalb County leaders could soon take a vote on a resolution introduced by county commissioner Ted Terry calling for an environmental assessment of the site and a noise study for the proposed center – and asks developers to reconsider the location if their plan cannot satisfy environmental standards. (Atlanta Police Foundation officials have said the center will “be built with 21st century EPA standards and controls.”)\n\nTerry recently said on Twitter county leaders have received more public comment from residents on this issue than any other during his tenure. “All opposed,” he wrote.\n\nDickens, Atlanta’s mayor, told the New Yorker recently an advisory committee created in the aftermath of the lease approval offered a way for public input on the project. But critics of the group note its members were appointed by local officials and don’t have the power to hold the police foundation and developers accountable to the community’s concerns.\n\nOne member was voted out after publishing an opinion piece criticizing the police foundation and project developers for misleading the community and avoiding their environmental due diligence – including by never investigating the possibility of unmarked graves on the prison farm land.\n\nA \"Defend the Atlanta Forest\" sign is seen in Atlanta, Georgia, on July 22, 2022. Austin Steele/CNN\n\nThe committee isn’t meant to serve as a watchdog, but rather to make recommendations on changes or adjustments to the development which would benefit surrounding communities, said committee chair Alison Clark. And so far, the foundation has adopted all the group’s recommendations, she added, including relocating the center’s firing range further away from residential areas.\n\nClark, who has lived in the Boulder Walk neighborhood for roughly eight years, told CNN she is in favor of the training facility. She agrees the area has long been used as a “dumping ground” for unpopular developments like landfills, and hopes the center can help economically lift the area, bring in new vendors and also boost police presence. “At the end of the day, I think that’s a win-win for the community,” she said.\n\nBut ahead of the DeKalb County commissioners’ vote, county leaders heard from residents who said the project remained highly unpopular among the surrounding communities and urged for the approval of Terry’s resolution.\n\n“Residents in the area, who are predominantly Black and brown, often low-income, have been left out of the decision-making process and their voices have been ignored,” DeKalb County resident Brad Beadles said during an August meeting, according to a summary posted on the county’s website. “No one should have to be subjected to such clear harmful violations of our environment and our neighborhoods.”\n\nTerry told CNN he is taking more feedback from community members on the resolution and expects a vote on it from the commission next month.", "authors": ["Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/22/politics/wind-energy-oklahoma-republican-states-climate/index.html", "title": "Wind energy is booming in deep-red Republican states | CNN Politics", "text": "WEATHERFORD, Oklahoma CNN —\n\nDriving west from Oklahoma City to the outskirts of Weatherford, wind turbines don’t just dot the landscape; they dominate it.\n\nFrom oil and gas booms and busts to heavy rains followed by drought, Oklahoma is no stranger to extremes.

Long an area devoted to oil and gas, Western Oklahoma is now home to one of the largest wind farms in the world.\n\nThe Traverse wind farm is made up of 356 turbines — each rising about 300 feet above the ground and spread out across 220,000 acres. The turbines tower over shimmering fields of wheat and give shade to cattle munching on hay. As they spin, they generate close to 1 gigawatt of energy; together with two other AEP-owned wind farms nearby, the trio will make enough electricity to power 440,000 homes each year.\n\nWind turbines are an icon for the energy transition and the subject of heated debate in Washington. They’ve been mocked by prominent members of the GOP, including former President Donald Trump, who recently called wind the “worst form of energy.”\n\nBut Weatherford Mayor Mike Brown told CNN that for the landowners in Western Oklahoma, the sound of a huge metal blade cutting through the atmosphere is “the sound of money.” For people who have long lived with wind whipping across their flat land, using it to make electricity is common sense.\n\nScott Hampton feeds the cattle on his farm.

It’s ‘how does it affect us?’ Some things we can’t control, this is something we can.”\n\nThe farmers who lease their land for wind energy hope it brings new financial stability to the area. Those who spoke with CNN said AEP will deliver 6-month payments to landowners based on how much electricity their turbines generate, as well as a base payment. Even people leasing land without a turbine on it will get a yearly check.\n\n“As long as they’re spinning, they’re making us money,” said Scott Hampton, who farms a small herd of cattle and works at the local school. “In my view, it’s not a fight; it’s what can we do that’s good for the environment.”\n\nA red-state boom\n\nA worker walks along the base of a wind turbine at the Traverse wind farm. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nWind energy is on the brink of a massive expansion in the next few years, data from the US Energy Information Administration shows. Of the wind projects becoming operational this year, Traverse is by far the biggest.\n\nWind energy is the fourth-largest electricity source behind natural gas, coal and nuclear. Wind generated near 380 terawatt-hours of energy in 2021, according to the EIA, which projects another 7.6 gigawatts of utility-scale wind will be brought online this year (a terawatt is a thousand times bigger than a gigawatt).\n\nMuch of the country’s current wind capacity is on land, and President Joe Biden’s administration is focusing on building off the coasts, with a goal of getting 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy online by the end of the decade. Still, many of the biggest offshore projects won’t come online until 2024 at the earliest.\n\nWhile the offshore wind industry has been particularly slow to get off the ground — driven in part by objections from some wealthy and well-connected Democrats and Republicans alike that wind turbines ruin the view — wind energy is booming in deep-red Republican states in the central US.\n\nTexas, in addition to being an oil and gas giant, is also a wind behemoth. In 2020, Texas generated more electricity from wind than Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma — the next three highest states — combined, according to the EIA. Still, because Texas is massive and both generates and uses the most total electricity out of any state in the nation, wind only accounted for 20% of its generated electricity.\n\nWind generated a higher proportion of electricity in Iowa (57%), Kansas (44%), and Oklahoma (36%). And in the Southwest Power Pool — which is the grid for Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana and other states — renewable power is steadily growing.\n\nNon-hydropower renewables generated nearly 94 billion kilowatt-hours on that grid in 2021 and are poised to grow to nearly 115 billion kilowatt-hours by 2023, according to the EIA. In comparison, non-hydro renewables generated just 7 billion kilowatt-hours for New York’s grid in 2021.\n\nThe wind whips at an American flag. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nThere are a few reasons wind is thriving in the middle of the country, said Ben King, a senior analyst at the nonpartisan think tank Rhodium Group. It’s an ideal location for consistent wind, it’s easier to build big projects in states that have streamlined their permitting process, and there are more utilities serving the area looking to invest in renewables.\n\n“It has made it easier for wind developers to come in and put wind farms there,” King said.\n\nFor big utility companies like AEP, renewables make more sense to invest in from a cost and risk standpoint. Unlike fuels like coal and natural gas, the wind is free and the cost of wind energy is dropping steeply.\n\n“All those investments are more risky than a renewables investment,” AEP CEO Nick Akins told CNN. “We’re moving towards a clean energy economy; nothing’s going to stop that.”\n\nA 300-foot office\n\nLance Hull, a plant manager at Traverse. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nA ladder runs up the inside of a wind turbine at the Traverse wind farm. Workers must climb up nearly 300 feet in order to perform inspections and maintenance on the turbines. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nOn a blustery April morning, Traverse plant manager Lance Hull pointed to the end of a turbine blade that was bending slightly with the wind. That slight flex is how Hull knows the wind is blowing at optimal speed to generate electricity.\n\n“We want as much wind to hit that blade and push it as we can actually catch,” Hull told CNN.\n\nThe machines do a lot of the work themselves. Standing under a turbine, you can sometimes hear the motor that pivots the blades so they face whatever way the wind is blowing. The turbines themselves can also adjust to spin slower or faster than the wind — trying to maintain the most favorable speed to generate electricity.\n\n“The machine actually takes into account the fact that we can’t control the power that pushes the machine because it is wind,” Hull said. “You can’t control the wind.”\n\nEven though Hull’s title is “plant manager,” there is no plant at Traverse in the sense of a traditional coal- or gas-run power plant. Instead, Hull and his crew of about 50 workers spend their days driving, doing spot checks and maintenance on their turbines — which usually means climbing up the turbines themselves.\n\nBlake Panek, senior wind technician, performs a routine inspection inside one of the wind turbines at the Traverse wind farm. To his left is Matt Miller, environmental coordinator principal at Traverse. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nThe traverse wind farm as seen from the top of one of the turbines. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\n“Your office is at 300 feet,” said Blake Panek, a senior wind technician at AEP who works on Hull’s crew.\n\nClimbing and being comfortable with heights is an essential part of being a wind technician. Decked out in a safety harness and attached to a pulley system, Panek charged up a ladder in the inside of the wind towers — scaling the first section in a matter of seconds.\n\nHull has been with AEP for years, but recently made the switch from a natural gas power plant to the wind farm. And in terms of the number of employees, he doesn’t see a big difference. He estimated his old gas plant had about 30-40 people employed, whereas his wind crew makes up about 50.\n\n“There are a lot of jobs with the wind farm that you don’t have at the typical power plant,” Hull said. “Industries change, things change, but there’s a lot of automation in the gas plants as well. It’s automatic control, people monitoring operations. It’s very similar.”\n\n‘Magnificent structures’\n\nThe morning sun illuminates a turbine near Weatherford. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nThe smallest wind turbines in Weatherford are the ones adorning Mayor Mike Brown’s business card holder on his desk.\n\nTurbines are something of a mascot for Weatherford, a small city that’s home to about 12,000 people but is an economic hub in the area. There’s a massive turbine blade outside city hall on which a local artist painted a colorful mural.\n\nBrown initially had another idea for it: Covering the blade in sandpaper and hoisting it upright on historic Route 66 — “the world’s largest nail file.”\n\n“I got shot down so quickly,” Brown laughed. “I really thought I’d come up with something.”\n\nWind power isn’t political in this part of the country. The two Oklahoma counties that Traverse spans — Blaine and Custer — voted overwhelmingly for Trump in the 2020 election. But the divisive debate over clean energy vs. fossil fuel doesn’t really factor into the conversation here.\n\nWeatherford Mayor Mike Brown. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nA turbine blade lies outside the Weatherford city hall. A local artist is in the process of painting a mural on it. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nTo hear Brown tell it, the wind boom took off after oil and gas started to decline in the area.\n\n“Really, when the oil fields kind of slowed down, the wind energy picked up,” Brown said. “It really was at a good time for us as far as not seeing a big drop-off.”\n\nBrown’s point speaks to something a lot of people in Western Oklahoma understand. Having lived through multiple boom-and-bust cycles for oil and gas, they’re keenly aware that fossil fuel is a finite resource. And though oil and natural gas are clearly still a big employer in the area, land owners and local officials see wind energy and jobs as complementing fossil fuels, not taking away from them.\n\n“We have a tradition in Oklahoma of being energy producers,” said Rep. Frank Lucas, who has long represented Western Oklahoma in Congress. “We’ve always been oil and gas. It’s only inevitable that as the other forms of energy have been developed, we would be a part of that.”\n\nLucas, the ranking member on the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, says he believes electricity will eventually be carbon-free — and that wind can be a big part of that. Biden has vowed to get the nation’s electricity to be zero-emissions by 2035; whether or not that goal can be met will ultimately depend on many more projects like Traverse coming online.\n\nA single oil pumpjack sits in a field in Weatherford. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nThe zone 2 substation at the Traverse wind farm. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\n“In the modern era, we are producers of a lot of wind power, but we can produce more,” Lucas said of his district. “The kind of power we’re talking about is a transition power. We’ll get to an emissions-free primary power source.”\n\nOf course, not everyone is happy with the windmills. On quiet days, the whooshing sound is more noticeable and the spinning blades can cast a flicker of sunlight on bright days. At night, the red lights on the windmills all blink at the same time to ward off airplanes.\n\n“It’s visual pollution,” landowner Melva Dickey admitted, but she still thinks the turbines are “magnificent structures.”\n\n“They’re pretty,” she said. “When the clouds are deep blue and the sun is shining on those turbines, it’s gorgeous.”\n\nThinking about the future\n\nCathy and Terry Baker stand on Cathy's family's farm that has been passed along through generations. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nCathy Baker has been thinking a lot lately about the older and younger generations of her family of farmers.\n\nCathy’s parents started farming in the area in 1947, a year before she was born. Her husband Terry has been working on the family farm since 1964. Farmers’ relationship with the land is tied deeply to family in Western Oklahoma, where land is typically passed down from generation to generation.\n\nThe Bakers leased their land to AEP, and now have one wind turbine on Cathy’s great-grandfather’s land, one on her grandfather’s land, and another one on her parents’ land.\n\n“Past generations mean a lot to me. I wonder how they’d feel about it,” Cathy Baker said. “I hope they’d like it. They all went with the flow. It’s just progress, it’s the way it is.”\n\nTerry Baker points to a photograph hanging on the wall of Cathy Baker's childhood home showing the family farm in the late 1900s. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nCows on the Baker family's land. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nHer thoughts are increasingly occupied by her children and grandchildren and making sure this land is passed to them with added value. Farming has always had ups and downs, but the Weatherford area — like the rest of the Central and Western US — is grappling with an extreme drought that has stunted crops and already stoked a dangerous wildfire year.\n\nParts of the Oklahoma panhandle have now gone 236 days without a quarter of an inch of rain in a single day; essentially, no substantial rain since last year, said Oklahoma’s state climatologist Gary McManus.\n\n“Right now, the farmers are praying” for rain, said farmer Scott Hampton. If they don’t get rain in the next few weeks, this year’s wheat crops could fail.\n\nScaling a barbed wire fence, Terry Baker showed off a field of emerald-green wheat. At this point in April, it should be knee high, but it only comes up to his ankle. Most farmers here have crop insurance in case of disaster, but the increasing cost of fertilizer and gas are eating even more into their bottom line.\n\nThe Bakers suffered losses in their cattle herd during the severe freeze in February 2021, and there’s always the threat of wildfires that get fed by the blustery winds. The Bakers see their wind turbines as another form of insurance.\n\n“It’s kind of like if y’all are going to get a bonus on your paycheck,” Terry said. “Money talks. We need what we can get.”\n\nTerry Baker holds stalks of stunted wheat. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nA wind turbine spins over a wheat field in Weatherford. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\nThe local schools are poised for a windfall, too. Energy projects in Oklahoma help the tax base to pay for public schools. The local school district could be looking at replacing about $150,000 in state aid with several millions of dollars in tax revenue from the Traverse wind project, superintendent of Thomas-Fay-Custer unified school district superintendent Rob Friesen told CNN.\n\n“Seeing those things up and turning, it gives us a little bit of hope for what the future might look like, because it will be a game changer for our budget, beyond belief,” said Friesen. “It will allow us to take care of our kids.”\n\nThe Bakers are particularly eager to take advantage of this new wind boom; they explored oil and gas leasing on their property years ago, but the wells the company drilled both turned up dry.\n\n“We didn’t get a thing from it but the damage from the site,” Terry recalled.\n\nIn contrast, Cathy believes the income generated from leasing their land for turbines will be more “stable,” and add to the value of their property for their children and grandchildren.\n\nThe view from Scott Hampton's home. Will Lanzoni/CNN\n\n“It’s a constant here in Oklahoma; we wouldn’t know what to do if it wasn’t windy,” she says with a laugh. “Who knows what the future holds, but I can see this going on for quite some time — the wind will be harnessed.”\n\nAnd just as Baker wonders what her ancestors would think about having three massive wind turbines turning high above their cattle fields, she hopes it will benefit the future generations to come.\n\n“I often wonder what my grandchildren are going to see,” she said. “We don’t always think we’re going to like change. But usually when it happens, it’s just fine.”", "authors": ["Ella Nilsen Photos Will Lanzoni Data Visuals John Keefe"], "publish_date": "2022/04/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/25/weather/christmas-arctic-winter-storm-power-outages-sunday/index.html", "title": "Prolonged winter storm causes at least 37 deaths and leaves ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe prolonged winter storm that brought heavy snow, high winds and brutal cold to most of the US this past week has killed at least 37 people and had hundreds of thousands without power on Christmas morning.\n\nPerhaps the worst impact was around Buffalo, New York, where 43 inches of snow fell as of Sunday morning, according to the National Weather Service. The snowfall and blizzard conditions made roads impassable, froze power substations and left more than a dozen people dead, Erie County officials said.\n\nThe conditions eased slightly on Sunday, allowing emergency responders to get out and see the extent of the problem.\n\n“I don’t want to say that this is going to be it because that would be a fallacy for me to say that, because we know that there are people who have been stuck in cars for more than two days,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Sunday. “There are people in homes who are below freezing temperatures.”\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul called it the “most devastating storm in Buffalo’s long storied history” due to its power and its extended length.\n\n“It’s a crisis of epic proportion,” Hochul told CNN’s Paula Reid on Sunday.\n\nOver the past week, this winter storm brought dangerously cold temperatures, blizzard conditions and coastal flooding to almost the entirety of the US, wrecking Christmas plans along the way.\n\nMore than 55 million people were under wind chill alerts Sunday morning, and freeze warnings are in effect across the South.\n\nThe blizzard conditions persisted Sunday across the Great Lakes, while frigid cold temperatures gripped the eastern two-thirds of the country.\n\nSome major cities in the Southeast, Midwest and East Coast recorded their coldest Christmas in decades. In Florida, it will be the coldest December 25 since 1983 for Miami, Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach.\n\nNew York City also saw record cold temperatures on Christmas Eve at several locations, including its JFK and LaGuardia airports. The high at Central Park was 15 degrees, marking it the second-coldest December 24 in at least 150 years, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to rebound later in the week with a much-welcomed warming trend with above-normal temperatures.\n\nAbout 250,000 homes and businesses in the US had no electricity service as of about 11 a.m. ET Sunday, with nearly half of those affected in Maine and New York, according to PowerOutage.us.

The operator warned rolling blackouts could happen if the strain becomes too much.\n\nIn New York, utility companies Con Edison and Natural Grid US also urged customers to conserve energy, citing extreme weather conditions and increased energy demand on interstate pipelines carrying natural gas into the city.\n\nMeanwhile, a shortage of electricity in Texas prompted the US Department of Energy to declare an emergency Friday, allowing the state’s energy provider to exceed environmental emissions standards until energy usage drops.\n\nIn Jackson, Mississippi, frigid temperatures are hampering efforts to repair a large water main break late Saturday, which has caused a loss in water pressure for residents, city officials said.\n\n“We are grateful to the crews who are braving these frigid temperatures on this Christmas Eve night, while working to restore pressure to residents. Their sacrifice does not go unnoticed and is appreciated not only by this administration, but also by every resident who is affected,” the release stated.\n\nThe brutal weather conditions have also snarled travel during the busy holiday weekend, with more than 5,000 flights canceled Friday, more than 3,400 flights canceled Saturday, and more than 2,800 canceled for Christmas Day.\n\nDangerous weather conditions claim lives\n\nSnow covers a vehicle on December 24, 2022, in Hamburg, New York.

Details about a third death, confirmed by a county spokesperson Saturday afternoon, weren’t immediately available.\n\n“The loss of two lives in Buffalo – storm related – because people were not able to get to medical attention, is again a crisis situation that unfolds before your eyes and you realize that lifesaving ambulances and emergency medical personnel cannot get to people during a blizzard situation,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Saturday.\n\nHochul said she will ask the federal government “for a declaration of emergency that’ll allow us to seek reimbursements for the extraordinary expenses of all the overtime and the fact that we brought in mutual aid from other parts of the state.”\n\nPowerful winter storm leaves first responders in need of rescue, official says 01:49 - Source: CNN\n\nOther storm-related deaths have been reported in the country. They include:\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs, Colorado, reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a power transformer of a building possibly looking for warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people have died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Kansas Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people have died in the state, officials have said, including one involving a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a caravan slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people have died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75, when a semi tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• Tennessee: The Tennessee Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Wisconsin: Wisconsin State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.\n\nWhat to expect as the storm slowly weakens and hazardous conditions continue\n\nStrong winds behind the arctic cold front that pushed through this week will lead to lake-effect snow and blizzard conditions at times across portions of the Great Lakes on Sunday.\n\nBlizzard warnings, winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories blanket much of the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes region and Ohio Valley.\n\nAn additional 8 to 16 inches of lake-effect snow is possible.\n\nThe storm system is forecast to gradually weaken as it lifts into southeastern Canada, moving slowly during the next couple of days and pulling arctic air from Canada down into much of the eastern side of the country.\n\nThe Arctic blast will slowly moderate into Monday.\n\nThe cold temperatures combined with dangerous wind chills will create a potentially life-threatening hazard for travelers who become stranded, people who work outside, livestock and pets, according to the National Weather Service.\n\n“In some areas, being outdoors could lead to frostbite in minutes,” the Weather Service warned.\n\nAs the frigid air continues to blast the warm waters of the Great Lakes, lake-effect snows and blizzard conditions are expected to continue, but slowly become less intense.\n\nStill, strong gusty winds initially up to 60 mph accompanying the snow downwind from the Great Lakes will continue to make for extremely dangerous conditions on the road.\n\nBy Christmas night into Monday, another low pressure system coming from the Pacific will deliver the next surge of moisture toward the Pacific Northwest and then into northern California, according to the Weather Service.", "authors": ["Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/12/25"}]}

Some posts were more tactful than others.\n\nThe NFL shared footage of A$AP Rocky enjoying Rihanna’s performance and some millennials drew parallels between Rihanna’s backup dancers’ outfits and the 2008 Disney film ‘Minutemen.’\n\nA representative for Rihanna confirmed that she is indeed expecting her next child, making her Super Bowl performance possibly the biggest pregnancy reveal ever.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nRihanna reasserts her pop music dominance at her halftime show\n\nWe’ve all been wondering who Rihanna might bring out to join her in the spotlight when she took the world’s biggest stage at State Farm Stadium for the Super Bowl 2023 halftime show and … surprise.\n\nShe got along just fine without a single cameo.\n\nRihanna made her entrance on a floating platform high above the field, rocking a stylish red jumpsuit and matching latex bustier singing “Bitch Better Have My Money,” seamlessly working her way through a dizzying celebration of her catalog that put the focus squarely on her most iconic hits, from “Umbrella” to “Work.”\n\nShe hasn’t toured since late 2016 and this halftime show more than lived up to the promise of a world-class performer reasserting her place in the pop music stratosphere.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nRihanna's Super Bowl 2023 playlist: Here's every song from her halftime show performance\n\nOne fan paid over $30K for her seat. Was it worth it?\n\nLiz Foster had the best seat in the house for Super Bowl 57, between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nAnd she’s a Cincinnati Bengals fan. She and her husband Bill bought the tickets before the AFC Championship, in which the Chiefs beat Cincinnati.\n\n“We were just hoping the Bengals would be here so we planned ahead,” Foster said. “We were putting out good vibes.”\n\nThey were also putting out good money — Foster wouldn’t come clean on exactly how much they spent, but she hinted at it — “30-ish,” she said.\n\nAs in $30,000?\n\n“Plus some.”\n\nPlus how much? Foster wasn’t saying. But even without her favorite team playing in the game, she said a backup plan:\n\n“I’m here for Rihanna.”\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nFan zone:The best seat at Super Bowl 2023 cost her $30,000 (plus some). And she's a Bengals fan\n\nFans at the Hance Park watch party aren't just blown away by Rihanna\n\nIt's getting a bit rough in downtown Phoenix for us mere mortals who didn't make it inside State Farm Stadium in Glendale.\n\nThe winds are whipping around Margaret T. Hance Park, where the official NFL watch party is underway at the Super Bowl Experience. According to the National Weather Service, the wind is blowing west at more than 20 mph, kicking up dead grass and the few leaves left on the trees.\n\nThat hasn't tamped down the excitement at the park, where it's been difficult — if at all possible — to navigate from one side to the other because the crowd in front of the stage is just that dense.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nAre you ready for Rihanna?\n\nThe Super Bowl has rarely had a more anticipated halftime show.\n\nRihanna, one of the most successful pop sensations of the century, is making her return to live performance for the first time since 2018, when she did the Grammys. It's been even longer since she’s toured.\n\nWe spoke to several members of the team that helped her put this show together and they promised us \"It's nothing like you've ever seen before.” Her music director added, “Trust me, this is my fourth Super Bowl halftime. And I must say, Rihanna has pushed the bar.\"\n\nThe singer herself is promising a “jam-packed ... celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together.\"\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nAdele at State Farm Stadium for the Super Bowl: 'I'm going just for Rihanna'\n\nAdele is cheering for Team Rihanna at Super Bowl 2023 in Glendale, just like she promised.\n\nThe British singer — who can always be counted on for a good reaction meme — was spotted in a box at State Farm Stadium on Sunday. Just over a week earlier, she told the crowd at one of her Las Vegas residency shows that she's \"going just for Rihanna.\"\n\nHopefully there will be some cameras pointed her way during the halftime show performance.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nChris Stapleton spared us the all-too-common national anthem showboating\n\nIs Chris Stapleton “only the best voice in the world,” as Babyface suggested at a press conference in downtown Phoenix Thursday morning?\n\nTo be fair, few singers could hope to live up to that level of hype. But Stapleton does have a wonderful voice, as anyone at all familiar with the Grammy-winning country singer’s catalog would surely testify.\n\nAnd he used it to brilliant effect at State Farm Stadium without making it feel like he was out there to impress us with a show of vocal pyrotechnics.\n\nIt was more about the song itself, which as Stapleton said, can go horribly wrong. But this one didn’t.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nReview:Chris Stapleton's deeply soulful Super Bowl national anthem, plus Sheryl Lee Ralph, Babyface\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph delivers a monumental ‘Lift Every Voice and Sing’\n\nSheryl Lee Ralph, the Emmy-winning star of “Abbott Elementary,” got the pregame entertainment off to a breathtaking start with her version of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the Black national anthem, looking powerful in a flowing, off-the-shoulder red gown and matching gloves.\n\nAt Thursday’s pregame press conference in Phoenix, Ralph said her goal was “to make sure we could have a version for people to understand the great lyrics of this song and what it means.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly how it went, a life-affirming testament to the deep meaning of the lyrics, well served by Ralph’s Broadway experience. If you didn’t understand those lyrics, you weren’t listening. — Ed Masley\n\nHere's what to expect in 2023:How long does the Super Bowl national anthem take?\n\nHow to watch Chris Stapleton sing the national anthem at Super Bowl 2023\n\nCountry superstar Chris Stapleton will sing the national anthem just before Super Bowl 2023 kicks off at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at State Farm Stadium.\n\nHe’ll be joined in the pregame ceremonies by Babyface, who will sing “America the Beautiful,” and Sheryl Lee Ralph, of “Abbot Elementary,” who will sing “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”\n\nEach song will be performed in American Sign Language as well, by Arizona native Troy Kotsur, who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for “Coda”; Colin Denny, a member of the Navajo Nation in Arizona; and Justina Miles.\n\nHere’s everything to know about today’s national anthem, including how long it might last.\n\n— Jill Cassidy\n\nSuper Bowl pregame: Sheryl Crow soaks up the sun, suggests new footwear for Patrick Mahomes\n\nSheryl Crow was midway through a hit-filled concert at the On Location tailgate party outside State Farm Stadium when she took a moment to reflect on her footwear — spectacular studded black open-toed clogs with heels that had to be at least 4 inches high.\n\n“All I’m saying,” she said, “is I think Patrick Mahomes should have to run in these shoes.”\n\nThat would definitely be a game changer.\n\nCrow and her band took the stage to a raucous recording of the Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up” — a bold move, to be sure, and a handy frame of reference for the brand of rock ‘n’ roll that has underscored her finest hours from the start.\n\nAfter setting the tone with “If It Makes You Happy,” Crow proceeded through such classics as “A Change Will Do You Good,” the decidedly Stonesy “My Favorite Mistake” (which always makes me think of “Goats Head Soup”), her stellar cover of Cat Stevens’ “The First Cut Is the Deepest,” “Soak Up the Sun,” her breakthrough single “All I Wanna Do” and “Every Day Is a Winding Road.”\n\n“Can you believe this weather?!” she asked. “It’s supposed to be snowing in Nashville today. I’m just really happy to be here, if nothing else to give myself a killer suntan.”\n\nShe also took a moment to note another cause to celebrate this weekend.\n\n“Yesterday was my birthday,” she said. “I’m 38 again.”\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nThe downtown Phoenix Super Bowl action has moved to Hance Park\n\nThe Super Bowl Experience at Phoenix Convention Center is officially over, and the NFL fans who have swarmed downtown Phoenix for the past week moved north to Margaret T. Hance Park for the free Super Bowl Experience fan event.\n\nThat’s where the NFL’s first ever official Super Bowl watch party is taking place on what officials claimed were the largest LED screens in Arizona. An hour and a half before kickoff, the bar scene near the Convention Center was subdued, with a smattering of patrons at venues such as Majerle’s Sports Grill and Barrel and Bushel.\n\nThe real fans — sorry, not sorry — were at Hance Park, biding their time by completing the QB obstacle course, playing corn hole and enjoying local food and drinks.\n\nThe lines for the bars, craft beer and portable toilets were manageable with an hour to go before kickoff. Visitors were eager to get their hands on some food; lines for the vendors on the north side of Hance Park far surpassed the shorter ones on the south side.\n\nBut the majority of fans were staked out in front of the screens, braving the full sun exposure (my weather app showed it was 76 degrees) as they sat on blankets and folding chairs.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nHance Park dining guide:What to eat and drink at the 2023 Super Bowl Experience\n\nWhat channel is the Super Bowl on? How to watch\n\nWondering how to watch Super Bowl 57 between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles?\n\nThe short answer is that the game airs on Fox this year. The game is scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m. Arizona time. Here’s how to watch or stream Super Bowl 2023.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nSeriously, what is up with Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly?\n\nOne moment we're speculating about whether Machine Gun Kelly actually got electrocuted while performing at the WM Phoenix Open's Birds Nest in Scottsdale on Friday.\n\nThe latest mystery now is whether he and Megan Fox are still engaged.\n\nThis Super Bowl Sunday — the morning after MGK headlined SI the Party with The Chainsmokers at Talking Stick Resort and two days after the couple attended the h.wood Homecoming event in Scottsdale — Fox sparked rumors that the couple, who have been engaged for over a year, are on the rocks.\n\nAccording to reports, she shared an Instagram post that included a clip of a burning letter with the Beyonce lyrics \"You can taste the dishonesty / it’s all over your breath\" in the caption. Then she reportedly removed all her photos with MGK and unfollowed everyone except Harry Styles, Timothée Chalamet and Eminem.\n\nShe has since appeared to have deactivated her Instagram.\n\nOnly time will tell what this development actually means.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\nRihanna, Dave Grohl, Paris Hilton:Celebrities spotted in Phoenix for Super Bowl 2023\n\nSibling rivalry at Super Bowl 57\n\nCornell and Darlene Brooks are siblings who may agree on some things, but football isn't one of them. Though the pair are attending Super Bowl 57 at State Farm Stadium together.\n\nCornell, from Chicago, wore a Kansas City Chiefs jersey. Darlene, from coastal Mississippi, wore a Philadelphia Eagles jersey.\n\n“She doesn’t know what she’s doing,” Cornell said of his sister. “She’s starting to get on my nerves.”\n\nFor her part, Darlene responded with an eye roll. Nothing like sibling rivalry.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nA peek inside the swag bags for premium seat ticketholders\n\nAs if great seats weren’t enough, fans sitting in the best seats in State Farm Stadium had a cooler full of snacks waiting for them.\n\nZachary Ginsberg of Scottsdale was one such fan. He was sitting with his father, who got the tickets.\n\n“I’m a plus-one,” Zachary said.\n\nInside the collapsible cooler was a Twix candy bar, almonds, Skittles, Doritos and … condiments.\n\nWhy condiments?\n\n“You can never have enough mustard and ketchup,” Zachary said. Fair enough.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nSuper Bowl announcers walk the field at State Farm Stadium\n\nThe NFL on Fox crew set up on the field just outside the Kansas City Chiefs endzone. Meanwhile, announcers Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen walked the field, chatting with players and surveying the scene.\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nDon't let Tom Brady make it his last:Greg Olsen is about to call his first Super Bowl\n\nSuper Bowl 57 is all about sponsorships\n\nEverything is sponsored at Super Bowl 57. Even the pop-up store in State Farm Stadium. It’s open for Arizona Cardinals games all season long, but Sunday its stock was limited to Frito Lay and Anheuser-Busch. So if you wanted Lay's potato chips or Bud Light, this is the place for you.\n\nOn the other hand, what else do you really need?\n\n— Bill Goodykoontz\n\nOh, it’s on: Puppy Bowl is happening now.

In the noon hour more than a mile from State Farm Stadium in Glendale, as traffic crept by at a pace no snail would envy, a woman was holding a bright green poster advertising parking on her street for $80. By 12:30 p.m., hundreds of people were trudging down the street in a line toward the stadium.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nPlan ahead: Super Bowl travelers should allow extra time when returning rental cars to Sky Harbor Airport\n\nAt least 180,000 passengers were expected at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on the Monday after the Super Bowl. That's about 60,000 more people than an average day.\n\nThousands of those people will be returning cars to the Rental Car Center. If you’re one of them, allow yourself ample time to drop off your car and ride the PHX Sky Train to your terminal. Airport staff recommends Super Bowl travelers allow at least four hours before departure to return car rentals.\n\nThe Rental Car Center is at 1805 E. Sky Harbor Circle South, south of Buckeye Road. It's accessible via exit 149 off Interstate 10. It’s roughly 2 miles from Terminal 3 and Terminal 4.\n\nHere are more tips on how to navigate Sky Harbor Airport after the Super Bowl.\n\n— Michael Salerno\n\nWhat to expect from Rihanna's halftime show, in her own words\n\nIn the event that you’re wondering what to expect from Rihanna when she hits the stage at State Farm Stadium, she shed some light on that in downtown Phoenix on Thursday, promising “a jam-packed show.” Her biggest challenge was \"trying to cram 17 years of work into 13 minutes,\" she said.\n\n\"That was the hardest, hardest part, deciding how to maximize 13 minutes, but also celebrate. That’s what this show is gonna be — a celebration of my catalog in the best way that we could have put it together.\"\n\nHere’s hoping she checked out our countdown of her greatest songs before she made the final edit to that setlist.

Especially being a Mexican American woman. I'm so grateful for what the universe has given me.\"\n\nLola's Tacos will offer carne asada street tacos, quesadillas and taquitos at concession stand 434, located on the fourth floor of State Farm Stadium.

MGK posted an Instagram story with a photo of his mile-high hairdo and the caption “Yooo. I got electrocuted and my hair stood up.”\n\nShocking, right?\n\nAs TMZ noted when sharing the story: “It's unclear if something really did happen or if it's just a stage prank.

W. Milam and Roy Bryant, the case fell from the news and the players in the saga all fell out of the spotlight. What happened to the key figures in the case in the years after they were momentarily thrust into the spotlight in the summer of 1955?\n\nUpdate:Carolyn Bryant Donham, woman at center Emmett Till lynching, dies\n\nMemorial:Statue honoring Emmett Till's mother, Mamie Till-Mobley to be unveiled in Illinois\n\nThe only one to emerge publicly at the national level was Mamie Bradley, but it did not happen for 30 years. Things began settling down for her a few months after the murder trial when her speaking engagements ended, yet she never returned to the job he held at the Air Force office in Chicago. Instead, she enrolled at Chicago Teachers College in the fall of 1956 and graduated cum laude three and a half years later. She earned her degree in January 1960 and began teaching, first at Carter Elementary and later at Scanlon School. She retired in 1983 after a total of 23 years with Chicago’s public schools.\n\nOn June 24, 1957, after dating three years, 35-year-old Mamie Bradley married Gene Mobley, a union that lasted 43 years, ending only with Gene’s death in 2000. Bradley, who became known as Mamie Till-Mobley, never bore another child but helped nurture Gene’s two daughters after their mother moved from Chicago.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Mobley’s mother, Alma Spearman, formed the Emmett Till Foundation, the goals of which were to build Christian character and a sense of citizenship in young people. It held its first annual banquet in Chicago in July 1966. The nonprofit organization eventually began a long tradition of awarding scholarships to deserving youth annually on July 25 — Emmett’s birthday.\n\nTill-Mobley created an additional way of keeping her son’s memory alive by establishing a performing group in 1973, the Emmett Till Players, made up of children who memorized and recited the speeches of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Over the years they performed at schools and churches, and a decade after its founding, Till-Mobley estimated that over 200 children had been part of the troupe. In 1984, the Emmett Till Players even performed in Mississippi.\n\nIn 1975 Till-Mobley earned a master’s degree in administration and supervision from Loyola University, with an additional 45 credits toward a doctorate.\n\nShe began speaking nationally about her son after 1985. Although widowed in 2000, Mamie’s life remained eventful for the next three years as she continued her activities with the Emmett Till Foundation. She also traveled and spoke, despite the heart and kidney problems she had long battled. In fact, it was on January 6, 2003, the eve of a planned departure for a speaking event in Atlanta, that she suffered a heart attack. She died that afternoon at Jackson Park Hospital. She was 81 years old. Her memoir, Death of Innocence: The Story of the Hate Crime that Changed America, was published posthumously later that year.\n\nMoses Wright, the star witness of the trial, moved to Argo Summit, Illinois, just days after the trial, too afraid to continue life in the Mississippi Delta. For most of the 22 years that followed, he lived quietly, outside of the public eye, although he traveled the West for the NAACP speaking during the month of November 1955. A year after the trial he reported that he was working odd jobs and had even gained 13 pounds since moving to the North. “I used to think I couldn’t live without seeing cotton stalks. Man, I ain’t seen cotton in a year, and I’m still living,” he told a reporter. The former preacher had already come to see the impact of the Till case for the fledgling Civil Rights Movement, and stated, almost prophetically, “What happened down there last year is going to help us all.”\n\nWright eventually found work as a custodian at a nightclub and later as a dishwasher at a local restaurant, working alongside a grandson. Adjusting to the big city after spending a lifetime in the rural Mississippi Delta was not easy. Wright, who left his car behind in Mississippi, never drove again after his move to Argo, but with the proximity of stores and schools, and the availability of public transportation, he didn’t need to. He gave up fishing after leaving the South, but the railroad let him use a little patch of land on which to grow a garden, which he kept up until he was 79. “That was his joy,” recalled his son, Simeon.\n\nIn 1970, Moses’s wife, Elizabeth, died, and over the next seven years, his health declined. He eventually had prostate surgery which affected the strength in his legs. Living alone, he did the best he could but in time his eyesight began to wane, and other health problems made it difficult for him to keep up his one-bedroom apartment. One time while home alone he lost his balance and fell. He remained on the floor for a day until his grandson, who had a key to the door, came to check on him. His family eventually placed him in the White Oak Nursing Home in Indian Head Park. He died on Aug. 3, 1977. The photo of Wright standing and pointing at two accused killers in Sumner remains a testament to bravery in a Mississippi courtroom.\n\nProsecution witness Willie Reed, whose testimony placed the murder in Sunflower County and was the source that other men besides J. W. Milam and Roy Bryant were involved in the murder, knew Emmett Till only in death but remained haunted for decades by the beating sounds he heard emanating from a plantation shed on an August morning. “That’s something you never put out of your mind. I remember it like it happened yesterday,” he said in 2007.\n\nAfter speaking at a few rallies following his late-night move to Chicago on the day the jury issued its verdict, Reed dropped out of sight. He had no contact with any of the other witnesses or Till family members for decades, despite living in Chicago and remaining in close proximity to many of them. He reemerged for interviews in 1999.\n\nIn Chicago, Reed obtained a new identity, or more accurately, reclaimed his old one. From the time he was 7 months old until he left Mississippi, he lived with his grandfather, Add Reed, and assumed Add’s surname. In Chicago, when Willie obtained a copy of his birth certificate in order to secure a Social Security number, he discovered that his last name was actually Louis, after his father, Joseph Louis. He went by his legal name of Willie Louis from then on, further obscuring his association with the Till case. In fact, most of his friends only learned of his role as a witness after seeing him on television in 2003. After the trial he was offered a $1,000 scholarship from the Elks Club should he have chosen to attend college, but he never took advantage of that. “I just didn’t want to do it,” he later said with regret.\n\nAround 1959, he began working as a surgical orderly at Chicago’s Jackson Park Hospital and remained there for 47 years before retiring in 2006. While working in the intensive care unit in 1971, he met Juliet Mendenhall, then a nurse’s aide. They married in 1976 and made their home in the Englewood area. Willie, who suffered from nightmares for several years into their marriage, did not even tell his wife about his role in the Till case until 1983. His 2001 interview for the documentary, The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till, reunited him with Mamie Till-Mobley, whom he had not seen in 46 years. After several years of declining health, Willie Louis died of gastronomical bleeding in July 2013 at age 76.\n\nLevi “Too Tight” Collins, one of the black field hands forced to participate in the kidnapping and murder, never got his life back on track after the case faded from the news. Following the trial, he worked odd jobs in Jackson and Memphis but disappeared again in 1957. Some said he feared revenge from local whites who worried that he might talk or by blacks angry because he hadn’t. “I’m plumb worried about the boy,” his 46-year-old father, Walter Collins, said at the time. “We used to be close. He’d come over to my place almost daily and we’d chat. Now I haven’t seen him but once in three years.”\n\nIn November 1957, Collin’s wife Treola and their four children arrived in Seattle at the invitation of Treola’s sister, who borrowed $246 from her minister and sent train tickets by way of the Memphis railroad station. “We had to slip off the plantation to catch the train, but we didn’t give our right names,” Treola explained. “We only had the clothing on our backs. I used an old bed spread for diapers on my 6-months-old baby. We had one loaf of bread and one can of peaches to eat.”\n\nLevi surfaced long enough for the couple to divorce, because Treola eventually remarried in 1960. Levi never resumed a relationship with his children, all of whom Treola’s second husband adopted. Treola managed to create a new life for herself in Seattle, where she bore five more children. Levi was not so lucky. Family members heard enough to know that the case completely destroyed him. He became an alcoholic and schizophrenic, hearing voices and hallucinating. He died in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1992.\n\nHenry Lee Loggins was another black man whose name has been tied to the case as an unwilling accomplice. After spending six months in jail in 1956 for theft of some iron belonging to J.W. Milam, he left Mississippi. At first, he moved to St. Louis, where he had lived a few years earlier, but then moved to Dayton, Ohio, in 1957. He did not surface publicly until July 2001 when historians David and Linda Beito found him and interviewed him over the telephone. For years he made a living in Dayton as a junkman. He later appeared in Untold Story and on a 60 Minutes segment about the case, where he denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, the Till murder. In 2005, Loggins became incapacitated after suffering a stroke but spent time in a nursing home and later at his daughter’s home recovering. He died in Dayton in October 2009. Since 1982, his stepson Johnny B. Thomas has been mayor of the village of Glendora, Mississippi, former home to both Loggins and J. W. Milam.\n\nDistrict Attorney Gerald Chatham, whose impassioned closing arguments in the case captivated everyone present, passed away only one year after his attempt to convict the two half-brothers. Because of notoriety in the Till case, the death of this otherwise unknown country lawyer was noted in the New York Times. Ill health had forced his retirement in January 1956. He suffered not only from high blood pressure but from nose bleeds so severe that he was often admitted to the hospital, where doctors had to pack his head in ice to stop them.\n\nChatham returned to private practice in Hernando, Mississippi, but on Oct. 9, 1956, he came home after speaking at an event, took a nap, and later that evening died of a massive heart attack.\n\nHamilton Caldwell, the elected attorney for Tallahatchie County who served on the prosecution team, lived for seven years after the trial. He was out of office and serving as vice president of the Bank of Charleston when he drowned in Enid Lake on Sept. 3, 1962. He had been fishing alone in his boat and for reasons unknown, fell overboard as he headed back to shore. He was 64.\n\nRobert Smith, the special prosecutor sent by the governor’s office to aid Chatham in the state’s case against Milam and Bryant, went back to his law practice in Ripley after the trial. He rarely talked about the case. “I’ve come to understand that not a lot of people in those days would have taken that case,” said son Fred in 2003. “I know now it took a lot of courage.” Bobby Elliot, a former law partner of Smith’s, remembered how surprised people were that Smith agreed to do it. “That wasn’t the popular thing to do back then.”\n\nOn Dec. 4, 1967, he was at work in Chancery Court and appeared fine. Yet privately, he was masking unbearable pain and went home later that morning and shot himself. Although he did not allude to his father’s suicide, Smith’s son, Bruce, explained in 2005 that his father had been battling alcoholism. “He had a sad life in a way, in his later years.” Smith’s obituary noted that he had helped with “important criminal cases” in his career, but it failed to mention the Till trial in particular.\n\nThe five defense attorneys who represented Milam and Bryant remained in Sumner. Sidney Carlton, former president of the Mississippi State Bar Association, died first in 1966 at age 50 after suffering a heart attack. Eighty-year-old Jesse J. Breland, the oldest member of the team, died one year later at Washington County General Hospital in Greenville after a long illness.\n\nJ.W. Kellum was one of three members of the defense team who lived for at least four decades after the trial and witnessed Mississippi’s transformation to an integrated society. In 1979, he sat for an interview, alongside civil rights activist Amzie Moore, for the PBS series, Eyes on the Prize. “As far as a fair trial is concerned,” Kellum said, there was no proof that his clients “were the criminal agent.” Had there been a conviction, he believed the Supreme Court would have overturned it. Kellum said this during a new era, however, and he noted with pride that blacks then served on juries, and that more were practicing law. “I would say that Mississippi now is part of the New South.”\n\nKellum, a self-taught lawyer who never attended college, passed the state bar exam in 1939 and practiced law until his death in July 1996. The year before he died, Kellum insisted that for him, the Till affair was “just another case over the desk.” He said that he asked Milam and Bryant early on if they were guilty of the murder, and both denied that they were. “I believed them,” he insisted, “just like I would if I was interrogating a client now. I would have no reason to think he’s lying to me.” Forty years after representing them, he claimed he still believed in their innocence. “I would have to see something ... But they told me they did not [commit the murder]. They told the other lawyers that they did not.”\n\nAfter his wife Ruth died in 1992, Kellum remarried. He died four years later.\n\nJohn Whitten also practiced law until the end of his life. Betty Pearson, a Sumner resident angered by the acquittal, refused to speak to Whitten for over six months after the trial. Yet in 2006, she remembered him as “a wonderful man,” one whom she remained close to for the rest of his life.\n\nAt Breland’s request, Whitten maintained the firm’s name as Breland and Whitten after his partner’s death. The firm continues to this day, still housed in the same office where Milam and Bryant talked to reporter William Bradford Huie.\n\nToward the end of his life, Whitten worked in his law office occasionally, but by then his son John Whitten III did the bulk of the firm’s legal work. He had been suffering from Parkinson’s disease since the late 1980s and died in February 2003.\n\nThe last surviving member of the defense team was Harvey Henderson, who continued to practice law, albeit part time, up until his death in October 2007. He was active in his local community, was a lifelong member of the Sumner Rotary Club and had also served as its president. The West Tallahatchie School District retained him as its attorney for over 50 years, and he also served as the legal counsel for Mississippi’s first chapter of Habitat for Humanity, which was formed in Tallahatchie County. He refused all requests for interviews about the Till case.\n\nJudge Curtis Swango, who impressed spectators with his fairness during the trial, remained on the bench of Mississippi’s 17th judicial district for the next 13 years. In 1968, a respiratory condition sent him to the hospital, followed by several months of treatment for tuberculosis at the Mississippi State Sanatorium in Simpson County. He died there in December 1968. Divorced and without children, at his death, he was survived only by his mother and a brother. “He was widely praised for his conduct of the Emmett Till murder case in Tallahatchie County,” noted his obituary, “and was recognized as one of the foremost trial judges in the state.”\n\nThe two sheriffs in the case remained active in the years after the kidnapping and murder, although each was completing his term at the time. Former Leflore County Sheriff George Smith, who arrested Milam and Bryant on kidnapping charges, wanted to forget all about his role by the time a reporter asked him about it two years later. “I hate to even mention the case, it was the only thing to mar my four years in office,” he said. “Don’t quote me on anything. I don’t want my name ever printed again in connection with the people involved in this case.”\n\nSmith later served a second term as sheriff from 1964 until 1968. This time, he succeeded his former deputy, John Ed Cothran, who had helped with the kidnapping investigation and served as a witness for the prosecution.\n\nSmith, an avid outdoorsman, was a member of the Parker-Gary Hunting Club and was planning a busy season when he died unexpectedly in 1975 at the age of 72.\n\nFormer Tallahatchie sheriff Henry Clarence Strider, who aided the defense at the trial and claimed the body retrieved from the river was not that of Emmett Till, planned to run for the office again in 1959 after sitting out the required minimum of one term, but he changed his mind at the urging of his wife after he barely escaped an assassination attempt in 1957. While he sat in his car outside of a store in the town of Cowart, someone fired a shot at his head, missing him, but striking the metal piece between the window and windshield. Strider claimed that the shooter had been sent down from Chicago by the NAACP for the express purpose of killing him, and that the would-be assassin was known to black workers living on Strider’s plantation. Strider also maintained that the governor of Illinois refused to extradite the mysterious gunman back to Mississippi for trial, thus the entire matter was dropped. Still fearing for his life in 1963, Strider declined to run for his former job yet again.\n\nBy 1962, Strider was chairman of the State Game and Fish Commission. In February of that year, state officials tried to keep black student James Meredith from registering at Old Miss, and the defiance of the governor, Ross Barnett, made national news. Strider, ever the segregationist, announced during the conflict that 250 supervisors and game wardens were ready to aid Ole Miss in preserving its white-only student body should they be needed.\n\nIn February 1965, Strider won a special election to the state Senate, where he represented Grenada, Yalobusha and Tallahatchie counties for the next five years. In addition to his role with the Game and Fish Commission, he was a member of the Public Property, Transportation, and Water and Irrigation committees, and chairman of the Penitentiaries Committee.\n\nIn July 1968, Strider admitted on the floor of the state Senate that he had paid for votes during his 1951 campaign for Tallahatchie County sheriff. He disclosed this as the Senate debated a bill that provided for absentee voting for teachers and students. “In those days you didn’t win elections, you bought them,” he told his colleagues. He said that he paid out a total of $30,000 for blank absentee ballots reserved for people who had indicated they would not be present on Election Day.\n\nAlthough he is remembered for regularly insulting the black press in the hot, crowded courtroom in Sumner, his election to the Senate after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 forced him to deal with a black constituency who finally had the power of the ballot. Yet Strider would have been happy to rid the Delta of its black citizens. In February 1966, he co-sponsored a bill to relocate Mississippi blacks to other states, as a new farm bill was making it harder for laborers to earn a living. A proposed relocation commission would seek federal funds for the removal of those who wanted to go. “If they (Negro farm workers) feel like they are put upon or have to live in tents and opportunities are brighter somewhere else, we’ll be glad to get them there,” said Strider’s co-sponsor, Sen. Robert Crook of Ruleville. Nothing ever came of the proposal, however.\n\nLike Sheriff Smith, Strider was a hunter. On Dec. 27, 1970, Strider died of a heart attack while on a deer hunt in Issaquena County; his body was shortly discovered by others. Gov. John Bell Williams flew to Clarksdale to attend the funeral. In 1981, a portion of Mississippi 32 was designated as the Henry Clarence Strider Memorial Highway.\n\nA year after the murder trial, co-defendant J.W. Milam was living on a farm between Ruleville and Cleveland. Several months after that, William Bradford Huie interviewed the brothers for a follow-up article to his “confession” piece from a year before. It, too, appeared in Look magazine. In the accompanying photographs, both men appear happy, but it was obvious that the smiles were only a façade. Huie described them as having “been disappointed,” explaining further that, “They have suffered disillusionment, ingratitude, resentment, misfortune,” but as yet, no guilt. Few had pity on them, even those who had earlier been supportive. Milam owned no land and could not get his former backers to rent to him. He was finally able to rent 217 acres in Sunflower County with the help of his brother-in-law and secured a $4,000 furnish (the funds to plant a cotton crop) from a Tallahatchie County bank where one of his defense attorneys, John Whitten, sat on the loan committee. Blacks would no longer work for Milam, and he was forced to pay higher wages to whites for the same work.\n\nFor three years after the trial, Milam held several menial plantation jobs. In 1958 he was living in a tenant house on a plantation owned by a Citizen’s Council member. On Valentine’s Day, the New York Post reported that Milam had been seen standing in a bread line waiting to receive rations from the Welfare Department. The black Pittsburgh Courier picked up on the story, also. The director of the Washington County welfare department would not confirm or deny the Post report, but Milam adamantly declared it false. Despite admitting to hard times a year earlier when talking to Huie, Milam bluntly told an inquiring reporter for Jet magazine, “Quote me as saying the New York Post is a g----d liar. I’m standing here with’a ass-pocket full of money.”\n\nThe Milams later moved to Orange, Texas, but returned to Greenville after only a few years. They would make their home at 615 Purcell St., where J.W. would live out the rest of his life. The house was a converted into African American Methodist Church in Greenville’s black section.\n\nMilam would have a few run-ins with the law while living in Greenville. In 1969 he was convicted in City Court for writing a bad check and fined $55. Three years later the same court fined him $300 and sentenced him to 60 days in jail for using a stolen credit card. Four months after that, he was convicted of assault and battery, fined $30, and sentenced to 10 days in jail.\n\nBy the time the Milams returned to Mississippi a decade after the Till trial, the outrage over the murder had subsided, and they were able to live quietly, for the most part. Milam eventually found work as a heavy equipment operator but that ended due to declining health. After a very long and painful illness, he succumbed to cancer on New Year’s Eve, 1980 at age 61. He and his wife Juanita were rumored to have divorced at some point, but this was not true.\n\nBecause J.W. never held a permanent job, Juanita began working as a hairdresser at the Greenville Beauty Salon in the 1960s, where she remained until owner Thelma Wood retired and closed the shop around 1990.\n\nAlthough she enjoyed a long and steady career, Juanita’s life was never the same after the murder of Emmett Till, and she appeared genuinely sad most of the time. Her depression had not been a part of her life prior to the notorious lynching that thrust her family into the spotlight. Despite her personal suffering, she was generous with her family and friends and managed to maintain many of her life-long interests. She was an avid reader and football fan. An active Methodist, she bought a keyboard and learned to play a few hymns to help her congregation enjoy the benefit of music.\n\nJuanita never remarried after J.W.’s death, nor did she allow herself any further romance. She later sold her home on Purcell Street and eventually moved to Ocean Springs, Mississippi. After J.W.’s death, Juanita became estranged from Roy and Carolyn Bryant, and they never spoke again. Juanita and Carolyn saw each other, but did not speak, at the funeral of Milam and Bryant sibling Dan Milam, who died in 1999. Juanita stormed out of the service after Milam and Bryant family members became involved in a confrontation over blame in Emmett Till’s death.\n\nJuanita, who was politically liberal, maintained interracial friendships, and her best friend for many years was a black neighbor woman. Juanita suffered a stroke in 2008, and in October of that year, her oldest son, Horace “Bill” Milam, died at age 57. After several years of declining health, Juanita died in Ocean Springs on Jan. 14, 2014, at age 86.\n\nRoy Bryant’s life, like that of his brother J.W.’s, was filled with hardship. After a black boycott forced the closure of his store three weeks after his release from jail, the family moved to Indianola, in Sunflower County. There, Roy reportedly found work as a mechanic. After laboring at odd jobs for 75 cents a day, he attended welding school nine miles away in Inverness, at the Bell Machine Shop. In 1985 Bryant reported to the Clarion Ledger that his welding made him legally blind. He suffered from optic nerve degeneration in both eyes, and his left eye was further damaged after a small piece of steel became lodged in it.\n\nBryant had other ambitions before settling on welding school. In May 1956, the Delta Democrat-Times, responding to rumors that Bryant had become an Indianola policeman, learned that he had sought a job with the local force, but was turned away. “He applied with us,” confirmed Indianola police chief, Will Love, “but he does not work here.”\n\nSix months later on Nov. 19, Roy and Carolyn Bryant were riding as passengers in a car driven by Carolyn’s 18-year-old brother, James Holloway, in Greenville, when they were involved in a head-on collision at about 1:45 a.m. The second vehicle was driven by a black airman who was stationed at the Greenville Air Force Base. All three were treated for minor injuries at Greenville’s General Hospital and released. The four-paragraph article in the Delta Democrat–Times reporting the accident mentioned nothing of the Bryants’ notoriety in the Till case, although the Chicago Defender shortly learned of the story and reported that fact. That same day, perhaps for reasons brought on by the accident, Carolyn gave birth to her third son, Frankie Lee.\n\nBy the fall of 1957, Roy was working as a welder in Morgan City, Louisiana. The Bryants shortly moved to Orange, Texas, where a daughter was born two years later. Because Carolyn had been sick with the measles during her pregnancy, her daughter was born deaf. Sometime later, the family relocated to Vinton, Louisiana, just thirteen miles away, where Roy continued to weld for a steel company. They bought a home there and lived in Vinton until returning to Mississippi in 1973.\n\nWhen Roy, Carolyn, and the two youngest children left Louisiana in 1973 and returned to Mississippi, they relocated to Ruleville, in Sunflower County. Roy went back into the grocery business by taking over a small store that had been run by family members.\n\nAt some point, Roy and Carolyn Bryant’s marriage developed serious problems, and it became unbearable for Carolyn. Even her mother-in-law, Eula Bryant, saw it. Eula, whom Carolyn described as tough and outspoken, asked Carolyn in front of Roy many times why she stayed married to him. Eula died in August 1974. A year later on Aug. 15, Carolyn left Roy and two months after that, filed for divorce. Their divorce papers describe Roy as having been guilty of “habitual cruel and inhuman treatment of her and of habitual drunkenness.” Perhaps Roy’s demons had concerned his mother because she had once endured similar abuses from her second husband, Henry Bryant. Carolyn asked for sole custody of their daughter, the complaint read, because “said child needs the care and guidance which only a devoted mother can give.” Roy failed to dispute any of the allegations. When the divorce was finalized two months later on Oct. 28, 1975, sole custody went to Carolyn. Roy was granted visitation and ordered to pay $75 per month in child support beginning Nov. 1. A lump sum of $6,300 for alimony was due by Dec. 1.\n\nAfter their return to Mississippi, the Bryants managed to continue a low-profile existence, despite living in close proximity to the land of the Till murder. In fact, in 1977, both Roy and his brother, James Bryant, were listed as two of five challengers to Ruleville’s incumbent aldermen. In the end, the brothers lost, each receiving the least number of votes of all the candidates. James garnered 53 while Roy received only 45. The winners received between 270 and 530 votes. Roy married Vera Jo Orman, an accountant at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, in May 1980. They remained in Ruleville.\n\nIn 1978, Roy Bryant lost his permit to handle food stamps for one year because he was allowing customers to purchase non-food items with their coupons. In 1982, the Inspector General’s office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture learned that Bryant had been purchasing food stamps at a discount for cash and then selling them back to the government at full value. In October 1983, Bryant was indicted on five counts of food stamp fraud, pleaded not guilty and was scheduled for a December trial. On Dec. 7, however, Bryant changed his plea to guilty on two counts in exchange for the government dropping the rest. Bryant returned to court for sentencing two months later, and through the pleadings of his attorney, he was given only three years probation and ordered to pay a $750 fine. Bryant had retained state senator Robert L. Crook of Ruleville as his counsel. Crook told the court that 53-year-old Bryant “is a good citizen of Ruleville, who is disabled and has been in very poor health a number of years, who has attempted to work despite that circumstance, and to be gainfully employed in the course of running his own store.” He was caring for both his wife and disabled sister and was an honorably discharged veteran of the Army. As to the charges against him, however, “He knows he has made a mistake.”\n\nBryant promised to obey the law respecting food stamp regulations going forward but found himself unable to resist the temptation to repeat the same violations only a few years later. In February 1987, he was again caught purchasing food stamps at a cash discount, and this time, his sister, Mary Louise Campbell, who worked as a cashier at the store, was indicted along with him the following September as a co-conspirator on six counts of food stamp fraud. Bail was set for Bryant at $10,000, and for Campbell at $5,000. Campbell pleaded guilty to count four on Nov. 23, and Bryant pleaded guilty on counts five and six. Campbell did not receive any prison time, but Bryant, having been convicted four years earlier for the same crime, received a two-year prison sentence and was ordered to turn himself in to the attorney general on April 4, 1988. Before leaving office in 2001, President Bill Clinton pardoned Campbell. Bryant served eight months of his term.\n\nBryant attended the first town meeting of the administration of Shirley Edwards, the town’s first black mayor, and complained of burglaries at his fireworks store and poor performance by police in stopping it. Reminiscent of his actions in his most famous dirty deed, Bryant had no trouble taking the law into his own hands and threatened to do so. “If I catch one out there this big [raising his hands two and a half feet off the floor], I’m going to twist his damn head off.” Edwards did not hesitate in telling a reporter that “Bryant is a vicious man … If my people did not deal or trade with him, he couldn’t stay here.”\n\nBryant began battling cancer and diabetes. Beginning around September 1993, he underwent radiation treatments for the next year and lost 35 pounds. Two months before his death, he spoke for two hours to a reporter for the Palm Beach Post but refused to say much about the Till case. He again denied that he had anything to do with the murder and matter-of-factly said, “I have no idea” who killed the Chicago youth when the reporter asked. Bryant believed that his acquittal in the Till case meant that people should leave that past alone. The case that brought him worldwide notoriety in 1955 was to him, “just something in the past. You have to leave it alone, live your life. You can’t just sit around and cry over spilt milk.” His frustration was caused in part by the occasional threats he received by crank callers. “They say: ‘We don’t like what you did a few years ago. We’re comin’ over to get you.’ I say, ‘Well, bring your g----d ass on over—what’s taking you so long?”\n\nBryant died of cancer on Sept. 1, 1994, at the Baptist Hospital in Jackson. When Vera Jo Bryant died in May 2012, her obituary mentioned nothing about her marriage to Roy, and only listed her parents and a brother as family members who had preceded her in death. She was, however, buried next to her infamous husband whom she was married to for 14 years.\n\nWithin a few months of the murder, another brother, Leslie Milam, who ran the plantation on which Emmett Till was murdered, was “requested” to leave because many of the black laborers working there were leaving the farm out of fear. He shortly found a new job on a plantation in the nearby town of Cleveland. Fifteen years later in February 1971, he was arrested, and four months after that, convicted of illegally possessing over 500 methamphetamine pills, popularly known as speed. He was sentenced to one year at Parchman state prison. His defense attorney was J.W. Kellum.\n\nAlthough never charged or tried, the biggest burden he carried throughout his life was his involvement in the Emmett Till murder. On Thursday, Aug.t 29, 1974, local minister Macklyn Hubble received a call from Leslie’s wife, Frances. Hubble, who had been pastor of the First Baptist Church in Cleveland, Mississippi, since 1962, knew the family, and Frances asked him to come to the Milam home at Leslie’s request. When he arrived he was ushered into a room where he saw Leslie laying on a couch, near death. Frances left the room and Hubble pulled up a chair. Leslie, so weak that he could barely whisper, was nevertheless anxious to talk and immediately told Hubble that he wanted to get something off his chest. He proceeded to confess that he had been involved in the murder of Emmett Till, which had occurred 19 years and one day earlier. Leslie provided no details of the crime, but Hubble could see that he was remorseful. Leslie Milam died the following morning. Hubble officiated at the funeral a few days later.\n\nCarolyn Bryant is perhaps frozen in memory as the 21-year-old local beauty working behind a counter in a country store where Emmett Till fatefully crossed her path in 1955. She turned 84 years old in July 2018 and has, for decades, been a devoted mother and grandmother and enjoys a close relationship with her family. Carolyn, for her part, has wanted only to live quietly, out of the spotlight.\n\nShe learned American Sign Language and became very proficient at it so that she could communicate with her daughter. On one occasion, her skills allowed her to come to the rescue of a deaf woman who had been in a car accident, comforting her until paramedics arrived. She also was quite talented at making jewelry, which she sold at arts and craft shows until the early 2000s.\n\nLike Mamie Till-Mobley, Carolyn experienced the pain of losing a child, or in her case, two. In September 1995, her firstborn, Roy Bryant Jr., passed away of cystic fibrosis. In April 2010, Frank, her youngest son, died of heart failure. Her faith in God sustained her through these two losses, and she believes her sons are now together. She says she places God first and her children second in her life.\n\nTwo months after Frank’s death, Carolyn put her home in Greenville up for sale and moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, to live with her surviving son. She brought along her dog, a 16-year-old Shih Tzu, but by July 2012, the dog had died, but her son surprised Carolyn with another of the same breed.\n\nLasting romantic love eluded Carolyn, however. After her divorce from Roy Bryant in 1975, she remarried at least twice. In 1984 she wed Greenville resident Griffin Chandler, an employee at U.S. Gypsum. The marriage ended three and a half years later with Chandler’s death. The widowed Carolyn soon married again, this time to former Leland police officer David Donham. In 1988, Carolyn began attending Mississippi Delta Junior College in Moorhead and took classes as a part-time student until 1990. The Donhams eventually divorced. With the help of her brother, Thomas Holloway, Carolyn moved to Brookhaven into a small home after her divorce, where she lived until Thomas died in 2000. After that, she returned to Greenville to be near Frank.\n\nIn June 2010, Carolyn joined Facebook, establishing a profile with a username that kept her actual identity hidden. Five months later, she both posed and answered the question as to what constitutes the real qualities in a man. Her answer was that they must be ethical and stand up for a good cause. If this seemed to hint of her first husband’s attempt to preserve the sanctity of her white womanhood, which propelled both her and him into the public eye, she was quick to add that a real man will respect others and refrain from bullying.\n\nWith the encouragement of her daughter-in-law, Marsha Bryant, Carolyn agreed to write her memoir. However, Frank Bryant’s death took a toll on her and the project stalled. When the FBI investigated the case from 2004–5, Carolyn became a focus. In February 2007, Joyce Chiles, district attorney for Sunflower County where the murder occurred, called a grand jury to hear evidence against Carolyn for possible manslaughter charges. In the end, the racially mixed jury refused to indict, citing a lack of evidence. “I feel like the district attorney used us as scapegoats,” said black jury member Otis Johnson. “To me, it seems like they just wanted to put on a show and go through the process to make people happy.”\n\nA year later, Marsha Bryant arranged for Carolyn to meet with historian Tim Tyson, and, for the only time besides speaking to the FBI a few years earlier, Carolyn granted two recorded interviews. It was during these sessions that she allegedly recanted her courtroom testimony that Emmett Till grabbed her by the waist and propositioned her. “Honestly, I just don’t remember. It was fifty years ago,” Tyson says she told him before he set up his recorder. “You tell these stories for so long that they seem true, but that part is not true.” Marsha Bryant, however, says she was present for the interviews and that Carolyn never said these words or otherwise recanted. Carolyn suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, is losing her eyesight, and mostly relies on a wheelchair. She has said privately that the Emmett Till case has kept her a prisoner.\n\nDevery S.

Kay Ivey’s office announced Tuesday. Ivey appointed Stewart to replace longtime school board member Ella Bell, who died in November. Stewart served as the dean and a professor in the College of Visual and Performing Arts at Alabama State University. Prior to her tenure as dean, she served as chair and a professor in ASU’s Department of Theatre Arts. She has a bachelor’s degree from Jackson State University, a master’s degree from the University of California in Santa Barbara and a doctorate from Florida State University, according to the governor’s office. Her other film and television credits include “Mississippi Burning,” the television movie “The Rosa Parks Story” and the series “American Horror Story.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A volcano in the Aleutian Islands spewed ash into flight paths, prompting a warning to pilots by the National Weather Service. Shishaldin Volcano erupted at 5 a.m. Tuesday, the Alaska Volcano Observatory announced, and sent up an initial ash cloud to 19,000 feet. Clouds initially obscured the mountain, but satellite imagery confirmed the ash cloud, U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Hans Schwaiger said. Seismicity diminished for a few hours, but it then increased again. During the increase, the volcano spewed an ash cloud to 25,000 feet, the observatory announced. The later eruption increased the volume of ash. Wind continued to push the ash cloud northeast into the eastern Bering Sea and away from jet airliners flying between North America and Asia.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A legislator says he will propose changing state law to require that state officials only buy coach or economy tickets when flying on the taxpayer’s dime. Rep. Walt Blackman, R-Snowflake, says he is working on a bill to tighten state travel rules after an audit found Northern Arizona University inappropriately paid for travel expenses incurred by the school’s president, Rita Cheng, and her spouse, including about $30,000 for first-class and business-class tickets to Russia. “If a commanding officer can travel coach,” said Blackman, a U.S. Army veteran, “the president of a university can do the same thing.” Arizona law already requires the state’s public universities to set policies for travel by employees and officials. Northern Arizona University’s guidelines say officials should use “the most beneficial, cost effective and practical mode of travel.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state panel formed after historic flooding last year released a report Tuesday recommending increased oversight of the state’s levees, consolidation of some levee districts and state grants to fund improvements. Gov. Asa Hutchinson created the Arkansas Levee Task Force after flooding along the Arkansas River that affected several of the state’s 92 levees, including one that was breached. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened a large dam to control the river flow after intense rain in Kansas and Oklahoma strained aging dams and levees. The panel called for districts to file standardized levee reports that county officials must sign off on to show they are aware of levee structural issues. Under that recommendation, the state Department of Emergency Management will review the reports and compile an annual summary of threat vulnerabilities.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Members of an elite police crime suppression team are under investigation over allegations that they falsified records and listed some innocent people as gang members, the Los Angeles Police Department said Monday. Ten officers have been assigned to home, while others were taken off patrol, Police Chief Michel Moore told KNX-AM news radio. “What would motivate them?” Moore said. “That is something that we’re looking at very intensely.” The months­long investigation began in early 2019 when a mother in the San Fernando Valley was notified her son had been identified as a gang member, according to an LAPD statement. References to her son as a gang member were removed from the documents, and three officers fell under investigation. The department said Internal Affairs investigators found more inaccuracies on field interview cards that police fill out after stopping and questioning people.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: The city’s Chamber of Commerce and Visit Loveland have unveiled details and plans for the 74th year of the valentine program in the nation’s Sweetheart City. Loveland’s Valentine Re-Mailing Program 2020 kicks off the 74th annual valentine re-mailing program, the largest of its kind. Volunteers hand-stamp the postmark and collector’s envelope artwork on each of approximately 120,000 valentines mailed through Loveland from all 50 states and 110 countries across the world. The 2020 envelope stamp was designed by Corry McDowell. It includes a verse written by Teresa Boynton: “Dan Cupid continues to play his part. Though he doesn’t text or tweet, he knows a Loveland Valentine is a sweeter treat.” To get the special postmark and message, send pre-addressed, pre-stamped valentines in an enclosed, larger first-class envelope to Postmaster – Attention Valentines, 446 E. 29th St., Loveland, CO 80538-9998.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: Louis Voros helped create something that has now saved his life, the Connecticut Post reports. Voros, 77, of Fairfield, is a retired mechanical engineer. During his career, he said, he worked on a lot of medical products, including da Vinci Surgical Systems – robotic technology that allows doctors to perform complicated surgeries through a tiny incision. That’s the same device that Dr. Imran Siddiqui, an oncology surgeon at St. Vincent’s Medical Center in Bridgeport, used to perform surgery on Voros after he was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Though the da Vinci robot has been used for years in a variety of surgeries, Siddiqui is one of the few in the country – and, he said, the only one in Connecticut – who uses the technology to perform complex gastrointestinal surgery. “I worked on a tool that was used on me,” Voros marveled. “And I was lucky because it was able to save me from the cancer.”\n\nDelaware\n\nRehoboth Beach: The days of throwing Thrasher’s fries at voracious seagulls may soon be over for local beachgoers, as the city is pushing to ban people from feeding the birds. If you’re caught chucking food at the squawking sky beasts, you could be fined anywhere from $5 to $50. Repeat offenders could be slapped with up to a $200 fine. The city already has signs warning folks not to feed seagulls, but several people have ignored them through the years, making a mess on the beach by throwing food up for the birds to catch, Mayor Paul Kuhns says. “You’re sitting there with your family, maybe having a sandwich, and the birds start to prey on you,” Kuhns says. The new ordinance, which hasn’t yet been voted on, cites harm to the gulls and aggressive behavior as reasons for the ban. It includes several rules on animal care and prohibitions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Officials say D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans has announced his resignation as of Jan. 17, WUSA-TV reports. In December, the D.C. Council unanimously voted to recommend Evans be expelled for ethical violations. The vote was the first step for expulsion. The Washington Post reported in December that the council would reconvene to cast a formal vote to remove Evans, who has served on the council for 27 years and currently represents Ward 2. The private law firm of O’Melveny & Myers previously released a 97-page report outlining an alleged 11 ethical violations concerning the longest-serving council member. The report alleges ethical violations dating back to 2014.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: The Sunshine State’s economy will grow in 2020, but it will experience growing pains from a lack of housing and a weak transportation network, according to an economic forecast from the University of Central Florida. The forecast released late last month from the school’s Institute for Economic Forecasting says Florida’s equivalent of gross domestic product – the value of all goods and services – will grow by 2.8% in 2020 and 2021, but it will slow down to 2.4% in 2022. Labor force growth in Florida will average 1.6% annually over the next three years, according to the forecast. It also predicts that Florida’s unemployment rate will drop to 3% this year, with the strongest job growth coming from professional and business services, construction, and leisure and hospitality. New home construction will increase but not quickly enough to make up for the shortage of single-family homes available, according to the forecast.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A bipartisan panel examining the state’s high maternal death rate is recommending that lawmakers extend the amount of time low-income mothers are eligible for Medicaid coverage. It’s one of 19 recommendations contained in a report released this week by the state House study committee on maternal mortality. But the recommendations, some of which would cost millions, could face an uphill battle winning full approval from lawmakers as the state faces budget cuts. The committee was created last year to analyze Georgia’s maternal death rate, which is among the highest of any state in the U.S. The report says the maternal death rate in Georgia is higher among African American women and in rural populations. Women in Georgia who are eligible for Medicaid benefits during pregnancy generally lose those benefits two months after giving birth.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The number of bankruptcies in the state rose for the second straight year in 2019, records show. There were 1,666 bankruptcy cases for the year, up 11.8% from 1,490 in 2018, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The data released last week by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Hawaii shows the 2019 mark was the highest since the state’s 1,702 bankruptcy filings in 2014. The number of 2019 bankruptcies was less than half of the post-recession peak of 3,954 in 2010. The state’s high cost of living is taking a toll on residents, with only a limited number of people benefiting from the rising stock market, said Ed Magauran, a Honolulu bankruptcy attorney. “I don’t think there has been any change in the number of people who have not paid their debt,” Magauran said. “As usual, the bottom 95% continue to suffer.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The co-chairmen of the Legislature’s powerful budget-setting committee said Tuesday that they are backing Gov. Brad Little’s call for “transparent budgeting.” Republican Sen. Steve Bair and Republican Rep. Rick Youngblood said the change is long overdue and will provide a more accurate picture of the state’s budget. The Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee they co-chair for the next six weeks will be going over state agency budgets that are being trimmed 1% this year and 2% next year. The change means lump-sum transfers of money will have to be broken down into clearly defined line-item entries and show up as expenditures. Previously, those transfers didn’t “show up as true expenditures,” Bair said, noting the last budget that had 7.1% growth. “We actually probably spent significantly more than 7.1% if those transfers would have been in the expense portion of the budget.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A report highlighting persistent problems within the state’s child welfare agency showed 123 children died in the past fiscal year despite having contact with the Department of Children and Family Services. It was the highest number since the fiscal year ending in 2005, when the number was 139 deaths, according to annual reports released each January by the department’s inspector general. The lowest during that time was 84 in the fiscal year ending in 2010. Of the 123 deaths in the fiscal year that ended last June, 24 were ruled homicides, 37 were accidental, 34 were natural, seven were suicide, and 21 were undetermined. The inspector general reviewed cases where children died despite having come in contact with DCFS in the 12 preceding months. “We, Illinois, must do better,” Meryl Paniak, the acting inspector general, said in the report.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A state House committee rejected a Democratic proposal Tuesday that would have directed $291 million in unexpected state tax revenue toward one-time teacher pay bonuses. The Republican-controlled House Ways and Means Committee voted 13-7 along party lines against the proposal, going along with arguments from GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb’s budget director that it wouldn’t be the best use of the money. Another legislative committee, meanwhile, advanced bills that would delay any penalties to schools from lower student scores on the state’s new ILEARN standardized test and to end the mandatory use of those test results in teacher evaluations.\n\nIowa\n\nSt. Lucas: It seems residents are doing their part to boost this tiny northeastern Iowa town’s population. The town of about 150 is experiencing a baby boom, television station KCRG reports. Resident Courtney Schott said 19 babies were born to town residents from August 2018 to October 2019, and several families have announced they’re expecting again. The boom follows about 10 years of more young families settling in the Fayette County community. The trend appears to be bucking what’s happening across the rest of the state. A new National Movers Study found slightly more people left Iowa than came into the state. The study shows 55% of moves were for people leaving the state, which ranks 10th in the nation. The study also found about a quarter of people leaving Iowa are between the ages of 18 and 34.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s declaration Tuesday that he won’t run for Senate in Kansas returned some Republicans to worrying that they can’t block a polarizing conservative from winning the GOP nomination and putting the seat in play. Pompeo’s decision to remain as the nation’s top diplomat, assuming he sticks by it, means the GOP can’t dodge the issue that had prompted top Republicans to woo Pompeo for months. They saw him as the best bet for torpedoing hard-right immigration policy advocate Kris Kobach’s bid for the Senate. Some anti-Kobach Republicans focused quickly on the race’s best-funded candidate so far, GOP Rep. Roger Marshall of western Kansas. But he still faced skepticism about his conservative bona fides and whether he can stop Kobach, particularly absent a one-on-one match.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Country music singer J.D. Shelburne has made the cover of his home state’s visitor’s guide. Shelburne joined Gov. Andy Beshear to unveil this year’s visitor’s guide Wednesday at the Capitol. The state prints 400,000 copies of the guide to share travel tips, stories and regional highlights. It focuses on the pillars of Kentucky tourism – music, bourbon, horses, food and outdoor attractions. “I can’t tell you how proud I am to know that when people first glance at this 2020 Kentucky tourism visitor’s guide, they’re going to see the face of a true Kentucky boy who is proud of where he came from,” Shelburne said. The Taylorsville native capped off the event by singing “My Old Kentucky Home.” He also performed a new song he wrote, “Straight From Kentucky.” Shelburne also is among several Kentucky musicians featured in an all-new digital and social media series by the state’s tourism department called “Sound Travels” premiering in May.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s Board of Regents will consider adopting penalties for public universities that violate minimum admissions standards for incoming freshmen at its meeting Thursday. The proposed amendments to the admissions policy were prompted by former LSU President King Alexander’s decision in 2018 to adopt a “holistic” admissions policy less reliant on ACT and SAT scores. Instead, LSU began placing more emphasis on recommendation letters, personal essays and activities outside the classroom, a move critics said lowered standards and diminished LSU’s stature as a state flagship university. Alexander is taking over as Oregon State’s president later this year. The changes would apply to every university if adopted. Louisiana’s Board of Regents set standards for all of the state’s university boards and their schools. Some exceptions are already allowed, but LSU exceeded that number.\n\nMaine\n\nFalmouth: The state’s annual loon count showed a slight drop in the number of birds, but the population appears strong and steady, Maine Audubon said Monday. Common loons live on Maine’s lakes and ponds and are known for their plaintive call. Volunteers count the birds every July. Maine Audubon said it’s estimating the 2019 loon population below the 45th parallel in Maine to include 3,219 adults and 372 chicks. The 2018 count found 3,269 adults and 406 chicks. The number of adults is more than twice the count from the mid-1980s, and the number of chicks has also trended up over the decades, according to data from Maine Audubon. The 2019 count might have been slightly down from the year before because heavy spring rains flooded some nests, causing some eggs to be lost. Some counters also said they found loons abandoning nests due to high numbers of black flies.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: After repeated public corruption cases in recent years, stronger ethics laws should be a priority of the upcoming legislative session, Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday. At a news conference announcing plans for legislation, the Republican governor noted a litany of federal indictments against state lawmakers – the latest just weeks ago. He said the cases illustrate that “a pervasive filter of corruption continues to exist, and it is clear that even tougher and more stringent laws are needed.” The Ethics and Accountability in Government Act of 2020 will include increased penalties for bribery – both for officials and for people who pay or solicit bribes. Hogan also said the legislation would force lawmakers to forfeit their pensions, expand prohibitions of misuse of confidential information by public officials, and empower the State Ethics Commission to directly assess penalties against public officials – authority the commission currently has for lobbyists.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nCambridge: The city has selected a Muslim woman who immigrated to the U.S. from Pakistan as a child to be mayor, in an apparent first for Massachusetts. Sumbul Siddiqui, who was in her second term as a city councilor, was selected by her peers. The mayor serves as chair of both the City Council and the School Committee, as well as performing political, ceremonial and community leadership functions, The Boston Globe reports. “At the end of the day, I’m committed to equity, inclusivity. and putting others first. That is exactly what I will strive to do for the next two years as your mayor,” Siddiqui said after being sworn in. She has a bachelor’s degree in public policy from Brown University and a law degree from Northwestern’s Pritzker School of Law.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The outdoor scenery in the Wolverine State picked up some national recognition Wednesday. TripSavvy named Michigan an “underappreciated outdoor playground” and the best place in the world for outdoor enthusiasts for its 19 million acres of forest and 3,000 miles of shoreline statewide. The national travel site included the state as one of 19 travel destinations in its “Where to Go in 2020: The Best Places to Travel This Year” list, which includes the top destinations for food, drink, families and more. Attractions across the state were highlighted, including Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in northern Michigan. For those looking to take a drive along water, TripSavvy writer Emily Hines suggests going north toward the Mackinac Bridge and driving along Lake Michigan on M-119.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCrystal: Bushels and bushels of corn spilled from a freight train and formed a smooth, yellow path for more than a third of a mile on railroad tracks in a northern Minneapolis suburb. The spill happened in Crystal on the Canadian Pacific line. The Star Tribune reports the corn stretched for about 2,000 feet. Assuming the corn was about 1.5 inches deep the entire way, the Tribune estimates the spill would amount to about 900 bushels. That’s about $3,400 worth of corn based on Tuesday’s prices at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Crews were working to clean up the spilled corn, Canadian Pacific Railway spokesman Andy Cummings said Tuesday.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Trustees over the second-largest school district in the state have voted to close an elementary school and consolidate two middle schools. The Jackson Public Schools board of trustees approved the plan Tuesday night, news outlets report. The change was needed to save money amid decreasing enrollment, a teacher shortage and a limited amount of funding to update old buildings, Superintendent Errick Greene says. Jackson City Councilman De’Keither Stamps voiced opposition to the plan, fearing the closure could continue a string of disinvestment in his south Jackson ward. The closure of the elementary school is the fifth such closure in the district in less than two years. Jackson is home to five of the six charter schools in the state, and Jackson Public Schools paid $2.6 million for nearly 1,000 students to attend charter schools for the 2017-18 school year.\n\nMissouri\n\nLake Ozark: A legislator from around the Lake of the Ozarks wants to allow riverboat gambling there. State Rep. Rocky Miller, R-Lake Ozark, filed a resolution Friday that would ask voters to add the Osage River to the list of waterways where casinos are permitted. Miller says he’s long thought it’s wrong that the state Constitution allows riverboat gambling solely on the Missouri and Mississippi rivers. It’s been that way ever since Missourians voted to revive gambling on the two big rivers in 1992. This isn’t his first time talking about the concept: Miller says he consulted on the Netflix show “Ozark,” which centers on the Byrde family’s efforts to launder money for a Mexican drug cartel in Osage Beach. Season 2 focuses on their efforts to open a riverboat casino at Lake of the Ozarks.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: With the city’s help, a group of residents hopes to conserve 72 acres of undeveloped prairie grassland on the southern edge of the city that’s owned by the state of Montana and valued at more than $1 million. It’s one of the last remaining undeveloped parcels along the Missouri River and still publicly accessible, says Alan Rollo of Missouri River Open Lands, a group that has formed to save the property as open space. There is a one-time opportunity to preserve the open land along with public access to it and the river, preserving it for recreational uses and wildlife, according to the group. Last year, the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation solicited ideas from the public for conservation uses of the property. Activities on school trust land must earn income for public schools and universities, says Andy Burgoyne, the DNRC’s Central Land Office Trust Program manager.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State lawmakers kicked off their 2020 session Wednesday by proposing more than 120 new laws, including a constitutional amendment that would abolish the state income tax and a ban on a common second-trimester abortion procedure. The 60-day session kicked off with many senators saying they expected to focus on the state’s property taxes, but some quickly signaled it would likely veer into contentious social issues as well. The abortion bill would ban dilation and evacuation abortions, which opponents refer to as “dismemberment abortion.” Federal courts have blocked similar laws in other states, and the proposal’s backers in Nebraska said they hope the U.S. Supreme Court will address the issue if the measure passes and is challenged in court. “I didn’t know this was occurring in Nebraska,” said Sen. Suzanne Geist, of Lincoln, who introduced the bill.\n\nNevada\n\nStateline: Volunteers joined state and federal officials to collect nearly 2,000 pounds of trash from a popular sledding area at Lake Tahoe last week in what has become an annual New Year’s cleanup. The Tahoe Daily Tribune reports Take Care Tahoe gathered the debris from Spooner Summit on Jan. 2 with the help of Nevada Department of Transportation, U.S. Forest Service and Nevada State Parks. Tahoe Fund CEO Amy Berry says the area is not under management during the winter, so no dumpsters can be set up at the site. Some of the 1,920 pounds of debris collected included broken sleds, lost snow clothes, dirty baby diapers, and food wrappers and waste. Nevada DOT spokeswoman Meg Ragonese says in addition to damaging the environment, the debris has the potential to blow onto area highways, where it can become a safety risk for passing motorists.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State lawmakers aren’t ready to prohibit companies from using fingerprints, DNA and other biometric information for purposes beyond what customers could reasonably expect. The Senate voted Wednesday to further study a bill the House passed last year that would have allowed individuals to file complaints against companies under the state’s Consumer Protection Act. It would have defined biometric information as “an individual’s physiological, biological, or behavioral characteristics,” including images of the iris, retina, face and fingerprints; voice recordings; and sleep, health or exercise data that contains identifying information. The bill faced opposition from the New Hampshire Business and Industry Association and others who argued that the definition of biometric information was too broad and that the standard for compliance was too subjective.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBayonne: A woman angry about long lines at a Motor Vehicle Commission office smashed computer equipment, assaulted two staffers and kicked police officers as they tried to arrest her, authorities said. Shawna Joseph, 28, of Jersey City, was told to leave the office in Bayonne about 2 p.m. Tuesday after she became irate over the length of the line of customers, authorities said. She then returned about two hours later and caused another disturbance. When she was confronted during the second visit, Joseph pushed the office manager and began breaking computer equipment, authorities said, eventually causing $23,000 in damage overall. Joseph was later found to have a PCP-laced marijuana cigarette in her possession, authorities said. She was charged with criminal mischief, drug possession, aggravated assault and hindering apprehension.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nGlorieta Mesa: An effort to trim the density of pinon and juniper trees near Canoncito is drawing criticism from some residents. The Santa Fe New Mexican reports state officials say the Ojo de la Vaca Meadow Restoration Project is designed to “encourage the growth of desirable understory vegetation.” The project also aims to improve forage for livestock and habitat for wildlife. But residents say the tree-thinning project is doing more harm than good. Stephen Dubinsky says the trees anchor the soil and prevent erosion. State Land Office spokeswoman Angie Poss says the state treated more than 48,000 acres last year in a range of projects similar to the work near Canoncito that are meant to improve the health of the land.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An ex-U.S. congressman is humbled and remorseful after pleading guilty to conspiracy in an insider trading scheme and should face no time behind bars, his lawyers argued in court papers Tuesday. The presentence submission on behalf of Christopher Collins was filed in Manhattan federal court, where the Republican is scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 17. Collins pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to commit securities fraud and lying to law enforcement officials. The lawyers said the 69-year-old Collins, who was one of the earliest supporters of President Donald Trump, should not go to prison because of his contrition, advanced age and good charitable works and because there’s no chance he’ll commit more crimes.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The top elected statewide leaders have agreed to rework lease terms on some state property that a group will turn into a park honoring the contributions of African Americans to North Carolina. The Council of State – comprised of Gov. Roy Cooper, Lt. Gov. Dan Forest and eight other elected officials – voted Tuesday to amend the lease. Less money will have to be raised than previously mandated for Freedom Park, to be located between the Legislative Building and the Executive Mansion in Raleigh. The 2012 lease required a nonprofit to raise at least $5 million in public and private funds in seven years, with $1.5 million of that set aside for perpetual mainteance, according to a document presented to council members. The altered lease now directs $3.2 million be raised by early 2022, with the park completion set for 2025.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A new tourism marketing campaign is promoting what the sparsely populated state has plenty of: elbow room. Among the least-visited states in the nation, North Dakota’s tourism agency on Tuesday unveiled a $2.9 million campaign touting the state’s wide-open spaces and outdoor recreational opportunities. Tourism Division Director Sara Otte Coleman said the state’s slogan is now, “Don’t follow the crowds – follow your curiosity.” “What that means is you won’t be bumper-to-bumper at a national park,” Otte Coleman said. Tourism officials confirmed last week that the agency has renewed its contract with Hollywood actor Josh Duhamel to promote tourism in his home state. The star of several “Transformers” movies will be paid $175,000 to be the face of North Dakota’s tourism campaign for the next two years, taking his total haul for the tourism contract to more than $1 million.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Petitioners are again asking the State Medical Board of Ohio to consider adding anxiety and autism spectrum disorders to the list of conditions that qualify for a doctor to recommend medical marijuana for patients. The conditions suggested in the second round of petitions the board received also include a football-related ailment: being a fan of the Cincinnati Bengals or the Cleveland Browns, both teams coming off disappointing seasons. Don’t expect that proposal to make it very far as a board committee reviews the petitions next month. Board members consider information from medical experts and scientific evidence before deciding whether to add a condition to the list. The list already includes conditions such as AIDS, cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. Last year, the board rejected petitions to add anxiety and autism spectrum disorders.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday night will debut its new “City” uniforms, designed to pay homage to those affected by the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, on national television. A striking combination of charcoal and bronze, they’ll also include numerous details that will be familiar to Oklahomans, such as the Survivor Tree on the waistbands and the Gates of Time on the side panels. The Thunder and the Oklahoma City National Memorial & Museum collaborated on the uniforms.\n\nOregon\n\nKeizer: The city is joining Salem in prohibiting camping on sidewalks and public rights of way, a move advocates say will make it more difficult for the homeless to stay warm and dry. Jimmy Jones, executive director of the Mid-Willamette Valley Community Action Agency, says the new ban creates “enormous complications for the homeless population because there’s really no safe place for them to go.” “There were very few safe places for them before,” Jones says. “But the worst part of it is that this is happening during the winter.” The ordinance – effective immediately – passed in a unanimous vote during Monday night’s City Council meeting. It comes just weeks after nearby Salem passed a similar camping ban leading to a clearing of a homeless camp outside of the ARCHES Project, a social services provider in downtown Salem.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A local nonprofit hoping to open a safe injection location with onsite overdose treatment is seeking a final judgment to make its operation legal and head off threats of punishment from the U.S. attorney. The nonprofit Safehouse filed a motion Monday asking U.S. District Judge Gerald McHugh to issue a declaratory judgement that would not prohibit the organization’s proposed overdose prevention model as a matter of law, WHYY reports. U.S. Attorney William McSwain sued the organization in February to stop it from opening the safe injection site. McHugh was asked by the federal government to decide simply whether the so-called crackhouse statute written in the 1980s as part of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act would apply to Safehouse. McHugh determined the organization’s plans did not violate the statute because the Safehouse’s ultimate aim is to reduce drug use, not facilitate it.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The nonprofit that oversees several of the city’s famous mansions hosted more than 1 million tours in 2019, the organization announced Wednesday. It was the fourth consecutive year that the Preservation Society of Newport County has hosted more than 1 million tours. The visitors came from all 50 states and more than 100 countries. The number of tours includes people who visited more than one of the society’s 11 historic properties, the society said. The society also hosted its 40 millionth tour since its founding in 1945. The Newport mansions comprise the only museum organization in New England outside of Boston that regularly reaches 1 million annual admissions, the organization said. The Preservation Society of Newport County’s properties include The Breakers, The Elms and Rosecliff.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Students at two Charleston County elementary schools will have the opportunity to collect data and help scientists at NASA and NOAA who are analyzing data for an international climate change study. A $2,500 Department of Health and Environmental Control grant will help fund the project for students at James B. Edwards Elementary and Mount Pleasant Academy, The Post and Courier of Charleston reports. The “Champions of the Environment” grant program aims to help kindergarten through 12th grade students be environmental stewards in their communities, said Amanda Ley, the grant program coordinator. It’s designed to support student-led projects that focus on pollution or waste reduction, water or energy efficiency, or preservation of natural areas. Charleston’s awardees will tackle two projects: restoring a salt marsh habitat and contributing relevant data to an international database for global analysis of climate change.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The president of the Oglala Sioux Tribe is asking for federal help in dealing with methamphetamine use on the reservation that he says has contributed to homicides. In a proclamation declaring a state of emergency, Julian Bear Runner says families on the Pine Ridge Reservation are living in a constant state of crisis and trauma due to drug use. Bear Runner is requesting immediate assistance from the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Indian Affairs Drug Task Force to help the tribe with meth prevention and intervention efforts. Bear Runner wrote in his declaration that the reservation has had several homicides in the past few weeks that were directly related to meth use. FBI spokesman Kevin Smith tells the Rapid City Journal he can’t comment on Bear Runner’s statement about the homicides being linked to meth since they are under investigation.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A fungal disease that kills sassafras trees is spreading, and the state Agriculture Department is seeking the public’s help to stop it. Earlier this year, laurel wilt disease was detected in trees in Montgomery, Cheatham, Dickson and Williamson counties. More recently, it has been detected in Robertson and Hamblen counties, according to a news release from the Tennessee Department of Agriculture. Laurel wilt is most likely in Tennessee due to human movement of contaminated wood, according to the department, and the best way to prevent its spread is to avoid moving firewood or untreated timber around the state. Laurel wilt is transmitted by the wood-boring redbay ambrosia beetle and can affect a range of plants, including sassafras and spicebush. Signs of laurel wilt include browning leaves, leaf loss and staining of the inner bark.\n\nTexas\n\nWichita Falls: A man accused of choking and headbutting his girlfriend because she complained about the smell of his flatulence has been jailed on an assault charge, police said. Officers in Wichita Falls responded to a home Sunday afternoon following a report that Christopher Ragsdale had assaulted his girlfriend, police said in a probable cause affidavit. “She told Christopher that his fart smelled horrible and he got mad and grabbed her by the hair and pulled her to the ground,” the affidavit said, adding that the woman told police that Ragsdale choked and headbutted her. The incident occurred at a friend’s house, and that friend called police, the affidavit said. Ragsdale remained jailed Wednesday on a complaint of assault family violence. Jail records do not list an attorney who might speak on his behalf.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: The president of Weber State University says a $10 million scholarship initiative will soon be accessible for students encountering financial difficulties. President Brad Mortensen made the announcement Tuesday in Ogden at his inauguration ceremony as the university’s 13th president, the Standard-Examiner reports. The scholarship called “CATapult” was designed to provide an energetic boost of momentum to students who are near completion but have encountered exhaustion and adversity, university officials said. About 1,000 students halfway toward their degrees were short on tuition and fees in fall 2018, representing about 3.5% of 28,247 students enrolled that semester, officials said. University officials expect that percentage to increase as enrollment increases.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A bill introduced in the Legislature would gives towns the authority to regulate short-term rentals in the age of online rental services like Airbnb and Vacation Rentals by Owner. Republican Rep. Jim Harrison of Chittenden introduced the bill Tuesday, the Rutland Herald reports. Many towns have taken steps to regulate short-term rentals through ordinances or zoning bylaws, Harrison said. “There’s some confusion as to what authority towns have in this arena,” he said. Under the proposal, short-term rentals are defined as “a furnished house, condominium, or other dwelling room or self-contained dwelling unit rented to the transient, traveling, or vacationing public for a period of fewer than 30 consecutive days and for more than 14 days per calendar year.”\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton Roads: An estimated 25,000 seabirds lost their nesting site of 40 years when it was paved over during a tunnel expansion project in coastal Virginia, state Department of Transportation officials say. Crews finished paving the entire south island of the nearly $4 billion Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel last month, a Transportation Department spokeswoman told the Virginian-Pilot, and in doing so did away with a large bird colony’s nesting area while those birds were migrating south for the winter. A new island for the birds will not be constructed, the department confirmed. And officials said they won’t know how it will affect the population until the animals return in the spring. Transportation officials did work with researchers and federal agencies to establish another place for them to live, but those efforts were largely abandoned after the Trump administration came out with an interpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act in 2017.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amtrak officials say a landslide blocking the tracks has temporarily stopped train service between Seattle and Portland. The slide was reported Tuesday on the tracks between Tacoma and Lacey, Washington. Amtrak said it would provide alternate bus transportation for passengers between Portland and Seattle. Officials said regular train service will resume at 8 a.m. Thursday. Rain from the past few days has brought many rivers to flood stage and increased landslide risk. And the Cascade Mountains have been seeing plenty of snow, the Seattle Times reports. About a dozen trees toppled because of heavy snow at Stevens Pass on Monday, closing Highway 2 from Monday afternoon into early Tuesday between the summit and Coles Corner.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: A high school has won a video contest aimed at raising awareness of the dangers of prescription painkiller abuse. Wheeling Central Catholic High School was selected as the winner of the public service announcement contest sponsored by Bill Powell, the U.S. attorney for the state’s northern district. Eight schools participated in the contest that was open to all high schools in the district’s 32 counties. Powell and other law enforcement partners judged the videos, which promoted drug-free high schools, Powell said in a news release. The winning entry will be shared with media outlets across the district.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s beach towels featuring yellow crime scene tape and an outline of a body quickly sold out Wednesday. Within 24 hours of the office’s Facebook post about selling the towels, which also feature the office’s logo, a steady stream of people stopped at the medical examiner’s office to snap them up for $20 apiece. The towels were given out in November to more than 200 attendees of the office’s annual forensic science seminar in Milwaukee, says Karen Domagalski, operations manager of the medical examiner’s office. There were about 75 left over from the conference, so the medical examiner decided to sell the towels. Despite a cash-only sales policy and requirement that they be picked up in person, they sold out by 10 a.m. Wednesday. Domagalski says there are no plans to create more of the towels.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Deputies who work in a county jail are now required to wear body cameras, making it the first program of its kind in the state, Sweetwater County sheriff’s officials said. Sweetwater County Detention Center uniformed deputies on all shifts must record any contact with an inmate or when they are in an inmate zone, with some privacy exceptions, according to a statement by the sheriff’s office. The recordings will be saved and available for official review. Sheriff’s officials said the cameras instill a higher level of professionalism and public trust. Misconduct complaints have plummeted since patrol deputies started wearing body cameras in 2016, and officials hope to replicate the success in the jail.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/08/24/pandemic-panda-mania-uss-missouri-virtual-book-fair-news-around-states/113464262/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The University of Alabama has issued a prohibition on student gatherings, including off-campus parties and fraternity and sorority events, as the school tries to curb the spread of COVID-19. The university on Friday announced a 14-day moratorium on all in-person student events outside of classroom instruction. Social gatherings are prohibited on and off campus and the common areas of dormitories and fraternity and sorority houses are closed, according to the new guidelines. Visitors are not being allowed in dormitories and sorority and fraternity houses. The announcement came less than a week after city and school officials raised alarm about large crowds waiting outside bars. The university said the hosts of gatherings will receive heightened consequences, even for a first offense, and that serious and repeated violations could result in suspension by the university. “While we are appreciative to those who have taken these expectations seriously, I am deeply disappointed that those guidelines are not being followed by each and every member of our student body,” University of Alabama President Stuart Bell wrote in a message to students.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: RavnAir Group, which halted operations in April, laid off staff and filed for bankruptcy because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, hopes to begin renewed service to its former hub communities in September under a new leadership team. Ravn Alaska CEO Rob McKinney said there is no set starting date as the airline tries to stage a comeback from a $9.5 million bankruptcy asset sale earlier this month, The Alaska Journal of Commerce reported. The airline plans to focus on safety and customer service as it gets back off the ground, McKinney said. The company operated more than 400 flights per day with a fleet of 72 aircraft, but passenger traffic dropped more than 90% after the pandemic outbreak. RavnAir Group is also owned the Corvus and PenAir carrier services, and flew passengers from Anchorage to the Aleutian Islands, the Kenai Peninsula and various rural Alaska destinations. Ravn Alaska will need about 400 employees and is actively recruiting staff. All employees, including former staff, will take courses before restarting, McKinney said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Possible exposure to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 means some students at Kyrene del Milenio Elementary School must quarantine, the school’s principal has told parents, azfamily.com reported Saturday. It wasn’t immediately known how many students were required to quarantine. But a letter sent by Principal Michael Lamp said the possible exposure happened in one teacher’s classroom and on one bus to school and another bus after school. The 14-day day quarantine will run from Wednesday when the last possible exposure occurred and the children involved can return to school Sept. 2, Lamp wrote. Kyrene has been using remote learning for most students since beginning the new school year on Aug. 17. But it has some students at school as required by a state mandate for districts to provide services to at-risk and certain other students.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:In her 28 years of teaching kindergarten at Fort Smith Public Schools, Cami Stancil had never made her students sit at desks. That will change Monday, when Arkansas Public Schools open with rules about students are supplied, where they are allowed in the school and how they are allowed to interact with each other amid the coronavirus pandemic. “While every year has been a little bit different, this one has by far been the greatest challenge,” Stancil said as she looked over rows of desks placed in taped-off grids in her Cook Elementary School classroom. The kinds of limitations schools should put on in-person teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic has been debated throughout the U.S. State officials last week released a threat assessment map of the state, which lists school districts in one of five threat levels based on how many people per 10,000 are infected with the virus in the past 14 days within the geographic boundaries of a school district. With 30 to 49 infected people per 1,000, Fort Smith School District was listed in the second-highest of the five threat levels. Schools within the district have taken advantage of the virtual teaching option. At Cook, 115 of the roughly 550 students are going to use the virtual option to start the school year, Principal Marta Boltec said. For the students who will be taught in-person, district officials have mandated students to wear masks unless appropriately socially distanced. They also have assigned students numbers that correspond with their desks and other places they can go in the school.\n\nCalifornia\n\nUkiah: Schools in Mendocino County were forced to close this week when state officials said their coronavirus cases had been higher than previously reported, and several hundred students were sent home from class, officials said Friday. Michelle Hutchins, superintendent of schools in the county, said she learned this week the county had been placed on a state monitoring list for coronavirus infections with a date retroactive to July 25, and that as a result schools should have not been allowed to open for in-person instruction after that point in time. Hutchins said on Wednesday she sent home 300 to 400 students who had already started the year off in largely rural schools. It’s possible elementary school students will be allowed to return under special waivers offered by the state but middle and high schoolers will remain on distance learning until virus conditions meet the state-mandated thresholds for the Northern California county to fall off the state’s monitoring list, she said. The situation comes after California faced a problem in late July with electronic lab reports that were getting backlogged at the state. The state said it has since fixed the data issue but it led to a delay in reporting about 14,000 virus cases.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Windsor Middle School has quarantined 37 students and 11 staff members after learning a student tested positive for COVID-19. Thirty-seven seventh-grade students in the same A-group cohort as the student who tested positive were asked to quarantine and switched to remote learning through Sept. 10, said Lisa Relou, a communications specialist for the Weld RE-4 School District. Seven teachers who had direct contact with the student are also working remotely through Sept. 4, she said, as are four paraprofessionals who had contact with the student. The school was notified Thursday afternoon of the positive test result of a student who had been in class that day, Relou said. Students in Weld RE-4’s middle and high schools are attending classes in person two days a week and receiving remote instruction on the other three, Relou said. Group A attends classes in person on Mondays and Thursdays, she said, and Group B on Tuesdays and Fridays. All students receive remote instruction on Wednesdays while schools are cleaned and disinfected. Windsor Middle School has 686 students, Relou said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDanbury: Residents are being urged to take precautions after what officials have described as a “serious outbreak” of the coronavirus. State health officials issued a COVID-19 alert Friday night that recommended that residents stay home, avoid unnecessary outings, limit indoor gatherings and avoid attending church services. It also urged people to cooperate with contact tracers and get tested immediately if they feel they have been exposed, and self-quarantine for 14 days if they test positive. “This is a serious outbreak in Danbury and we really need an all-hands-on-deck approach,” Acting DPH Commissioner Deidre S. Gifford said in a statement. The alert came days after a spike in cases led the city to cancel youth sports leagues. The state reported the city of roughly 85,000 has had nearly 180 confirmed cases from Aug. 2-20, compared to 40 new confirmed cases in the previous two-week period. Mayor Mark Boughton told the News-Times that 44 new cases were reported on Friday alone. Acting city health director Kara Prunty told the newspaper the seven-day average of new cases went from 2.3 in the week of July 19 to 8.4 last week. City officials have blamed the recent uptick on neighborhood gatherings such as barbecues, travel and youth sports.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Delaware is joining the list of states taking up President Donald Trump’s offer of additional unemployment benefits to millions of American affected by the coronavirus pandemic. While announcing that Delaware will accept the offer, Labor Secretary Cerron Cade on Friday nevertheless criticized it as “a Hail Mary that is unnecessarily complicated and will be a nightmare to implement quickly.” “Furthermore, with the stability of the funding source and overall legality of the president’s memorandum in question, it is unclear if or when the additional benefits will be available,” Cade added. Trump acted by executive order to extend additional unemployment payments of up to $400 a week to cushion the economic fallout for people affected by the pandemic. The move came after negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House failed to reach agreement on extending a program that provided for supplemental payments of $600 a week, which expired Aug. 1. Trump’s plan calls for a weekly benefit of $300 a week, or $400 if states chip in $100 per claimant to provide the higher amount.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A new giant panda cub is sparking pandemic-fueled panda-mania, and officials at the National Zoo said traffic on their livestream spiked 1,200% over the past week. “I’m pretty sure we broke the Internet last night,” National Zoo Director Steve Monfort said Saturday. The zoo’s Panda Cam traffic has been crashing since venerable matriarch Mei Xiang’s pregnancy was announced this past week. When she gave birth Friday night, zoo officials said they had a hard time getting into their own livestream, and they’re now working to boost their capabilities. On camera, the moment of birth at about 6:35 p.m. EDT is obscured, but the results become immediately obvious from the new cub’s robust squealing. The massive mother immediately picks up and cradles the infant, which officials said is the size of a stick of butter. “We can tell the cub is doing well from its vocalizations and the mother’s behavior,” Smith said. Zoo staff remain ready to intervene if something seems wrong, but Smith said Mei Xiang, who has reared three cubs to adulthood, “knows exactly what she is doing.” For now, zoo staff are letting the new pair share some private time. Mei Xiang will remain with her baby (gender still unknown) in a small indoor enclosure where she has built a modest nest. For about a week, the new mother will not leave the baby’s side even to eat or drink. The cub, who will not be named for its first hundred days in accordance with tradition, will remain in the den for its first few months of life. For now it is pink and hairless; the distinctive black and white fur markings come later. Meanwhile father Tian Tian seems blissfully oblivious, rolling around his outdoor enclosure. Giant pandas are almost entirely solitary, and in the wild it would be normal for Tian Tian to never meet his offspring.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The COVID-19 pandemic has done what 9/11 and Hurricane Andrew couldn’t do: It forced The Miami Book Fair to cancel its annual weeklong book frenzy at Miami Dade College’s Wolfson Campus for the first time in 37 years. But the show will go on virtually – and it will go on for free. The transition from live to virtual fair, which will feature programs in English and Spanish, has been a painstaking process, said program director Lissette Mendez. Some events will be available on the website for one night only; others might linger online longer. All the usual genres will be represented – fiction, politics, history, memoir, comics, poetry, Caribbean works with a focus on Haiti – in addition to robust children’s programming. Mendez envisions it as “Netflix for books” accessed through a new and upgraded website. Participants sign in with their email and create a password, and the site will take them to a list of programs, panels and conversations that they will view the way they would view their Netflix catalog. Click on what you want to see, and the link will take you to a YouTube-like page where you watch the event. The fair, which runs Nov. 15-22, kicks off with Margaret Atwood (“The Handmaid’s Tale,” “The Testaments”). More than 171 English-language authors and 80 Spanish-language authors have signed up, with more to be added over the next few weeks. The website is expected to go live sometime in September, at which point you can create a watch list of the events you’re hoping to see and sign up for emails letting you know when new authors have been added.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia on Saturday became the 10th state in the nation to report that it has surpassed 5,000 deaths caused by COVID-19. The Georgia Department of Public Health said there have been at least 5,092 deaths in the state caused by the coronavirus and more than 252,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Data kept by the Associated Press showed the coronavirus has been spreading in Georgia faster per capita than any other state over the past two weeks, although infection numbers have been declining in the state since their peak last month. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who was among the first governors to ease earlier restrictions this spring, highlighted the downward trends this past week. He has used social media to remind residents to wear a mask, maintain social distancing and follow guidance from the health department.\n\nHawaii\n\nPearl Harbor: Several dozen U.S. veterans will gather on a battleship in Pearl Harbor next month to mark the 75th anniversary of Japan’s surrender in World War II, even if it means the vulnerable group might be risking their lives again amid the coronavirus pandemic. The 75th anniversary was meant to be a blockbuster event, and the veterans have been looking forward to it for years. There were to be thousands of people watching in Hawaii as parades marched through Waikiki, vintage warbirds flying overhead, and gala dinners to honor the veterans. Now, most in-person celebrations have been canceled over fears the virus could infect the veterans, who range from 90 to 101. But about 200 people, mostly veterans, their families and government officials, will still commemorate the milestone on the USS Missouri, which hosted the surrender on Sept. 2, 1945, in Tokyo Bay. It comes as Oahu – Hawaii’s most populated island and the home of Pearl Harbor – has seen an alarming spike in coronavirus cases in the past two weeks, forcing many restrictions to be reinstated, including a ban on gatherings of more than five people and the closure of all beaches. Officials plan to keep the veterans socially distanced while they are honored in front of livestreaming cameras instead of live crowds of thousands, as was first planned. Hawaii is expected to grant modified quarantine orders for those traveling for the anniversary, allowing them to attend the official ceremony and other events. Otherwise, people coming to the islands are required to quarantine for two weeks.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho will remain in the fourth and final stage for reopening the economy for at least another two weeks as coronavirus infection rates and hospitalizations remain too high, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican governor spoke at the Idaho Foodbank in Boise, where he emphasized the need to support food banks during the pandemic when many people have lost jobs. He said $2.56 million in federal coronavirus relief money will be made available to the Idaho Foodbank for use throughout the state. “More and more Idaho families are turning to their local food banks and food assistance programs during the coronavirus pandemic,” Little said. Idaho Foodbank officials said they saw a 10% to 50% increase in food demand when the pandemic reached the state in March and the economy started shutting down. “We are experiencing increased food insecurity in our state,” Idaho Foodbank President and CEO Karen Vauk said. Little also said that $10 million of relief money would go to long-term care facilities to keep residents safe during the pandemic. Little said the state has sufficient ICU beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment. He also said the number of people being admitted to hospitals is stabilizing, and that positivity test rates are falling.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Illinois’ incoming high school seniors have been struggling to register for standardized testing ahead of college application season after the coronavirus pandemic caused testing dates to be canceled. Students weren’t able to take the SAT at schools in April, and ACT tests in the spring and summer were canceled after sites closed, the Chicago Tribune reported. ACT executive Shane King said the company relies on schools for testing sites, but shutdowns made that impossible. He also can’t guarantee that locations booked for September and October won’t be canceled. Clay Lindner is one senior who secured a spot to take the ACT. But like some, he was assigned to a site in another state. He registered to take the test in Chicago but was transferred to a site in Jonesboro, Arkansas. ACT officials said location changes were because of a computer bug that has been fixed. But Lindner didn’t want to risk it, so he grabbed a spot in Louisville, Kentucky, near homes of extended family members. The SAT, the ACT’s main competitor, tried a different approach. The College Board, which administers the exam, allowed seniors to sign up early for tests that will resume Aug. 29. Some students said they were able to register for an SAT test after they couldn’t land a spot for ACT testing. Evanston senior Josie Hansen was offered a spot in Michigan to take the ACT after two previous testing cancellations. But she decided to take the SAT in nearby Wilmette instead. Meanwhile, about 350 colleges have made assertions since the start of the outbreak that standardized test scores will be optional this year. But parents and students are not convinced that the lack of a good score will be a disadvantage at a competitive school.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: After a monthslong break forced by the coronavirus pandemic, felony jury trials are set to resume in Marion County, home to Indianapolis and the state’s largest county court system. Marion Superior Court officials said major felony trials will begin this week, and lower felony, misdemeanor and civil trials would resume the week of Sept. 14. To protect jurors against the spread of COVID-19 during trials, the court said it is implementing assigned, socially distanced seating and requiring face masks. Jurors will also be provided personal hand sanitizers and sanitizer stations, as well as deep cleaning facilities. Prospective jurors are being asked to notify the jury pool coordinator if they have been diagnosed with COVID-19 within the last 30 days, are caring with someone with COVID-19 or will be self-quarantining on their summons date. Major felony trials will take place at the Marion Superior Court Traffic Court to accommodate larger jury pools. All other trials will continue to be in the City-County Building. Prospective jurors are asked to check their jury summons to make sure they report to the correct location.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The University of Iowa is cutting four athletic programs to cope with lost revenue because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier reported that Iowa announced Friday that its men’s gymnastics, men’s and women’s swimming and diving and men’s tennis programs will be discontinued at the conclusion of the 2021-22 academic year. “We are heartbroken for our student-athletes, coaches and staff,’’ director of athletics Gary Barta wrote in a letter announcing the moves. The letter also was signed by university president Bruce Harreld. Finances are tight after the Big Ten decided to scrap plans for a fall sports season because of the coronavirus crisis. The university will continue to honor all existing scholarships through graduation for student-athletes who choose to remain at Iowa and will assist student-athletes who wish to transfer to other institutions “in every way possible.” Iowa previously announced reductions in compensation for all athletics department personnel and cuts in operational expenses.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The number of inmates who have tested positive for COVID-19 at a jail in Wichita has grown to more than 500. The Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office has conducted mass testing of its inmates at the urging of state health officials. As of Friday, 523 inmates have tested positive and 747 negative, KAKE-TV reported. “As results were received, inmates were separated and housed based on the results of their tests to minimize the spreading of COVID-19,” Lt. Tim Myers said. “Inmates that have reported symptoms of COVID-19 have received treatment from the contracted medical provider. No inmates have required hospitalization because of testing positive for COVID-19.” Inmates with no symptoms are considered recovered 10 days post-test. Myers estimated that around 400 inmates will be considered recovered by the end of the weekend. “We are continuing to maintain sanitization standards to take care of our staff and inmates which include issuing extra soap, and having disinfectant available as needed.” Myers said all staff members have been issued masks, and all inmates have been issued face coverings for the last several months.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A school district that reopened to in-person classes last week announced Friday that it would switch to virtual learning until at least Sept. 8. Green County Superintendent William Hodges said in a social media post that the move was because of increased coronavirus activity in the community, news outlets reported. “We have had a great week in our school system and are unaware of any student cases, but the increase in community cases has caused us to reach our threshold for transitioning into the ‘red phase’ of our reopening plan,” the district wrote in a Facebook post. Students returned on Aug. 17, despite Gov. Andy Beshear recommending that school districts wait until Sept. 28 to hold in-person classes. Meanwhile, Kentucky reported 785 new coronavirus cases Friday, including 97 youngsters ages 18 and under. Eight more virus-related deaths were reported, raising the statewide death toll to 864.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Sixty percent of Louisiana’s parishes will continue to receive information about residents who have tested positive for the coronavirus under a data-sharing agreements they signed with the state – even as questions arise about whether local officials should continue to receive the personal health details. Louisiana’s health department sends lists of people with positive tests and their addresses to local emergency officials to help first responders know they will be interacting with someone infected with the virus. The agency required parish officials to sign data-use agreements outlining limits on disclosure of the information after two rural parishes appeared to misuse lists they received, raising concerns they may have violated privacy laws. The state began sharing positive test result lists in the early days of Louisiana’s coronavirus outbreak, when first responders had shortages of personal protective equipment and were rationing masks, gloves and other gear. The health department said giving local officials lists of people who tested positive for the virus helped law enforcement and emergency workers know when they should use that limited protective equipment because they’d be encountering someone who had the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus. Those shortages are largely gone – and COVID-19 has spread across Louisiana in larger numbers, so the lists don’t truly show the footprint of the virus outbreak. Public health officials say first responders should act as though anyone they encounter could be carrying the virus, because so many people are asymptomatic and may never get tested.\n\nMaine\n\nMillinocket: One of the people who tested positive for the coronavirus after a wedding reception in Millinocket has died, a hospital said. There are more than 30 cases associated with the Aug. 7 event but only one of them was hospitalized. That individual died Friday afternoon, said Robert Peterson, CEO of Millinocket Regional Hospital. Because of the outbreak, the hospital is closed to visitors. Town Hall and schools also were closed. The reception at the Big Moose Inn exceeded the state’s indoor gathering limit, among other violations of state rules. The outbreak affected individuals from 4 to 78 years old, officials said. Friday was the 14th day since about 65 people – more than the limit of 50 – attended the reception. A representative for the Big Moose Inn has declined to comment.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean Pines:Staff will stay home and two pools will be closed in the Ocean Pines resort community after another staff member was found Friday to have contracted COVID-19. The worker, a member of the aquatics department, was last at work on Thursday, according to a post by the Ocean Pines Association on Facebook. Three OPA workers have now tested positive since April. “We have notified employees believed to have had close contact with the affected employee directly, and asked them not to report to work for 14 days,\" the Association wrote in a statement. \"For the rest of us, it is important to continue practicing sound hygiene practices by frequently washing hands thoroughly, maintaining 6 feet of separation between others, and wearing masks when indoors or when social distancing is not possible.\"\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBrockton: The city has enacted a curfew to slow the spread of the coronavirus after state health officials deemed it a “higher risk” community. All residents and visitors in Brockton are to remain in their residences between the hours of 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. The curfew doesn’t apply to essential workers. Violators are subject to a $200 fine for the first offense, $350 for a second, and up to $500 for a third. Mayor Robert Sullivan signed an executive order mandating the curfew on Friday. In the order, he noted that the city’s infection rate has been 8.5 cases per 100,000 residents for the past two weeks – an alarming figure that prompted state officials to designate Brockton as “higher risk.” The city of nearly 100,000 is located 25 miles south of Boston.\n\nMichigan\n\nKalamazoo: A federal judge on Friday refused to block a requirement that Michigan’s migrant farm workers get tested for the coronavirus, rejecting claims that it violates the rights of Hispanics. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a handful of workers, as well as some fruit producers. But farm worker advocates told the judge they’re in favor of the tests. Compliance starts Monday under an order from the state health department. “The emergency order is facially neutral,” U.S. District Judge Paul Maloney said. “It applies to all owners and operators of migrant housing camps and all agricultural employers, as defined in the emergency order, with over 20 workers on site at a time. … The emergency order does not mention Latinos or any other racial classification.” The state said the tests are intended to protect vulnerable people who live in close quarters. “The department welcomes today’s ruling by a federal court rejecting an attempt to undermine this critical program to save lives,” director Robert Gordon said. There have been virus outbreaks since April at a poultry farm, an asparagus farm, a meatpacking plant and other agricultural sites, according to the state.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: University of Minnesota President Joan Gabel wants to delay reopening campuses in the Twin Cities, Duluth and Rochester for two weeks in the wake of COVID-19 outbreaks at other U.S. colleges. The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that Gabel announced her proposal Friday. The Board of Regents is expected to consider it on Monday. The plan comes on the heels of outbreaks at schools such as the University of North Carolina and Notre Dame. White House Coronavirus Task Force leader Dr. Deborah Birx has said colleges should be able to conduct 10,000 tests per day. Right now the University of Minnesota plans to test only students who are symptomatic or have been exposed to someone who has been infected. “If the university’s best plan is that students aren’t going to go out and party, then I don’t think that’s a solid plan,” said Amy Ma, the Twin Cities campus’ student body president. Classes begin Aug. 31 in Duluth and Sept. 8 at the other two campuses. Under Gabel’s plan, classes would start on time but would be delivered completely online. Dorms would be closed for the first two weeks of the semester, with housing and dining contracts prorated. Students would be allowed to cancel their housing contracts or defer them to the spring.\n\nMississippi\n\nHattiesburg:Dozens of Oak Grove High School students staged a walkout Friday to protest what they believed are lax rules around COVID-19 precautions and the handling of an alleged racially charged incident. Faith Jones, an Oak Grove senior, said the students came to school Friday with a plan to walk out. \"Oak Grove is extremely reactive and never proactive,\" she said. The protest was planned after a senior photo was taken Aug. 13 during a celebration of seniors at the start of the school year. Students wore masks until it was time to take the photo, but were crowded together despite Gov. Tate Reeves' mandate on social distancing. Parents were then notified by the district that \"an individual in your child's class, group or team has been diagnosed with COVID-19.\" The letter was not signed, but was printed on school district letterhead. Lamar County Superintendent Tess Smith said Friday she could not comment about the district's COVID-19 cases and declined to answer a question about the number of students notified of possible exposure. Also during the senior event, a video posted to Facebook showed students allegedly yelling \"white power\" during the senior run on the football field. Smith said the school is still investigating the incident. Students were warned before the walkout that they could possibly face disciplinary action for leaving class during school hours.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: St. Louis County will expand its requirement on face coverings, including a requirement that all students kindergarten through high school wear one. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the new guidelines were announced Friday. The guidelines are effective starting Monday. The school regulation applies to private and public schools, for all students in kindergarten through 12th grade. They can remove masks for physical education, choir or music class, during school-sponsored sports, or while eating, as long as they remain 6 feet apart. Beyond school, children 6 or older will be required to wear face coverings in public. A previous order applied to children 10 or older. The new regulations also require businesses to deny entry to customers who refuse to wear face coverings. A previous order authorized businesses to deny entry, but did not require it. St. Louis County has reported 16,758 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 700 deaths. Both figures are the most for any county in the state.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: More than 30 inmates at the Yellowstone County jail have tested positive for COVID-19, an inmate at the Cascade County regional jail in Great Falls has also tested positive and a resident died at a long-term care facility in Flathead County where there has been an outbreak of the respiratory virus, officials said. Thirty out of 70 men in one housing unit at the Yellowstone County jail tested positive, Sheriff Mike Linder said. Those who have tested positive are being isolated but are not showing symptoms. In Great Falls, one inmate at the regional jail tested positive for COVID-19 after showing symptoms, Cascade Copunty Sheriff Jesse Slaughter said. In Flathead County, a resident of a long-term care facility has died of COVID-19, county health officials said Saturday. However, because of privacy laws, they are not identifying the facility. At least two facilities have announced cases. Fourteen residents and employees with Whitefish Care and Rehabilitation Center tested positive for COVID-19, executive director Reid Crickmore told the Daily Inter Lake on Thursday. Meanwhile, a nurse, a housekeeper and a maintenance worker at Immanuel Lutheran Communities in Kalispell tested positive for COVID-19, President and CEO Jason Cronk announced Friday. They had not shown any symptoms, he said. Residents of Immanuel Skilled Care Center and Retreat were expected to undergo testing on Friday and those results were expected within several days, Cronk said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Colleges throughout the region have changed some of their residence and dining hall operating procedures to minimize the risk of a coronavirus breakout. Many college leaders said they want their campus to be open for business because most students would rather be on campus than taking classes by computer from home. But the Omaha World Herald reported that the pressure is on administrators to pull that off safely. Megan Failor, Doane University’s director of residential life and education, said administrators this fall are bound to be concerned. “It’s definitely going to be a unique year,” Failor said. “I think any time there are changes ... that always causes some angst.” Failor said Doane has designated its Colonial Hall residence facility as an isolation place for students with positive COVID-19 tests, symptoms or significant exposure to someone who has the disease. At the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Piper Hall, which wasn’t used last year, will serve as an isolation residence hall for those who have tested positive for the coronavirus or show symptoms. Spokeswoman Leslie Reed said Piper is not a medical facility and those with serious symptoms will have to visit a clinic.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Teachers in Washoe County will receive free COVID-19 testing, the district said Friday. The tests will be done through a drive-through site with Renown Regional Medical Center. The district said it also hired an employee health nurse who will answer questions and determine if an employee has symptoms that would warrant a test. The district said it could not immediately say what the turnaround time for results will be. Results in Washoe County have been taking three days or more. Also Friday, the Washoe Education Association, the union representing about 2,500 district teachers, sent out information about filing a claim if an employee believes he or she contracted COVID-19 at work. Claims also must be filled out within seven days of getting a positive COVID-19 test. The union was encouraging teachers to document unsafe conditions and the timing and location of COVID-19 cases among students and staff.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLaconia: Motorcycle Week is underway in Laconia, but some bars and pubs won’t be serving customers. The annual event typically attracts thousands of motorcycle enthusiasts to the Lakes Region. Because of concerns about the coronavirus, Gov. Chris Sununu recently mandated that masks be worn at gatherings of more than 100 people, and has said that liquor enforcement officials will be out in force throughout the nine-day gathering. Although indoor dining is allowed, standing at bars is not; customers must be served while seated. Some bar owners brought in new chairs to comply, but others, fearing crowds and the potential for fines or the loss of their liquor licenses, decided to shut down for the week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Bills that would require the state to prioritize protective gear for long-term care facilities and increase pay for workers in those facilities advanced in the state Legislature on Friday. Health committees in the Senate and Assembly each passed seven bills that are a response to the coronavirus's devastating toll in the state's long-term care facilities. More than 7,000 residents and staff in those facilities have died, accounting for half of the COVID-19 confirmed deaths in New Jersey. One key bill advanced in the Senate committee but not in the Assembly. The bill, S-2798, would require all long-term care facilities to submit outbreak response plans to the Department of Health. Bills that address other recommendations, such as imposing harsher fines on facilities for infection control violations, were not discussed.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico’s jobless rate has jumped to 12.7%, the highest for the state since the coronavirus pandemic began in the U.S. in March. The unemployment rate is up from 8.4% in June, reversing a steady downward trend since April, when the rate was 11.3%, the Albuquerque Journal reported. The U.S. unemployment rate was 10.2% in July, down from 11% in June. All major sectors in New Mexico experienced year-to-year job losses, the state Department of Workforce Solutions said in a statement. Industries like leisure and hospitality reported the largest employment losses. State Workforce Solutions Secretary Bill McCamley said the main reason behind the state’s unemployment rate increase came from temporary furloughs for workers that became layoffs as the pandemic persisted. The Albuquerque metropolitan area reported an unemployment rate of 13.1% in July. The Santa Fe area reported a rate of 13.5%, Las Cruces’ figure was 13% and Farmington had a rate of 16%, officials said.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: A western New York couple’s big wedding is off – at least for now – after an 11th-hour court order in a fight between couples and the state over a 50-person limit on social gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. A federal appellate judge in Manhattan on Friday granted a state request that blocks Pamella Giglia and Joe Durolek from having the 175-person celebration they planned Saturday at a Buffalo-area golf club. The order from Judge Denny Chin, of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, leaves New York’s 50-person rule in place at least until a panel of appeals judges can hear arguments, which couldn’t happen before the planned celebration. One of the couple’s attorneys, Phillip Oswald, noted the order came after lengthy court hearings and lower court rulings in the duo’s favor. “It is unfortunate,” Oswald said in an email Saturday, that “a single judge from the appellate court cavalierly issued a two-page, four-paragraph order that prevented this couple from having their wedding in a manner that is no more risky than going to a restaurant, gym, museum, etc.” The couple’s attorneys said Durolek and Giglia were postponing their wedding. Messages were sent Saturday to representatives for Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state Attorney General Letitia James, whose offices are leading the state’s side of the case. On Saturday night, James’ office referred questions to the governor’s office. Cuomo’s office has not released guidance specific to weddings, but has said they are subject to the 50-person cap on social gatherings.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: East Carolina University and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte are moving courses online in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the universities announced Sunday. ECU will move undergraduate courses online for the remainder of the fall semester, beginning Aug. 26. Undergraduate classes are suspended Monday and Tuesday at ECU to adjust to the change in the schedule. Professional and graduate courses will continue as they are operating at ECU. Fall classes began at ECU on Aug. 10. University residence halls will begin move-out this week with the conclusion on Aug. 30. The university will work with international students, student athletes and hardship cases who apply to continue to live on campus, the university said. UNC at Charlotte will begin classes as scheduled on Sept. 7, but it’s delaying the start of undergraduate and graduate in-person instruction for three weeks until Oct. 1. All instruction will begin as planned on the first day of classes Sept. 7, but will now be delivered online. UNC at Charlotte will continue to offer on-campus housing and dining services for students who are on-campus, international students and others with approved extenuating circumstances. Move-in to residence halls is scheduled for Sept. 26-29.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Passenger traffic is starting to pick up again at North Dakota’s airports but remains less than half of what it was a year ago before the coronavirus pandemic drove people into their homes. The Bismarck Tribune reported the state’s eight commercial airports saw about 5,000 passengers, or 5% of expected traffic, in April, the lowest monthly passenger count since record-keeping began 40 years ago. Passenger counts rose to 13,474 in May; 24,313 in June; and 39,660 in July. That’s still down 64% from July 2019, according to the state Areonautics Commission. Year-to-date boardings are down about 50% overall. The Federal Aviation Administration is providing more than $85 million in aid to 53 North Dakota airports through the federal coroanavirus relief bill. The Bismarck airport is getting more than $20 million.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Staff members at all Ohio assisted living facilities must undergo coronavirus testing under a public health order issued Friday that expands testing being done in nursing homes. The order, signed by interim Health Director Lance Himes, requires staff in such facilities to be tested and any residents who wish it. Ohio licenses 771 assisted living facilities statewide. The pandemic has struck the elderly living in Ohio’s long-term care facilities especially hard. More than 2,500 residents in such settings have died from the coronavirus in Ohio, or more than six of every 10 deaths statewide. DeWine was also expected to issue an order Friday on guidelines for performing arts facilities.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Face-mask mandates adopted in some communities to reduce the spread of COVID-19 seem to be working, according to a newspaper report. Data from the Oklahoma State Department of Health showed cities with mask mandates nearly cut in half their average number of new COVID-19 infections after three weeks, The Oklahoman reported Sunday. In Oklahoma, 17 localities have adopted mask ordinances, according to data compiled by the Oklahoma State Medical Association. On July 20, the rolling average of new COVID-19 virus cases in cities with mask ordinances was 457. By Aug. 12, that number had dropped 47% to 233, according to data from the Oklahoma State Department of Health. Areas without mask ordinances also saw a 28% drop in new coronavirus cases during the same time period. That drop was likely the result, in part, to some residents wearing face masks even where they aren’t required, the newspaper reported. Dr. David Kendrick of the University of Oklahoma’s School of Community Medicine said he’s also seeing indications that local mask mandates are reducing the percentage of COVID-19 virus tests that are positive. Kendrick, who is also the CEO of Oklahoma’s nonprofit health information exchange MyHealth Access Network, looked at six cities, including Oklahoma City and Tulsa, that have adopted mask ordinances. In the first seven days after a mask policy went into effect, the positivity rate dropped by 0.47%. After 14 days, the positivity rate dropped by 7.57% and by 21 days, it had decreased by 5.73%.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Coronavirus cases in Oregon have declined during the past month, but in order for schools to reopen, the average amount of new cases a day needs to decrease from 250 to 60, state health experts said Friday. In order to reach that goal, Gov. Kate Brown said residents will have to continue to follow and enforce current statewide COVID-19 safety mandates or else bars and restaurants may have to close and travel restrictions will be implemented. The Oregon Health Authority reported 259 new cases Friday as the state’s total case count rose to 24,421. The death toll is 414. Dean Sidelinger, the state’s epidemiologist, said that since July, transmission of the deadly virus has slowed. Hospitalizations also declined last week, from 143 to 115. The percentage of positive tests has leveled off too – remaining at 5.4%. In June, Brown issued an executive order that allowed in-person learning at public and private K-12 schools only if it they met guidance issued by the Oregon Health Authority and Oregon Department of Education. One of the guidelines requires a statewide and a county-wide testing positivity rate of 5% or less, as well as 10 or fewer new cases for every 100,000 people in the county where the school is located.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPottsville: U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser has said he is postponing public events after testing positive for the coronavirus. Meuser, a Republican, said he is following guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and working from home in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. “I am thankful to God that my grown children were not at home and that my wife Shelley has tested negative,” said the congressman, who represents a portion of east-central Pennsylvania, in a statement. Meuser said because of the quarantine he will not be voting on the bill regarding postal services but would have voted against the measure, saying calls to direct $25 billion to the postal service “are not reflective of the data or the reality of the situation.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s arts sector lost more than 10,000 jobs and more than $436 million in sales from April until July as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recently issued report by The Brookings Institution. In Rhode Island and across the nation, arts venues and events were among the first to shut down and will be among the last to reopen in response to the pandemic, according to a statement Friday from Randall Rosenbaum, executive director of the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts. “This report documents how, in just four short months, the arts sector nationwide and in Rhode Island has literally ground to a halt,” he said. “Theaters and concert halls and museums were shuttered, and artists and cultural workers lost their livelihoods.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants lawmakers to simply copy and paste last year’s spending plan for the current budget year, asking state agencies to prepare for possible cuts if the economy continues to struggle amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The roughest of estimates by state economists said South Carolina might collect a little extra money in the fiscal year that started July 1. If that happens, the state should bank it until the COVID-19 uncertainty eases, McMaster told his Cabinet on Thursday. “The $1.8 billion revenue surplus we had estimated evaporated almost overnight,” McMaster said. Lawmakers said they will listen to the governor’s request, but aren’t committing to anything yet. With schools starting back, South Carolina faces a crucial point in its economic recovery and COVID-19 response. After two months of first rising COVID-19 cases, then a spike in deaths, the numbers have taken a turn downward. South Carolina is now averaging less than 800 new cases a day, the lowest level since mid-June, when a massive increase in cases experts blamed on a lack of mask rules, reopening businesses and Memorial Day parties.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Hundreds of Sioux Falls students didn’t participate in online learning last spring and all but vanished after the coronavirus pandemic drove the district to close classrooms. Keloland.com reported 700 children, or 3% of the district’s student body, never connected with their teachers during the last quarter of the year. Assistant Superintendent Teresa Boysen said the district tried to reach out to the students but never connected with them. She said phone numbers and emails changed and some students moved to different towns so they would have someone to take care of them while their parents kept working. Boysen said some students who returned have been catching up on their work in summer school. She said the district has been updating contact information in case schools have to close again this fall. “Teachers will work with the students to take their devices home, practice getting connected and this is what we have to do in case we have to jump out,” she said. School begins on Thursday.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will provide an additional $300 per week in federal assistance to people who are unemployed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced it has approved Tennessee’s request for a grant to give to people on top of their regular unemployment benefits. The Lost Wage Assistance grants have been awarded to nearly half of the states. President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this month making the money available. It was announced as a $400-per-week benefit, but put the burden on the states to pay $100 a week of that amount. The U.S. Department of Labor issued recent guidance saying states would not have to contribute that money. Trump’s order came after a $600-per-week federal unemployment benefit expired at the end of July, without a new bill for pandemic relief being reached.\n\nTexas\n\nBrownsville: Efforts by officials in Cameron County to delay the start of in-person classes because of the coronavirus pandemic could face a legal challenge on claims of religious freedom. The county, which has been one of the many COVID-19 hot spots in South Texas in recent months, has delayed in-person classes at public and private K-12 schools until after Sept. 28. But attorneys for two private religious schools have told the county that the order is unlawful and goes against Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s June 26 executive order superseding the authority of local governments to issue orders aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus if they conflict with the governor’s own orders, the Brownsville Herald reported. Laguna Madre Christian Academy in Laguna Vista and Calvary Christian School of Excellence in Harlingen plan to open for face-to-face classes on Aug. 31 and Sept. 8, respectively. Last month, Abbott said Texas counties don’t have the power to preemptively shut down campuses to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Abbott said that power rests with local school boards and state education officials. Jeremy Dys, an attorney with Plano-based First Liberty, which represents the two schools, told officials in a letter that “any effort by Cameron County to enforce its unlawful order … will be viewed as an affront to the religious liberty of (the two schools) and met with the strictest legal defense.” Daniel N. Lopez, an attorney for Cameron County, said in an Aug. 20 letter that officials were not opposed to granting Laguna Madre Christian Academy an exemption because the school is small and it came up with a plan that meets state guidelines for reopening. But Calvary Christian School is larger and its reopening plan was still being reviewed, officials said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The annual Christmas concert by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ choir has been canceled because of lingering concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. It will the first time since the holiday concert began in 1974 that the show has been canceled, said Kim Farah, a spokeswoman for the Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square. The cancellation announced Friday by church officials is the latest sign that disruptions to normal religious activity will continue through the holidays. The Utah-based faith previously announced it would hold its twice-yearly signature conference in October without in-person audience as it did at the April conference. The faith has limited activities at temples and allowed regular Sunday worship services to resume only where it’s allowed under local government rules and without safety measures. It’s missionary program has shifted to focusing on online faith outreach. The Christmas concert that has been canceled usually brings brings thousands to the faith’s 20,000-seat auditorium in Salt Lake City and features guest performers such as Broadway star Kelli O’Hara and actor Richard Thomas. It has been held for decades without disruption. The choir, previously known as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, also announced the cancellation of two other fall concerts and auditions.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has extended until the new year its emergency rules for how courts operate in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The judicial emergency declared in March means that jury trials are not being held and many court hearings are taking place online or over the phone, the court said. People must go through a health screening before entering a courthouse, wear a facial covering and stay at least 6 feet away from others. “The Court has extended the judicial emergency to January 1, 2021 in recognition of the fact that the ongoing and dynamic nature of the pandemic will continue to impact court operations and to require changes to court operations and rules,” the Vermont Supreme Court said when it announced the extension last week. The court also made changes to allow individuals participating in proceedings other than hearings access to court buildings.\n\nVirginia\n\nSalem: Roanoke College said it has removed six students for violating the student conduct code after three positive tests for COVID-19 that might have been related to an off-campus party. The Roanoke Times reported that four students have tested positive for the disease caused by the coronavirus. The first was tested last weekend, as students began to move in, and the student had withdrawn from classes before the test result came back. The other three have been moved to an isolation area on campus. Others who might have been exposed to them are quarantining in their rooms, and people they might have been in contact with have been notified, the college said. Online classes at the private college began Wednesday. Students continue to filter into residences in a phased plan the college announced earlier this summer. Classes are supposed to transition to mostly in-person instruction by Sept. 7. The Roanoke College announcement follows actions by Virginia Tech and Radford University. Virginia Tech suspended seven students Thursday after being alerted to large gatherings of students off campus. Radford suspended three students for failure to comply with that university’s COVID-19 safety measures.\n\nWashington\n\nPullman: The athletes weren’t the only ones affected when Washington State University’s fall football season was canceled by the coronavirus pandemic. Merchants in Pullman who depend on big football crowds said they are losing a major chunk of their annual income. Pullman, the most remote outpost in the Pac-12, has only 34,000 residents. Many businesses in town depend on visitors attracted by football games, graduation and other special events. The pandemic has led to the cancellation of many of those events, including seven home football games that annually provide a lifeline to hotels, restaurants and other retailers. Of Pullman’s 34,000 residents, about 20,000 are Washington State students and many of the rest are faculty and staff. Without the college, Pullman would be another small farm town amid the rolling hills of the fertile wheat country known as the Palouse.“We expect to be down 50 to 60% in annual sales this year,” said Bob Cady, owner of the Cougar Cottage, an iconic bar and restaurant in Pullman close to Martin Stadium, where the Cougars play their home football games. The cancellation of Mom’s weekend and graduation ceremonies last spring, and the recent decision by the Pac-12 to postpone the football season to next year at the earliest will devastate business at what is popularly called The Coug, Cady said. In reality, Cady has long expected the football season to be canceled.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: Attendance at West Virginia high school football games will be limited to family members of players and coaches during the first few weeks of the season. The Secondary School Activities Commission released guidelines Friday for sports competitions and extracurricular activities. The guidelines are based on the state’s color-coded reentry map for public schools during the coronavirus pandemic. The map uses four colors to classify the opening status of each of the 55 county school systems based on virus transmission rates. The system will be used during the first two weeks of the football season, which starts on Sept. 3. Immediate household family members will be allowed into football games involving counties in the green category, and only parents and guardians can attend games in counties in the yellow category. No games are allowed if a county is in the orange or red category.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:A deputy with the Dane County Sheriff’s Office who is believed to have contracted the coronavirus while on duty has died. Sheriff David Mahoney said in a statement that Richard “Rick” Treadwell is believed to be Wisconsin’s first law enforcement officer to die from the virus after contracting it while on duty. The Journal Sentinel reported Treadwell had been with the department since 1995 and worked as a recruiter and instructor. The statement did not provide specifics but said “all evidence” indicated Treadwell contracted the virus while on duty. His body was escorted from a hospital Saturday to a funeral home by a law enforcement procession. He leaves behind a wife and three adult children. Funeral arrangements are pending.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming reported 61 confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, officials said. The university tested more than 10,000 students and staffers ahead of the fall semester, which is scheduled to begin on Monday. Out of the 61 confirmed cases, 46 are still active as of Thursday and 15 people have recovered. Two of the 46 active cases are students who were living in dorms. They have since been isolated. Other students who were in close contact with the infected students are now required to quarantine for 14 days. Eight of the active cases are university employees who live off campus. The final 36 of the active cases are students who live off campus, many of whom officials said do not live in Laramie. School officials had initially planned to begin in-person classes immediately, but they decided last week that only some in-person education would start on Monday. The school said it plans on having all students returning on campus for in-person instruction by Sept. 28. The school plans to test all students and employees twice a week until then. “As we have seen across the country, many of our peers are having to pivot to online environments because of infection outbreaks,” university President Ed Seidel said in a statement. “We believe we have one of the best programs in the nation to monitor and intervene to limit the virus spread, so we can continue to offer a strong on-campus program.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/28/prairie-power-beer-pig-bystander-honor-news-around-states/50782545/", "title": "Prairie power, beer pig, bystander honor: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A coastal environmental group filed suit Monday trying to block a decision by Alabama Power Co. to leave millions of tons of coal ash along a riverside in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, where opponents say a spill could devastate a huge ecosystem. The federal lawsuit by Mobile Baykeeper was filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center, which announced plans to sue the electrical utility in July. The group wants to force Alabama Power to give up what it contends is an illegal plan to permanently leave more than 21 million tons of coal ash in an unlined pit at Plant Barry, located north of Mobile along the Mobile River. Environmentalists argue the ash pond is polluting groundwater and could destroy a verdant, biologically diverse region should it be breached by heavy flooding, a hurricane or some other disaster. “Plant Barry is the only coal ash lagoon of a major utility left in a low-lying coastal area of the Southeast that is not already cleaned up or on track to be recycled or removed to safe storage, away from waterways,” Barry Brock, director of the law center’s Alabama office, said in a statement. Alabama Power declined to comment on the lawsuit. Plant Barry opened in 1965 about 25 miles north of Mobile. The company contends moving the material farther away from the plant site would pose a hazard in itself.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A U.S. Coast Guard ship on routine patrol in the Bering Sea came across a guided missile cruiser from China, officials said Monday. But it turned out the cruiser wasn’t alone as it sailed about 86 miles north of Alaska’s Kiska Island on Sept. 19. The patrol boat, known as a cutter called Kimball, later discovered there were two other Chinese naval ships and four Russian naval vessels, including a destroyer, all in single formation. The Honolulu-based Kimball, a 418-foot vessel, observed as the ships broke formation and dispersed. A C-130 Hercules provided air support for the Kimball from the Coast Guard station in Kodiak. “While the formation has operated in accordance with international rules and norms, we will meet presence with presence to ensure there are no disruptions to U.S. interests in the maritime environment around Alaska,” Rear Adm. Nathan Moore, Seventeenth Coast Guard District commander said. The Coast Guard said Operation Frontier Sentinel guidelines call for meeting “presence with presence” when strategic competitors operate in and around U.S. waters. The Kimball will continue to monitor the area. The Chinese and Russian formation came a month after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned about China’s interest in the Arctic and Russia’s military buildup there.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A massive expansion of the state’s private school voucher system will likely go into effect after public school advocates failed to gather enough signatures to block the law, a conservative think tank that supports the expansion said Monday. The Goldwater Institute, a conservative and libertarian public policy think tank in Phoenix, said Save Our Schools Arizona “submitted just 88,866 signatures, according to petition sheets made available by the Secretary of State’s office.” That’s “significantly short of the requisite 118,843 signatures needed to overturn the reform via ballot referendum.” Although Save Our Schools Arizona said it “will await accurate numbers” from the Secretary of State’s office regarding its challenge to the law, the head of the grassroots group acknowledged it’s probably well below the threshold. Monday’s developments appear to be a major victory for “school choice” advocates in Arizona and across the nation who argue that parents should be able to use public tax dollars to send their children to schools that best serve their needs. Voucher opponents say they drain money from long-underfunded public schools that serve the vast majority of children, sending public money to unaccountable private and religious schools and mainly benefiting the wealthy.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Deer season for archery is underway in western Arkansas, though drought may have affected the population and growth of deer this summer. A healthy population of deer and bear has been noted by those in the field during the opening days since the season began Saturday. Lack of vegetation can affect growth of deer during a drought. Young bucks may have smaller antlers, wildlife experts say, should the drought persist. That has not been the case in Arkansas this year. But the deer harvest this year in western Arkansas should be strong because the drought did not start until mid- to late June, said Ralph Meeker, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission’s statewide deer program coordinator. The does were able to produce enough milk for fawns that can adapt. The number of deer harvested could increase because visibility increases for hunters when drought causes foliage to die off, taking away the cover for the deer. But the deer so far are healthy, Meeker said. Antler growth has not been affected, he has observed. “Whitetail deer are a very adaptable species,” Meeker said. “We had a good growing season before the drought started in mid to late June. Fawn production was phenomenal.” The bear population – for which archery season is underway – has also reportedly increased this year in western Arkansas.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Beyond what they learn academically in kindergarten, students learn everyday routines: how to take care of class materials and how to be kind to their peers, according to Golden Empire Elementary School kindergarten teacher Carla Randazzo. And nearly two-thirds of students at the Sacramento school are English learners. “Those kids just start out having to climb uphill,” she said. “They need a lot of support to be successful.” Randazzo always thought it was “peculiar” that kindergarten is not mandatory in the state. For now, though, California won’t join 20 other states with mandatory kindergarten. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, vetoed legislation Sunday night that would have required children to attend kindergarten – whether through home-schooling or public or private school – before entering first grade at a public school. As he has with other recent legislative vetoes, Newsom cited the costs associated with providing mandatory kindergarten, about $268 million annually, which he said was not accounted for in the California budget. Newsom had supported similar legislation in the past. Proponents of mandatory kindergarten say it could help close the academic opportunity gap for low-income students and students of color, as well as help children develop important social skills before the first grade. Kindergarten enrollment in California dropped nearly 12% in the 2020-21 academic year compared to the previous year, according to the state Department of Education.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A bystander who intervened during the rough arrest of an elderly woman with dementia has been recognized as the only one who “did the right thing.” Reidesel Mendoza had stopped his car to confront the police officers arresting 73-year-old Karen Garner on June 26, 2020, because “the way they were handling that situation was not the right way,” he said in an interview Sept. 17, after receiving a citizenship award for his actions that day. Garner was accused of leaving Walmart without paying for $13.88 worth of merchandise, but staff stopped her and retrieved the items before she left. Garner was walking home when Officer Austin Hopp stopped her, soon forcing Garner to the ground and trying to arrest her. Mendoza saw how Hopp and two other officers were treating Garner and decided he needed to intervene. “Do you have to use that much aggression?” Mendoza could be heard saying in Hopp’s body camera footage. Hopp told him: “Get out of here; this is not your business ... this is what happens when you fight the police.” Mendoza continued to speak up. The award was presented in part by the Community Trust Commission, formed by the Loveland City Council to aid in rebuilding trust with the community and its police department. Interim Loveland Police Chief Eric Stewart applauded Mendoza’s courage in stepping up that day and said the public plays a key role in successful policing. “We certainly didn’t do a great job that day,” Stewart said. “I’m sorry we let you down that day.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Ian Hockley testified Tuesday that he was ridiculed online as a “party boy” and an actor after posting a video of the memorial service for his 6-year-old son, who was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre. Hockley is the latest family member of the 26 victims of the shooting to testify at the defamation trial of Alex Jones, in which a jury is deciding how much the conspiracy theorist must pay for spreading the lie that the shooting was a hoax. Hockley, who lost his autistic son, Dylan, in the shooting, testified that he became the target of conspiracy theorists because he smiled during what he found as an uplifting memorial service. “That is what that video started to attract is people saying this must be fake,” he said. “ ‘He’s an actor. He’s smiling. Oh, you’re out of character’ – all of those things started to appear until we took our video down.” Earlier in the trial, other victims’ relatives gave often emotional testimony describing how they endured death threats, in-person harassment and abusive comments on social media by people calling the shooting a hoax. Some moved to avoid the abuse. The jury of six will determine how much in damages Jones and Infowars’ parent company, Free Speech Systems, should pay relatives of five children and three adults killed at the school for saying the shooting didn’t happen and inflicting emotional distress. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting also is a plaintiff.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A man was killed when he was pinned beneath a truck, police said. Officers were called to Beehler Court in the Wilmington area Sunday for a report of a person hit by a vehicle, New Castle County Police said in a news release. When officers arrived, they found a 46-year-old man pinned beneath a Ford F-350 pickup truck, police said. Officers and paramedics tried to resuscitate the man, but their efforts were unsuccessful, and police said he was pronounced dead on the scene. The initial investigation revealed that the man got out of the truck while it was still in gear, and he was hit by the truck, then became pinned beneath it, police said. His body was turned over to the Delaware Division of Forensic Sciences.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: First lady Jill Biden paid tribute Friday to Jacqueline Kennedy, a predecessor 60 years ago, for her pivotal role in preventing the teardown of historic buildings on iconic Lafayette Square near the White House. Biden helped the White House Historical Association, an organization that Kennedy helped spearhead, unveil a medallion of the former first lady, designed by American artist Chas Fagan, in front of the association’s office on the square. The wife of President John F. Kennedy is widely credited with ushering in an emphasis on historic preservation at the White House during her 1,036 days as first lady. Lafayette Square, just north of the White House, over the years has become a gathering place for protesters, from suffragists in the early 20th century to Vietnam demonstrators in the 1960s to Americans speaking out for policing reform in 2020. In quieter daily times, it is a city oasis for tourists and for office workers on lunch breaks. The bas relief of Kennedy sits in a new garden at the front of the association’s office, known as Decatur House. It includes one of her best-known quotations: “The White House belongs to the American people.” Jill Biden said Kennedy worked to save the park and surrounding historic townhouses “because we all deserve to experience our rich history, the full, complex and beautiful story of who we are.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Prosecutors in the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz began their rebuttal of the defense case Tuesday by showing the jury swastikas he drew on a gun magazine and his boots, his online racism and misogyny, and his online searches for child pornography. Prosecutors are trying to show that Cruz’s murder of 17 people at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School four years ago was driven by antisocial personality disorder – commonly known as being a sociopath – and not fetal alcohol spectrum disorder as the defense contends. Cruz, 24, pleaded guilty last October to the Feb. 14, 2018, murders – the trial is only to decide whether he is sentenced to death or life without the possibility of parole. Detective Nick Masters, an online investigator, then testified about racist and sexist searches and comments Cruz made starting about eight months before the shootings. Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer only allowed prosecutors to present a fraction of the searches and comments Cruz made, saying more would be excessively prejudicial. Jurors were told Cruz wrote that “the Nazi party will rise again.” He made searches and comments using a racial slur directed against Black people. He wrote that he punched his widowed mother and called her a slur used against women. He wrote that “women are less important than a dog.” He also made comments extolling animal abuse, saying he had killed 12 cats and writing: “I am glad when animals die. It makes me happy.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State regulators began hearings Tuesday on Georgia Power Co.’s request to raise rates by 12% over the next three years, setting up clashes over how much profit the utility should earn, how much solar panel owners should be paid and how rates should be structured. The five elected members of the Public Service Commission are scheduled to decide in December on the company’s request to collect a cumulative $2.8 billion more from its 2.3 million customers beginning in January. Changes are likely before any vote. The company says it needs more money to improve the grid, retire old coal plants, acquire electricity from new sources and upgrade customer-facing computer systems. A residential customer who uses 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month pays Georgia Power an average of $128 a month now, the company has said. Under the plan, that would rise by $14.32 a month in 2023, reaching a total of $16.29 more over the three-year period. That’s nearly $200 a year more by 2025. However, electricity bills are likely to go up even more. Commissioners have already approved plans for the company to increase rates by $3.78 a month when the first of two new nuclear units being built at Plant Vogtle starts generating electricity, likely early next year. A bigger increase could follow the second new reactor coming online, possibly in 2024.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man pleaded not guilty Monday to charges he kidnapped and sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl and forced her to smoke meth. Duncan Mahi, 52, also requested a trial by jury. Judge Wendy M. DeWeese maintained bail for Mahi at $2 million and set his trial date for Feb. 7. According to an indictment filed Wednesday, Duncan forced the girl to tie up her boyfriend at a Anaehoomalu Beach in Waikoloa, put a knife to her throat and kidnapped her. He’s charged with 11 counts, including kidnapping, terroristic threatening, robbery, sexual assault and methamphetamine trafficking. If found guilty, he could face life in prison without the possibility of parole because he was convicted twice for two separate 2018 cases of terroristic threatening. Police issued an Maile Amber Alert, similar to the Amber Alert for missing children in other states, shortly after the girl’s kidnapping on Sept. 16. Police said the girl managed to get free one day later after she convinced Mahi to take her to a restaurant in Hilo to get something to eat, and people recognized her from the alert.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Universities across the state are warning staffers not to refer students to abortion providers, and at least one public university is barring employees from telling students how to obtain emergency contraception or birth control as well. It’s the latest restriction in a state that already holds some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation. “This is going to have a very broad impact,” said Mike Satz, an attorney and former faculty member and interim dean at the University of Idaho’s College of Law. “It’s going to have a very strong chilling effect on free speech, and it’s going to scare people. I’m afraid it’s going to scare people from going to school here or sending their kids to school at Idaho institutions.” The prohibition against referring students to abortion providers or “promoting” abortion in any way comes from the “No Public Funds for Abortion Act,” passed by Idaho’s Republican-led Legislature in 2021. Boise State University, like the University of Idaho, told faculty members in a newsletter earlier this month that they could face felony charges for violating the law. Idaho State University did not respond to messages asking if it had issued similar guidance. The law also bars staffers and school-based health clinics from dispensing or telling students where to obtain emergency contraception, such as the Plan B pill, except for in cases of rape.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Tuesday that the state’s relatively low jobless rate will help him keep his promise to pay off coronavirus-era debt in the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund by year’s end. The Democrat announced he will transfer $450 million from the account set aside to pay jobless benefits toward the debt that ballooned to $4.5 billion during business closures forced by COVID-19. That decreases the remaining balance of the federal loan to $1.8 billion, which Pritzker pledged will be eliminated by the new year. Illinois joined dozens of other states in borrowing money to pay unemployment claims, which in Illinois surged in spring 2020 to levels not seen since 1982. “With the COVID-19 pandemic came a disaster of a different kind,” Pritzker said at a Chicago news conference. “All across the United States, to make sure eligible individuals could get access to unemployment benefits, extraordinary measures were taken by state unemployment trust funds because nearly none … were funded enough to cover that kind of an emergency.” The General Assembly, controlled by Democrats, and Pritzker agreed last spring to use $2.7 billion in federal pandemic relief funds to more than halve the debt. Republicans argued for paying the entire balance with federal money while it was available.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Satanic Temple is suing the state on claims a near-total abortion ban violates the rights of its Hoosier members who want abortions after their birth control failed. A lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana by the Massachusetts-based religious association says it brought the lawsuit on behalf of anonymous women from Indiana who say they became pregnant by accident despite using contraceptives. Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita are listed as defendants. The new law bans abortions except in cases of rape or incest up to 10 weeks post-fertilization, when pregnancy poses a risk to the life or long-term health of the mother, or in cases of fatal fetal anomalies. Enforcement of the law was put on hold last week by a Monroe County judge who found that it may violate the Indiana Constitution. Rokita has already appealed the judge’s decision. The Satanic Temple has more than 11,300 members in Indiana, according to its lawsuit. The group “venerates, but does not worship,” the allegorical Satan as featured in the 17th-century epic poem “Paradise Lost” by John Milton. Members follow a set of tenets including the belief that a person’s body is subject to their will and their will alone, the lawsuit says, and that beliefs should “conform to one’s best scientific understanding of the world.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Cattle producer Bryan Sievers thinks the black-eyed Susans, purple coneflowers and native grasses in his eastern Iowa prairie can help warm homes and tackle water pollution, erosion and other pressing environmental problems in the state. Thanks to a five-year, $80 million federal grant, Sievers will work with Missouri business Roeslein Alternative Energy, Iowa State University and a dozen other groups to test whether U.S. farmers can make money turning prairies and manure into renewable fuel. Sievers and his partners plan to mix harvested prairie, cover crops and conservation grassland with cattle manure in an anaerobic digester to make renewable natural gas that will go into a pipeline that feeds homes and businesses or be compressed to power trucks and other vehicles. The project is one of 70 that the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently awarded $2.8 billion, a total the federal agency nearly tripled after receiving about 450 requests. The projects seek to create new carbon markets that pay farmers for work to reduce the environmental impact of commodities like corn, soybeans, beef and pork. Sievers and his partners expect their project will help pave the way for more on-farm digesters that can reduce odor from cattle, pig and other livestock operations; cut harmful methane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; and encourage farmers to plant prairies, conservation reserve grasses and annual cover crops on marginal farmland, as well as buffers along rivers, lakes and streams.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A man was sentenced Monday to 18 months in prison for his role in a hoax phone call that led police to shoot and kill an innocent man in 2017. Shane Gaskill was sentenced after pleading guilty in May to wire fraud, KSN reports. He was originally placed on probation but faced renewed prosecution after violating the terms of his probation. Prosecutors said Gaskill got into an argument in December 2017 with Ohio gamer Casey Viner over a $1.50 bet. Using an old Wichita address Gaskill had given him, Viner persuaded Tyler Barris in Los Angeles to call Wichita police and say a kidnapping and shooting had happened at the address, prosecutors said. It’s called “swatting,” a form of retaliation in which someone makes a false report to police to send first responders, including SWAT teams, to someone’s address. Andrew Finch, 28, who lived at the address, was shot and killed by police after he opened the front door to see what was going on outside. Barris was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to 51 counts of making fake emergency calls and threats around the country, including the one that led to Finch’s death. Viner served 15 months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a woman who shoplifted about $80 worth of items from a Walmart self-checkout station should not face a felony that carries five to 10 years in prison – a punishment that Attorney General Daniel Cameron defended. All seven justices instead agreed with the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which had said it was “inherently unfair to convict somebody of a class C felony for theft of goods worth $80,” and the high court sent the case back to Pulaski Circuit Court, where a jury had initially found Chasity Shirley guilty of “unlawful access to a computer.” Shirley, 34, will now likely receive a directed verdict, which would see her felony conviction dismissed in court. While shopping in 2018 at a Walmart in Somerset, Shirley pulled what retailers call a “switcheroo” by switching the bar codes from a toothbrush holder with those from a more expensive children’s rug and slipcover before checking herself out of the store. A loss-control associate caught her, and the cost difference between the item she paid for and the two items she tried to take was $80.80. She also allegedly “pushed and elbowed” a loss prevention manager as she exited the store but was later found not guilty of a fourth-degree assault charge at trial, the Kentucky Supreme Court noted.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A social services nonprofit long called the Kingsley House renamed itself Tuesday, dropping the name of a Victorian clergyman who is perhaps best remembered as the author of a children’s fantasy novel but held profoundly racist views. For 126 years it was Kingsley House, named both for author and social reformer Charles Kingsley and for the founder’s son Kingsley Warner, who died as a toddler. Now the nonprofit will be called Clover. Officials knew Charles Kingsley had been a chaplain to Queen Victoria, tutor to the boy who became King George V, and had written about 20 books. “And he was quote-unquote a social reformer who helped create the settlement house movement,” said Keith Liederman, CEO of Clover, shortly before Tuesday’s announcement. The Rev. Beverly Warner of New Orleans’ Trinity Episcopal Church founded Kingsley House in 1896 as a settlement house, an inner-city institution dedicated to fighting poverty. The organization’s programs now help children in need, families and community. Its prominence made it a stop in Democrat John Edwards’ unsuccessful campaign for president in 2007. Its community outreach was why former Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush visited there in 2006 to announce $9.7 million in grants to help victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Congressional candidates in a hotly contested race snipped at each other Tuesday about a contribution from the leader of a conservation group that has discouraged consumers from buying lobster. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is defending his seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District against Republican former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin and independent candidate Tiffany Bond. Poliquin’s campaign on Tuesday called on Golden to return a contribution of $667 from Julie Packard, the executive director of Seafood Watch. The group based at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California that Packard helped found added American and Canadian lobster to its “red list” of seafood species to avoid this summer because of the risk fishing gear poses to endangered whales. Poliquin’s camp said that listing has caused economic hardship for fishermen in Maine, where most of the nation’s domestic lobster comes to the docks. “Seafood Watch’s warning to consumers to avoid Maine lobster, on top of forty-year high inflation and fuel prices, have gouged Maine lobstermen’s paychecks,” said Roy Matthews, a Poliquin spokesperson. Golden’s campaign said he has no intention to return the money and cited Golden’s opposition to new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration whale protection regulations as evidence that he has the fishing industry’s interests at heart.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A judge granted an emergency petition Friday filed by the Maryland State Board of Elections to enable the counting of mail-in ballots earlier than they were during the state’s July primary. Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge James Bonifant granted the petition, which will allow local elections officials across the state to begin canvassing mail-in ballots on Oct. 1. Bonifant wrote that with so many mail-in ballots, local boards of election would not be able to verify the vote count within 10 days of the general election as required. “There is no doubt that the increased number of mail-in ballots will have an enormous affect on the process of this election,” Bonifant wrote in his ruling. “Mandatory deadlines will be missed if the Court takes no action.” The state elections board said the ruling provides election officials with additional time to canvass and tabulate mail-in ballots to ensure that all critical election-related deadlines established by law are met. “It also enables elections officials to return to a well-established process of canvassing mail-in ballots prior to Election Day, which was allowed in the 2020 General Election,” the board said in a statement.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: A Harwich pig that had long been overshadowed by a diva sibling has risen to celebrity status and beer label glory. A stirring portrait of Bartholomew, a 200-pound half-Julianna, half-mini pig, now graces the cans of a new offering from the Provincetown Brewing Co. The high hog honor has not affected Bart one bit. “He’s kind of like an old man in a sport coat with sneakers on,” owner Emma Bankman said. “He doesn’t care what anyone thinks.” “Bartholobrew,” billed as “a classic wheat ale with sweet, caramelly notes,” is the frothy result of a summer-long pet label contest to benefit Provincetown’s Carrie A. Seaman Animal Shelter. Sherry Brec, CASAS board president, said there were more than 65 animal entries, and the donate-to-vote system generated more than $17,000 for the no-kill facility that places dogs and cats with folks on the Outer Cape. Meanwhile, in Harwich, Bartholomew has finally eclipsed the renown of his domineering half-sister Matilda. According to Bankman, Matilda has long been the boss hog in the house and often shuts the door on Bart, leaving him outside. And Matilda even tried to nose in on Bart’s bowl of celebratory Bartholobrew, a sudsy incursion that was nipped in the bud by an alert Bankman.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: General Motors is stepping back a bit on a return-to-work policy after a backlash from salaried employees. CEO Mary Barra sent out a note to the salaried workforce Tuesday offering an apology of sorts for the timing of putting out a new policy late in the day Friday saying employees would have to return to working in the office three days a week. She said in the update that GM’s plan still will include a more regular in-person presence, but it will not implement any changes to its return-to-the-office policy this year as the company continues to listen to worker feedback. The plan still will ask employees to work in-office three days each week. “The initial letter was a notification, and the purpose of the update is to provide clarification and additional details,” GM spokeswoman Maria Raynal said Tuesday. “The timing has shifted slightly; however, the overall plan has not changed.” In Tuesday’s note sent to employees, Barra wrote: “We want to take the opportunity to address some of the questions, concerns, and misconceptions that we’ve heard. We acknowledge that the timing of the message, late on a Friday afternoon, was unfortunate. It was also unintentional.” GM will communicate more information on its plan next month, Barra said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Republicans attacked Democratic Gov. Tim Walz on Monday after a judge took the rare step of disputing the administration’s claim that the judge prevented the state from cutting off payments to Feeding Our Future, which is the target of a $250 million federal fraud case. The GOP candidates for governor, attorney general and state auditor – Scott Jensen, Jim Schultz and Ryan Wilson – said Walz and other top Democrats should have done more to stop the alleged fraud before it became what federal prosecutors last week called the largest pandemic-related fraud in the country. But the warring political sides disagree on how far Ramsey County District Judge John Guthmann went toward compelling the Minnesota Department of Education to resume payments to Feeding Our Future. A court statement issued late Friday said the judge “never issued an order” for the state to resume payments, but the department produced a hearing transcript showing the judge threatened to hold one attorney in contempt if the state failed to restore the flow of funds. The Republican candidates largely accepted the judge’s version of events. Jensen called for an independent investigation to report back before he and Walz hold their next debate Oct. 18.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The federal government wants to work with officials in the city to reach a legal agreement that ensures Jackson can sustain its water system in the future, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said Monday. Federal attorneys also sent a letter to city officials Monday threatening legal action if Jackson does not agree to negotiations related to its water system. Regan returned to Mississippi’s capital city Monday to meet with Jackson officials about the city’s troubled water system. At the meeting with Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and U.S. Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim, Regan said the federal government would work with the city to “deliver long overdue relief for Jackson residents.” “The people of Jackson, Mississippi, have lacked access to safe and reliable water for decades. After years of neglect, Jackson’s water system finally reached a breaking point this summer, leaving tens of thousands of people without any running water for weeks,” Regan said. “These conditions are unacceptable in the United States of America.” In a Monday letter sent to city officials and obtained by the news station WLBT-TV, Kim and attorneys for DOJ’s Environmental Enforcement Section said they were “prepared to file an action” against the city under the Safe Drinking Water Act but hoped the matter could be resolved through an “enforceable agreement.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: As abuse allegations mount against a Christian boarding school, the way “troubled” children are often whisked away to facilities far from home is under fire. Within what’s known as the secure transport industry, it’s called “gooning.” Brawny men show up under the cover of darkness and force a teenager into a vehicle, taking them against their will to a boarding school, foster home or treatment center. They might be restrained with handcuffs or zip ties. They could be blindfolded or hooded. Criminal charges are rare because the little-known industry is virtually unregulated. In Missouri alone, more than 100 Christian boarding schools promise hope for wayward teens. The former doctor at Agape Boarding School, in Stockton, which serves about 60 teenage boys, was charged last year with multiple counts of sexual abuse of children, and five staff members are charged with abuse. In nearby Humansville, Circle of Hope, a Christian boarding school for girls, closed amid an investigation in 2020. The husband-and-wife co-founders were charged with 99 abuse counts last year, including sexual abuse. The allegations of wrongdoing at Agape and Circle of Hope led state Rep. Keri Ingle, a Democrat, to sponsor a measure signed into law last year that requires more rigorous oversight in Missouri. Now, Ingle said she’ll seek stricter regulations on companies transporting the kids against their will.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Authorities said Tuesday that they were investigating the shooting of a 6-month-old dog by a woman who skinned the animal and posted pictures of herself with the pelt, apparently believing she had killed a young wolf. The animal was among more than a dozen dogs that local residents reported abandoned last week on national forest land in northwestern Montana near Kalispell, according to the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office. The hunter who shot one of the dogs posted images of herself smiling on social media in front of the animal’s head and hide, which were taken by the sheriff’s office and turned over to a state wildlife biologist, said Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Greg Lemon. The biologist determined the remains belonged to a domestic dog about 6 months old, Lemon said. Officials were investigating if the woman was properly licensed to hunt wolves, he said. The sheriff’s office is investigating both the shooting of the dog and the abandonment of the other dogs but declined Tuesday to release any further information. Lemon said accurately identifying animals before they are shot is a core tenet of hunting. “The vast majority of hunters are very deliberate about when they pull the trigger that the animal in their sights is the animal they are licensed to hunt,” he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: With Memorial Stadium on the cusp of its 100th anniversary, the University of Nebraska athletic department on Thursday set the stage for a massive renovation that will make the venue more fan-friendly for decades to come. University leaders also announced a new multimedia rights deal that would bring in more than $300 million over 15 years and said that alcohol would be sold at men’s and women’s basketball games at Pinnacle Bank Arena starting this season. The athletic department must get approval from the university Board of Regents, which is expected to approve the plans. The next board meeting is Friday. Nebraska is scheduled to open a $160 million football facility next year, and the Big Ten’s billion-dollar-a-year media rights deal announced this summer will bring unprecedented windfalls to league members. The announcements came less than two weeks after Nebraska began its search for a new football coach following the firing of Scott Frost. Athletic director Trev Alberts said discussions about stadium upgrades and the rights deal have been going on for months, and the timing is coincidental. The Cornhuskers have played in Memorial Stadium since 1923, and incremental improvements have been made over the years, including luxury suites in 1999 and an expansion to more than 85,000 seats in 2013.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A dolphin habitat at a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip has been temporarily closed after the third mammal death at the attraction in five months. Officials at the Mirage Secret Garden and Habitat said an 11-year-old bottlenose dolphin named K2 died Saturday. The cause of death remains unclear, but officials told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the mammal had been receiving treatment for a respiratory illness. They say Maverick, a 19-year-old bottlenose dolphin, died Sept. 2 following treatment for a lung infection, while 13-year-old Bella died in April after undergoing treatment for gastroenteritis. According to the international organization Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums’ website, a bottlenose dolphin’s life expectancy is about 28 to 29 years. Mirage interim President Franz Kallao said officials were working closely with veterinary and pathology experts to determine the cause of death for K2, who was born at the Secret Garden. “We are also working with additional outside veterinary, water quality, behavioral, animal welfare, and environmental experts to help us conduct a thorough review and inspection of both the animals and the facility,” Kallao said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: A local woman who found herself with an unexpected inheritance and the desire to “do the most good” with the money is helping to make housing for domestic abuse survivors possible. She received more than half a million dollars following the sale of real estate her late uncle’s family business owned. Knowing her family was financially comfortable and living within their means, she did something unexpected: She became an angel investor with a $500,000 investment into Dover Housing Authority-owned property. This income assures the future of the Haven at the Falls project to house domestic abuse survivors, said Ryan Crosby, executive director of the authority. The investment will serve as seed funding to build the affordable housing units. The proposed six-unit apartment development is planned in the Dover Housing Authority’s Whittier Falls neighborhood. The new project was born out of a partnership between the Dover Housing Authority and Haven, a domestic and sexual violence prevention agency. “Our angel investor is a lot like me – frustrated with how little affordable housing there is and how little there is we can do about it,” Crosby said. “This investment allows us to both make a direct, measurable impact in that fight. We both share the belief that housing is a human right.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: After months of calls to eliminate a state-mandated expensive teacher licensing test blamed for worsening the teacher shortage, Gov. Phil Murphy did away with it – sort of. The Murphy administration said the educative Teacher Performance Assessment would no longer be required in New Jersey, but it must be replaced by a similar test to be used to certify graduates. Murphy issued a conditional veto Thursday to legislation that shifts the burden of certifying teachers from the state’s shoulders to the colleges that train them. Starting in spring 2024, colleges and universities will be required to use their own tests as a final step to certify graduates before they may join the workforce. The conditional veto was welcomed by many of the state’s education-related groups, including the state superintendents’ association, teachers’ unions and school principals’ associations. Some said Murphy waited too long to make a decision about the test. The New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, welcomed the move to remove the edTPA but indicated in its statement that the decision could have come earlier and that it continues to delay teacher candidates who are otherwise ready to start working.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators are reconsidering how they evaluate complaints of sexual misconduct against colleagues, amid outrage about the handling of a complaint against an influential senator. A panel of leading lawmakers met Monday to discuss possible changes to ground rules for harassment investigations at the Legislature. “It has become clear that our anti-harassment policy is not working,” said Democratic state Rep. Daymon Ely of Corrales, co-chairman of a legislative ethics committee. “This is intended to start a discussion.” Harassment complaints against lawmakers are often assigned for an initial investigation to a panel of four legislators, which may deadlock on a 2-2 vote. Ely proposed the changes that would assign an outside expert to break any tie vote, with public notice of the outcome. Ely outlined proposals that would remove secrecy provisions that currently prevent people who complain of harassment by legislators from publicly discussing any investigation that has been dismissed without a finding of probable cause. “How do we fix that so that we have closure for those people?” said Democratic Sen. George Muñoz, of Gallup. “It can’t come out in a tie. There has to be closure for both sides.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State investigators have substantiated more than 1,600 instances of corporal punishment in New York schools over the past five years, The Times Union in Albany reports. A substantial number of the complaints were in New York City public schools, according to the newspaper. Other incidents included a substitute teacher in Watertown who was fired and arrested for grabbing a student by the throat and forcing him against a wall and a teaching assistant in Syracuse who was transferred and retrained for spanking a nonverbal student. Corporal punishment is generally banned and can be classified as child abuse. In all, the state Education Department documented nearly 18,000 complaints of corporal punishment in public and charter schools from 2016 through 2021, according to the Times Union. The newspaper said it found that school districts have underreported cases of corporal punishment to the federal government and that state Education Department records are not readily available to the public.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Four people pleaded guilty Monday to misdemeanors for their roles in absentee ballot fraud in rural North Carolina during the 2016 and 2018 elections. The convictions stemmed from an investigation that in part resulted in a do-over congressional election. Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway accepted the plea agreements, which resulted in no active prison or jail time, in Wake County court. Cases against six other defendants remained pending, with hearings scheduled through the end of next month, Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said. All 10 defendants, according to indictments handed up in 2019, had a common involvement with Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., a longtime political operative in rural Bladen County. Dowless also was indicted on more than a dozen state charges, with his case scheduled last year to go to trial last month. He rejected a plea agreement and looked forward to his day in court, according to a friend. But he died in April after being diagnosed with lung cancer. Freeman said at the time that the prosecution of the other cases would continue. Dowless worked in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris, who appeared to have received the most votes in the general election for the 9th District seat in south-central North Carolina. But allegations against Dowless surfaced, and testimony and other information revealed at a State Board of Elections hearing described him running an illegal “ballot harvesting” operation.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A prison guard was fired over the suicide of a man who was serving life sentences for killing four people. Sgt. Deandre Adams violated corrections policy in failing to adequately check on Chad Isaak, according to a termination letter from the warden at North Dakota State Penitentiary. Adams was fired Thursday. Warden James Sayler noted that Adams had received two previous written reprimands, for failing to report that he had left a missing inmate in a recreational area and for not intervening when two prisoners were potentially exchanging contraband, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “Your credibility, professionalism, and the trust I had in you as a sergeant are irreparably damaged,” Sayler wrote. “This level of trust, which is expected of every team member, is something I no longer have in you, due to your misconduct.” Isaak, 48, died July 31. An investigative report from the state Highway Patrol released last month found that Adams said he failed to adequately check on Isaak twice. It also said Isaak had covered his cell with cardboard. Adams knew inmates were not allowed to cover their cell windows but allowed it as a “courtesy in case they were naked in their cells,” the report said. “He stated they could enforce it but that they would just get more window coverings.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state has officially signed off on its biggest package of incentives tied to job creation – potentially totaling as much as $650 million over 30 years for Intel for its $20 billion investment in Licking County. The Ohio Tax Credit Authority on Monday approved the incentive package, one of six projects the panel approved. As is the case with most projects that come before the authority, there was little discussion about the Intel project before the four members approved it. The $650 million approved Monday is part of a total incentive package from Ohio to Intel that is expected to top $2 billion. Unlike the other state incentives for Intel, the one approved by the authority is based on how many jobs it creates. The incentive begins in 2024; Intel has said in anticipates production of semiconductors to begin in 2025. Intel announced in January its plan to create 3,000 jobs as part of its $20 billion investment in New Albany, the biggest single economic development project in state history. Those jobs will have an annual payroll of $405 million, according to Intel. Intel has said it expects to start recruiting this fall from college campus as it anticipates ramping up hiring in advance of the opening of the two plants.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-1 Tuesday to deny clemency for a man sentenced to die for killing his 9-month-old daughter in 2002, moving him a step closer to his scheduled lethal injection next month. Attorneys for Benjamin Cole, 57, did not dispute that Cole killed Brianna Cole by forcibly bending the infant backward, breaking her spine and tearing her aorta, but they argued that he both is severely mentally ill and has a growing lesion on his brain that has continued to worsen while he has been in prison. Cole has refused medical attention and ignored his personal hygiene, hoarding food and living in a darkened cell with little to no communication with staff or fellow prisoners, his attorneys told the panel. “His condition has continued to decline over the course of this year,” Cole’s attorney Katrina Conrad-Legler said. The lesion on Cole’s brain, which is separate from his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, has grown in size in recent years and affects the part of his brain that deals with problem-solving, movement and social interaction, Conrad-Legler said. Cole declined to speak to the panel. Attorneys for the state and members of the victim’s family told the board that Cole’s symptoms of mental illness are exaggerated and that the brutal nature of his daughter’s killing merits his execution.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two ships that have been abandoned in the Columbia River for years are being removed, and the U.S. Coast Guard is working with state agencies to clean up the fuel and oil that leaked from the vessels. The ships – a Navy tug called the Sakarissa and a Coast Guard cutter called the Alert – first arrived in Portland in 2006 and were brought near Hayden Island in hopes that they could be turned into a museum. But the funding for that project dried up, and they have been abandoned for more than a decade.Both of the ships sunk two years ago. Bill Ryan with the Oregon Department of State Lands said it’s not yet clear why the Alert sunk, but the Sakarissa foundered after someone salvaging metal cut through a pipe, causing it to flood. The Coast Guard raised the 100-foot Sakarissa from the river last week and towed it to a repair service to remove the remaining oil waste from the ship. Metro Council, a regional government agency that serves three counties in northwest Oregon, is spending $2 million to have the ships removed, and the Coast Guard is spending more than $1 million to clean up. The state estimates that there are more than 300 vessels abandoned around Oregon. Removing them all would cost an estimated $40 million.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney signed an executive order Tuesday banning guns and deadly weapons from the city’s indoor and outdoor recreation spaces, including parks, basketball courts and pools. The order is the latest attempt by Philadelphia officials to regulate guns inside city limits – something made difficult by Pennsylvania’s preemption law that bars municipalities from enacting or enforcing their own stricter gun regulations. Attorneys for the city said the executive order is the city managing its facilities as a property owner, making it different from previous legislation passed by the City Council and struck down in court. The ceremonial signing also comes the day after Kenney spoke at the funeral for Tiffany Fletcher, a 41-year-old mother of three, who was struck and killed by crossfire earlier this month outside of the city recreation center where she worked. A 14-year-old, who was firing at another group of teens, has since been charged in Fletcher’s shooting death. “I watched (parks and recreation workers) yesterday line up on Lehigh Avenue like police officers burying one of their own. … I saw what I usually see when a police officer or firefighter dies in the line of duty. They were all out there lined up like they were on the front line, and they are,” Kenney said, fighting back his emotions.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBarrington: The owner of the historic Belton Court mansion has applied to demolish the deteriorating buildings on the 37-acre property. While the demolition permit has not been granted, there is little Barrington can do to prevent issuing the demolition permit once all the requirements are met, including such items as a plan to dispose of asbestos. Barrington Town Manager Phil Hervey said the mansion, once occupied by the Zion Bible College, was the centerpiece of the town’s 2016 master plan, as well as zoning rules passed specifically for the property that would allow it to become age-restricted housing. He is trying to set up a meeting with the project’s managers to discuss the demolition, but no date has been set. “We cannot prevent the teardown,” Hervey said. “If it meets the technical requirements, I don’t see any way to not issue it at a certain point.” The property has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976. It was once an 800-acre estate, the country house of Frederick Peck, designed by the Providence architecture firm Martin & Hall. The property is owned by a Chinese investor and holdings company who bought it atpublic auction in 2011 for $3.85 million after town officials backed out of a plan to purchase it from the Zion Bible Institute for $5.2 million. Barrington College occupied the campus in the 1950s until it was bought in 1985 by the Zion Bible Institute, which vacated the property in 2007.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservative lawmakers voted Tuesday not to make changes to the state’s abortion laws after this summer’s U.S. Supreme Court decision, meaning rules on abortion likely will not become more restrictive. South Carolina was for decades at the forefront of passing more restrictive abortion laws that challenged Roe v. Wade, before the landmark case was overturned this summer. But the state that helped lead the nation through requiring ultrasounds, parental consent and 24-hour waiting periods before abortions is at an impasse during a special session. The Senate could only muster enough votes to tweak South Carolina’s current six-week ban – which isn’t even in effect at the moment because of a state Supreme Court challenge. The House started its session Tuesday by rejecting a proposal by Democratic Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter to have the right to abortion placed before voters in a constitutional amendment. “Why are you afraid to let the people decide?” Cobb-Hunter asked. “Are you afraid you are going to be proven wrong? I think that’s it.” The rejection of the Senate’s version allows a group of three lawmakers from each chamber to work on a compromise between the Senate bill and the House version, which banned almost all abortions with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest or that threaten the life of the mother up to 12 weeks after conception.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: For the first time this year, anthrax, a serious bacterial disease, has been found in a herd of livestock in western South Dakota. State Veterinarian Dr. Beth Thompson confirmed the presence of the disease in a press release from the South Dakota Animal Industry Board on Tuesday. The disease was found in several deceased cows that belonged to a herd of 160 unvaccinated cattle in Meade County. South Dakota State University’s animal disease laboratory confirmed the disease from samples submitted over the weekend. Anthrax is a pervasive disease that can devastate herds of livestock in a short amount of time, “and much of South Dakota has the potential of experiencing an outbreak,” Thompson said in the release. Cattle that catch anthrax may sudden perish without any visible symptoms. Russ Daly, state public health veterinarian with SDSU, said the general public is not at risk of infection, but farmers need to avoid making direct skin contact with carcasses containing anthrax. Drought, floods and winds can spread anthrax spores to grazing livestock. Spores can also persist indefinitely in contaminated soil and may vegetate in grazeland, which could further spread the infection among South Dakota’s cattle.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s textbook commission may need additional staff and its own attorney to deal with the aftermath of a new, controversial Tennessee law requiring schools to catalog and publicize a list of all available library and classroom materials. Textbook and Instructional Materials Quality Commission chair Linda Cash told a legislative subcommittee on Tuesday the law has added a lot of work “to people who already have a full load.” Cash suggested the commission should have an independent attorney who can answer commission questions, as the commission is currently seeking legal answers from the Tennessee Attorney General’s Office. “The way that we’re designed currently, it’s hard to get an opinion,” Cash said. The commission faces a Dec. 1 deadline to issue statewide guidance on the library materials law, which the General Assembly passed this year in response to pushback from conservatives alleging students were being exposed to “inappropriate” school materials. The commission must provide schools’ guidance on determining what is age-appropriate, which is not settled in state law, in addition to establishing an appeals process for local decisions on contested materials.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton ran out of his house and jumped into a truck driven by his wife, a state senator, to avoid being served a subpoena to testify Tuesday in an abortion access case, according to court documents. A process server wrote in an affidavit that he was attempting to deliver the federal court subpoena Monday at Paxton’s home and ultimately had to leave the document on the ground. He said the Republican avoided him for more than an hour from inside his house, then dashed toward the truck, and the couple drove off. Paxton, who is facing a variety of legal troubles as he seeks to win a third term in November, said he avoided the server out of safety concerns and said the news media should be ashamed for reporting on what happened. “It’s clear that the media wants to drum up another controversy involving my work as Attorney General, so they’re attacking me for having the audacity to avoid a stranger lingering outside my home and showing concern about the safety and well-being of my family,” Paxton wrote on Twitter on Monday night. On Tuesday, a judge hearing the lawsuit by nonprofit groups that want to help Texans pay for abortions out of state granted Paxton’s request to quash the subpoena.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: State wildlife officers are launching a new drone team to help prevent vandalism and provide law enforcement on public lands. Five Division of Wildlife Resources officers completed various licensing and training requirements with the Federal Aviation Administration to become certified law enforcement drone operators and staff the first Unmanned Aerial Systems team. “Using drones will help us more effectively solve wildlife crimes, and having trained law enforcement drone pilots will also allow us to assist other law enforcement agencies with search-and-rescue efforts or any other investigations,” DWR Captain Wade Hovinga said. The specialized drone officers function similarly to a K-9 officer team, called in to help with situations like search-and-rescue operations, searching for evidence of illegally taken wildlife, assisting biologists with wildlife surveys and investigating hunting-related shooting incidents. “Utah conservation officers are public servants, and these new tools will help us better serve the public, whether we’re solving poaching crimes or locating lost hunters,” Hovinga said. DWR officers patrol Utah’s mountains, lakes and unpopulated areas, often on foot or on off-road vehicles or even on horseback, investigating wildlife-related violations.\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: A student at a military college who sued top Pentagon officials after he was deemed unfit for service because he tested positive for HIV has settled his lawsuit and plans to pursue his dream of becoming an Army officer, his lawyers said Tuesday. “I am incredibly grateful to be back on track to obtain a contract with the ROTC and then commission as an officer,” Eddie Diaz, a student at Norwich University, said in a statement released by Lawyers for Civil Rights. “I just want an opportunity to serve my country, and I believe that should be available to all eligible Americans.” The plaintiff in the lawsuit filed in Burlington in May was listed as John Doe, but Diaz is now using his real name publicly. Diaz, 21, of Revere, Massachusetts, said in the complaint that he tested positive for HIV in October 2020 during his sophomore year at Norwich, the nation’s oldest private military college. He was deemed unfit for service and dropped from the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps and the Vermont National Guard in violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal law despite being “healthy, asymptomatic and on a treatment regimen that renders his viral load undetectable,” according to the suit. Military officials never asked him how he manages his HIV or spoke to his treating physician, and he was never examined by a military doctor, the suit said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The Albemarle-Charlottesville Historical Society is creating a database with the information it has uncovered about enslaved people in the area so descendants can make connections. The goal is to allow descendants’ voices to guide the process for creating some kind of memorial for the site, The Daily Progress reports. Charlottesville native Diane Brown Townes knew some of her family history from records kept in an old tattered family Bible passed down for generations, and she knew she had ancestors who were enslaved in the region. But until recently, she had no idea some of her people may be buried in unmarked graves in a city park she’d spent lots of time in over the years or that she’s been living next door to relatives without knowing it. The Charlottesville officials believe there are at least 43 enslaved people buried at Pen Park in unmarked graves. The graves are adjacent to a cemetery belonging to the Gilmer family, which owned a tobacco plantation on the land where the city-owned park and golf course are today. The Albemarle-Charlottesville Historical Society started researching the probable identities of the people buried in the park last year. Members have been able to identify and connect with several area residents likely to have ancestors buried in the park. “For me, it’s finally being able to understand your feeling, a sense of being. I really never felt connected to history. I was always taught dates from a more white, patriarchal perspective,” Townes said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The National Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Navy have started efforts to recover the wreckage of a floatplane that crashed in the Puget Sound earlier this month, killing all 10 people on board. A barge that’s been equipped to conduct the recovery entered the shipping channel Monday, KING-5 News reports. It was expected to drop anchors near the suspected wreckage location before a team arrived at the barge Tuesday. The U.S. Navy will use a remotely operated vehicle Deep Drone 8,000, a barge and a crane in recovery efforts. The remotely operated vehicle will collect smaller pieces of wreckage into baskets for the crane to lift, the NTSB said. Some items from the plane have already been recovered, including foam fragments, a seat cushion, a seat belt, dispatch paperwork, flooring structure remnants and some personal items belonging to the victims, according to the NTSB. The plane was traveling from Friday Harbor on San Juan Island to the Seattle suburb of Renton when it crashed Sept. 4. Only one body was found, identified as Gabby Hanna, of Seattle. Officials say determining the probable cause of the crash could take 12 to 24 months.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A protester who was forcefully removed from the House of Delegates gallery after allegedly disrupting debate on a bill to ban abortion earlier this month was arrested more than a week after she and others rallied against the ban at the state Capitol. Lindsey Jacobs, a 38-year-old lawyer from Morgantown, was arrested Friday and charged with three misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, willful disruption of governmental processes, and disorderly conduct against “the peace and dignity of the state,” according to a copy of the arrest warrant. Jacobs, who runs advocacy programs for a nonprofit legal services organization, was removed from the House chamber’s gallery Sept. 13 while listening to lawmakers discuss legislation that bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with few exceptions. Republican Del. Margitta Mazzocchi said people who want to protect against pregnancy can buy emergency contraceptives – known as “Plan B” pills – over the counter. “Not if you’re poor,” Jacobs shouted down at lawmakers, followed by shouts from others sitting in the gallery. Jacobs said she became frustrated listening to Mazzocchi’s speech because she felt like the lawmaker was overlooking that the pills cost between $40 and $50, an amount she said is “cost-prohibitive for a lot of people.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: All records from the closed Republican-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election in the state are being uploaded to a website “for all to see,” an attorney told a judge Tuesday. The investigation was led by former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who was fired in August by Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. He fired Gableman just days after Vos won his primary over an opponent whom Gableman and ex-President Donald Trump endorsed. But the office Gableman led still exists after he was fired. American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, has filed four open records lawsuits against Gableman, Vos and the office seeking records created during the investigation. On Tuesday, during a hearing over a lawsuit American Oversight filed seeking to stop the deletion of records, attorney James Bopp said that all electronic and paper records from the office have been turned over to the Assembly chief clerk’s office. The files are being uploaded to a website that will soon be available “for all to see,” said Bopp, who represents the office, which he said has no employees. Hundreds of pages of documents have already been made public as the result of other American Oversight lawsuits. Bopp said the data yet-to-be made public that’s being processed now includes text messages on cellphones used in the course of the investigation.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Gov. Mark Gordon plans to propose spending $25 million in federal pandemic relief on affordable housing projects, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The governor’s office plans to submit its proposal to a legislative committee for a grant program aimed at funding “shovel-ready” projects with the American Rescue Plan Act money, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/14/malcolm-country-benefit-show-rising-tide-news-around-states/50734257/", "title": "Malcolm X, country benefit show: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state told a federal judge that it could soon be ready to use a new, untried execution method called nitrogen hypoxia to carry out a death sentence. The disclosure came Monday at a court hearing over inmate Alan Miller’s request to block his scheduled Sept. 22 execution by lethal injection. Miller maintains that prison staff lost paperwork he returned in 2018 requesting nitrogen hypoxia, an execution method that the state has authorized but never used. U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr. asked whether Alabama was ready to carry out executions by nitrogen hypoxia. James Houts, a deputy state attorney general, said the method could be available as soon as next week. He said, however, that a final decision on when to use the new method would be up to Corrections Commissioner John Hamm. The Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment about the status of the proposed new execution method. Nitrogen hypoxia, which is supposed to cause death by replacing oxygen with nitrogen, has been authorized by Alabama and two other states for executions but has never used by a state. Huffaker noted the “high stakes” involved with a looming execution date but did not immediately rule on the request to block the lethal injection.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker that ran aground more than three decades ago, causing one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history, has died, the New York Times reports. He was 75. He died in July after struggling with COVID-19 and cancer, his nephew Sam Hazelwood told the newspaper. The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, grounded on Alaska’s Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the rich fishing waters of Prince William Sound. Currents and storms carried the crude over 1,200 miles of Alaska coastline. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council estimates the spill killed a quarter-million seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, up to 22 killer whales and billions of fish eggs. It took years for the fish numbers to rebound following the spill, and oil can still be found under the surface of some beaches in Prince William Sound. Hazelwood, whom prosecutors accused of being drunk when the tanker grounded, was the only crew member criminally charged after the spill. He had left a third mate in control of the ship while he went below to do paperwork. Hazelwood was accused of one felony, criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors – reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.\n\nArizona\n\nLees Ferry: The National Park Service will poison a Colorado River side channel below Glen Canyon Dam to remove fish that threaten native species, the agency announced. Meanwhile, biologists warn, rising temperatures and declining oxygen levels in water the dam releases into the river’s Lees Ferry stretch are stressing the popular trout fishery there. Nonnative smallmouth bass are known to have passed through the dam’s hydropower-generating turbines for several years to reach the Lees Ferry area, but their successful breeding at that stretch was not documented until this year. If it continues, agency officials fear, bass could establish themselves far downstream and eat humpback chubs, which are protected as a threatened species. “Threats to the native fish are increasing due to the warmer temperatures of water passing through the dam and related increased river temperatures below the dam,” said a statement released by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which includes the river segment. The park service announced it will treat the slough with the fish killer rotenone Saturday and Sunday. While the plant-derived chemical is commonly used by fish managers, and the park service said it will carefully protect the environment and human health by isolating it in the slough, at least one Native American tribe with cultural links to the river and Grand Canyon has objected. The Zuni Pueblo of New Mexico consider the river and canyon sacred.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Jason Andrew Vineyard, a Sebastian County Election Commission chairman, has a felony conviction that makes him ineligible to vote and has reportedly been removed from the position. Sebastian County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue said Monday that Vineyard, 43, a Republican, has a 2003 felony conviction. Shue sent a letter to Sharon Brooks, Sebastian County Clerk, notifying the office that Vineyard is ineligible to vote, despite the fact he had continued to cast ballots in elections since his conviction. The letter says that Shue was responding to a recent request from Brooks on whether Vineyard is ineligible to vote. Lee Webb, Democrat election commissioner, said Monday that he was not aware if Vineyard had been removed as chairman. Either the Circuit Court or the Sebastian County Republican Party could remove Vineyard. But Larry Bishop, chairman of the Sebastian County Republican Committee, told reporters Vineyard had been removed from the commission Monday. “It is part of a long list of stuff that has been going on the last few months,” Webb said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom wants voters to reject a new tax on rich people that would pay for more electric vehicles in the nation’s most populous state, warning in a new statewide TV ad that a measure on the ballot this November won’t help the environment but is instead “one company’s cynical scheme to grab a huge taxpayer subsidy.” Proposition 30 would raise taxes on people who make more than $2 million per year. It would generate up to $5 billion in new tax money each year, most of which would go to programs that help people buy electric cars and install charging stations. A smaller amount would go to wildfire prevention response and prevention programs. The ballot measure’s campaign is paid for by the ride-hailing company Lyft. Last year, state regulators ordered companies like Lyft to make sure nearly all their rides are in electric vehicles by 2030. Newsom says the ballot measure is Lyft’s attempt to make taxpayers pay for that. “Don’t be fooled. Prop 30’s been advertised as a climate initiative. But in reality, it was devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company,” Newsom says in the ad, which will air in all of the state’s major media markets. “Put simply, Prop 30 is a Trojan horse that puts corporate welfare above the fiscal welfare of our entire state.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Police who shot a 22-year-old man after he called 911 for roadside assistance escalated the situation, needlessly leading to his death, the man’s relatives said in a tearful news conference Tuesday in which they called for accountability. After Christian Glass’ June 11 death in the small mountain town of Silver Plume west of Denver, the Clear Creek County Sheriff’s office issued a news release saying Glass was shot after he became “argumentative and uncooperative” and tried to stab an officer when police broke a car window to grab him. “Christian was experiencing a crisis, and he called 911 for help,” said the parents’ attorney, Siddhartha Rathod, “and yet these officers busted out Christian’s window, shot him six times with bean bag rounds, Tased him multiple times from two Tasers, and then shot him five times.” The Colorado Bureau of Investigation handles police shootings, including the Glass case, but the family wants prosecutors to file criminal charges, Rathod said. Videos shared with the Associated Press show Glass refusing to come out of his car while also telling police he’s “terrified” and making heart shapes with his hands to officers. At one point, he also can be seen praying with folded hands and saying, “Dear Lord, please, don’t let them break the window.” When the officers do break the window, Glass seems to panic and grabs a knife.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: An FBI agent struggled to control his emotions Tuesday as he described on the witness stand seeing bodies inside Sandy Hook elementary school – a scene that the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones later claimed was staged by actors. FBI agent William Aldenberg was the first witness to testify as a Connecticut jury began hearing statements in a trial to decide how much money Jones owes for spreading the lie that the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown didn’t happen. Aldenberg broke down as he described being among the first law enforcement officers to enter the two classrooms where 20 children died. “Was what you saw in that school fake?” asked attorney Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “No,” Aldenberg said. “It’s awful. It’s awful.” He also testified about how he and others in the community and law enforcement were targeted with threats and conspiracy theories, including one that claimed he was an actor who also pretended to be the father of a victim. The trial in Waterbury – less than 20 miles from Newtown, where the children and six teachers were shot to death – was attended by more than a dozen family members of victims, including David Wheeler, the father who conspiracy theorists had claimed was the same person as Aldenberg.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The City Council has set a public hearing for Oct.3 to discuss a new ordinance that distinguishes short-term and long-term rentals and establishes certain rules for each. One Lewes couple said they’ve lived in the quaint, historic beach town for more than three decades, but it wasn’t until more recently that they started to see their neighborhood change. As more of the homeowners on their street began to offer short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb and Vrbo, they noticed that their quiet community would drastically switch from a near “ghost town” to “busy beach town” within the turn of a weekend. Knowing that Lewes typically has more year-round residents than many of its neighboring resort towns, another resident who commented at a city meeting last year said he worried that the sense of community in Lewes would start to break down if short-term rentals soon dominated. These residents all had concerns about how these rentals would affect their quality of life – from pressures on parking to issues with trash or noise – if the city did not specifically regulate short-term rentals. For at least the past year, the City Council, the city manager and a designated short-term rental committee have been discussing how to manage these rentals and ensure they do not add costs to the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Washington Spirit fans can travel to games with new commemorative Metro SmarTrip cards celebrating their National Women’s Soccer League Championship win, WUSA-TV reports. The transit cards feature an image of the team hoisting the championship trophy after the title-winning game. The limited-edition cards are being sold at Navy Yard, Waterfront and Gallery Place stations in specially marked fare machines topped with a sign. The NWSL championship cards arrive just in time for soccer fans headed to Saturday’s game at Audi Field against the NJ/NY Gotham FC. “We are excited to honor the Spirit, reigning NWSL champs, with this commemorative card. The Spirit’s title run continues the winning tradition in the District of Champions,” Metro General Manager/CEO Randy Clarke said in a statement. “Metro is proud to support the team and fans getting to and from games.” The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority produced 10,000 of the commemorative cards, and they are only available on a first-come, first-served basis. Fans looking to grab the cards can meet up with starting midfielder Anna Heilferty at the Gallery Place station to grab a card and say hello starting at 4 p.m. Sept. 13.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials are fining an Orlando abortion clinic $193,000 for violating a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before abortions are performed, according to a case assigned to an administrative judge Tuesday. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration filed the complaint against the Center of Orlando for Women this summer. The mandatory 24-hour waiting period rule for abortions in Florida was signed into law in 2015 and was upheld by a judge in April after a nearly seven-year court case. State regulators used patient records to determine the clinic performed 193 abortions that violated the 24-hour waiting period rule between late April and early May of this year, the complaint said. State law allows for a fine of $1,000 per violation of the waiting period law. A clinic manager told officials she was aware of the law but did not know when it became effective, according to the complaint. A lawyer representing the center said the facility contacted the state several times to inquire about the law’s effective date, given the lengthy legal battle over the rule, but received no additional information. “It would be disastrous for the clinic if they had to pay a $193,000 fine to keep their license,” attorney Julie Gallagher said in an interview Tuesday. At least two other Florida clinics are facing similar but smaller fines.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStatham: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he wants the state to provide grants to school districts to help students catch up on what they might have missed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, expand the number of school counselors, encourage teacher aides to become full-fledged teachers and pass a law requiring school lockdown drills. Kemp unveiled a relatively modest set of K-12 education proposals as part of his second-term reelection effort at an elementary school in Oconee County where one of his daughters was a teacher last year. “We have more work to do to address pandemic learning loss, bring more educators and counselors into our schools, and keep our students and staff safe,” Kemp said at Dove Creek Elementary School in Statham, just outside Athens. Kemp made a $5,000 pay raise for teachers a centerpiece of his agenda when he was running in 2018 and delivered the final chunk of the money this year, but he didn’t propose a pay raise for his second term Monday, although in response to reporter questions, he said he would “continue to work support all state employees to make the pay scale competitive in the future.” Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running against Kemp, has proposed boosting average teacher pay over four years to $75,000 and guaranteeing a starting salary of $50,000.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Monday appointed several people, including some prominent Native Hawaiian activists, to a new board charged with managing Mauna Kea summit lands underneath some of the world’s most advanced astronomical observatories. Two of the eight appointees – Lanakila Mangauil and Noe Noe Wong-Wilson – were leaders of 2019 protests that brought a halt to the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, the latest observatory proposed for the mountain on Hawaii’s Big Island. Many Native Hawaiians consider the summit sacred, and protesters objected to building yet another telescope there. The summit currently hosts about a dozen telescopes built since the late 1960s. Responding to the protests, the state created the Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority this year with a new law that says Mauna Kea must be protected for future generations, and science must be balanced with culture and the environment. Native Hawaiian cultural experts will have voting seats on the governing body, instead of merely advising the summit’s managers as they do now. The eight nominations must be confirmed by the state Senate. The authority will have 11 voting members. The other three are representatives of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and Hawaii County’s mayor.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Chipmaker Micron’s planned $15 billion investment in a new factory in the company’s hometown of Boise will help protect the United States from the vulnerabilities of a globalized semiconductor market, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Monday. “It is time to get America making things again, with American parts and American labor,” Granholm told a crowd of about 250 guests and Micron workers invited to a tent-covered dirt field for a ceremonial groundbreaking. The event included setting off a ground-clearing explosion far from the crowd that emitted red, white and blue smoke. The U.S. and Europe are pushing aggressively to build chipmaking capacity and reduce reliance on producers that are now mostly based in Asia. Semiconductor businesses have also been trying to diversify their operations to avoid bottlenecks caused by problems – such as a natural disaster or pandemic lockdown – in a specific region. Micron officials said that the high desert, sagebrush steppe area east of Boise is expected to have the largest chipmaking cleanroom, or fab, in the U.S. by the end of the decade, covering 600,000 square feet and creating 17,000 jobs. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with some cleanroom working space ready by 2025 and expanding in phases. Micron is among the nation’s largest chipmakers, with product development sites in five other states and eight countries. Research and development is centered in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Anne Burke, chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, announced her retirement Monday. The 78-year-old jurist will end her 16-year high-court tenure Nov. 30. “I have been blessed to serve as a Supreme Court Justice,” Burke said in a statement. “The past three years as chief justice have been a challenging time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I am thrilled with the progress made by the Illinois courts.” The seven-member court, which has the authority to fill interim vacancies, has chosen Joy Cunningham, a justice on the First District Appellate Court, to take Burke’s place. Cunningham will be the court’s second Black woman. The first took her oath just three months ago. Lisa Holder White was appointed to replace the retiring Rita Garman. Burke herself replaced the first woman on the court, Mary Ann McMorrow, in 2006. Burke will leave just weeks after the fall election, in which two seats are up for grabs, and Republicans hope to gain control of the court for the first time in decades. Burke’s husband, Edward Burke, a Chicago alderman for half a century, is scheduled to go on trial next year on federal racketeering and extortion charges. He has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local leaders and community stakeholders have highlighted a proposal to include money for a pilot clinician-led emergency response program in the city’s proposed budget – an initiative at the heart of calls for reform following the death of Herman Whitfield III in police custody during a mental health crisis in April. Mayor Joe Hogsett, alongside representatives from the Office of Public Health and Safety, the City-County Council and Faith in Indiana, voiced their support last week for the program, which would require $2 million in the city’s proposed operating budget for 2023. The program and its budget still need approval from the full City-County Council in October. If it passes, the pilot is expected to begin next year and would include 24-hour coverage of teams made up of mental health clinicians and experts in a limited number of Indianapolis police districts who can respond to calls for nonviolent mental health help. The proposed budget item would also include money to increase mental health expertise at the 911 dispatch center. “This team would be equipped to provide meaningful support for those who in years past would have spent the length of their crisis in a jail cell,” Hogsett said. “This is because we recognize that police are not health care providers and our jails are not hospitals.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The second-largest school district in the state improperly and repeatedly shut students with disabilities in seclusion rooms and restrained them in violation of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, federal authorities said Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the federal prosecutor for the Northern District of Iowa announced a settlement with the Cedar Rapids Community School District in which school officials have agreed to end the use of seclusion rooms and reform its restraint practices. The district based in Cedar Rapids, about 120 miles east of Des Moines, also promised in the settlement agreement to improve staff training on how to address and de-escalate students’ disability-related behavior through appropriate measures. A justice department investigation found that the district subdued students with disabilities through unnecessary restraints and improper confinement in small seclusion rooms, sometimes multiple times in a day and often for excessive periods of time. The investigation covered the three school years ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Investigators found 4,968 incidents where students were secluded, restrained or transported from class and more than 83% of cases involved a student with a disability.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Topeka police officer hit a car while driving drunk last October, then told police his wife had hit it, says the body that voided his law enforcement certification last month. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training revoked the certification of Steven Dorsey Smith, it said on its website Aug. 15. “Respondent’s conduct shows that he lacks the personal qualities of integrity, upholding the laws of the state, conduct that warrants the public trust, and upholding the oath required for certification,” the website said. Smith was employed by the city of Topeka from Oct. 7, 2019, through Jan. 21, 2022, said Gretchen Spiker, the city’s communications director. Smith was put on leave after the crash, Spiker said, and he resigned during the investigation, which continued even after he left the department. The investigation’s findings were then sent to the statewide commission. “While unfortunate, the city feels this is an example of an investigation that was handled with the utmost integrity,” she said, “and that all best practices were followed.” Kansas statute empowers KSCPOST to revoke the certification of officers whose actions show they aren’t of good moral character sufficient to warrant public trust in them.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Three country music superstars, all natives of Kentucky, will come together for a concert to aid victims of this summer’s catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the commonwealth. Chris Stapleton, Dwight Yoakam and Tyler Childers have announced the Kentucky Rising benefit concert, a special, one-night-only show that will be held at Lexington’s Rupp Arena on Oct. 11. A full 100% of net proceeds from the concert will benefit the Kentucky Rising Fund to support flood relief work and recovery efforts in eastern Kentucky, including support for the many victims, their families and first responders. In August, 39 people died as a result of devasting flooding in parts of eastern Kentucky. The flooding also destroyed many homes, roadways and other infrastructure. Both Childers and Stapleton stepped up in different ways to help out their home state in the days immediately following the flooding. Tickets for the benefit concert go on sale Friday. Visit KentuckyRising.com for more information. For Citi cardmembers, the official presale credit card of Kentucky Rising, sales began Tuesday and run through Thursday at 10 p.m. through CitiEntertainment.com.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Department of the Interior said Monday that it wants to reverse some Trump administration rollbacks of offshore safety rules to prevent blowouts like the BP catastrophe that killed 11 people and fouled the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. “This proposed rulemaking will help ensure that offshore energy development utilizes the latest science and technology to keep people safe,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in remarks prepared for an afternoon announcement. “As our nation transitions to a clean energy economy, we must commit to strengthening and modernizing offshore energy standards and oversight.” The changes are a step in the right direction but not far enough, said Diane Hoskins of the ocean environmental nonprofit Oceana. “No operator can promise there won’t be another disaster like BP’s Deepwater Horizon blowout. The only way to prevent offshore drilling disasters is to permanently protect our coasts and workers from new offshore leasing,” she said. Under Trump, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement acted in 2019 to change rules put in place three years earlier while Barack Obama was president. The agency is proposing to change seven out of the scores of revisions and additions made in 2010, director Kevin M. Sligh Sr. said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The governor said Tuesday that the federal government is moving ahead too quickly with potential new restrictions on the lobster fishing industry and isn’t taking the industry’s concerns about the changes into account. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced it was seeking input on new rules to reduce risk to rare whales. The North Atlantic right whales number less than 340, and they are vulnerable to entanglement in lobster fishing gear. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the agency’s plan to provide only one chance for public comment about the new rules later this month is not sufficient. She wrote in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who oversees NOAA, that lack of input from fishermen will put coastal industries and communities at risk. “As NOAA well knows, effectively reaching an audience of fishermen with challenging schedules absolutely requires in-person meetings and opportunities for comment,” Mills said. The protection of the lobster industry has emerged as an issue in Mills’ reelection race this year. Her opponent, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, said last week that he would push back at the “Biden administration’s destructive regulatory policy aimed at destroying the livelihoods of our fishermen over the false notion they are harming whales.”\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Five western Maryland police officers won’t face charges in a man’s death that occurred days after officers shocked him with a stun gun during an altercation, officials announced Monday. Frederick police said Daniel Michael Holley, 23, died at a hospital Nov. 14, two days after officers used a stun gun to subdue him, news outlets report. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is still trying to determine the exact cause of Holley’s death, but the report rules out the officers’ actions as a cause, officials said. The Office of the Attorney General looked into the incident, and nothing in the initial report from the office’s Independent Investigations Division led officials to believe that there was a basis for prosecution, Frederick County State’s Attorney Charlie Smith said. Officers were called to a home for a report of a person behaving erratically and found Holley nude, pacing and talking incoherently, police said. Body camera footage showed an officer use a stun gun after Holley tackled another officer. Officers requested emergency medical services, and Holley was taken to a hospital, where he died, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: President Joe Biden on Monday urged Americans to come together for a new “national purpose” – his administration’s effort to end cancer “as we know it.” At the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Biden channeled JFK’s famed moonshot speech 60 years ago, likening the space race to his own effort and hoping it, too, would galvanize Americans. “He established a national purpose that could rally the American people and a common cause,” Biden said of Kennedy’s space effort. “We can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone.” Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in February of cutting U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and dramatically improving the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer. Experts say the objective is attainable – with adequate investments. Dr. Michael Hassett, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said Biden’s goal to reduce cancer deaths could be met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches. “If we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,” Hassett said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Monday that she will step down by the end of 2022, an announcement that followed a major decision affecting abortion rights and more than two years of steering Michigan’s judiciary through the COVID-19 pandemic. Bridget McCormack, a Democratic Party nominee, has been on the court since 2013 and still had six years left in her second term. “After a decade, the time has come for me to move on, to let others lead, and to build on a foundation of progress,” McCormack, 56, said in a statement. She said she would resign no earlier than Nov. 22 and no later than Dec. 31. The timing will depend on the appointment of her successor. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she will pick a new justice, apparently no matter the results of the Nov. 8 election. Whitmer, a Democrat seeking reelection, called her a “phenomenal public servant.” McCormack is leaving to become president of an international provider of dispute-resolution services, the American Arbitration Association-International Centre for Dispute Resolution announced Tuesday. Kimberly Wiehl, leader of the group’s governing board, said the organization was looking for someone who has “outstanding business acumen” and is committed to expanding access to resolving disputes outside court.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Local police and the FBI are investigating a break-in at a mosque as a bias-motivated crime. According to a press release from the St. Cloud Police Department, officers were called to the Islamic Center at 375 Fifth Ave. S early Thursday. Islamic Center of St. Cloud President Mohayadin Mohamed said the damage was discovered as individuals began to arrive for morning prayer. Police said a man and woman had damaged a door to enter the mosque, then caused damage inside. Both suspects were found before 7 a.m. at a nearby hotel and taken into custody. Mohamed said surveillance footage showed the two inside the mosque for two hours, roughly 1-3 a.m. He said they went into every space; caused damage to an exterior door, office space and the building’s downstairs area; and brought alcohol into the building. Consuming alcohol is forbidden in Islam. CAIR-MN, the Minnesota chapter of national Islamic civil liberties and advocacy group Council on American Islamic Relations, held a press conference at the center Friday morning regarding the incident, which CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said the group is asking be investigated as a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city hasn’t paid for its trash to be picked up in more than five months, as the mayor and City Council are locked in a battle over who truly won the bidding process, but Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said his administration is proposing a public referendum in which Jackson residents could pick between Waste Management, whose bid a majority of the City Council supports, and Richard’s Disposal, whose bid his administration supports. After the request for proposal blind-bidding process was completed, the mayor’s office maintained that Richard’s won, but the council refused to approve a contract, claiming that Waste Management had been victorious. That led to Lumumba attempting to veto the council’s no-vote on the Richard’s contract. A specially appointed judge ruled that Lumumba could not veto a no-vote, but the mayor has appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court. Lumumba said at his weekly news conference Monday that he trusts the will of the voters to resolve the dispute. The mayor said his legal team has researched statutes on referendums and consulted with the state auditor’s office in order to ensure that such a vote would be legal. Whether one will end up happening now rests with the council.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A Christian boarding school in southwestern Missouri can remain open despite the state attorney general alleging a “dark pattern of behavior,” a judge ruled Monday. Judge David Munton’s ruling allows continued round-the-clock monitoring of Agape Boarding School in Stockton by Missouri child welfare workers. The school serves about 60 boys. The Kansas City Star reported that the state was prepared to call two former Agape students to testify Monday. Agape attorney John Schultz told the judge that there was no proof of any immediate health or safety concern for students and that allowing former students to testify was “simply for publicity,” the Star reports. The judge didn’t allow the testimony but scheduled another hearing for Sept. 21. Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office first sought to shut down Agape last Wednesday after learning that someone on the state registry for child abuse and neglect was actively working there. On Friday, the attorney general’s office filed an amended motion alleging systemic abuse. “Agape’s operation of a residential care facility must cease because it presents an immediate health and safety concern for the children residing at Agape,” the court filing said. It also accused Agape of providing the state with incomplete information concerning which adults have access to children.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. officials have withdrawn parcels of public land near the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation from future mining to protect a reclamation area where more than $80 million has been spent to clean up past mining contamination. Mining will be barred for 20 years on 4 square miles of land at the Zortman-Landusky Mine site now administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Canada-based mining company Pegasus Gold Inc. declared bankruptcy in 1998, leaving cleanup at the site to U.S. taxpayers. The BLM has previously said the remaining cleanup work could cost about $70 million and involve moving millions of tons of waste rock and treating hundreds of millions of gallons of water in coming decades. Contaminated water from the shuttered mine site has flowed downstream to the Fort Belknap reservation and fouled its water. Treatment of mine water to prevent further contamination will continue indefinitely, the BLM said in announcing the Sept. 9 withdrawal. About 5.4 square miles were withdrawn from mining in 2000, but that action expired in 2020. A proposal for a new withdrawal on the remainder of the land – about 1.4 square miles – is pending.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Fifteen years after being rejected as too controversial, Malcolm X is the first Black honoree to be inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The organization’s commission selected the civil rights icon Monday with a 4-3 vote, edging out the late University of Nebraska educator and author Louise Pound. “Malcolm X used the lessons he learned early in life and his intellectual power, dedication and perseverance in the fight for freedom and equality for all during the civil rights movement in America,” said commission Chairman Ron Hull. “His work and his legacy continue to impact the citizens of the world.” Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha in 1925 as the son of a Baptist preacher. His family left for Milwaukee the following year after threats from the Ku Klux Klan. The firebrand was first nominated for Nebraska’s Hall of Fame in 2004 but passed over by a commission made up solely of white men who instead selected a U.S. senator who made a name for himself with his campaign to remove gay men from government posts in the 1940s and 1950s. The pick of Sen. Kenneth Wherry was later nixed because of an open-meetings violation. Malcolm X was passed over again in 2007 for little-known botanist Charles Bessey. Each Nebraska Hall of Fame member is immortalized with a bronze bust displayed in the state Capitol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Demolition has begun at two Las Vegas-area casino properties had been shuttered since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. A spokesman for Station Casinos declined to comment about work that began Monday at Texas Station in North Las Vegas and Fiesta Henderson in Henderson. Work has not begun at the company’s closed Fiesta Rancho, which is also slated to be razed. Red Rock Resorts, the publicly traded corporate owner of the properties, announced in July that the three casino-hotels would be demolished, and the land on which they sit will be sold. Fiesta Rancho opened in 1994 off Rancho Drive near North Las Vegas Airport, and Texas Station opened across the street in 1995. Fiesta Henderson opened as The Reserve in 1998 off U.S. 95 and was acquired by Station Casinos in 2001. Station Casinos markets its off-Strip properties to Las Vegas residents. It is building a new property, Durango Casino & Resort, off the 215 Beltway southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. Station owns six other casino-hotels in and around Las Vegas and is building a new site near a crossroads southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. It also operates several non-hotel Wildfire properties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Justice is seeking to assuage concerns about a new state law curbing some enforcement of federal firearms laws. School officials can still report potential shooters on campus, Attorney General John Formella wrote this month. New Hampshire State Police officers can still confiscate weapons from alleged domestic abusers, the New Hampshire Bulletin reports. A new federal firearms law closing the “boyfriend loophole” will still apply in the state. The legal interpretations, issued in a nine-page opinion Sept. 1, are part of an effort by the department to provide more information and cool tensions around the new law, which prevents state and local officials from enforcing federal firearms laws that are not replicated in state law. “Unless expressly delegated by a federal law enforcement agency, state and local law enforcement have never had the authority or jurisdiction to enforce or administer federal firearms violations or laws,” the department wrote in an accompanying “Frequently Asked Questions” document. “HB 1178 has not changed this.” The law was championed by Republicans and Second Amendment advocates as a partial bulwark against federal firearms laws and rules, which include agency rules from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Workers can’t be fired just for testing positive for marijuana, under new guidelines the state released Friday. The long-awaited interim regulations for the nascent industry came as a relief to employers, who said they had been left in the dark on how to keep their workplace free of drugs. While a positive drug test for marijuana won’t by itself be grounds to fire or discipline a staffer or to decline to hire someone, an employee could still be let go if they’re also shown to be under the influence during work hours. “Striking a balance between workplace safety and work performance and adult employees’ right to privacy and to consume cannabis during their off hours is possible,” said a statement from Jeff Brown, executive director of the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission, which oversees the state’s marijuana industry. “We have been doing that with alcohol without thought.” For workers and bosses, the situation has been complicated by medical uncertainty ever since sales began April 21, as well as by fears of how weed could affect worker performance in high-risk jobs with little room for error. Pot and alcohol affect the human body differently, so long-established protocols for substance-free workplaces and gauging if someone’s under the influence hadn’t necessarily applied.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is using a visit to Washington to celebrate Democrats’ flagship U.S. climate and health care bill and to advocate for addition federal wildfire relief. The Democratic governor said she was traveling to Tuesday’s celebration of the Inflation Reduction Act at the invitation of President Joe Biden. Signed in August, the law could save money for some Americans by lessening the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly, extending health insurance subsidies and reducing energy prices. The legislation represents Congress’ largest-ever investment in curbing carbon emissions. It would also modestly cut the government’s budget deficit. While in Washington, the 62-year-old governor and skiing enthusiast also planned to consult with an orthopedic surgeon about a lingering knee injury. Campaign related activities in Washington and New York are scheduled before the Lujan Grisham’s planned return to New Mexico on Friday. Lujan Grisham is seeking a second term in the November general election against Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti. He is campaigning on proposals for a permanent annual tax rebate tied oil-field production, new restrictions on abortion access and enhanced criminal penalties to address crime.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The man who shot and killed John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment building in 1980 has been denied parole for a 12th time, New York corrections officials said Monday. Mark David Chapman, 67, appeared before a parole board at the end of August, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Chapman shot and killed Lennon on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, as Lennon and Yoko Ono were returning to their Upper West Side apartment. Lennon had signed an autograph for Chapman on a copy of his and Ono’s recently released album, “Double Fantasy,” earlier that day. State officials have yet to make transcripts of Chapman’s latest board interview available, but he has repeatedly expressed remorse in previous parole hearings. Chapman called his actions “despicable” during his hearing in 2020 and said he would have “no complaint whatsoever” if they chose to leave him in prison for the rest of his life. “I assassinated him … because he was very, very, very famous, and that’s the only reason, and I was very, very, very, very much seeking self-glory. Very selfish,” Chapman said then. He is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Green Haven Correctional Facility, north of New York City, according to online state corrections records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGraham: A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by civil rights leaders that sought the removal of a Confederate statue in front of a historic courthouse. Superior Court Judge Don Bridges ruled Tuesday against the state NAACP, which had argued that the statue in front of the Alamance County Courthouse was a danger to public safety and violated constitutional rights to equal protection, according to The Times-News. A 2015 state law sharply limits state and local governments from removing Confederate statues and other objects of remembrance. The NAACP had argued in its 2021 lawsuit that county officials had leeway to remove the statue under an exception for public safety. The statue, erected in 1914, has been the site of protests in recent years. Separately, North Carolina’s governor ordered the removal of Confederate monuments outside the state’s historic Capitol in 2020, citing the public safety clause in the law after nearby monuments were damaged by protesters. Demonstrators have toppled other statues in recent years on the campus of the University of North Carolina and in downtown Durham. But Bridges said that he interprets the state law as protecting the Alamance County statue and that the local county commission is entitled to follow it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legalizing recreational pot could cut the number of people who are registered to use the drug as medicine by at least 80%, due to access to bigger quantities and more varied products, a state health official said Monday. Supporters of legalizing recreational cannabis in North Dakota succeeded last month in bringing the matter to a public vote in November by submitting more than the required 15,582 valid petition signatures to get it on the ballot. The state has issued more than 8,200 identification cards to qualifying patients since voters approved medical marijuana in 2016. North Dakota’s approved medical marijuana forms are dried leaves and flowers, concentrates, tinctures, capsules, topicals and transdermal patches. Edibles were part of the original initiative, but the Legislature removed them from the list, fearing they could get in the hands of children. The initiative on the ballot in November would allow people 21 and up to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts. Edibles would be allowed. Medical Marijuana Division Director Jason Wahl said thousands medical marijuana users may only purchase 2.5 ounces of cannabis flower in a 30-day period. Recreational users could potentially – though illegally – purchase at least that amount in a single day, as “none of that is tracked,” Wahl said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An educational experiment happening in one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods could expand to a national model, using tax dollars to establish religious schools. Last month 31 children from the Hilltop and Franklintown areas began attending a new school called Westside Christian inside converted Sunday school classrooms at Memorial Baptist Church. Founders of this “micro-school” call it a new, low-cost way to open private schools in underserved communities using state education dollars – known in Ohio as EdChoice vouchers – instead of private donations. And if it’s successful, they hope to open hundreds more. “Our goal is five to 10 more in Ohio next yea,” Center for Christian Virtue Executive Director Troy McIntosh said. “But we want to take this model and export it to other states.” Public school advocates worry this is a misuse of the EdChoice Scholarship system at best or another step toward dismantling public education at worst. “It’s not about rescuing kids from failing schools,” former Democratic lawmaker and school finance expert Stephen Dyer said. “It’s all about subsidizing private education and mostly religious education.” Traditionally, opening a private school requires millions of dollars in donations that “float” the school until tuition can cover its expenses.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state received almost $17.9million in tribal gaming exclusivity fees in August – the most the industry has ever paid to the state in a single month. The record amount is one sign of the region’s continued economic growth despite rising inflation. Summer is also a strong season for the tribal gaming industry, which generates a large chunk of its business from Texans and other travelers. Officials in both Oklahoma and Texas have said consumer spending as a whole ticked up last month as prices and pay increased. The previous record for exclusivity fees was nearly $17.8 million in May 2021, according to monthly totals published by the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The fees have added up to $193 million over the past year, 13% more than the same time in 2021. Whether Oklahoma’s tribal gaming industry can keep expanding will depend largely on external forces, especially whether Texas legalizes widespread casino-style gaming or sports betting, said Victor Rocha, a tribal gaming industry analyst based in California. Oklahoma’s largest casinos are near the Texas border and draw heavily from Dallas-Fort Worth. Casinos on the other side of the border would be a game changer, said Rocha, who belongs to the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Saying that a police response is often an improper solution to mental health crises, Biden administration officials on Monday announced financial support for expansion of mobile crisis intervention teams in Oregon. The Pacific Northwest state, which has pioneered the use of unarmed intervention teams, became the first to receive the infusion of aid under President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act. The new Medicaid-supported plan will allow Oregon to provide and expand community-based stabilization services to individuals experiencing mental health and/or substance use crises throughout the state by connecting them to a behavioral health specialist, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra encouraged other states to take advantage of the funding opportunity. Federal health officials said that under the program, 85 cents of every dollar spent by states to expand these services and utilized by Medicaid-covered individuals will be paid for by the federal government. There are more than 1.4 million Medicaid recipients in Oregon, according to the Oregon Health Authority. That’s almost one-third of the state’s population of 4.1 million. An example of such a program exists in Eugene, where teams of paramedics and behavioral health practitioners take mental health crisis calls out of the hands of uniformed and armed officers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A white Philadelphia police officer became distraught when he learned that a Black motorist he fatally shot after a high-speed chase was unarmed, his lawyer said as the ex-officer’s third-degree murder trial began Tuesday. Prosecutors said former Officer Eric Ruch Jr. shot and killed Dennis Plowden Jr. less than six seconds after arriving on the scene – even as other officers held their fire. A grand jury investigation found that Plowden, 25, was dazed after crashing the car and had his left hand raised as he tried to follow commands on a city sidewalk. However, defense lawyer David Mischak told jurors that Plowden’s right hand remained hidden near a pocket. Only later, he said, did Ruch learn what was inside. “As soon as my client discovered it was heroin and not a gun, he was upset. He was distraught,” Mischak said. He urged jurors to consider not just what happened in the six seconds at the scene but also the two-minute chase beforehand. Police thought the car was linked to a recent homicide. Plowden, who had borrowed the car and was not involved in that case, drove at high speed for several blocks through a city neighborhood before crashing. “It was a tragedy,” Mischak said of Plowden’s death. “To call my client a criminal really compounds that tragedy.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., said he hopes something good can come from an “outrageous” incident last month in which he nearly had to cancel a congressional trip because an airline wouldn’t let his wheelchair onto a plane. The event caused him to miss his flight and arrive late in Italy, where the House Armed Services Committee member was leading a congressional delegation with the U.S. Navy. The airline, Lufthansa, has acknowledged it made a mistake and has issued an apology. “It’s outrageous that airlines are blocking wheelchair users from traveling with FAA-compliant mobility devices,” Langevin tweeted Monday. “If I was denied boarding on a government trip, what do you think is happening to people with disabilities on vacations, visiting family, or traveling for work?” Langevin, who is quadriplegic, uses a wheelchair powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lufthansa staff at Boston Logan International Airport told him the chair was prohibited because its batteries posed a fire threat. Having had similar trouble in January, he’d taken steps to avoid another problem, with the Navy contacting the airline on his behalf in advance. Discussing the issue with a gate agent and operations manager, Langevin even got the wheelchair’s inventor on the phone to explain that it was safe. “They wouldn’t budge,” he said. Langevin noted that most people wouldn’t have a staff to help under such circumstances. “It’s very expensive to be disabled,” he said. “Not everyone has a backup chair.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Republican state lawmakers will keep trying to enact new abortion restrictions later this month. Speaker Murrell Smith announced Monday that the House will meet Sept. 27, more than two weeks after the Senate sent back a markedly different proposal from the one passed earlier by the lower chamber. Contentious debates among Republicans over exceptions have emerged in a special session on abortion that convened after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. It is unclear if the House will take up the Senate’s bill. Smith told reporters earlier Monday that “all options are on the table.” While Smith was disappointed with the outcome last week, he said this is how legislation gets made. “I respect the Senate as a body and their votes,” Smith told reporters. “Obviously, the House is vastly different from their position.” The House passed a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in late August with exceptions for the mother’s life and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. The Senate passed a six-week ban, based on when cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, to save the life of the mother and, when approved by two doctors, in cases of fatal fetal anomaly.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem disclosed Monday that she recently underwent back surgery to treat an injury impacting her spine and that her activity would be limited during several months of recovery. The 50-year-old Republican governor said she traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for the surgery after receiving medical treatment for several weeks in South Dakota. She said in a video posted on Twitter that she injured her back about two months ago. She said she will be restricted in the amount of travel she can do and the time she can spend standing while she recovers. Noem is in the midst of a reelection campaign and is also considered a potential 2024 White House contender. “I won’t be able to stand for more than 10, 15 minutes at a time. I won’t be able to get out and about South Dakota like I love to do so much,” the governor said in the video, where she appeared slightly dispirited. Dr. Mohamed Bydon said in a statement released by the governor’s office that he treated her for an “acute condition impacting her lumbar spine.” He said that the surgery was successful and that the governor is in “excellent health.” The governor’s office and her campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a question on how she was injured.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Police have revised the number of people killed in a man’s shooting rampage from four to three after a different suspect was identified in the slaying of a teenager during the tense ordeal. In a Facebook post, Memphis police said the killing of a 17-year-old girl, Corteria McKinnie, was not part of the series of shootings last Wednesday that terrorized the city and led to a shelter-in-place order. The teen was shot as police frantically hunted the man who posted some of his actions on social media. Police said Ezekiel Kelly, 19, carjacked two motorists and drove around Memphis and north Mississippi, opening fire on people. Kelly has been charged with first-degree murder in one of the shootings. More charges are pending, authorities said. Kelly’s next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The court-appointed public defender has not returned calls seeking comment in his case. At a news conference early Thursday – just after Kelly was arrested – Memphis Police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis provided a timeline that included four people killed and three others wounded. In a Facebook post made after-hours Friday, police said the shooting of McKinnie in south Memphis was not carried out by Kelly but by a different suspect. Police said McKinnie reported the shooting at a fire station, but she was shot in her car at a separate location by a man wearing all black.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A woman accused of killing another woman to steal her unborn baby to present as her own went on trial for capital murder Monday. Taylor Rene Parker has pleaded not guilty to capital murder and kidnapping in the October 2020 deaths of 21-year-old Regan Michelle Simmons-Hancock and the daughter who died after being cut from her mother’s womb. Authorities say Simmons-Hancock was stabbed and cut more than 100 times and had her skull crushed with a hammer in her New Boston home before a scalpel was used to remove her unborn baby. She is also charged with non-capital murder in connection with the baby’s death. Assistant District Attorney Kelley Crisp told the Bowie County jury Monday that Parker, 29, acted not because she wanted a baby but to keep from losing her boyfriend. Crisp said Parker disguised herself to make her look pregnant for nearly 10 months, faked ultrasounds, had a gender-reveal party and posted about her fake pregnancy on social media while searching for a possible victim, Crisp said. “How did we get here?” Crisp asked the jury. “How did it get this far? She is an actress, an actress of the highest order. The lies and fraud go on and on; the layers of fraud are staggering.” Leaving the victim’s 3-year-old daughter alone with her dying mother, Parker then drove with the baby in her lap when a state trooper stopped the car and sent the child to a hospital in nearby Idabel, Oklahoma, authorities say. The child later died.\n\nUtah\n\nTooele: Federal wildlife managers say they plan to gather approximately 700 wild horses later this week as part of an ongoing effort to tamp down the horses’ populations along the Utah-Nevada border. The gathering operation is slated to start Saturday and last for two weeks, starting in the proximity of the Cedar Mountain Herd Management Area, west of Tooele, according to the Bureau of Land Management. BLM officials say the herd management area should have between 190 and 390 horses but now has a population of 920. Horses removed from the range will be transported to BLM-contracted off-range corrals in Axtell, Utah. “The Cedar Mountain Horse Management Area wild horse gather supports the BLM’s continuing efforts to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and to manage wild horse populations under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971,” Jessica Wade, the bureau’s Salt Lake field manager, said in an email. The agency’s method for rounding up the horses involves low-flying helicopters chasing the horses into corrals – a method that has drawn fire from advocacy groups over the years but that wildlife officials say is the quickest, most effective way to reduce herd sizes and minimize longer-term problems. Members of the public are invited to come and observe the operations, as long as they remain at a safe distance, starting Monday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Education is investigating allegations of antisemitism at the University of Vermont, including that some Jewish students were excluded from campus clubs and that a teaching assistant threatened to reduce the grades of students who support the state of Israel. The complaint filed by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law alleges that UVM has allowed a hostile environment to exist on campus in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The complaint, which was filed last year but acted upon by the Department of Education last month, says that Jewish students have expressed fear about identifying publicly as Jewish, that they hide their Jewish identity and that some have considered transferring from UVM due to the hostile environment. Jewish students are being pressured to disavow their sense of being Jewish if they want to engage on issues like LGBTQ, women’s or immigration rights or climate change, said Alyza Lewin, the president of the Brandeis Center. “It can’t be that today, the only community that’s not welcomed to bring their full identity to the table are the Jews,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press. In a statement, UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials were aware of the investigation by the Office of Civil Rights and look forward to providing the agency with a full response to the underlying allegations, which were reported to the university in 2021 and investigated by campus officials.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Elizabeth River Project’s latest work will roll with the rising tide. The environmental group is constructing a 6,500-foot resilience lab with an intentional life span of about 30 to 50 years. When sea levels reach a certain height, the structure can be disassembled and moved to allow a living shoreline – part of the design – to take its place. The outdoor pavilion will float when the area floods and is meant as a refuge for people who canoe down the river-like streets after a deluge or for those caught outside. The Pru and Louis Ryan Resilience Lab and Learning Park is scheduled to open next fall. The $8 million project is funded by Pru and Louis Ryan of Norfolk and donations through the ERP’s Next Wave Campaign. The group picked the location because it is a notorious flood zone, and the creek is an important tributary. The lab will be equipped with solar panels, rainwater collection barrels and gray water collection systems. It also will employ natural cooling techniques such as a “green wall” of ivy. The proposed living shoreline will be at the back of the property and planted to restore wetland and oyster habitats. Once in place, it will help trap contaminants and filter the water. There will be two storage sheds, one of which will float, a research dock, and a public boardwalk for people to look out over the creek. A kayak launch will be just off the boardwalk.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools said late Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the union for teachers who went on strike last week over issues like pay and classroom support. Earlier Monday, the district had canceled classes Tuesday – the fifth school day that students have missed since the strike began began Sept. 7. That was supposed to be the first day for approximately 49,000 students in the district. Details about the agreement weren’t immediately available. Striking teachers said their main concern was educational and emotional help for students, especially those with special needs or learning difficulties. The school district had offered pay raises of an additional 1% above the 5.5% cost-of-living increase set by state lawmakers – far less than the union says it wanted – plus one-time bonuses for certain teachers, including $2,000 for third-year Seattle teachers earning an English language or dual-language endorsement. Teachers in the city have seen healthy raises since their last strike in 2015, with many making more than $100,000, thanks largely to a new state education funding model. The union has said it is primarily focused on winning raises for its lower-paid members, including instructional assistants and front office staff. Paraeducators in Seattle Public Schools start at $19 an hour – nowhere near enough to afford to live in the city, many say. The union says it was opposing the district’s efforts to eliminate staffing ratios for special education students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Legislature passed a sweeping abortion ban with few exceptions Tuesday, approving a bill that several Republicans said they hope will make it impossible for the state’s only abortion clinic to continue to offer the procedure. Under the legislation, rape and incest victims would be able to obtain abortions at up to eight weeks of pregnancy – but only if they report to law enforcement first. Such victims who are minors would have until 14 weeks to terminate a pregnancy and be required report either to law enforcement or to a physician. Rape and incest victims would have to report the assault within 48 hours of getting an abortion, and a patient would have to present a copy of a police report or notarized letter to a physician before the procedure could be performed. Abortions also would be allowed in cases of medical emergencies. Lawmakers resumed debate on the bill after failing to come to an agreement in late July, giving up the chance for the state to become the first to approve new legislation restricting access to abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June removing its protected status as a constitutional right.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hundreds of Madison nurses seeking to be recognized as a union canceled a three-day work strike at the last minute after Gov. Tony Evers called the health care workers and their bosses to Maple Bluff over the weekend to hash out a settlement. Evers announced the agreement to avoid striking Monday at a state Capitol news conference, where UW Health health care workers and UW Health CEO Alan Kaplan said the two sides agreed to pursue an analysis from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission on whether the health system must recognize their union. “I just made an offer to come to the residence, sit down together, and my message was quite clear that people in Wisconsin expect everybody to work together for the best of everyone. And no one wants a strike,” Evers said. The agreement came a day before the nurses were set to start a three-day strike they voted in late August to take if UW Health officials did not agree to negotiate with their union, SEIU Healthcare Wisconsin. Their pursuit of union recognition has been brewing since 2011, when Republican state lawmakers and then-Gov. Scott Walker passed a collective bargaining law that eliminated most collective bargaining for public employees. Kaplan has argued state law prevents officials from bargaining with the union.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Republican U.S. House nominee Harriet Hageman won’t agree to a debate with Democratic challenger Lynnette Grey Bull, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Hageman, who defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in the GOP primary after winning the endorsement of ex-President Donald Trump and pushing his election conspiracy theories, declined an invitation to appear on stage with Grey Bull next month, first citing a scheduling conflict and later saying she wouldn’t take part at all. Grey Bull said voters deserve to hear the candidates discuss their differences and calling the refusal a tactic of the privileged class, according to the newspaper. WyomingPBS officials, who have long hosted statewide debates, also said they were diappointed that Hageman wouldn’t agree to participate in a forum that helps constituents learn about the candidates and issues.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/24/till-statue-lin-manuel-miranda-buried-convertible-news-around-states/50868009/", "title": "Till statue, Lin-Manuel Miranda: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nRussellville: A northern Alabama community with large numbers of Hispanic immigrants is using federal COVID-19 relief money to fund an experiment to better serve students who are still learning English. They are hiring and certifying more local, Spanish-speaking staff. More than half of 2,500 students in the small Russellville city school district identify as Hispanic or Latino, and about a quarter are learning English. But the district at times has struggled to find the people and money necessary to help those students achieve. As part of a recent exercise to help the class learn English, a third grader pulled a block from a Jenga tower and read aloud a question written on one side. “Where,” the boy read, then slowly sounded out the other words: “Where would you like to visit?” “Disneyland,” one student said. “Space,” another chimed in. “Guatemala,” one girl said. Kathy Alfaro, a new English language teacher at Russellville Elementary, exchanged a few words with the girl in Spanish, then turned to the other students. “Do y’all know what she said?” Alfaro asked the class. “She said she has a lot of family in Guatemala because she was born there. And I told her that I was born here, but I also have a lot of family in Guatemala.” Districtwide, the percentage of students who met their language proficiency goals increased from 46% in 2019 to 61% in 2022. At the two elementary schools, proficiency jumped by nearly 30 percentage points.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress, received a hero’s welcome Thursday when the Democrat gave the keynote address at the Alaska Federation of Natives conference in Anchorage. Those attending the largest annual gathering of Natives in Alaska showered her with standing ovations, spontaneous songs and gifts, including a bolo tie worn by her Republican predecessor, the late Don Young. Young’s daughter Joni Nelson presented the tie to Peltola, saying it was a passing of the mantle to her. The surprise presentation came after Young’s adult children joined Peltola on stage as she paid tribute to Young, who held Alaska’s sole seat in the House for 49 years until his death in March. Peltola defeated Republicans Sarah Palin and Nick Begich in an August special election to finish out Young’s term. Those three, along with Libertarian Chris Bye, are competing for a full two-year term in the November election. Another of Young’s daughters, Dawn Vallely, later said on stage that her father would have been happy with the results of the special election, won by Peltola. Nelson wore the white beaded tie – which features the state of Alaska in blue beads – onstage but removed it to place it around Peltola’s neck when she greeted the family.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has sued the federal government to be able to keep more than 100 double-stacked shipping containers that Republican Gov. Doug Ducey had placed to fill in gaps along the U.S.-Mexico border near the southwestern desert community of Yuma. The lawsuit filed in federal court in Arizona on Friday asks that the state be allowed to take the unilateral action it believes necessary to defend its residents from migrants illegally crossing the border. Ducey complains the U.S. government is not doing enough to stop migrants from coming to Arizona, forcing the state to take action. The shipping containers went up in August. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation last week sent a letter telling Arizona to take down the containers, saying they are unauthorized and violate U.S. law. Arizona refused. The Cocopah Indian Tribe in southwestern Arizona also complained that some of the containers were placed on its reservation without permission. The Bureau of Reclamation also demanded that no new containers be placed, saying it hoped to prevent conflicts with federal construction contracts to fill the gaps in the wall near the Morelos Dam in the Yuma area.\n\nArkansas\n\nConway: Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended her avoidance of local media in her bid for governor Friday as she appeared in her only debate ahead of next month’s election. Sanders, the Republican nominee who is heavily favored in the November election, has conducted few local interviews during her bid for the state’s top office. Sanders had agreed to only one debate with Democratic nominee Chris Jones and Libertarian Ricky Dale Harrington. Sanders said she’s been speaking directly to voters by campaigning around the state. “Freedom of the press is incredibly important, but with freedom of the press comes a great deal of responsibility,” Sanders said. “When they don’t live up to their end of the bargain, it forces some of us to go outside the box, which I have done every single day for the past two years.” Public polling has shown Sanders leading by double digits, and she’s shattered fundraising records in the predominantly Republican state. Early voting begins Monday in Arkansas. During her two year term as ex-President Donald Trump’s chief spokeswoman, Sanders scaled back televised news briefings after repeatedly sparring with reporters who aggressively questioned her. Sanders often sought to justify the lack of formal briefings by saying they were unnecessary when journalists could hear from Trump directly.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAtherton: Three decades after a car was reported stolen in Northern California, police are digging the missing convertible out of the yard of a $15 million mansion built by a man with a history of arrests for murder, attempted murder and insurance fraud. The convertible Mercedes Benz, filled with bags of unused concrete, was discovered Thursday by landscapers in the affluent town of Atherton in Silicon Valley, Mayor Rick DeGolia said, reading a statement from police. Although cadaver dogs alerted to possible human remains Thursday, none had been found more than 24 hours after technicians with the San Mateo County Crime Lab began excavating the car, DeGolia said. Police believe the car was buried 4 to 5 feet deep in the backyard of the home sometime in the 1990s – before the current owners bought the home. The car was reported stolen in September 1992 in nearby Palo Alto, he said. By Friday, the technicians had been able to excavate the passenger side of the convertible, which was buried with its top down. They also opened the trunk, where they found more bags of unused cement. Cadaver dogs were again brought back to the house and again “made a slight notification of possible human remains,” DeGolia said.\n\nColorado\n\nCastle Rock: Brewing beer, cooking food, and refilling water bottles with recycled wastewater could soon become standard practice in a state that’s synonymous with its pristine-tasting snowmelt and mountain springs. Last week, Colorado’s water quality agency gave unanimous preliminary approval to regulate direct potable reuse – the process of treating sewage and sending it directly to taps without first being dispersed in a larger water body. Pending a final vote in November, the state would become the first to adopt direct potable reuse regulations, according to state and federal officials. “Having well-developed regulations … helps ensure projects are safe and that project proponents know what will be required of them,” said Laura Belanger, water resources engineer with the non-profit Western Resource Advocates. As the state’s population explodes, and regional water supplies dwindle, recycling water for drinking is a significant opportunity for stretching a limited supply, said Kevin Reidy, conservation specialist for the Colorado Water Conservation Board. And he said it’s a game changer in a place like Castle Rock, a city of 75,000 just south of Denver nestled under its prominent namesake butte, that relies primarily on pumping finite groundwater for drinking.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Hartford: The grieving widows of two slain police officers gave tearful tributes to their husbands Friday during a funeral attended by thousands of law enforcement officers from around the country. Others who spoke at the service for Bristol Officers Dustin DeMonte and Alex Hamzy pleaded for an end to hatred and suspicion against the police. “To Alex and Dustin, you were both true heroes, amazing people, and you will be missed beyond words by everyone,” said DeMonte’s wife, Laura, who is pregnant with their third child. “I am so sorry this happened to you. Two of the very best humans. So kind, positive and fun-loving.” DeMonte, Hamzy and Officer Alec Iurato were shot Oct. 12 in what police believe was an ambush set up by a 911 call made by the shooter, Nicholas Brutcher. Iurato, who survived a gunshot wound to his leg, struggled to get behind a police cruiser and fired a single shot that killed Brutcher. Brutcher’s brother, Nathan, also was shot – possibly by his brother – and survived. DeMonte was a sergeant with 10 years’ experience on the force, and Hamzy was an officer for eight years. The funeral included formal, posthumous promotions of DeMonte to lieutenant and Hamzy to sergeant.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state auditor was sentenced Wednesday to one year of probation and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine and complete 500 hours of community service for official misconduct and conflict of interest convictions. Auditor Kathy McGuiness avoided jail time for the misdemeanors, each of which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison, news outlets report. McGuiness maintains her innocence, and prosecutors sought a sentence of 30 days in prison for the Rehoboth Beach Democrat based on her lack of remorse. Her attorney argued that a $1,000 fine was sufficient. In July, a Kent County jury convicted McGuiness on three misdemeanor counts but acquitted her on felony charges of theft and witness intimidation. A judge later threw out a misdemeanor conviction for improperly structuring contract payments to a consulting firm, rejecting her request for a new trial. The conflict of interest charge involved the May 2020 hiring of her daughter Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness. Prosecutors alleged that Saylar McGuiness, 20, and a friend were hired even as other part-time workers in the auditor’s office left because of a lack of work during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic. Authorities said McGuiness then allowed her daughter special privileges that were not available to other “casual-seasonal” workers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: First lady Jill Biden will host a roundtable Monday on breast and cervical cancer, part of the administration’s “moonshot” effort to reduce deaths from cancer, the White House said. The event is one of many being launched by the American Cancer Society. Singer Mary J. Blige, an advocate for cancer screening, will participate in the roundtable with Biden. President Joe Biden announced in February his goal of halving cancer deaths in the next 25 years. The issue is personal for the president, whose son Beau Biden died in 2015 of brain cancer. Biden launched the cancer moonshot the following year when serving as then-President Barack Obama’s vice president.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: More than 230 pythons were removed from the Everglades as part of an annual competition to eliminate the invasive species from the South Florida wetlands preserve. Florida wildlife officials said Thursday that 1,000 hunters from 32 states and as far away as Canada and Latvia removed 231 Burmese pythons during the 10-day competition known as the Florida Python Challenge. Matthew Concepcion won the $10,000 top prize for removing 28 Burmese pythons. Another hunter, Dustin Crum, won a $1,500 prize for removing the longest python, a snake that measured over 11 feet long. Pythons became invasive in Florida after they were brought into the state as pets and then abandoned in the wild by their owners, wildlife officials say. Since 2000, more than 17,000 wild Burmese pythons have been removed from Florida, where they are a destructive presence for native species, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “Every one of the pythons removed as part of the Challenge is one less preying on our native birds, mammals and reptiles,” said Rodney Barreto, the commission’s chairman.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A beer garden near downtown Atlanta filled for a recent event hosted by Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock aimed at Latino voters. Some said they came to seek Warnock, who is seeking reelection in the midterm elections Nov. 8 against Republican challenger Herschel Walker. But others came to see a particularly high-profile Latino who would be speaking on Warnock’s behalf: composer, actor and filmmaker Lin-Manuel Miranda. “Who I’m really here to see is Lin-Manuel Miranda because I’m a really big fan of his,” said Camilla Estrada, of Atlanta, who described herself as liberal and said she plans to vote for Warnock. Georgia Democrats spent the first week of the state’s 19-day early voting period in frantic activity, as they implore supporters to vote in advance. Warnock and gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams each held multiple events a day. Miranda also appeared with Abrams at a restaurant in suburban Lawrenceville on Wednesday, while the Abrams campaign later rolled out a recorded chat with Oprah Winfrey on Thursday night. Almost 575,000 people had voted in Georgia by the end of Thursday, roughly on pace with the 2020 presidential election, when 5 million votes were cast in the state, buoying Democratic hopes that a big turnout might help them.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines will operate 10 cargo planes for Amazon.com starting next fall under a deal that could eventually involve more planes and give Amazon a 15% stake in the airline. The airline’s parent company, Hawaiian Holdings Inc., said Friday that it will fly and maintain an “initial fleet” of 10 leased Airbus A330-300 jets for the retail giant. The fleet could grow “depending on Amazon’s future business needs,” the company said. Hawaiian said it issued warrants that Amazon can exercise over the next nine years and acquire up to 15% of Hawaiian stock. Shares of Hawaiian Holdings jumped 13% in afternoon trading Friday. When travel plunged and consumer spending spiked early in the pandemic, airlines began carrying more cargo and demand for freighter planes grew. More recently, the cargo business has cooled off as consumer spending shifted away from goods toward services including travel, and airlines have been stuck with excess cargo capacity. Global demand for cargo fell 8.3% in August compared with a year earlier, the International Air Transport Association reported this month. Hawaiian said it won’t use any of its current planes to serve Amazon. Instead, Amazon’s air division will lease the first 10 planes -- which will be converted from passenger jets to freighters -- from leasing company Altavair.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: It’s not uncommon for Idaho wildlife officials to be called for help when a moose, mountain lion, black bear or other wild animals wander into one of the state’s rural communities. But Idaho Fish and Game officials are asking the public for help with a particularly unusual find – a 3.5-foot alligator that was discovered hiding in the brush of a rural neighborhood about 40 miles northwest of Boise. Southwest Region spokesperson Brian Pearson told the Idaho Statesman that a New Plymouth resident was walking their dog Thursday evening when they noticed something moving in the brush. Further investigation revealed the alligator – a creature commonly found in the coastal wetlands of the southeastern U.S., but certainly not native to Idaho. Pearson said the resident put the alligator in a nearby horse trailer until Idaho Fish and Game conservation officer could pick it up Friday morning. The department has the animal in captivity for now, but Pearson said it will be euthanized or given to a licensed facility unless the owner is located. Idaho Fish and Game officials are hoping members of the public will call the department if they have any information about the alligator’s origins.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Three young men were fatally shot and two more seriously wounded early Sunday during what police called a caravan of street racers involving about 100 vehicles that took over an intersection on the city’s Southwest Side. The shooting happened about 4 a.m. in Brighton Park after the caravan blocked streets leading to the intersection for illegal street racing, Chicago police Cmdr. Don Jerome said during a news conference. Those killed were between the ages of 15 and 20, Jerome said, adding that the two wounded are expected to survive. Police made no immediate arrests. Caravans blocking streets for drag racing, cars turning doughnuts and “drifting” are a “semi-recent phenomenon where they gather throughout different points of the city, and there were several others last night of no consequence … until this one,” Jerome said. The City Council member for the neighborhood where Sunday’s shooting happened said police and other city officials needed to act more aggressively to shut down such caravans. “This is not just fun and games on the street,” Alderman Raymond Lopez told reporters at the scene. “We are seeing gangs and criminality join into the drifting and drag racing.”\n\nIndiana\n\nCrown Point: A northwestern Indiana man who pleaded guilty to fatally shooting his 9-year-old daughter as he was talking to her two brothers about gun safety won’t serve any prison time for her 2017 death. A Lake County judge sentenced Eric S. Hummel, 38, on Thursday to one year to be served in the county’s community corrections program while living at home, followed by 31/ 2 years of probation. Judge Natalie Bokota accepted the Hobart man’s guilty plea to reckless homicide and neglect of a dependent charges in Olivia Hummel’s death, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. Prosecutors had sought an 81/ 2 -year prison sentence for Hummel, but Bokota said she agreed with Hummel’s attorneys that incarcerating him would result in further trauma to his boys. According to court records, Hummel said he was showing a handgun to his sons and telling them to never play with it “because it can kill someone” when he accidentally shot and killed his daughter. Hummel told a 911 dispatcher he didn’t realize the gun was loaded when he pulled the trigger. He admitted in his plea agreement that he was talking to his sons about gun safety in a bedroom of his Hobart home in June 2017 when he pointed a handgun at the boys and pulled the trigger.\n\nIowa\n\nGrinnell: In a rare move, leaders of Grinnell College and the city appealed this month for the public’s help to put an end to racial harassment, slurs and graffiti that have shaken the campus community this fall. In an open letter to the public Oct. 16, Grinnell Mayor Dan F. Agnew and Grinnell College President Anne F. Harris asked residents to mobilize against the harassment against black citizens, students and community members and not be complacent to any racism they may witness. They urged residents to report any harassment or vandalism to police, tip police if they know any individuals who have been involved, and to enroll in bystander intervention training to help prevent future incidents. Grinnell police said Friday that they had only one formal incident report, and no arrests had been made. But in a statement to the campus community Oct. 12, the private college said there had been several incidents, including defacement of campus signs and vehicles with racist and white supremacist graffiti and harassment of community members by “unknown individuals screaming slurs from moving vehicles.” “We also know that additional incidents may not have been reported,” the statement said. Grinnell, routinely ranked as one of the nation’s best liberal arts colleges, has a diverse student body.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Two years after her mate’s death, a female lion at the Topeka Zoo has grown a mane. The confident, sassy African lion named Zuri was always pretty much in charge of her three-member pride at the zoo, said her animal curator, Shanna Simpson. But staff members were still taken aback when, in the wake of her mate’s death two years ago, the aging lioness began growing what appeared to be a “mohawk” atop her head. That was followed by a rare and significant growth of the fur around Zuri’s head and neck, Simpson said. Zuri is intelligent, feisty and easy to train, Simpson said. The Topeka Zoo acquired Zuri and sister Asante in 2005 from the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas, then in 2006 it acquired Avus from the Henry Vilas Zoo in Madison, Wisconsin, to mate with Zuri and Asante. Avus had a large mane. Female African lions are attracted to males with large manes, Simpson said. Those manes help protect the males as they fight with other lions and with predators such as leopards and hyenas, she said. Zoo staff suspect Zuri’s increase in fur was triggered by the death of Avus, which left she and her sister as the only remaining members of their pride, Simpson said. “She feels like she needs to protect her pride, so her testosterone increases,” Simpson said. “And boom, she’s got more fur around her neck.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Local public transit workers have authorized a strike, but they aren’t walking out just yet. Union members with the Transit Authority of River City voted 95% in favor of the strike authorization Thursday, amid contentious contract negotiations. For now, buses will continue to run as scheduled, with no immediate plans to initiate a strike, Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1447 President Lillian Brents said after the vote. The two sides are set to return to the bargaining table Nov. 2. Union leadership said workers want “a safe workplace and a fair contract.” The union is asking for a 6% raise for all workers after one year and 4% raises after years two and three, along with a cost-of-living adjustment of 1.25% every six months. TARC has offered a 3% raise for technical maintenance workers and radio room employees, a 2.5% raise for coach operators and a 1% raise for nontechnical maintenance workers, according to the union. The raises would take place in each year of the three-year contract. They do not include a cost-of-living adjustment. TARC claims the union’s salary demands are unrealistic and would exceed TARC’s annual budget, which is set by Louisville’s mayor and Metro Council.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Prohibitions against nonunanimous jury convictions – outlawed by Louisiana voters in 2018 and, later, by the U.S. Supreme Court – do not have to apply retroactively to earlier convictions, Louisiana’s highest court ruled Friday. The ruling came in the case of Reginald Reddick, convicted of murder by a 10-2 jury vote in 1997, but the court acknowledged it had implications for hundreds of others convicted with 10-2 or 11-1 jury votes. In 2018, Louisiana voters approved a constitutional amendment prohibiting nonunanimous verdicts in trials for crimes committed after Jan. 1, 2019. At the time, Louisiana was one of only two states allowing such verdicts. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that nonunanimous verdicts were unconstitutional, broadening the effect of the state constitutional amendment. But in 2021, the Supreme Court made clear in a case known as Ramos v. Louisiana that its decision against nonunanimous verdicts applied only to future cases and cases in which the defendants’ appeals had not been exhausted. Friday’s state high court majority ruling by Justice Scott Crichton cited the Ramos case and other jurisprudence in determining that neither federal nor state law required a retroactive application of the prohibition.\n\nMaine\n\nLewiston: A Republican congressional hopeful in a highly competitive race is spreading misinformation about the state’s housing policies, public housing directors said. Former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin is challenging Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who narrowly defeated the Republican in 2018. During his campaign, Poliquin has relayed a story about a woman living in her car who allegedly told him she was taken off a housing list because of immigrants who are living in the country illegally. Poliquin, who has focused his campaign on issues such as curtailing immigration and protecting gun rights, used the anecdote as part of his argument for increased border security. The Maine Association of Public Housing Authority Directors rebuked the story on Thursday with a statement to the Bangor Daily News that did not name the candidate but came in response to his statements. The statement said: “Such misinformation erodes trust in the public housing system on which so many individuals and families depend for safe, quality affordable housing, and it cannot be left uncorrected.” Eligibility for federal housing assistance is limited to U.S. citizens and noncitizens who have eligible immigration status, federal rules state.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A video shows Republican Dan Cox, who is running for governor, accepting a gift from a young man wearing a shirt with a Proud Boys insignia during the candidate’s primary victory party this summer. The video, obtained by The Washington Post, shows Cox accepting a comb from him. “Here, this is a present from Maryland Proud Boys to you,” the young man said in video footage publicly posted on Cox’s Vimeo account. Members of the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, were involved in storming the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. After accepting the gift, Cox asked the man’s name and shook his hand. “Nice to meet you,” Cox said, before greeting other supporters. The Washington Post reports the clip was removed after the newspaper contacted Cox’s campaign, which responded with a statement denying an association with the young man. “In the noise of the victory celebration, it was hard to hear what was being said,” Cox said, adding that he was surprised by the man handing him something and that “frankly, I did not even keep the comb.” Cox has reiterated false claims that the 2020 presidential election “was stolen” from Donald Trump, and he volunteered to help decertify results in Pennsylvania. He has also issued denials and apologies about his conduct surrounding Jan. 6. Although he said he attended the “Stop the Steal” rally, he has said he left before the march to the Capitol.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlympton: A nearly three-week strike by truckers at New England’s largest wholesale food distributor has come to an end with a new labor agreement, the Teamsters union said. The five-year agreement includes an immediate $5 per hour pay raise, an $11 per hour raise over the course of the agreement, improved retirement benefits, and keeps drivers on the union health insurance plan, the Teamsters Local 653 said in a Facebook post Thursday. About 300 workers at the Sysco facility in Plympton south of Boston went on strike Oct. 1. “I’ve never been prouder to be a Teamster. This fight proves that we truly are the biggest, fastest, strongest union in the world,” Local 653 shop steward Kevin Whitten said. “This strike brought members together like never before and built solidarity that will continue for years to come.” An email seeking comment was left Friday with a spokesperson for Houston-based Sysco. More than a dozen picketers at the facility were arrested early Monday after blocking the exits with tractor-trailers and preventing some employees from leaving. Sysco, which has distribution facilities across the country, supplies food to schools, hospitals, nursing homes, restaurants and other businesses. The Plympton facility remained operational during the strike with third-party drivers.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A teenager accused of killing four fellow students and injuring more at his high school is expected to plead guilty to murder this week, authorities said Friday. Ethan Crumbley had created images of violence during a classroom assignment last November but was not sent home from Oxford High School in southeastern Michigan. He pulled out a gun a few hours later and committed a mass shooting. Authorities have pinned some responsibility on Crumbley’s parents, portraying them as a dysfunctional pair who ignored their son’s mental health needs and happily provided a gun as a gift just days before the attack. They also face charges. Crumbley, 16, is due in court Monday. “We can confirm that the shooter is expected to plead guilty to all 24 charges, including terrorism, and the prosecutor has notified the victims,” said David Williams, chief assistant prosecutor in Oakland County. A message seeking comment was left for the boy’s lawyers. Crumbley was 15 when the shooting occurred at Oxford High, roughly 30 miles north of Detroit.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Two former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd’s death are heading to trial on state aiding and abetting counts, the third and likely final criminal proceeding in a killing that mobilized protesters worldwide against racial injustice in policing. J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao have already been convicted of federal counts for violating Floyd’s civil rights and begun serving those sentences. Many witnesses expected to testify at their state trial have already done so at both their federal trial and at the state trial against their former colleague, Derek Chauvin. While much of the evidence in this proceeding will look similar, there will be some key differences. Jury selection gets underway Monday.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: Hundreds of people applauded – and some wiped away tears – as the community unveiled a larger-than-life statue of Emmett Till on Friday, not far from where white men kidnapped and killed the Black teenager over accusations he had flirted with a white woman in a country store. “Change has come, and it will continue to happen,” Madison Harper, a senior at Leflore County High School, told a racially diverse audience at the statue’s dedication. “Decades ago, our parents and grandparents could not envision that a moment like today would transpire.” The 1955 lynching became a catalyst for the civil rights movement. Till’s mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, insisted on an open-casket funeral in Chicago so the world could see the horrors inflicted on her 14-year-old son. Jet magazine published photos of his mutilated body, which was pulled from the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi. The 9-foot-tall bronze statue in Greenwood’s Rail Spike Park is a jaunty depiction of the living Till in slacks, dress shirt and tie with one hand on the brim of a hat. The rhythm and blues song “Wake Up, Everybody” played as workers pulled a tarp off the figure. Dozens of people surged forward, shooting photos and video on cellphones.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft, a top Republican prospect for governor, wants to block public funding for library books that might appeal to the “prurient” – meaning sexual – interests of minors. Ashcroft proposed the new rule on libraries last week. It does not include a more-detailed definition or include examples of which specific books would be restricted as appealing sexually to children or teenagers. In a statement, the Missouri Library Association called Ashcroft’s rule “an infringement on the professional judgment of librarians, and an effort to further stoke division in the communities that libraries serve.” The group warned that small and urban libraries, which rely most on state funding, would face the greatest impact from the policy. Ashcroft on Friday said he didn’t propose the rule in response to any particular book but hoped it would prevent potential issues. “I know that a lot of Missouri libraries are doing a good job on this and reflecting the values of the taxpayers that paid for the materials,” Ashcroft said. “But I just think it’s good to have some guidelines to make sure that we’re reinforcing that parents are in control.” The proposal would require state-funded libraries to adopt policies on the age-appropriateness of literature, which is already common at both school and public libraries in the state. And under the rule, anyone could challenge access to books. The proposal is what’s known as an administrative rule, which would have the same effect as a law if enacted.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Two physician groups have asked state election officials to issue a correction to statements printed in a voter information pamphlet that they argue are false and and could confuse voters as they consider an abortion-related ballot measure. The complaint comes from two groups that oppose a referendum that would raise the prospect of criminal charges for health care providers unless they take “all medically appropriate and reasonable actions to preserve the life” of an infant born alive, including after an attempted abortion. At issue is language in the pamphlet written by supporters that explains the proposed measure. Supporters say the referendum requires medical care to be provided if an infant is born alive after induced labor, cesarean section, attempted abortion or other method. The physicians say that supporters dropped a word from the language of the proposal and that the law, if passed, would also apply to an infant born as a result of natural labor, even if a fetus was born extremely preterm, and regardless of the infant’s prognosis or the family’s wishes. The complaint was made Friday by the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology on Friday. They asked the Montana Secretary of State’s Office to issue a correction to statements.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific delivered 13% more profit in the third quarter, but the railroad predicted Thursday that its customers will ship fewer items than it expected, confirming the economy is slowing down in the face of soaring inflation. The Omaha-based railroad said it now expects the number of shipments it handles to be up about 3% this year and match the third-quarter number. Previously, Union Pacific had predicted that volume would be up 4% to 5% this year. “I have no idea if we’re in a recession or one is looming,” UP CEO Lance Fritz said. “I do know that the economy is slowing down.” Union Pacific reported $1.9 billion profit, or $3.05 per share, in the quarter. That’s up from $1.67 billion, or $2.57 per share, a year ago, but this year’s results were weighed down because the new contracts the railroads agreed to with their 12 unions cost $114 million more than Union Pacific had been planning on. Without that one-time charge for the new contracts, which only half of the unions have approved, Union Pacific would have reported earnings per share of $3.19. The results exceeded Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $3.06 per share.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A rural county can start hand-counting mail-in ballots two weeks before Election Day, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday, but it won’t be allowed to livestream the tallying and must make other changes to its plans. The ruling came in response to an emergency petition filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, which challenged several aspects of Nye County’s plan to start hand-counting votes this week. The ACLU said in its lawsuit that the plan risked leaking early voting results. It also said that rules on touch screens to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act were too vague and restrictive and that the county violated state law with its “stringent signature verification” for voter ID. Located between Las Vegas and Reno, rural Nye County was one of the first jurisdictions nationwide to act on election conspiracies related to mistrust in voting machines. Alongside the primary machine tabulation process, Interim County Clerk Mark Kampf’s plans to publicly hand-count all paper ballots. The hand count was first proposed to county commissioners by Republican secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant in response to false claims about Dominion voting machines. Sadmira Ramic, the ACLU of Nevada’s voting rights attorney, praised the ruling.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nKeene: A small plane crashed into a building, killing the two people on board and sparking a large fire on the ground, authorities said. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement Saturday that a single-engine Beechcraft Sierra aircraft crashed into a building north of Keene Dillant-Hopkins Airport in Keene on Friday evening. City officials said on their Facebook page that no one was injured in the building hit by the plane but that “those on the plane have perished.” “The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate. The NTSB will be in charge of the investigation and will provide additional updates,” the FAA said. Keene Mayor George Hansel told the Associated Press that two people on the plane died but that they have not been identified. He said the the plane hit a two-story barn connected to a multi-family apartment building. All eight people were evacuated from the apartment building due to the subsequent fire. At a morning press conference, Hansel said the plane was owned by Monadnock Aviation, which is based at the airport. He said it was unclear where the plane was headed, and no one answered the phone at Monadnock. The cause of the crash remains under investigation, and the operations at the airport were not affected, he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s new K-12 public school mental health plan is facing lots of opposition from state lawmakers who say they won’t back its proposal to eliminate the decades-old School Based Youth Services program, which provides critical counseling and support for teens in low-performing districts. The School Based Youth Services program, set up in 90 of the state’s public schools, is scheduled to be eliminated by June 2023 to make way for NJ4S, New Jersey Statewide Student Support Service Network, an expanded and revamped system that would be available to all or most of the state’s 2,400 schools. Unveiled in October as a “first-in-the-nation” effort to centralize services and spread them beyond schools and into libraries, group homes and social service agencies, NJ4S was in the works for more than a year and created as a response to the pandemic’s teen mental health crisis under the guidance of Department of Children and Families’ Commissioner Christine Norbut Beyer. But it was immediately met with intense criticism from educators and advocates who support expanding services but said the time-tested school-based programs must also stay.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The U.S. Department of Agriculture will waive cost-sharing requirements for farmers and ranchers affected by the largest wildfire in the state’s recorded history. U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján on Thursday announced that the agency will cover cost sharing for emergency forest restoration, conservation and other environmental improvement programs. The move follows the approval of a massive federal spending bill that included $2.5 billion in relief for those affected by the fire and post-fire flooding. That bill included a provision to waive cost sharing for all programs administered by the USDA. The wildfire was sparked by two government planned burns earlier this year. It ripped through hundreds of square miles of forest and grazing lands, destroying homes and the livelihoods of many of the rural residents. Through no fault of their own, Luján said, residents lost large swaths of cherished lands and will have to grapple with the effects for years. “Our farmers and ranchers, business owners and families deserve relief to recover,” he said in a statement.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: The victims of a racist mass shooting at a Buffalo supermarket will be honored with a permanent memorial in the neighborhood, elected and community leaders announced Friday. The shooting “is part of the Buffalo story forever going forward,” Gov. Kathy Hochul said. “We want to do something that people remember. A place to come and reflect. A place to honor. And a place to say never again.” Former Buffalo Fire Commissioner Garnell Whitfield, whose 86-year-old mother Ruth Whitfield was among the 10 Black people killed May 14, is among those appointed to a planning commission tasked with acquiring land, seeking input on the design, securing funds and maintaining the monument. Buffalo NAACP President Mark Blue will lead the effort. “It’s not going to take the place of my mother or the lives of the other loved ones that were lost here,” Whitfield said. “So we will forever miss them and honor their legacy by what we do going forward.” The officials did not specify a budget or timeline for the project’s completion. Brown said numerous businesses and people have offered to contribute. Payton Gendron, 19, has been charged with killing 10 and wounding three others at the Tops Friendly Market. Investigators said he drove 200 miles from his Conklin home intending to kill as many Black people as possible at the store, which he targeted because of its location in the predominantly Black East Buffalo neighborhood. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSalisbury: A man who was shot during a weekend concert at Livingstone College has been identified as a suspected shooter and is now facing charges, officials said Tuesday. The shooting took place Saturday during a performance featuring rapper Asian Doll at the historically Black college in Salisbury. Police are also asking for help identifying another person of interest. Salisbury police obtained a warrant charging Talib Latrell Kelly, 21, of Salisbury, with attempted first-degree murder, discharging a firearm on educational property and possession of a firearm by a felon, the department said. Kelly is not a Livingstone student, Salisbury police Capt. P.J. Smith said at a news conference. Officers were called to the campus about 11 p.m. and found gunshot victims and others who had been hurt as concertgoers fled the gunfire, city officials said in a statement. Video footage from the event shows that a fight broke out while Asian Doll was on stage. Two male victims were taken to Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center in Charlotte with gunshot wounds, and officials also identified a woman who had a superficial wound to her neck, Smith said. None of the victims’ injuries were considered life-threatening, he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A North Dakota farmer who had been detained in Ukraine since November 2021 on accusations he planned to kill his business partner is back home, the state’s two U.S. senators announced Friday. Kurt Groszhans, from Ashley, North Dakota, has ancestors from Ukraine and went there to farm in 2017. The relationship with his partner, law professor Roman Leshchenko, crumbled after Groszhans alleged that Leshchenko embezzled money from him. Groszhans and his assistant were arrested on charges of plotting to assassinate Leshchenko, who was then Ukraine’s agriculture minister. Groszhans said in a statement Friday that the Ukrainian officials made up the charges in an “effort to shut me up” after he discovered corruption “at the highest levels” of the government. “I am grateful to be home after this horrible ordeal,” Groszhans said in a statement. “My family and supporters worked tirelessly over a long period of time to make this happen and it was nice to be able to celebrate my birthday on North Dakota soil. The fact they refused to classify me as a wrongful detainee was an unfortunate and politically cowardly act that cost me almost a year of my life,” he said.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state of Ohio will not require the COVID-19 vaccine for school students despite a recommendation from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel. A panel with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday recommended adding the COVID-19 vaccine to the federal government’s list of routinely recommended vaccinations. The panel’s decision, likely to be adopted by the CDC director, formally adds the shot to a list often used by schools and health officials in making vaccination requirements. Ohio leaders made it clear Friday that the vaccine would not be required for Ohio students. “The State of Ohio does not mandate the COVID-19 vaccine for school attendance. The ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) vote does not change Ohio law. The state’s list of required vaccines can only be changed through legislation,” Ohio Department of Health Director Bruce Vanderhoff said in a statement. Indeed, not every vaccine on the list has been adopted by Ohio as a requirement for schoolchildren, such as flu shots. A list of required vaccines for schools and child care in Ohio can be viewed on the Ohio Department of Health website.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A private foundation has raised more than $6 million to build a residence for future Oklahoma governors and their families, under a plan that calls for the current mansion near the state Capitol to be used for official meetings and special events, according to Gov. Kevin Stitt and people involved in the project. Talks about building a new home on the mansion grounds predate Stitt’s inauguration in 2019 and grew out of concerns about the cost of renovating the century-old structure. Stitt told reporters on Wednesday that he and his family – who lived only temporarily in the mansion – would not live in the new residence if he wins a second term next month. “It will not benefit Gov. Stitt,” he said. The foundation, Friends of the Mansion, is expected to announce plans for the residence after the Nov. 8 election. The foundation was created in 1995 by former Gov. Frank Keating and former first lady Cathy Keating to pay for renovations and additions. The new residence is envisioned for land behind the current mansion. Plans would have to be approved by two zoning commissions that oversee the area near the Capitol.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The mayor plans to ban camping on city streets and move unhoused people to designated campsites, as the growing homeless population has become the top concern for the vast majority of residents. “The magnitude and the depth of the homeless crisis in our city is nothing short of a humanitarian catastrophe,” Mayor Ted Wheeler said Friday. “We need to move our scattered, vulnerable homeless population closer to the services that they need.” The resolution would establish at least three large, designated outdoor camping sites, with the first opening within 18 months of securing funding. Wheeler didn’t specify when the funding would be confirmed or how much the measure would cost. The designated camping sites would initially be able to serve up to 125 people and would provide access to services such as food, hygiene, litter collection and treatment for mental health and substance abuse, Wheeler said. The sites could eventually serve 500 people. Oregon’s homelessness crisis has been fueled by a housing shortage, the coronavirus pandemic and drug addiction. More than 3,000 people are living without shelter in Portland, a 50% jump from 2019, and there are more than 700 encampments across the city, Wheeler said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s elections chief wants legal penalties against two Republican county officials and their lawyer for what she calls in a new court filing their “unprecedented, reckless decision” to give an outside group access to voting machines during pending litigation on that subject. Lawyers for acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman last week asked the state Supreme Court to hold in contempt the two Fulton County commissioners and to dismiss the litigation that had been scheduled for oral argument before the justices this week. Chapman was appointed by Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. On Friday afternoon, the justices appointed Commonwealth Court Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer as a special master to gather evidence on the contempt request and make a report with recommendations by Nov. 18. During their long-running dispute with the state, Fulton County GOP Commissioners Stuart Ulsh and Randy Bunch had allowed one group, Wake TSI, access to voting machines as part of the failed effort to locate fraud that might overturn ex-President Donald Trump’s 2020 election defeat. That prompted the Department of State to tell counties they “shall not” allow such access to voting machines. Ulsh and Bunch were moments away from permitting a second group, Envoy Sage, to inspect the machines in January when the state Supreme Court put that on hold. The inspection planned in January was to involve computers, electronic poll books, ballot scanners and possibly more.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A lawsuit claiming that Brown University failed to protect female students from sexual harassment and assault can move forward in part, a federal judge ruled last week. Four former students filed a federal class action suit in August 2021 alleging that the university systemically and repeatedly failed to protect women from harm, including rape, despite knowing that sexual assault on campus is “endemic.” Two current students later joined the suit. The university moved to dismiss the suit in March. On Oct. 18, U.S. District Court Judge John J. McConnell Jr. allowed the plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief to go forward but denied their efforts to seek monetary relief. The plaintiffs were enrolled between 2018 and 2021. The plaintiffs can sue to force Brown to “ensure that the Title IX office receives, investigates and resolves complaints.” The plaintiffs must still prove that their suit meets the criteria for class-action certification. Title IX protects people from discrimination based on sex in education programs or in activities that receive federal financial assistance.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Months after accusing disbarred attorney Alex Murdaugh of killing his wife and son, investigators and prosecutors have released few details about the evidence that they believe connect him to the shootings. That’s led Murdaugh’s lawyers to file a flurry of court documents requesting information from the prosecution, seeking to publicly weaken the case before the January trial has begun. The defense attorneys argue that there was unknown DNA found under Murdaugh’s wife’s fingernails. They also have a different suspect, Murdaugh’s friend Curtis Eddie Smith, arguing that he failed a lie detector test regarding the killings. Murdaugh has already admitted to asking Smith to arrange Murdaugh’s own death to defraud his life insurance company. Those defense documents even boosted a story from Smith that prosecutors later said had no evidence to back it up – that Paul Murdaugh killed his mother, Maggie, when he caught her with a groundskeeper at the family’s Colleton County hunting lodge, and the groundskeeper then shot the son. Alex Murdaugh, 54, has proclaimed his innocence ever since June 2021, when he found the bodies, each shot several times. He has said through his lawyer he “loved them more than anything in the world.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nVermillion: The University of South Dakota may welcome a new sorority chapter in the coming years. Alpha Pi Omega, the country’s oldest Indigenous Greek letter organization, could open doors on campus if enough students express interest, according to a flier circulated on social media promoting an informational session held Oct. 13. APO is a sisterhood of Indigenous women who are committed to each other, communities, tribes, families, academic excellence and self-empowerment, according to the flier. Its philanthropic cause is the National Indian Education Association. Hanna Delange, a spokesperson for USD, said nothing has been solidified yet with the sorority’s plans but confirmed the informational session took place as a chance for students to learn about the potential organization. Brooke Poppe, director of sorority and fraternity life on USD’s campus, said while there is no current timeline to open the sorority, the plan moving forward is on hold until there is enough student interest. It takes five or more students to start any student organization on campus. When or if Poppe receives a list of interested students, USD can move forward with the APO national organization in the expansion process. Poppe said her office hopes to have that potential list together by the end of the semester.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Employees of Bess T. Shepherd Elementary School blasted a recent nighttime prayer meeting over the school’s exterior loudspeaker, although district officials said it was an accident. An unidentified neighbor who could hear the praying from inside his or her home Monday night posted a video on the Reddit website that recorded about two minutes of a speaker praying over the intercom, the Chattanooga Times Free Press reports. “This went on for 45 minutes,” the video caption said. The video included a woman’s voice repeatedly saying, “We need you in this school, God. We need you in every school, God.” She spoke of casting the things of hell “back to the abyss” and said: “You cannot rule in this school. You cannot rule in the hearts and minds of the children.” The speaker also prayed over staff members. District officials said the prayer meeting occurred about 6 p.m. Monday, although they were not aware of it until Thursday morning. “There were staff members inside the building praying who were unaware the external intercom system was enabled,” district spokesperson Steve Doremus said in an email. “As soon as they were made aware, the intercoms were turned off.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The Texas Department of Public Safety fired an officer Friday who was at the scene of the Uvalde school massacre and becomes the first member of the state police force to lose their job in the fallout over the hesitant response to the May attack. The department served Sgt. Juan Maldonado with termination papers, spokeswoman Ericka Miller said. No details were offered about his role at the scene of the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School or the specific reason Maldonado was fired. The firing comes five months after the mass shooting that has put state police under scrutiny over their actions on the school campus as a gunman with an AR-15-style rifle killed 19 children and two teachers. Maldonado could not be reached for comment Friday night. Body camera footage and media reports have shown the Department of Public Safety had a larger role at the scene than the department appeared to suggest after the shooting. State troopers were among the first wave of officers to arrive but did not immediately confront the gunman, which experts say goes against standard police procedure during mass shootings.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Gov. Spencer Cox hosted the first of what governors across the U.S. are planning to be a series of new discussions on how states could address mental health issues. Neither Cox nor other governors involved are proposing specific policy solutions so far, but that isn’t the point – the idea is to listen to physicians, pediatric psychologists, educators, parents and others to try to find areas of consensus. Cox, the vice chair of the National Governors Association, is among a bipartisan group of governors who have joined NGA chair Phil Murphy, the governor of New Jersey, in forwarding the “Strengthening Your Mental Health” initiative, with the ultimate goal of finding nonpartisan policies that states everywhere might adopt. Over two days at a roundtable event in Salt Lake City, Cox, a Republican, and Murphy, a Democrat, hosted a series of conversations on the topic, hoping to hear experts’ opinions on potential solutions connected to prevention, early intervention and resilience building. “Youth mental health is an urgent issue in Utah and nationwide,” Cox said. “The (COVID-19) pandemic has heightened the problem, and it’s important that we be proactive in bolstering support resources and letting young people know that help is available.”\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Albans: A fired deputy who is the only candidate on the November ballot to become sheriff of the county where he served was charged Friday with simple assault for kicking a shackled prisoner, authorities said. John Grismore, 49, of Fairfax, was cited on the charge Friday through his attorney. He is due in court Monday in St. Albans to answer the charge, Vermont State Police said in a news release. Surveillance cameras recorded the prisoner being kicked Aug. 7. In the Aug. 9 primary, Grismore won the nominations of both Franklin County’s Republican and Democratic parties to have his name on the November ballot for sheriff. But after the video became public, he was suspended and then fired by outgoing Franklin County Sheriff Roger Langevin. The county Republican and Democratic parties gave their support to a write-in campaign by Sheriff’s department Lt. Mark Lauer, a 27-year Vermont State Police veteran who has been at the department for nearly a decade. Gale Messier is also running a write-in campaign. He spent decades in law enforcement including 20 years at the sheriff’s department in Chittenden County, Vermont’s most populous county. On Friday, Grismore said in an email that “the story is still the same” and that he had nothing new to add.\n\nVirginia\n\nFort Belvoir: A “barricade situation” drew the FBI and other law enforcement officials to a U.S. Army base outside the nation’s capital Sunday, according to the official Twitter account of Fort Belvoir in northern Virginia. The base tweeted shortly before 1 p.m. that its law enforcement officials, local police and the FBI had responded “to a barricade situation” Sunday morning. “The situation is ongoing, & we cannot comment further at this time,” the base tweeted. It provided no other details except to say some of the gates to the installation remained open. The situation was inside a home, WUSA-TV reports. Fort Belvoir sits on about 8,800 acres of land along the Potomac River in Fairfax County and is located about 20 miles south of Washington. The base is home to several Army command headquarters, elements of the Army Reserve and Army National Guard and nine Department of Defense agencies, according to a Department of Defense website that serves the military community. The installation has 2,154 family housing quarters and seven child youth service facilities, according to Fort Belvoir’s 2022 strategic plan.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Authorities said Friday that they arrested three suspects in the slayings of two people and shooting of a police officer after a daylong search on a tribal reservation in northeastern Washington. The Colville Tribes Emergency Services said on Facebook on Friday evening that the third suspect was arrested in Elmer City, one of several small communities on the rural reservation. Two others were arrested earlier in the day. The search for the suspects began after the Colville Tribal Police Department responded to a report of a shooting Thursday in Keller, a small community about 275 miles east of Seattle. Officers found two people dead, and an officer who came across a vehicle described as having left the scene was shot in the arm, according to the department. He was doing well after being transported for medical care, the department said in a news release. Police identified two of the suspects as Curry Pinkham and Zachary Holt. Robin Redstar, a Colville Tribal member and Nespelem resident, said she and other residents waited in their home for hours, and at one point one of the suspects was believed to be in a gully behind her house. Authorities eventually arrested a man in front of her home around 10 a.m. after he tried to enter her neighbor’s back door, Redstar said. Her neighbor, a hunter with guns, was able to detain the man and get him to the street, where a tribal police car was waiting, Redstar said. “It was pretty quick. Corbie (the neighbor) was giving him a good speech about morals,” she said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Voters will get the final say on a ballot question that would amend the state constitution to give the Republican-dominated Legislature control over virtually every aspect of public schooling. The vote comes amid a fight raging nationally over the politicization of schools. West Virginia’s Republican leaders have joined politicians elsewhere in pushing to regulate how subjects such as race are taught in classrooms and funnel public money into alternative education options, including charter schools and voucher programs. Just this year, the state Board of Education joined a lawsuit against top Republicans over a school choice program – one of the nation’s most expansive – alleging it unconstitutionally drains money from public schools. The case went to the state Supreme Court, which sided with lawmakers. And in a state that once was a stronghold of organized labor, some see the proposed amendment as part of an effort to defang the most formidable center of union power left standing: public school employees. Four years after more than 30,000 school workers went on strike in one of the nation’s poorest states, igniting teacher walkouts nationwide, many say they’re overworked and exhausted.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A Milwaukee County judge on Friday denied a Republican Party of Wisconsin request to stop the city of Milwaukee from continuing a get-out-the-vote effort that the city argues it neither runs nor funds. Judge Gwen Connolly wrote that the arguments made by the party and Milwaukee voter Elizabeth Burke were “deficient” and that issuing such an order would chill constitutionally protected free speech. The lawsuit was one of two filed by the Republican Party of Wisconsin and other plaintiffs in the weeks after Mayor Cavalier Johnson made comments Sept. 12 about an initiative dubbed “Milwaukee Votes 2022” and referenced door-to-door canvassing funded by the “private sector.” Johnson’s spokesman then said the campaign conducting the canvassing is privately funded, and the city’s association was “limited to the mayor voicing support for the work.” The first lawsuit, which centered on an open records request, was dismissed earlier this month after the party said it had received the requested records from the Milwaukee Election Commission and Mayor’s Office related to the get-out-the-vote effort. In the second lawsuit, filed Sept. 28, Burke and Republicans argued that though Milwaukee Votes 2022 is a purportedly nonpartisan get-out-the-vote effort, the city would partner with an organization, GPS Impact, that openly works to elect Democratic candidates and advance progressive causes.\n\nWyoming\n\nPinedale: A hunter accidentally shot himself in the leg while trying to fight off a grizzly bear attack in west-central Wyoming – the second such attack in a week’s time, officials said. Lee Francis, 65, of Evanston, was taken to the University of Utah Health hospital for treatment after the encounter Friday, the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office said. Francis was hunting with his son in an area south of Grand Teton National Park on Friday evening when the bear attacked him. He was able to fire several rounds from his handgun, causing the bear to run away, but one of the rounds hit Francis in the lower leg, the sheriff’s office said. His son used a satellite phone to call for help just before 6 p.m., then began providing first aid. His son was able to help his father onto a horse, and they headed toward a nearby lake to meet search and rescue crews. Francis was eventually taken to the hospital via helicopter, the sheriff’s office said in a statement. Wildlife officials had not located the grizzly bear, Sgt. Travis Bingham with the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office said Sunday. Because it was snowing, Game and Fish planned to try to search for the bear again Monday, weather permitting, he said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/25/eagle-cam-lynching-memorial-midwest-wildfires-news-around-states/50871577/", "title": "Eagle cam, lynching memorial, Midwest wildfires: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: After the company that opened a high-tech recycling center in the city went belly-up, and a second company needed steep government subsidies to keep it running, Mayor Steven Reed said the city has decided to cut its losses, end its public recycling service and sell the building. People in Montgomery throw all their trash into one container, and it’s separated and sorted into re-sellable goods at the $37 million facility. RePower South has handled operations there since 2019, when the company poured $10 million into upgrades to produce alternative fuel. But the price of commodities crashed the following year when China changed its import policies, and the facility couldn’t claw back into the black. Since then, Montgomery has paid RePower South about $2 million in subsidies to keep plant operations afloat. Reed said the company may continue to provide service temporarily, but the subsidies are over. RePower South issued a statement Friday afternoon saying it “will soon be announcing a new partnership to bring an advanced plastics recycling capability to Montgomery to build a sustainable, circular economy.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A Republican gubernatorial candidate faces accusations he sexually harassed a former assistant while he was a borough mayor. The lawsuit filed Friday accuses Charlie Pierce of “constant unwanted physical touching, sexual remarks, and sexual advances,” the Anchorage Daily News reports. The woman’s Anchorage-based attorney, Caitlin Shortell, said in an email to the Associated Press that it was filed in the Kenai Superior Court, and she expected a judge to be assigned Monday. “When an elected official abuses their power and position to sexually harass public servants, they must be held accountable,” Shortell said. The AP does not normally identify alleged victims in sexual harassment cases. Pierce is one of four candidates running for governor in Alaska, and all appeared at a forum Saturday morning in Anchorage. “I have no comments on future litigation,” Pierce told the AP following the debate. He said he also had no plans to end his campaign just a few weeks before the Nov. 8 election. “I’ll be in the race,” he said. The lawsuit also names the Kenai Peninsula Borough south of Anchorage as a defendant in the case, claiming the local government failed to protect the woman. She claims the borough provided no way to report harassment or discrimination without fear of reprisal.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A man who runs a veterans charity lied about serving in the Army and duped Arizonans – including a retired veteran with cancer and a disabled Iraq War combat medic – out of tens of thousands of dollars, according to family and former supporters. Matt Augee of RecFX Foundation gained trust within military and church communities by touting himself as a warrior and his nonprofit as a Christian cause. He used humor, generosity and encouragement of people’s dreams to suck both the wealthy and the struggling into his schemes, people who know him said. In some cases, Augee’s actions derailed lives, depriving veterans of their nest eggs and leaving at least one military mother homeless, an investigation found. Augee denies wrongdoing. Former supporters, including Augee’s own parents, have tried to stop him by attempting to dissolve the organization and notifying local and federal authorities of their concerns. The Arizona Attorney General’s Office has closed at least two investigations without charges, while other agencies did not take action on complaints. Augee continues to operate his foundation, although the IRS website indicates it revoked its status as a nonprofit organization in 2019.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Federal prosecutors have asked a judge to dismiss wire fraud and bribery charges against a former state senator who was set to face trial next month for a second time after a jury deadlocked last year. Gilbert Baker, who also served as a former chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas, was accused of conspiring with a former state judge who admitted to lowering a jury’s award in a negligence lawsuit in exchange for campaign contributions. The judge, Mike Maggio, pleaded guilty to bribery in 2015 and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. In August 2021, a federal jury acquitted Baker of bribery conspiracy and deadlocked on another bribery charge and seven wire fraud charges. He was set to go on trial again Nov. 8, but prosecutors filed a motion Thursday seeking to dismiss the indictment against Baker. The motion did not give a reason for the dismissal, and a judge must still approve it. Baker’s attorney, Blake Hendrix, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that he was preparing to go to trial up until he received the motion. He declined to comment until the indictment is dismissed. Baker’s case was among several corruption cases filed against lawmakers and lobbyists in recent years.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday vowed he would serve a full four-year term if reelected in November, trying again to knock down speculation that he wants to replace Democrat Joe Biden on the ballot should he not seek a second term. Newsom made the promise during an hourlong debate with his Republican challenger, state Sen. Brian Dahle – the only time the two candidates will meet face to face before voting ends Nov. 8. Newsom is expected to easily win reelection in November more than one year after beating back a recall attempt fueled by anger at his pandemic policies, which included the nation’s first statewide stay-at-home order. He has barely campaigned in California this year, instead spending money on ads in challenging Republican leaders Florida and Texas – potential opponents in a presidential election. “Everyday Californians understand what is happening here in California, and the governor is focused on running for president,” Dahle said during a debate that was broadcast live on the radio by KQED News. Asked directly by co-moderator Marisa Lagos if he would commit to serving all four years if he’s reelected, Newsom said “yes.” He defended his national campaigning, saying he “barely” left the state to take on national Republican leaders, who he said are banning books and “demeaning” the LGBT community.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: A man charged with killing 10 people at a supermarket last year is still incompetent to stand trial, a judge ruled Friday, keeping his prosecution on hold. Court proceedings against Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa, 23, have been paused since December, when a judge first found him to be mentally incompetent. The rulings mean he is unable to understand legal proceedings or work with his lawyers to defend himself. Alissa remains at the state mental hospital, where he is receiving treatment, and was not in the Boulder courtroom Friday. Relatives of those killed sat in the courtroom for the brief hearing while others watched online. District Court Judge Ingrid Bakke said Alissa’s latest evaluation Oct. 10 showed he that there was a substantial probability that he could be treated to be made competent in the “forseeable future,” echoing an outlook she first shared in March. When District Attorney Michael Dougherty said the victims’ families were frustrated with the state hospital and the doctors there, Bakke expressed sympathy, noting that there was not much either the defense or prosecution could do as Alissa underwent treatment. “It understandably is a very frustrating process,” said Bakke, who set another hearing to review Alissa’s condition for Jan. 27.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones has asked a judge to throw out a nearly $1 billion verdict against him and order a new trial in a lawsuit by Sandy Hook families, who say they were subjected to harassment and threats from Jones’ lies about the 2012 Newtown school shooting. Jones filed the requests Friday, saying Judge Barbara Bellis’ pretrial rulings resulted in an unfair trial and “a substantial miscarriage of justice.” “Additionally, the amount of the compensatory damages award exceeds any rational relationship to the evidence offered at trial,” Jones’ lawyers, Norm Pattis and Kevin Smith, wrote in the motion. Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the 15 plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Jones, declined to comment on the filing Saturday but said he and other attorneys for the Sandy Hook families will be filing a brief opposing Jones’ request. Twenty first graders and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School died in the attack on Dec. 14, 2012. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting and relatives of eight children and adults killed in the massacre sued Jones for defamation and infliction of emotional distress over his pushing the bogus narrative that the shooting was a hoax staged by “crisis actors” to impose more gun control.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A project decades in the making that promises to alleviate flooding issues in the low-income, low-lying neighborhood of Southbridge was unveiled Wednesday. The $26 million Southbridge Wilmington Wetlands Park was completed earlier this year, 16 years after initial work began and nearly a year after its expected completion because of delays in installing the gates that control the tidal flow within the wetlands. The project was funded through a mix of federal, state and local sources to restore a freshwater wetland and create a flood basin and open park space on contaminated, drained wetland bordered by A Street, Walnut Street and Garasches Lane in Wilmington. The park serves as recreation space as well as a stormwater management facility. Community leaders and elected officials said Wednesday that the project is a perfect example of environmental justice for a community of color surrounded by contaminated industrial sites and devastated by floods for decades. “It stores over 2 million gallons of stormwater that previously caused flooding in these homes back here,” said Wilmington Public Works Commissioner Kelly Williams, gesturing to homes along B Street in Southbridge. “It improves our water quality. As the stormwater traverses over a mile of wetland, it restores the tidal wetland with 62 different planted species.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University wrapped up its homecoming weekend celebration with a visit from Vice President Kamala Harris, a Howard alum, WUSA-TV reports. The nation’s first female and first Black vice president showed up at Sunday’s call to chapel, where she reflected on her time at Howard. “It’s a very special experience to be a student at the mecca,” she said. Howard University’s homecoming celebrations were back in person this year following two years of virtual celebrations due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: The most devastating storm in the city’s history wiped out the main nesting location for Harriet and M15, the famous North Fort Myers eagle couple whose lives are streamed across the globe during nesting season. “Their nest was completely demolished during Ian – not a stick left, and many of their foundational branches broke off,” said Virginia Pritchett McSpadden, whose family owns the land where the eagle nest is located. “After the storm passed, I remember having this gutted feeling that they were harmed, the trees had fallen, and they wouldn’t return to the area, but to my surprise … both eagles were spotted safe and already attempting to bring in new sticks. It brought tears to my eyes and I know to many others as well.” Losing the nest during September is actually good timing for the birds because there’s still time to rebuild and lay eggs this season. October is typically when bald eagles build and repair nests in South Florida. It’s also the time of year when the Pritchett family turns on the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam. There are actually multiple cameras that show different angles of the nest and branches on which the birds rest. The footage is streamed online to millions of viewers each year. But the camera system was damaged by Hurricane Ian as well, so it may be some time before their daily lives are streamed again.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A trial to determine whether the state can continue to ban abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy began Monday in an Atlanta courtroom with testimony from an abortion provider who criticized the restriction and said it has created confusion. Carrie Cwiak, a gynecology professor at the Emory University School of Medicine and a plaintiff in the case, shared how women have reacted when she has explained that their pregnancy was past the time period when abortion is allowed under state law. “It’s upsetting,” she said. “It’s emotional.” Women have wondered aloud what they will do next, she said. Georgia’s law bans most abortions once a “detectable human heartbeat” is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. That means most abortions in Georgia are effectively banned at a point before many people know they are pregnant. The law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed, and allows for later abortions when the mother’s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable. Cwiak said the law, however, does not provide clear guidance about when doctors can intervene. The potential criminal penalty for an error is also chilling, she said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Visitors fed pumpkins to elephants Sunday for the Honolulu Zoo’s “Ele-Fun” day, HawaiiNewsNow reports.\n\nIdaho\n\nSalmon: Officials with an Australian company’s newly opened cobalt mine in east-central Idaho say it could soon produce enough of the key ingredient in lithium batteries to build 400,000 electric vehicles annually. Officials with Jervois Global Limited held an opening ceremony this month at the remote, underground mine located in the Salmon River Mountains on federal land managed by the U.S. Forest Service. Officials said the mine will likely start operating at full capacity early in 2023, producing about 2,000 tons of cobalt. On its website, the company said it wants to “become the leading global supplier of responsibly sourced cobalt and nickel materials to serve both the battery and chemicals markets, and to provide a secure, reliable supply to customers in the face of geopolitical and other risks.” President Joe Biden in March directed the Defense Department to consider at least five metals – lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel and manganese – as essential to national security and authorized steps to bolster domestic supplies. U.S. officials want to reduce reliance on China and other countries for metals needed for electric vehicles and clean-energy storage systems. Gov. Brad Little said he toured the cobalt mine as part of the opening.\n\nIllinois\n\nStonington: A man killed last week in a central Illinois train accident has been identified as a worker who had been with a local grain cooperative for nearly a half-century, authorities said. Christian County coroner Amy Calvert Winans said Stephen “Steve” J. Jordan, 69, died Friday of multiple traumatic injuries, according to preliminary results of an autopsy performed Saturday. Legacy Grain Cooperative said in a post on its website that Jordan, who was from Moweaqua, had worked the co-op for 49 years. Christian County Sheriff Bruce Kettelkamp said Jordan was driving a rail car mover owned by the co-op when about noon Friday he crossed into the path of a Norfolk Southern engine pulling four empty cars. Jordan was pronounced dead at the accident scene. No one else was hurt in the incident, which occurred near Stonington, a village located about 20 miles southeast of Springfield.\n\nIndiana\n\nMount Vernon: More than 100 people gathered outside the city’s old courthouse on a breezy autumn Sunday to memorialize the deadliest recorded lynching of Black Hoosiers in state history. The somber ceremony capped off a months­long effort led by 17-year-old Sophie Kloppenburg, a Mount Vernon High School senior, to see a memorial honoring the slain men built on the courthouse lawn. It’s been a long time coming. One hundred and forty four years ago, in October 1878, a mob of white Posey County residents unleashed a torrent of racial violence after eight Black men were accused of raping three white women. The accused never received a trial. The mob ultimately shot, stabbed, hanged and burned to death seven men. Kloppenburg made it her mission to commemorate the lives lost when she learned of the lynchings from a family friend last year. After months of discussions with city and county leaders, and with the help of teachers, University of Southern Indiana historians and community members, Kloppenburg succeeded in securing the memorial’s place at the old courthouse. She spoke to a packed Hovey House on Sunday about the lynchings. “A mob watching African Americans hang has been replaced by a crowd watching us speak and lead,” Kloppenburg said as she recounted the events of October 1878.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A rural lawmaker wants to allow raccoons to be hunted year-round, saying their populations have grown too large, making them a nuisance. Republican state Rep. Dean Fisher plans to introduce legislation next year creating an open season on hunting for raccoons, opossums, skunks and groundhogs. Open season hunting already exists for coyotes, and a bill Fisher introduced during the last legislative session would have allowed hunting of those animals without prior state approval as well. It passed the Iowa House but stalled in the Senate. “There’s just no end of the problems with these critters. It’s just gotten out of control,” said Fisher, a retired engineer and farmer who lives in Montour. But unrestricted hunting is controversial. An open season “would cause more of these animals to die unnecessarily,” said Preston Moore, state director for the Humane Society of the United States, which opposed Fisher’s bill. “They’re native wildlife species and play an important role in a healthy and balanced ecosystem.” Wildlife in Iowa is held in the public trust, Moore said, and hunting should not be removed from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources’ oversight. “They should be managed for the benefit of all Iowans,” the Cedar Rapids resident said.\n\nKansas\n\nBelle Plaine: An undersheriff in rural Kansas is facing a manslaughter trial for fatally shooting an unarmed man with a homemade beanbag round out of his personal shotgun, a case that comes amid a national reckoning on police violence. Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Virgil Brewer, who was with the Barber County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the deadly encounter with Steven Myers in October 2017 outside a shed in Sun City, about 300 miles from Kansas City, Kansas. A civil lawsuit brought by Myers’ family against Brewer and then-Barber County Sheriff Lonnie Small was settled in 2020 after county officials agreed to pay $3.5 million. Brewer’s criminal trial is expected to focus on whether his lack of knowledge and training with the less-lethal munitions amounted to reckless involuntary manslaughter. Defense attorney David Harger did not respond to messages seeking comment on the case. Brewer has been on unpaid leave since his 2018 arrest. He has been free pending trial. “The fact of the matter is that it is not going to be a good outcome for anybody, no matter whether or not he gets convicted,” Steven Myers’ widow, Kristina Myers, told the Associated Press on Thursday. “Yes, it will be over in that sense, but this one bad decision has ruined the lives of so many people.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky public school districts and private schools that own school buses can apply for funding through a program designed to reduce diesel emissions, Gov. Andy Beshear announced. The 2022 Kentucky Clean Diesel Grant Program will reimburse up to 25% of the cost of a replacement bus, the state Energy and Environment Cabinet said in a news release Wednesday. Grant recipients have to cover the remainder. The program will provide $310,643 toward replacing aging school buses. Diesel exhaust contains pollutants that negatively affect health, especially in children, the release said. Applicants in areas that don’t meet air quality standards, proposals that achieve the most cost-effective emission reductions and applications that demonstrate the greatest reductions in emissions will be given priority. The deadline to apply is Nov. 4, and projects must be completed by Sept. 30, 2023. Apply by visiting the Division for Air Quality’s website at https://eec.ky.gov/Environmental-Protection/Air/Pages/Clean-Diesel-Grant-Program.aspx.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state Supreme Court has suspended a Baton Rouge judge without pay for 180 days for abusing her power to hold people in contempt. East Baton Rouge Parish Family Court Judge Charlene Charet Day, who has held the seat since 2011, violated the law when she issued a bench warrant that resulted in a teacher being arrested at the school where she works, the high court ruled Friday. The Louisiana Judiciary Commission, which investigates complaints of judicial conduct, recommended the six-month suspension in July, finding that Day violated rules of conduct and committed “willful misconduct” when she locked up litigants for contempt of court. Day was directed to pay the commission a $6,260 fine. The justices unanimously agreed that a suspension was warranted, though one thought a less-severe penalty was required, The Advocate reports. “Judge Day’s conduct harmed the integrity of and respect for the judiciary,” Justice William Crain wrote in the prevailing opinion. “When a judge abuses the immense power to deprive a person of their liberty, it has a profound effect on public confidence in the judiciary.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A judge declined a request by developers of a $1 billion power line to resume construction, keeping the project on hold until a judge’s decision next year on the constitutionality of a referendum that halted the project. The judge on Friday rejected an injunction by the New England Clean Energy Connect and said the case is on a “fast track” for a trial in April. Developers suggested the project is at a “tipping point” where delays could cause Massachusetts, which is funding the project, to walk away. The project, which would supply enough Canadian hydropower for 1 million homes in New England, received regulatory approvals, but Maine voters rejected the project in a referendum after construction had begun. The proposal calls for a 145-mile power line from Canada into Maine, where it could connect to the regional power grid. Most if it would follow existing utility corridors, but new section had to be cut through 53 miles of woods to reach the Canadian border. Supporters say the project is a bold step in reducing carbon in the atmosphere and would moderate electric rates in the region. Critics say those benefits are overstated and must be weighed against destruction of woodland habitat.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A federal judge has postponed the trial of Gov. Larry Hogan’s former chief of staff. The Baltimore Sun reports that Roy McGrath asked the judge through his lawyer to postpone the trial because federal prosecutors had handed over more than 8,800 pages of evidence in recent weeks. McGrath briefly served as Hogan’s top adviser before resigning after a report in the newspaper detailed a severance payment he received from the government-owned nonprofit Maryland Environmental Service. McGrath also wants the opportunity to review the evidence in his case personally, his defense attorney, Joseph Murtha, said in court Thursday. But because he lives in Florida, he cannot look at discovery documents in the case while out of state, per an agreement with the prosecution. McGrath faces an eight-count federal indictment. Charges include wire fraud, including securing a $233,648 severance payment equal to one year of salary. U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman did not immediately set a new trial date but said she would do so in the near future once all the parties were able to look at their calendars. The trial had been scheduled to begin this week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A Canadian man has been arrested in connection with a series of bomb threats last month targeting several prominent locations in Boston, police said Monday. Joshua Kimble, 42, of Peterborough, Ontario, faces multiple charges in Canada, Boston police said in a statement. A series of threats were transmitted to Boston Children’s Hospital on Sept. 9, police said. Over the next four days, the Prudential Center shopping mall, the Orpheum Theater, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Boston Public Library all received threats, police said. All shared similar details and all appeared to have originated in Canada, police said. They did not disclose a motive. Boston police, working with the FBI and the Suffolk district attorney’s office, notified the Peterborough Police Service in Canada, which was granted an arrest warrant for the suspect and a search warrant for his home. Kimble is currently being held pending trial in Canada on 12 counts of public mischief and 12 counts of false information, police said. It could not immediately be determined if the suspect had an attorney. It was not clear when or if he would face charges in the U.S. No other details were provided.\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: Prosecutors urged a jury Monday to convict three men for assisting the leaders of a plot to kidnap Michigan’s governor, saying they provided land, paramilitary training and inspiration for domestic terrorism in the months ahead of the 2020 U.S. election. Joe Morrison, Pete Musico and Paul Bellar were not charged with trying to abduct Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. But their role was critical, according to authorities, who said the trio aligned themselves with key players and repeatedly endorsed the “boogaloo,” a term that became a code word for U.S. civil war. “The plan was hatched, nurtured here in Jackson County,” said state Assistant Attorney General Sunita Doddamani. “It’s really unmistakable what these men in this case did. They promoted terrorism. They sought out terrorists, and they found them and trained them.” The trial in state court in Jackson was an offshoot of the main case handled in federal court, where Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr. were convicted of a kidnapping conspiracy. Two other men pleaded guilty, and two more were acquitted. The main charge is providing material support for a terrorist act, especially gun drills and ambush training with Fox at a rural property controlled by Morrison. Musico, Morrison’s father-in-law, also lived there.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Legislature should mandate that the Minnesota Secretary of State’s Office proofread every county’s ballots before they’re mailed out, Republican challenger Kim Crockett said Thursday as she decried ballot printing errors in four counties. Crockett acknowledged that state law does not require the office to review the ballots of each precinct across the state for accuracy – that’s long been the responsibility of Minnesota’s counties. But she suggested that Democratic incumbent Steve Simon should have caught the errors anyway, since counties are required to mail copies to his office. “I think it’s a joint responsibility, certainly, between the secretary’s office and the counties, and this is something that I think the Legislature needs to step in and fix right away,” Crockett said at a news conference. Crockett has been a harsh critic in the campaign of how Simon stresses ease-of-voting. She repeated her earlier statement that the 2020 election was “rigged” against Donald Trump and called Simon’s moves to facilitate voting amid the pandemic “lawless and partisan.” She and other Republicans were especially upset with consent decrees that Simon entered into with groups seeking temporary changes, which courts approved.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenwood: In a state where health officials expect 5,000 more births each year as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling upending abortion rights, children are more likely to die before their first birthday than in any other state. Mississippi has the nation’s highest fetal mortality rate, highest infant mortality rate and highest pre-term birth rate and is among the worst states for maternal mortality. Black women are nearly three times more likely to die due to childbirth than white women in Mississippi. As the state’s Republican leaders led the legal fight against abortion, Gov. Tate Reeves said he would do everything in his power to make Mississippi the “safest state in the nation for an unborn child.” But access to prenatal and postnatal care has dwindled in Mississippi since the June ruling, making childbirth even more dangerous for poor women and children. The only neonatal intensive care unit in the state’s impoverished Delta region closed in July under financial pressures, moving lifesaving care for ill or premature newborn babies about two hours away by car. And now the publicly owned Greenwood Leflore Hospital has announced the permanent closure of its labor and delivery unit, saying it can’t pay competitive wages and retain experienced nurses. The area’s women will need to travel about 45 minutes to give birth at a hospital.\n\nMissouri\n\nWooldridge: Roughly half of a small town burned Saturday after a wildfire spread quickly from a farm field and destroyed or heavily damaged 23 buildings, officials said. No one died, and only one person was taken to a hospital for an injury that was not life-threatening, but the entire town of Wooldridge had to be evacuated Saturday because of the fire. The blaze was sparked in a field by a combine that was harvesting crops. A nearby stretch of Interstate 70 had to be closed for nearly two hours Saturday evening because of heavy smoke. Cooper County Fire District spokesman Jim Gann said Sunday that between 4.6 and 5.4 square miles burned before the fire was brought under control. Firefighters were working Sunday to keep hot spots under control with strong winds forecast in the afternoon. Wooldridge is a town of less than 100 people about 20 miles west of Columbia along the Missouri River. Stephen Derendinger, an engineer with the Jamestown Rural Fire Protection District, said half the town is burnt. “It’s devastated,” Derendinger said. Firefighters saved the Wooldridge Baptist Church, Wooldridge Community Club and post office as they pumped water from swimming pools to help battle the blaze.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Following extensive bargaining, Gov. Greg Gianforte and public employee unions last week reached an agreement for the state pay plan, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Covering the 2024-2025 biennium, the agreement includes wage increases, health benefit cost freezes, one-time payments and other contractual changes, according to the news release. It characterized the agreement as significant, the Daily Montanan reports. “This negotiated pay plan addresses challenges faced by state and higher education employees and will keep them doing important work for Montana,” said the news release. The governor and union leaders praised the agreement in statements from the governor’s office. “This agreement reflects our commitment to our hardworking state employees for all they do for Montanans,” Gianforte said in a statement. “As Montanans and all Americans face higher prices and historic inflation, this package will help ensure we retain and recruit qualified, dedicated public employees to serve Montanans.” The Montana Federation of Public Employees also lauded the negotiations, according to the news release. “This pay plan agreement is a testament to our bargaining team’s tireless commitment to their fellow MFPE members,” MFPE President Amanda Curtis said in a statement.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Prairie fires pushed by tinder-dry conditions and winds topping 60 mph led to evacuations in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa and destroyed homes and injured two firefighters south of Nebraska’s capital city, officials said. At least two grassland fires were first reported Sunday afternoon south of Lincoln and spread quickly as winds began to pick up and push the fires north, the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office reported. The nearly 300 residents of Hallam, about 20 miles south of Lincoln, were ordered to evacuate their homes, and rural residents of southern Lancaster County and northern Gage County were urged to evacuate because of the fires. Officials also asked farmers to turn on irrigation pivots or other water sources to help combat the fires, which were contained by Sunday evening, with the help of rain showers that moved into the area. Officials said three homes and several outbuildings were destroyed in Lancaster County. Two firefighters also were injured, one seriously. Officials had not released their names or updated their medical conditions by early Monday morning. In southwestern Lancaster County, residents made plans to move cattle and other valuables to Christopher Smith’s farm south of the fires. “Everybody’s just trying to help out,” Smith said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A former Las Vegas-area politician has been indicted on a murder charge – which carries the possibility of the death penalty – in the killing of a veteran investigative journalist who wrote articles critical of him and his managerial conduct. Robert “Rob” Telles, 45, was indicted Thursday and scheduled for arraignment this Wednesday in Clark County District Court, according to court records. One of Telles’ court-appointed lawyers, Edward Kane, declined to comment about the indictment, a move by prosecutors that means Telles will not face a preliminary hearing of evidence that had been set for this week. Telles, 45, a Democrat, lost his party primary in June and has been stripped by court order of his position as Clark County Administrator, heading the office that handles assets of people who die without a will or family contacts. The state Supreme Court has suspended Telles’ law license pending a State Bar of Nevada investigation of allegations that he misappropriated client funds. He was arrested Sept. 7, several days after the Sept. 2 stabbing death of Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter Jeff German outside German’s home. Telles is being held without bail at the Clark County jail. District Attorney Steve Wolfson has said he’ll make a decision in coming weeks whether Telles will face the death penalty.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The father of Harmony Montgomery, a girl who disappeared in 2019 at age 5 but was not reported missing until late last year, has been arrested on a charge of second-degree murder, authorities said Monday. He is accused of repeatedly striking her in the head with a closed fist that December. Other counts against Adam Montgomery, 32, include falsifying physical evidence and abuse of a corpse between December 2019 and March 2020. Authorities did not say whether the girl’s body had been found. Montgomery, also is charged with tampering with a witness by attempting to cause his wife and Harmony’s stepmother, Kayla Montgomery, to provide false testimony. He is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Manchester. An attorney for Adam Montgomery did not immediately comment. “I do want to again express my deepest sympathies to Harmony’s family, friends and loved ones,” state Attorney General John Formella said at the news conference in Manchester. “We understand that today’s news, while significant for purposes of this investigation, is yet another difficult moment for those who loved Harmony and those who have followed this case.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNeptune: Nurses at Jersey Shore University Medical Center ratified a three-year contract that is expected to increase wages, keep veteran nurses on board and enhance security at the hospital, union officials said Sunday. The contract, approved three months before the current agreement was set to expire, could increase pay for many nurses by 8% to 11%, said Debbie White, president of the Health Professionals and Allied Employees union. “These workers have been adamant that working conditions must improve, and we are now on the right path,” White said. Jersey Shore University Medical Center, owned by Edison-based Hackensack Meridian Health, is the region’s biggest hospital, with 691 beds. Like its competitors, it has faced a series of challenges in recent years, including pressure from insurers to lower costs; a labor shortage; and COVID-19. In mid-September, the union released a survey of its members and found 79% said hospital management doesn’t take adequate steps to keep them safe; 58% didn’t feel safe working in the hospital; and 54% said they wouldn’t feel safe being treated there. Hackensack Meridian said the survey wasn’t scientific. It countered with a letter from Dr. Angelo Chinnici, who said he has worked with Jersey Shore University Medical Center for 40 years and entrusts his family’s care to Hackensack Meridian.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nTaos: A judge has ruled five defendants are competent to stand trial more than four years after they were found in a squalid New Mexico compound with 11 malnourished children and the body of a young boy. But multiple motions filed by defense lawyers last week may slow the proceedings again. Taos County sheriff’s officials raided the compound in remote northern New Mexico in August 2018, saying they also discovered a firing range and firearms. In a second search days later, authorities reported recovering the decomposing remains of a 3-year-old boy from an underground tunnel. Authorities said the child was the son of one of the five adult suspects and had been reported missing by his mother in Georgia. All five members of the extended family are charged with conspiracy to commit an offense against the United States and providing material support to terrorists. Their attorneys said the defendants would not be facing terrorism-related charges if they were not Muslim. Albuquerque TV station KOB reports that defense lawyers filed motions last week trying to get the judge to drop all kidnapping charges.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City and state officials on Saturday announced new efforts to curb violence and other crimes on the city’s subway system, including increased police patrols, cameras and mental health help for those in need. Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, and other officials disclosed the new measures in the wake of more disturbing attacks in the system, including the fatal shooting of a 15-year-old boy on an A train in Queens earlier this month and the death of a man pushed in front of another Queens train during a dispute last Monday. Adams said that while crime in the city is down 4% since 2019 and down 17% from 10 years ago, many in the public don’t feel safer. He said the new efforts complement the subway safety plan he announced at the beginning of the year. “We can give you stats all day,” he said. “The question is, how do New Yorkers feel? We must match the actual impacts with how New Yorkers feel on the streets and in the subway system.” Adams and Hochul said police with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will be taking primary responsibility for patrolling subway stations adjacent and linked to the four major commuter rail hubs – Penn Station and Grand Central Station in Manhattan, Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn and Sutphin-Archer Station in Queens.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWhiteville: A suspended sheriff has resigned in the aftermath of a leaked audio recording in which he called Black employees by derogatory names and said they should be fired, his attorney announced Monday. Attorney Michael Mills made the announcement during a hearing on whether Jody Greene, who was elected Columbus County sheriff in 2018, should be removed from office, according to news outlets. “Jody Greene loves Columbus County and does not want to put the people he has served through this ordeal,” Mills told Senior Resident Superior Court Judge Douglas Sasser. The announcement prompted applause from some in the courtroom, The News & Observer reports. District Attorney Jon David had sought Greene’s removal alleging that he had engaged in racial profiling of employees both personally and through those under his command, WECT-TV reports. Sasser suspended Greene earlier this month until Monday’s hearing on the petition for removal. The rest of the hearing was called off and David, the district attorney for Bladen, Brunswick and Columbus counties, said it was no longer necessary due to Greene’s resignation. David has said that he asked the State Bureau of Investigation to probe allegations of obstruction of justice within the sheriff’s office. That investigation is ongoing.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Unless oil prices increase dramatically in the remaining days of October, North Dakota’s treasury won’t be banking the benefits of a tax increase on drillers that has bumped state tax collections by $120 million since June, the state tax commissioner said Monday. The increase in state oil tax collections was possible because of a state law that adjusts North Dakota’s oil extraction tax when the three-month average price of a barrel of oil went above a specified “trigger” price of $94.69. Oil prices have fallen well below the benchmark in recent weeks, and will almost certainly wipe the increased tax off the books Nov. 1, North Dakota Tax Commissioner Brian Kroshus said. “Unless there is a significant geopolitical event or supply disruption of some sort, it will revert back,” Kroshus said. The monthly averages are figured using West Texas Intermediate prices, the U.S. benchmark set at Cushing, Oklahoma. WTI crude was fetching below $85 a barrel Monday morning, and the average has been below the price trigger since August. Oil prices would have average above $110 a barrel for the remainder of October to keep the trigger in place, Kroshus said. North Dakota has two primary taxes on oil production – a production tax and an extraction tax, the latter of which was part of an initiated measure voters approved in 1980.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Franklin County commissioners are accusing the state’s top election official of making them spend hundreds of thousands of county taxpayer dollars for election security. A directive from Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office requires county boards of elections to implement new security standards as it continues to investigate claims of voter fraud from the 2020 presidential election, claims that it has acknowledged are largely unfounded. In Franklin County, officials say the directive requires swapping out physical security locks and keys with keycard access, electronic monitoring systems and new security cameras for areas that house voting machines, poll pads and other election equipment. The commissioners, all Democrats, reluctantly approved a request from the county elections office for $375,000 to complete the state-mandated upgrades – but not without expressing their frustration with LaRose, a Republican, who has been endorsed by and has rallied with ex-President Donald Trump, who continues to publicly deny the results of the 2020 elections while privately acknowledging that he lost. “The security measures are important and critical,” Commissioner Kevin Boyce said. “It’s just frustrating to get such a strong mandate, such a costly mandate, when we’ve been asking for so many things to help ensure voter access and engagement and just not getting any cooperation from them on that.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: As the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma works to help people hurt by rising costs of food and other necessities, the organization itself is confronting the effects of high inflation. Supply chain issues driven by labor shortages and equipment availability have reduced the variety of food products and lengthened the lead time on deliveries. Before the pandemic, food orders would be delivered within two to three weeks; it is now eight to 10 weeks. The organization is experiencing persistent hikes of 15% to 25% in costs of food plus freight. “Inflation is touching everything, and the supply chain issues are only compounding that impact both in costs and in food availability,” said Caleb Dixon, chief operations officer for the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. According to a new poll, inflation has forced 60% of Oklahoma voters to cut spending on essentials like groceries and on discretionary items like travel. The poll, by Amber Integrated, of Oklahoma City, shows only 17% of the 500 voters surveyed haven’t cut back. A majority in most age groups have cut back on groceries, travel, entertainment and dining out. The biggest percentages by age of people cutting back were those between 40 and 49 and those 70 and older.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A U.S. Forest Service employee was arrested last week by a county sheriff after a planned burn in a national forest spread onto private land. It was the latest episode that underscores simmering tensions over management of federal lands in rural, conservative eastern Oregon. That tension exploded into the 2016 takeover by armed right-wing extremists of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 300 miles southeast of Portland. One of the extremist leaders was killed by law enforcement officers at a roadblock. Rick Snodgrass, the U.S. Forest Service “burn boss,” was arrested Wednesday and transported to the Grant County Jail, where he was conditionally released, District Attorney Jim Carpenter said in a statement. Carpenter warned that Snodgrass’ federal employment “will not protect him if it is determined that he acted recklessly.” “That the USFS was engaging in a prescribed burn may actually raise, rather than lower the standard to which Snodgrass will be held,” the prosecutor said. Prescribed burns are set intentionally and under carefully controlled conditions to clear underbrush, pine needle beds and other surface fuels that make forests more prone to wildfires.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The city is asking a judge to force the state’s Department of Human Services to take custody of more than 70 juveniles sentenced in court to state rehabilitation programs, hoping to alleviate what it says is dangerous overcrowding at the city’s holding facility. In the lawsuit filed Friday, city attorneys said the state has refused to prioritize transferring juveniles from the overcrowded juvenile justice center. The city is asking a judge to mandate that the state take the sentenced juveniles within 20 days and either contract with a private or public facility or open a state-run facility to handle the increase in youths being sentenced to state centers. Workers from Philadelphia’s juvenile facility spoke last week at a City Council hearing about worsening conditions at the center that’s designed to temporarily hold up to 184 youths between the ages of 10 and 17 who are awaiting court proceedings. But as of last Friday, the lawsuit said the center had reached 223 juveniles – 74 of whom had been sentenced to state facilities and were awaiting transfer. A spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services declined to comment on the litigation Monday. In a statement issued after the City Council hearing last week, department officials said the state’s facilities are also at capacity.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: For the first time, authorities have detected a highly contagious form of avian flu in domestic birds in the state. The state Department of Environmental Management on Friday euthanized a small, backyard flock of chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys on a farm in Newport County after confirming that some had been infected with a strain of influenza that has spread throughout much of the country in recent months and led to the deaths of millions of birds. It’s not the first case of the strain of flu in Rhode Island. That occurred in July when a great black-backed gull found seriously ill on a South Kingstown beach tested positive for the virus. But the Newport County case is the first confirmation of the virus in a domestic flock. Environmental authorities have been warning of the virus since last winter, when the strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza spread from Europe and Central Asia to North America. Since then, more than 47 million domestic birds in 43 states have died from the virus or had to be killed after being exposed to infection. While there have been other waves of bird flu in the past, this is the largest outbreak in the nation of a variant of the virus. And the number of fatalities is soon expected to exceed the total in the last major bird flu outbreak in 2015-16.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state’s first-ever round of early voting for the general election started Monday with no problems at the polls, but a state website where people go to check voting locations or get a sample ballot crashed. Technicians were working to fix the South Carolina Election Commission’s website at scvotes.org, agency spokesman Chris Whitmire said. In the meantime, voters can look at their ballot choices before heading to the polls at a different site. The agency’s website is not linked to the state’s voting system, Whitmire said. This is the first year South Carolina is allowing voters to cast ballots in person early without having an excuse as to why they can’t vote on Election Day. Polls are open Monday through Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., through Nov. 5. There were a smaller number of polling places opened for early voting during the June primaries, and only a few minor problems were reported. Over the past several elections, South Carolina has allowed people to cast absentee ballots in person, but they had to include an excuse for why they could not be at the polls on Election Day. The law passed this year has South Carolina returning to mail-in absentee ballots.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Fernson Brewing Company and South Dakota State University have collaborated to create a premium beer called Ears Up. The beer will hit the shelves in the Brookings market Tuesday. On Saturday, when South Dakota State hosts Indiana State for Hobo Day, the beer will be available inside the stadium. That’s thanks to a new change in the policy of the state’s Board of Regents, which allows state schools to sell beer to the general public. “As a 2008 graduate of South Dakota State, it’s a bit surreal and deeply humbling to be able to create something for my alma mater,” Fernson co-founder Derek Fernholz said in a press release. “We are so proud of the beer we have crafted, together with SDSU, to be enjoyed by Jackrabbits everywhere. This has been one of our largest undertakings to date, and working with the amazing people at South Dakota State University has truly been (an) honor and a great collaborative effort. We cannot wait to see how this project grows and evolves for years to come.” The beer is billed as an “easy-drinking and smooth premium beer with 5% alcohol by volume.” After beers hit the shelves in Brookings, Ears Up will become available in Sioux Falls and distributors who serve across the state including Rapid City, Mitchell, Watertown, Huron, Aberdeen and Pierre.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Benjamin L. Hooks Institute for Social Change at the University of Memphis and Memphis International Airport are co-hosting an exhibit depicting the civil rights movement in Fayette County through the photographs of freelance photographer Art Shay. The photographs will be displayed in the airport’s terminal for departing flights, across from the TSA office, through next October. The public will be able to view the exhibit without purchasing a ticket or going through the TSA security checkpoints. Established in 1996 by civil rights activist and former NAACP Executive Director Benjamin L. Hooks, the Hooks Institute seeks to promote civil rights and social change through multiple avenues, including education, research and community engagement. Shay worked as a photographer and writer after serving in World War II. His work has appeared in Life, Time and Sports Illustrated magazines. For more than five decades, Shay photographed some of the 20th century’s most intriguing figures, from Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton to President John F. Kennedy. The photographer was also fascinated with the happenings of everyday life, leading him to take an interest in photographing the efforts of the civil rights movement, including in Fayette County in the 1960s.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A judge has dismissed illegal voting charges against a Houston man who stood in line six hours to cast a ballot in the 2020 presidential primary and became a figure over Republican efforts to tighten election laws. The decision last week followed a wider ruling in Texas that limits the state’s power to prosecute voting fraud cases, which has drawn backlash from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other GOP leaders. Hervis Rogers, who in March 2020 did not leave a polling center at a historically Black college until about 1:30 a.m., had faced charges that carried a possible sentence of two to 20 years in prison. He had voted while still on parole from a felony burglary conviction, making him ineligible to cast a ballot under Texas law. Rogers said he did not know he was ineligible to cast a ballot when he got in line at Texas Southern University, where reporters had interviewed him and other voters who expressed anger and frustration over the long wait. The charges against Rogers were brought by the office of Texas Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has promoted baseless claims of widespread election fraud and challenged the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, entirely comprised of elected Republicans judges, upheld last month that the state cannot unilaterally prosecute election fraud cases.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Democratic state Sen. Gene Davis resigned Wednesday, hours after legislators from both parties demanded he step aside and leadership stripped him of committee assignments. Davis’ resignation ends a saga that began in August after a former intern posted on Instagram claims that Davis, 77, had inappropriately touched her, including her toes and waist, in multiple instances in their workplace. In his resignation letter, posted on Twitter by the state Senate, Davis said he would resign effective Nov. 19, following the election and scheduled date of interim committee meetings. Davis, who has served six terms in office, is not on the ballot after he was defeated in the Democratic Party’s June primary. His resignation follows public demands from Senate President Stuart Adams and Davis’ colleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus that Davis resign. An independent investigation commissioned by legislative leaders determined that it was “more likely than not” that Davis invaded former intern Sonia Weglinski’s personal space, likely violating the Legislature’s Workplace Discrimination and Harassment policy. It found her allegations to be more credible than Davis’ recollections and accused him of not being forthcoming or completely honest.\n\nVermont\n\nEssex Junction: Organizers of the Champlain Valley Fair have announced the first grandstand concert for the 2023 fair, more than 10 months before the summer show will take place. Country star Riley Green, known for hits including “There Was This Girl” and “I Wish Grandpas Never Died,” will play the Champlain Valley Exposition grounds Sunday, Sept. 3. Tickets for Green’s concert go on sale to the general public at 10 a.m. Friday. The Champlain Valley Fair, an annual 10-day event in Essex Junction, draws thousands of visitors a year for animals on display as well as rides, games and food on the midway, but the grandstand concerts are a perennial attraction. This year’s performances included rapper Nelly, Celtic rockers The Dropkick Murphys, ventriloquist Jeff Dunham and country performer Scotty McCreery.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Glenn Youngkin continued to raise funds at a quick clip over the past three months, outpacing his recent predecessors, while also traveling the country building his national profile and boosting midterm candidates. The Republican’s Spirit of Virginia political action committee raised nearly $1.8 million in cash over the July-to-September quarter, spent about $1.1 million and ended the quarter with about $2.3 million on hand, according to campaign finance disclosures filed this month. The governor, increasingly viewed as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, far outraised any other Virginia official’s leadership committee during that timeframe, and the strong receipts are a continuation of a trend: the political newcomer’s combination of fundraising and loans to his campaign during his race last year against Democrat Terry McAuliffe shattered records set in the 2017 gubernatorial campaign. Youngkin also brought in big bucks post-election and for his inauguration. In his first two full quarters in office, he raised more than twice as much as his three most recent predecessors in donations of $10,000 of more, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project, which tracks money in politics.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The payroll premiums on workers’ wages to pay for the state’s paid family and medical leave program will increase Jan. 1. The state’s Employment Security Department announced Thursday that the rate will increase from 0.6% to 0.8% of wages to keep pace with the number of people using the program, with most of the share continuing to be paid by employees. The premium increase comes just weeks after an analysis of the financial health of Washington state’s paid family leave program estimated the fund would hit an $8.7 million deficit by the end of the year. The actuarial analysis by the consulting firm Milliman that was recently presented to a legislative task force showed that the current premium rate is not keeping up with demand for the state benefit that launched in 2020 and it recommended increasing the rate. When premiums first were enacted, 0.4% of workers’ wages funded the program, with 63% paid by employees and 37% paid by employers. An increase to 0.6% had already gone into effect earlier this year, and employees’ share increased to about 73%, with the remainder paid by employers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMartinsburg: Clorox has opened a new cat litter plant that is expected to create more than 100 new jobs. The company said the Martinsburg facility officially opened Friday, with plans to bring $190 million into the local economy. The facility is in a West Virginia Eastern Panhandle community that includes suburbs of Washington. The plant is expected to reach full capacity by early next year. The project includes a 97,000-square-foot main building and 450,000 square feet offsite at a warehouse. The facility will produce Fresh Step and Scoop Away litter. Gov. Jim Justice, U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito and staff for U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin joined company officials for Friday’s opening ceremony. Clorox now has three facilities in West Virginia, including Kingsford brand charcoal plants in Mineral and Tucker counties.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: In a trial marked by persistent disruptions, what was expected to be the final day of testimony Monday was marred by more outbursts and interruptions from Darrell Brooks Jr., which once again resulted in his removal from the courtroom. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow ruled Brooks, who is acting as his own attorney, forfeited his rights to call any more witnesses or testify as a result of his behavior after attempting multiple times to determine whether he intended to testify on his own behalf. Closing arguments are tentatively scheduled for Tuesday. Brooks, 40, of Milwaukee, is charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide, 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety, six counts of hit-and-run causing death, two counts of bail jumping, all felonies in connection to the 2021 Waukesha Christmas Parade tragedy, and one count of misdemeanor battery.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: Three school districts around the state have been selected for a pilot program aimed at addressing teacher shortages through paid apprenticeships, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Districts in Laramie, Teton and Fremont counties will be the first to try the program to recruit and train educators, and other schools may be able to join the effort in 2024, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/11/02/mikiztil-festival-exorcism-ranch-storms-underwater-impact-news-around-states/50894879/", "title": "Mikiztil festival, exorcism ranch: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: As early as next summer, Tuskegee University plans to move the needle in cancer genomics – the study of DNA sequence and gene expression differences between tumor cells and normal cells. With a $7.93 million grant from the National Institutes of Health, the university will build a new biomedical annex to its Carver Research Center to focus on cancer research and health disparities in underrepresented populations. “This award is recognition for the dedicated effort of the faculty, staff and students within the Center for Biomedical Research to eradicate health disparities, particularly in Alabama Black Belt,” Center for Biomedical Research director Dr. Clayton Yates said in a statement. “Students, particularly African-Americans and other underrepresented minorities, will receive training to become excellent biomedical research scientists, significantly benefitting from this state-of-the-art enhancement.” Booker T. Washington founded the historically Black university in 1881 with the purpose of educating Black teachers. Since then, the school has expanded its mission to include educating students for careers in the sciences, architecture, business and engineering. It also forged a path in bioethics for HBCUs. Tuskegee formed its National Center for Bioethics in Research and Health Care in response to the violations committed during the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A lawsuit filed in state court is challenging the eligibility of a legislative candidate to hold the seat. The lawsuit filed Monday alleges Democrat Jennifer “Jennie” Armstrong did not meet residency requirements on the date she filed to run for office. The complaint seeks an injunction barring state elections officials from certifying Armstrong as the winner of her Anchorage House race should she garner the most votes. Armstrong faces Republican Liz Vazquez in next week’s election. The case, brought by Chris Duke, Randy Eledge, Steve Strait and Kathryn Werdahl, names the state Division of Elections and its director as defendants. The plaintiffs are described as “public interest litigants.” Patty Sullivan, a spokesperson with the state Department of Law, said Tuesday morning that the department had not yet been served an official copy of the complaint and could not comment on the specific allegations. But she said that Armstrong has been certified for the ballot based on information she provided in her declaration of candidacy and that the time for any challenge to her eligibility under a state law and regulation has expired. “There is no process for the Division to find a candidate disqualified based on residency at this point in the process,” Sullivan said by email.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Crowds gathered at Steele Indian School Park on Sunday to honor the Indigenous roots of Día de los Muertos at the annual Mikiztil festival. “The Mikiztil is the painted decorated skull that you see, and it represents not death but transcendence,” said Zarco Guerrero, president, chair and co-founder of Cultural Coalition, the host organization of the event. Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, an ancient Mexican celebration with Indigenous Aztec roots, is typically observed Nov. 1-2 during the Catholic holidays of All Saints Day and All Souls Day. During this time, people honor their deceased relatives and invite their spirits back from beyond to join their families in the celebration. The Día de los Muertos celebration well-known today in the U.S. is a medley of Indigenous origins of the tradition mixed with forced Spanish and Catholic influence from the Europeans who conquered the lands of Indigenous people, according to Carmen Guerrero, executive director and co-founder of Cultural Coalition. The Mikiztli festival aims to revive and celebrate its Indigenous origins. “We’re trying to go back to the ancestral understanding of what this event really means. ... It was never about death. It was always about transcending to the next life,” Zarco Guerrero said. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego acknowledged the city’s support and welcomed the crowd to the event. Shortly after began the Danza Mexica, a form of ancestral worship to what the Aztecs described as the four sacred directions: north, south, east and west.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The FBI is investigating after several people in the city told police someone called and said their children had been kidnapped and then demanded a ransom. The calls’ claims have been fake but are being investigated by local and federal law officers. Since Thursday, police took reports of a series of calls from across the city about kidnappings. The caller used the same phone number to claim that the targets’ children had been kidnapped and that they would only give the children back if a ransom were paid, police said. “These calls have been investigated and are confirmed to be scams,” according to a Fort Smith news release. In one of the calls, the victim’s child was confirmed safe. In another, the victim did not even have any children. “When the caller is pressed, their knowledge of the victims and the area appears to be limited and superficial,” police said. Anyone who gets a kidnapping call or any other suspicious call can report it to Fort Smith police or the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center at fbi.gov/tips.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The Hoopa Valley Tribe alleged in a lawsuit Monday that the federal government is violating its sovereignty and failing to collect money from California farms that rely on federally supplied water to pay for damages to tribal fisheries. The tribe, which has a reservation in northwest California, says in its lawsuit against the Biden administration that the Trinity River that it relies on for food and cultural purposes has been decimated by decades of the federal government diverting water. The suit alleges the U.S. Department of the Interior has failed to follow laws that require the contractors who use that water to pay money for habitat restoration projects. It says those contractors owe $340 million for environmental restoration work along the Trinity River and other places damaged by water diversions. “The river has become a place that is no longer a healing place, but a place that is a sick place,” said Jill Sherman-Warne, a member of the Hoopa tribal council. The suit also alleges that the federal government has failed to appropriately consult with the tribe on matters related to the river. The Interior Department declined to comment through spokesman Tyler Cherry.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A man has been sentenced to more than 23 years in federal prison after pleading guilty to shooting a ranger at Rocky Mountain National Park last year. The ranger was wearing a bulletproof vest and wasn’t seriously injured. Daron Ellis, 29, of Aurora, was sentenced Monday in federal court in Denver after pleading guilty to attempted murder of a federal officer and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence, The Denver Post reports. The Dec. 8 shooting occurred after a Colorado State Patrol officer tried to stop Ellis outside the park for speeding. The trooper learned the car was stolen and ordered Ellis to leave the car, but Ellis sped off, authorities said. A National Park Service Law Enforcement ranger spotted the car at the Fall River entrance to the national park in Colorado and ordered Ellis to show his hands. Ellis shot the ranger in the chest with a semi-automatic handgun; the ranger returned fire, wounding Ellis, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado. The ranger’s identity hasn’t been released. Rocky Mountain National Park is about 50 miles northwest of Denver.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A former state representative pleaded guilty Tuesday in connection with the theft of more than $1.2 million in federal coronavirus relief funds from the city of West Haven, using some of the money for gambling at a casino, according to prosecutors. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat, appeared in federal court in Hartford and pleaded guilty to three counts of wire fraud conspiracy. DiMassa’s wife and his former business partner also pleaded guilty earlier this year, while a fourth person charged in the scheme awaits trial. At the time of the theft, DiMassa was both a state representative and an aide to the West Haven City Council. Prosecutors alleged he used his city position, which had authority to approve the reimbursement of COVID-19 expenditures, to steal the funds – some of which he used for gambling at the Mohegan Sun Casino in eastern Connecticut. DiMassa resigned from both positions after his arrest last year. No sentencing date was set for DiMassa. The sentencing guideline range for the charges to which he pleaded guilty is 41 to 51 months.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After years of hovering slightly under 1 million residents, the First State has surpassed that milestone − but just barely, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. The government estimated this summer that in July 2021, Delaware had 1,003,384 residents. Census Bureau data lags by about a year. While Delaware’s overall population growth has remained steady at an average of 1% per year since 2010, adults 65 and older have seen the fastest-growing numbers, with that population increasing 55% in the 11-year period. In contrast, the 35-to-49 age group declined the most, dropping 4.2% in the same time frame. Currently, the 50-to-64 age group makes up the largest share of Delaware’s population, at 20.5%. The 65-and-up age group comes in close second, however, making up 20.1% of the state’s population. Though adults ages 50 to 64 still account for the largest percentage of the state’s population, the rapid growth of the 65-plus age group comes as no surprise given the trend is also being seen nationally, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Community Living found.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After decades of planning and years of delays, the D.C. region’s Metrorail system will open a long-awaited extension to Dulles International Airport in about two weeks. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced Monday that the second phase of its Silver Line extension into Loudoun County and the northern Virginia airport will open to passengers Nov. 15. The $3 billion extension adds more than 11 miles of track and six new stations. It has been plagued by cost overruns and criminal charges against contractors who falsified records to try to hide faulty concrete. It was originally scheduled to open in 2018 but faced numerous delays. The opening comes at a time where the Metrorail system continues to face a significant drop in ridership from its pre-pandemic levels, as well as an anticipated budget gap. In recent weeks, Metro officials had said they could not open the new line until safety regulators allowed the system’s 7000 series rail cars to return to use. They had been pulled from service after a derailment. Regulators approved a plan last week to return enough of the cars to service ahead of Thanksgiving to allow the Silver Line extension to open.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Hurricane Ian ravaged southwest Florida on land but was destructive underwater as well. It destroyed human-made reefs and brought along red tide, the harmful algae blooms that kill fish and birds, according to marine researchers who returned last week from a six-day cruise organized by the Florida Institute of Oceanography. Researchers who used the cruise to study marine life in the Gulf of Mexico following the hurricane say it left in its wake red tide and destroyed artificial reefs from as far away as 30 miles from the coast of southwest Florida. “The onetime vibrant reefs are now underwater disaster sites themselves,” said Calli Johnson, safety dive officer for the research cruise. “Where there used to be a complete ecosystem, there are now only fish that were able to return after swimming away.” Before the Category 4 storm made landfall a month ago, southwest Florida had a reputation for being one of the best saltwater fishing destinations in the U.S. Saltwater and freshwater fishing in Florida has an economic impact of about $13.8 billion, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. “Time will tell how this affects our greater economy because changes in the fishing industry and tourism will come from changes in our underwater world,” Johnson said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Monday declined to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani by two women who served as election workers in Georgia in November 2020. In the lawsuit filed last December, Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss accused Giuliani of defaming them by falsely stating that the pair had engaged in election fraud while counting ballots at State Farm Arena in Atlanta. The lawsuit says Giuliani repeatedly pushed debunked claims that the mother-and-daughter pair pulled out suitcases of illegal ballots and committed other acts of fraud to try to alter the outcome of the presidential election in Georgia. In an opinion accompanying Monday’s order, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell in Washington described the situation that followed the November 2020 election, when the vote totals in several key states were so close that the results were not immediately clear. “As election workers across the state worked long hours carefully ensuring the accuracy of the election, the Trump Campaign and its allies, including Giuliani, engaged in a media offensive that at best questioned, and at worse condemned, their work,” Howell wrote. Moss had worked for the Fulton County elections department since 2012 and supervised the absentee ballot operation during the 2020 election. Freeman, her mother, was a temporary election worker, verifying signatures on absentee ballots and preparing them to be counted and processed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The pilot of a helicopter that crashed on a remote lava field during a sunset tour in June told investigators that the engine had been swapped out but three earlier flights that day were normal. The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday released various documents related to the crash that injured all six people on board, but the agency has yet to release a probable cause for why the helicopter suddenly made “violent and uncommanded yaw and pitch changes.” The morning of the crash, the pilot and a mechanic took the helicopter on a operation control flight after its engine had been changed and there were no issues with the flight, according to the pilot’s accident report. The documents did not specify exactly when the engine was changed. The pilot then took the helicopter on two tours, which were also normal and uneventful. The helicopter crashed during a third tour and was found lying on its left side with significant damage to the cockpit, and the tail boom was nearly 800 feet from the main wreckage, according to one of the reports. A large piece of lava rock penetrated about 13 inches into the cockpit area. In a passenger statement, a 48-year-old man on the tour with his two 18-year-old daughters told investigators the helicopter suddenly felt upside down about 30 minutes into the flight.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A former longshot Idaho gubernatorial candidate was convicted Monday of kidnapping and killing a 12-year-old Colorado girl who went missing nearly 40 years ago. Jurors found Steve Pankey, 71, guilty of felony murder, second-degree kidnapping and false reporting in the disappearance and death of Jonelle Matthews in 1984, the office of district attorney Michael Rourke said. A judge then sentenced him to life prison with the possibility of parole, the Greeley Tribune reports. It was Pankey’s second trial in the case. Last year, jurors were unable to reach verdicts on the kidnapping and murder charges, and prosecutors decided to put him on trial again. Pankey was a neighbor of Jonelle and her family when she vanished after being dropped off at her empty home by a family friend after performing at a Christmas concert in Greeley, Colorado, a city about 50 miles north of Denver. He emerged as a person of interest in the case three decades later – shortly before Jonelle’s body was found in 2019 – after claiming to have information about what happened to her and asking for immunity from prosecution. Prosecutors said Pankey kept up to date on the case throughout the years even as he moved his family to several states before settling in Idaho, where he ran unsuccessfully as a Constitution Party candidate for Idaho governor in 2014 and in the Republican gubernatorial primary in 2018, the year authorities said he was named as a person of interest in the girl’s death.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The owner of a North Side senior housing facility where three women earlier this year died amid a brief May heat wave that caused temperatures in the building to soar into the low 90s has been fined $1,500 by the city’s buildings department. Citing city records, the Chicago Sun-Times reports that the fine was levied after an inspection by the buildings department found 11 code violations – two of which were the result of a rooftop air conditioning “chiller” that did not appear to be suitable for use on the exterior of the building. Records show, according to the newspaper, that the department determined that issues noted in the city’s first inspection had been addressed and that a second inspection determined there were “no dangerous and hazardous conditions.” By that time, the Hispanic Housing Development Corporation – a nonprofit organization that owns and manages the James Sneider Apartment – had, among other things, provided individual air conditioning units to every tenant. Mike Puccinelli, a buildings department spokesman, said the fine was levied before city officials had access to autopsy records that showed the deaths of the three women whose bodies were discovered May 14 were linked to the heat. He said the fine was based completely on the violations found during the inspection.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel: After years of overcoming legal challenges and governmental hurdles, more than 200 people gathered excitedly Saturday to break ground on the Islamic Life Center in Carmel. “My heart is pounding so fast with no fear or sadness but truly with a feeling of joy and pleasure,” Nadeem Ikhlaque, Al Salam’s founding president, said from a podium at the site of the future center. “In my 54 years of life, I never had this feeling, but today I have – standing in front of you.” Carmel leaders, the Al Salam Foundation, Muslim members, and those from other faith communities and the public broke ground on the city’s first mosque. The center will be under the umbrella of the foundation, which is an Islamic nonprofit organization. “We are practicing our faith rituals – daily and weekly prayers, nightly prayers, fasting through the month of Ramadan,” Ashhar Madni, president of the Al Salam Foundation, told the crowd. “The other half of our faith is to do good deeds. ... While we worship our creator, we need to serve his creation as well.” The road to this point was not a straight line and showed the clash that can occur as cities become more diverse. While city, community and religious leaders largely supported the project, many Carmel residents of different cultural and religious backgrounds in nearby upscale neighborhoods protested against it, saying they were largely concerned with property values. Center members said Saturday that they looked forward to being a good and inviting neighbor.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Agriculture officials said Monday that another commercial egg farm in the state has been infected with bird flu – the first commercial farm case identified since April, when a turkey farm was infected. The latest case is in Wright County in north central Iowa, about 80 miles north of Des Moines, housing about 1.1 million chickens. Iowa has had 15 commercial farms infected this year, including turkeys, egg-laying hens and other chickens. In addition, five backyard flocks have been infected. Because the virus is highly contagious, all birds on an infected farm are killed and disposed of to avoid the spread of the disease. Iowa has been hardest hit with bird losses at more than 13.3 million this year before the latest farm was found infected. Nationally more than 47.7 million birds have been affected in 43 states that includes 251 commercial flocks and 328 backyard flocks, U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show. Most of the Iowa cases were during the spring migration of wild birds in March and April with one reported in early May. The virus hadn’t been detected again until a backyard flock was infected Oct. 20, and then the latest infection was confirmed Monday.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state’s top elections official warned voters Monday that text messages from outside the state were giving them incorrect information about where to vote, but groups involved in the texting said they weren’t trying to confuse or mislead people. Several Democrats said they began hearing about the texts Sunday or had received them. Each message said it was from a representative of Voting Futures, Voto Latino or Black Voters Matter and provided the address of a voting site, with a picture of a building. In some cases, the person already had voted; in others, people couldn’t vote in advance at the listed site, and in some, people could vote in advance there, but not on Election Day, Nov. 8. Movement Labs, a vendor headquartered in Oakland, California, working for both Voto Latino and Black Voters Matter, tweeted that texts also went to voters in Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia. Kansas Democrats who learned of the texts worried that a disinformation campaign had targeted their voters in hopes of preventing their ballots from counting or discouraging them from voting. And Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab, a Republican, said voters should be on “high alert” about potential election misinformation from such texts.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Former U.S. Rep. Romano L. Mazzoli, D-Ky., whose tenacity and personal integrity formed the foundation of a long career in politics and public service, died Tuesday at his home in Louisville. He was one day shy of his 90th birthday. Charlie Mattingly, his former chief of staff, said Mazzoli’s mental acuity never waned, although his health declined, particularly in recent months. Throughout his 24 years in the House, Mazzoli defied the usual stereotypical descriptions applied to political figures. His unpredictable voting patterns occasionally prompted the casual observer describe him as a maverick, a term Mazzoli disliked. “I don’t like labels,” he said in 1988. “I don’t consider myself anything but thoughtful.” Mazzoli’s nature frequently put him in conflict with his party on issues of substance and matters of conscience. Although he pledged in his first House speech to support the Equal Rights Amendment, he alienated women’s groups that were trying to keep the amendment alive in 1983 by voting to defeat an ERA resolution. He said Democratic leaders had not provided enough time to discuss its impact on abortion and women in the draft. A devout Catholic, Mazzoli strongly opposed abortion, putting him at odds with members of his party’s liberal Washington establishment. He frequently angered organized labor by refusing to support protectionist legislation and voted once to support the veto of a Democratic bill to raise the minimum wage.\n\nLouisiana\n\nFerriday: The family of legendary rock ’n’ roll pioneer Jerry Lee Lewis has announced details of memorial services planned this weekend for his birthplace. Lewis, known for hits such as “Great Balls of Fire” and many others, died Friday at age 87. The funeral service is set for 11 a.m. Central Daylight Time on Saturday at Young’s Funeral Home in Ferriday, family members said. There will be very limited public availability, but the ceremony will be livestreamed, with details to be announced later on Lewis’ Facebook page. A private burial will follow. A celebration of life is also planned for 1 p.m. that day at the Arcade Theater in Ferriday, Lewis’ representatives said. Lewis was the last survivor of a generation of artists that rewrote music history, a group that included Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry and Little Richard.\n\nMaine\n\nEtna: A 74-year-old man who spent nearly 30 hours lost in the woods was hypothermic and unable to move when he was found by a game warden using a tracking dog, officials said. Joseph Nolin knew his ordeal was over when he heard a bell attached to the Labrador retriever’s collar, and then the dog bounded up and started licking him Monday afternoon, his son told wardens. Nolin walked until he couldn’t move and told wardens he wouldn’t have survived another night in the woods. He was found a mile from his house deep in the woods at the edge of the Etna Bog, officials said. A Maine Forest Service helicopter was used to retrieve Nolin, and he was released after being hydrated and warmed up, officials said. Nolen had been last seen Sunday morning, when he departed to check on game cameras in the woods. He son reported him missing Sunday evening.\n\nMaryland\n\nBowie: A representative for the company staging a Halloween magic performance at Six Flags America says an emergency call that medics described as a serious injury caused by sword swallowing was caused by an “unrelated medical condition,” WUSA-TV reports. The call for help came from Six Flags in Bowie between 9:30 and 10 p.m. Saturday evening. “It was not for an accident during the show but rather for other unrelated health conditions,” said Josh Bowren, production manager for Aaron Radatz Productionz, which staged the show, according to Six Flags officials. Bowren did not name the actor, whom he described as “our sword swallower,” and authorities have not released the name of the injured person. The performer was a 59-year-old man who was in serious but not life-threatening condition when he was transported to Capital Region Health Hospital in Largo on Saturday night, rescuers said. Rescuers described the weapon to medical workers as “a haunted house sword” and said it occurred during a “Halloween show.” A spokesperson for Six Flags said the company’s “thoughts and prayers are with the performer and his family.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A retired state trooper who was killed in what authorities described as a shooting motivated by racism and an officer who drowned while trying to save the life of a teenager were honored Tuesday with awards for exemplary acts of bravery. A total of 32 Massachusetts law enforcement personnel were named recipients of the annual George L. Hanna Memorial Award for Bravery by Gov. Charlie Baker during a ceremony at Mechanics Hall in Worcester. Hanna was a state trooper shot and killed during a traffic stop in Auburn in 1983. Two of his children participated in Tuesday’s ceremony. “Like Trooper George Hanna, the dedicated women and men in law enforcement perform exceptional work guided by their deeply rooted commitment to helping others, no matter the risk to themselves,” Baker said in a statement. Retired state Trooper David L. Green, 68, left his Winthrop home in June 2021 to investigate a truck crash and was shot multiple times by a white man who authorities say had expressed antisemitic and anti-Black views. Green and Ramona Cooper, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran, were killed. Both were Black.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The family of Porter Burks, a Black man fatally shot during an early morning confrontation with Detroit police, is suing the city for $50 million, their lawyer announced Tuesday. Five unnamed officers also are named in the wrongful death lawsuit filed Tuesday by attorney Geoffrey Fieger. It claims gross negligence and assault and battery, among other things. Burks’ Oct. 2 death was recorded by police body cameras as officers pleaded with him to drop a knife he was carrying. They initially were called to a home on the west side about a knife-wielding man who was having a mental health crisis and spoke to a man who identified himself as Burks’ brother. The man said Burks had slashed the tires on his car. “Drop the knife for me, man. Come here real quick. You’re OK,” a member of the Detroit Police Department’s crisis intervention team can be heard telling Burks. “You’re not in any trouble. Can you just talk to me and drop the knife?” “You’re not in any trouble, OK?” the officer continued. “I just want to help you. I just want to help you, man. OK? Can you just drop the knife for me please? Please? Whatever you’re going through, I can help you.” Burks – who police say had schizophrenia – was shot as he sprinted toward officers from the middle of the street.\n\nMinnesota\n\nBrainerd: A man is accused of fatally shooting his daughter’s boyfriend who he suspected was abusing her. The 45-year-old Brainerd father is charged with second-degree murder in the death of 23-year-old Bryce Brogle, who was reported missing after going to the man’s storage unit Oct. 26. According to a criminal complaint, the father shot Brogle in the back of the head from a distance and then buried his body in Crow Wing County. The defendant’s daughter reported her boyfriend missing Oct. 28, telling police he hadn’t been seen since he went to the storage unit with her father. Investigators executed a search warrant Oct. 29 at the storage unit and said they found the presence of blood and bleach on the concrete floor and signs something had been dragged across the floor. The following day, law enforcement officers searched land in Crow Wing County on foot and found a grave site. The complaint said that after it was excavated, they found a body with a gunshot wound to the back of the head. An autopsy confirmed it was Brogle. According to the charges, the landlord for Brogle and his girlfriend called the sheriff’s office, saying the father has asked if Brogle had hurt his daughter. The landlord said his daughter had been seen with two black eyes. The complaint said the father then told the landlord he was going to kill Brogle, and he’d already dug a hole.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency confirmed Monday that the city’s water is safe to drink, after months of sampling at a treatment plant overwhelmed by August flooding that caused wide supply disruptions. The beleaguered O.B. Curtis water treatment plant fell into crisis after the late summer flooding left 150,000 people without running water for several days. People waited in lines for water to drink, bathe, cook and flush toilets. The crisis also added to the rising costs for business owners already saddled with a labor shortage and high inflation. The city had already been under a boil-water notice since late July because the state health department found cloudy water that could make people ill. But current water samples pass muster for safe consumption, the EPA said. “Current sampling confirms water delivered from J.H. Fewell Water and O.B. Curtis Water Treatment is safe to drink,” said Maria Michalos, a spokesperson for the EPA, referring to the city’s two water treatment plants. The agency encouraged Jackson residents to stay vigilant about updates and follow all future boil water advisories, as “localized issues” may resurface. It is not yet certain whether Jackson has too much lead and copper in its water. Sampling has been completed, and results are expected in mid-November.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state’s health department is investigating whether a hospital violated federal health care rules in denying a woman an emergency abortion, an agency spokeswoman confirmed Monday. Missouri Health and Senior Services spokeswoman Lisa Cox in a statement said the agency launched an investigation into southern Missouri’s Freeman Health System’s treatment of Mylissa Farmer. Farmer, who is from Joplin, told the Associated Press she went to the system’s local emergency room when her water broke months early Aug. 2. She said tests showed she had lost all of her amniotic fluid because of a pregnancy complication, and doctors told her the fetus was not expected to survive. Doctors also told Farmer that “awaiting a medical emergency may put her at further risk for maternal mortality” or the removal of her uterus, medical records show. But because her fetus still had a heartbeat, and her condition wasn’t considered a life-threatening medical emergency at that moment, they couldn’t terminate the pregnancy in Missouri, they told her. She eventually got an abortion in Illinois. Records from that visit say doctors told Farmer that the law supersedes their medical judgment, and “contrary to the most appropriate management based (on) my medical opinion, due to the legal language of MO law, we are unable to offer induction of labor at this time.” “They were telling me to basically get out of the state to get the care that I needed,” the 41-year-old told AP.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: A woman was cited for animal cruelty Thursday for shooting and skinning a 6-month-old husky and posting pictures of herself with the animal online bragging that she had shot a young wolf, officials said. The husky was among a group of 18 dogs and puppies, including German shepherd mixes, that had been abandoned on national forest land in northwestern Montana in mid-September, the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office has said. The investigation led the woman to be cited with a misdemeanor and not charged with a felony because officers believe they can prove negligence but not intent, the Sheriff’s Office told NBC Montana. The citation gives the woman two weeks to appear in Justice Court, Officer Paul Charbonneau said. The Flathead County Animal Shelter cared for the dogs, some of which had parvo, a viral infection that causes vomiting and diarrhea. Charbonneau said he believed all the dogs had been adopted.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A Halloween celebration turned frantic after a man drove through a barricaded area and was shot by a police officer Monday night, police said. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the shooting occurred during the popular annual “Halloween on the Boulevard” block party in the Minne Lusa neighborhood in Omaha. Children and adults were out in the neighborhood trick-or-treating when a car drove recklessly through a blocked-off area shortly after 7 p.m., Omaha Police Lt. Neal Bonacci said. The driver of the vehicle was shot by an Omaha police officer and taken to Nebraska Medical Center with serious injuries. The name of the driver has not yet been released. Police say no one else was injured. Chrissy Lopez, a resident of the neighborhood, told the Omaha World-Herald that the vehicle initially drove slowly through the crowd as people yelled at the driver to stop. “He would stop and then drive a little more,” she said. “I heard his engine rev, and people started screaming, and I thought, ‘Oh no.’ And then I heard the gunshots, and everybody just started screaming and running and crying.” Police and firefighters were already on the scene for the block party, which is put on by the Miller Park Minne Lusa Neighborhood Association and draws thousands of people to the area each year.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The Republican National Committee is asking a judge to order election officials in Las Vegas to hire more GOP poll workers to correct what a legal filing calls a disproportionate imbalance favoring Democrats. A Clark County District Court judge is scheduled Wednesday to consider accusations that county elections chief Joe Gloria “stacked” a key ballot signature verification board with 23 Democrats, 33 nonpartisans and “a mere” eight Republicans. Dan Kulin, spokesman for Gloria, declined Monday to comment on a matter pending before a judge. “The registrar’s lopsided staffing of the signature verification board is not remotely ‘as equal as possible’ ” under state law, attorneys representing the RNC alleged in a document filed Friday. “He created a signature verification board with a partisan makeup that tilts sharply against Republicans.” Judge Timothy Williams had signed off Oct. 5 on a pact between the two sides after the county agreed to provide to the RNC a roster showing job titles and political party affiliations of poll workers. The RNC dropped a demand to obtain workers’ names. Voter registration leans Democratic in Clark County, the most populous area of Nevada and home to nearly 1.3 million, or more than 71%, of the state’s 1.8 million active registered voters.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: A U.S. House candidate on the ballot in next week’s election would be the youngest woman ever in Congress if she wins. Karoline Leavitt recalls being in her college dining hall in 2018, filling out an application for a White House intern job while her friends were tailgating at a football game. “I remember thinking, ‘If I made this opportunity, it’s worth missing any football game in the world,’ ” she told the Associated Press in an interview She got the job. That eventually led to a position in President Donald Trump’s White House press office, then another as communications director for Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. Inspired by Stefanik, the youngest woman elected to Congress when she won in 2014 at age 30, Leavitt is now running for a House seat of her own. At age 25, she could make history on Election Day: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., won at 29 in 2018. Leavitt, an unabashed pro-Trump Republican, would also be the youngest person in the next session of Congress if she were to defeat two-term Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in one of the most competitive races this year. Leavitt is seven months younger then fellow Gen Z candidate Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a Florida Democrat favored in his race. Leavitt won her 10-way Republican primary in September in part by going to the right of the other candidates. “I consistently continue to be the only candidate in this race who says that I believe the 2020 election was undoubtedly stolen from President Trump,” she said during a debate.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: While COVID-19 has been at the forefront of health concerns for more than two years, another group of infections has continued to spread among New Jersey residents. Chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis have become more prevalent among adults and teens over the past decade, according to data from the New Jersey Health Department. Incidences of the three infections rose 40% between 2012 and 2019, according to state data. While it caused a small drop-off in disease rates, the COVID-19 pandemic failed to significantly slow down the spread of sexually transmitted infections across the state, said Dr. Edward Liu, the infectious disease section chief at Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune. “Even during the pandemic … their behaviors didn’t change that much,” he said. “Or maybe they were so cooped up that they had to have some type of outlet.” While rates of infection for chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis did drop during 2020, the rate still exceeded the rate for 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. Although all three infections are treatable with certain antibiotics, experts worry that they may soon run out of medications capable of treating gonorrhea. Greta Anschuetz, the assistant acting commissioner at the New Jersey Department of Health who leads the division of HIV, STD and TB Services, said her office is concerned about the infection. “Gonorrhea has figured out how to be resistant to every drug, and we’re on the last of the (known, effective) drugs,” she said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A sheriff’s department has submitted its investigative findings to prosecutors in the death of a cinematographer shot and killed by Alec Baldwin on a film set in New Mexico in October 2021. Santa Fe Sheriff’s Office spokesman Juan Ríos said Thursday that two binders of information were turned over to the Santa Fe-based district attorney’s office, without setting forth any recommendations about possible criminal charges. He said the case file outlines all the evidence collected, including investigative interviews and forensic analysis of physical evidence by the FBI. District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said through a spokeswoman that investigators and prosecutors will now begin a thorough review to make a timely decision about whether to bring charges, without mention of specific deadlines. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died shortly after being wounded by a gunshot during setup for a scene in the western movie “Rust” at a filmset ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe on Oct. 21, 2021. Baldwin was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when the gun went off went off, killing her and wounding the director, Joel Souza.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The debut of a giant “Bluey” balloon, Lea Michele and the Broadway cast of “Funny Girl,” and the legendary Dionne Warwick are some of the highlights slated for this year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. This year’s parade – the 96th annual – will feature 16 giant character balloons, 28 floats, 40 novelty and heritage inflatables, 12 marching bands, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups and, of course, Santa Claus. New balloon giants joining the line-up Nov. 24 include Stuart the one-eyed Minion from “Despicable Me 2”; a new green dinosaur, an Apatosaurus; the debut of the animated sensation “Bluey”; and a new “Diary of a Wimpy Kid” balloon. Other celebrities slated to be on hand include Paula Abdul, making her parade debut; Fitz and the Tantrums; Big Time Rush; “Blue’s Clues & You!” host Josh Dela Cruz; Gloria Estefan along with her daughter, Emily, and grandson, Sasha; Kirk Franklin; Mario Lopez; Ziggy Marley; and Miss America 2022 Emma Broyles. The singers Joss Stone, Jordin Sparks and Betty Who will all be part of the festivities, as will the stars of Peacock’s “Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin” – Adam Devine, Sarah Hyland and Flula Borg. Jimmy Fallon & The Roots will be on a float celebrating Central Park.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper on Tuesday announced a new commission tasked with making recommendations on changing how the boards guiding the University of North Carolina system and its 17 member schools are chosen, bidding to broaden their membership by political leanings, race and gender. The Democratic governor essentially blamed the Republican-controlled Legislature for contributing to problems within the governing structure of one of the country’s leading public university systems – with 240,000 students and UNC-Chapel Hill and N.C. State University as its flagship campuses. “The UNC system is the envy of the nation for what we have built here,” Cooper said at an Executive Mansion news conference. “But there are signs of trouble that come when all of the appointed leaders are chosen by too few … we have an appointed university leadership that doesn’t come close to reflecting our diversity.” As a reminder of partisanship he blames for the system’s stumbling, Cooper stood beside commission co-chairs Tom Ross and Margaret Spellings, two recent UNC system presidents. Both got pushed out in different ways by previous editions of the UNC Board of Governors that were controlled by GOP-approved members.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A judge ruled Monday that he will keep the state’s ban on abortion from taking effect, saying there’s a “substantial probability” that a constitutional challenge to the law will succeed. Judge Bruce Romanick’s ruling means abortion is still legal in North Dakota, though the state’s only clinic – the Red River Women’s Clinic of Fargo – shut down as it challenged the ban and has moved across the border to neighboring Minnesota. Romanick last month rejected a request from North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley to let the law take effect while the Red River clinic’s lawsuit went forward. Romanick based his earlier decision on several factors, but Wrigley argued he had not sufficiently considered the clinic’s chances of prevailing in court. The North Dakota Supreme Court agreed and told Romanick to take another look. In his earlier ruling, Romanick noted the clinic’s uphill battle. But in his ruling Monday, he said the clinic has a “substantial probability” of succeeding, though he noted that the question of whether abortion is a constitutional right in North Dakota has been contentious and has not been decided by the state’s highest court.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A man was arrested Saturday at the Hamilton County Board of Elections after officials say he yelled through a megaphone on the premises and refused to leave. Stephan Pryor, 43, of Over-the-Rhine, is charged with criminal trespassing after the weekend incident at the Norwood facility. Officers engaged with Pryor about 1:30 p.m., while early in-person voting was underway for the day. According to board of elections director Sherry Poland, the board implemented a policy in March banning the use of bullhorns on the premises because they can be heard inside. Ohio law prohibits campaigning inside a polling location. Pryor was reportedly asked to stop using the bullhorn and to leave the property. He refused, Poland said, and Norwood police responded to ask him to leave. He was arrested after refusing again, an incident report says. In an interview Monday evening, Pryor said after he cast a ballot, he went to advertise candidates as he often does for elections. It is not the first time he’s used a megaphone at the facility, he said. He said he was standing the proper distance from the building and didn’t break laws regarding polling place advertisements. He cited that the board’s recent rule regarding megaphones is not protected directly by Ohio Revised Code. “They did me wrong. They arrested me in front of everybody – that was wrong,” Pryor said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nRamona: A ranch with a history of exorcisms is being revamped into a resort. When Amber Stewart found out that Tri County Technology Center was selling a 114-acre property just off Highway 75, she leapt at the opportunity to own the land despite its history. “My husband (David) and I had wanted to buy it for years and years and years,” Amber Stewart said. “It was something that we had talked about, dreamed about and didn’t really think would come to fruition. But when we found out the property was for sale, we were feeling like this is the Lord’s will for us.” Jarrett Farm Resort, 24 miles north of Tulsa, has a history as a commercial property tracing back to the 1940s. It’s been a commercial farm, a conference and retreat center and, for a few years, home to an order of Catholic priests known for performing exorcisms. The Stewarts hope to restore its reputation as a vacation getaway, but it has been an immense challenge. “There were dead mice and large spiders ... there was a raccoon living in the attic,” Amber Stewart said. The Stewarts actually spent the first night of their honeymoon 20 years ago during its previous iteration as a resort. The Catholic Diocese of Tulsa then purchased Jarrett Farm and used it from 2014 to 2018 as a home for an order of priests known for performing exorcisms, according to county records and reports from the diocese. The Stewarts have faced a mix of curiosity and resistance from some residents in Ramona’s small community, but they intend to “honor the story” of Jarrett Farm.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s pioneering motor voter program, in which residents who interact with the motor vehicle division are automatically registered to vote, hit a minor software speed bump, but Oregon’s secretary of state said Monday that it’s being resolved. Secretary of State Shemia Fagan said the Oregon Elections Division on Friday discovered the software error, which for the past six years has failed to preregister some 16- and 17-year-olds to vote. “As a result, 7,767 eligible voters in Oregon … were not given the opportunity to become automatically registered voters for the 2022 election. The issue has impacted voters during the last three election cycles,” Fagan’s office said in a statement. Fagan will direct Oregon’s 36 county clerks to issue ballots to affected voters – those who will be 18 or older Nov. 8. “Eligible voters not receiving their ballots in Oregon is unacceptable,” Fagan’s statement said. “As long as I am Oregon’s Secretary of State, I will do everything in my power to ensure that no eligible voters are disenfranchised.” The Oregon Elections Division was alerted to the issue by a voter who didn’t receive a ballot. Fagan said her technical staff worked through the weekend to resolve the software error.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nStroudsburg: Prosecutors say they have found no evidence of criminal negligence in a gas main rupture under an eastern Pennsylvania roadway and a subsequent fatal single-vehicle crash early on Christmas Day almost two years ago. The Monroe County district attorney’s office said Monday that all parties involved were cooperative in the investigation into the Pocono Township rupture and crash on Route 314 that killed 33-year-old Ana Abreu, of New York City. Township police said Abreu, her husband, their 2-month-old child and another family member were in a sport utility vehicle heading north toward the intersection with Route 611 about 1:30 a.m. on Christmas morning in 2020. Police said a natural gas main beneath the roadway ruptured, flipping the SUV over onto its roof and killing Abreu. The rupture left a large hole in the road, exposing the gas main underneath and a fracture in the pipeline, prosecutors said. A UGI Utilities spokesperson told LehighValleyLive.com that the company was “encouraged” by the decision but declined additional comment.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Bus drivers have reached a tentative settlement with their employer, First Student, avoiding a strike that was scheduled to begin Wednesday. The bus drivers, monitors and aides are members of Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union. The strike would have affected bus drivers in Lincoln, West Warwick and the state bus yard in Cranston, who transport students with special needs, among others. The settlement includes a four-year contract that provides a fair wage increase and an increase in guaranteed hours, the union said. The 275 members of the union are expected to ratify the contract, at which time more details will be provided. “I’ve been a school bus driver for 13 years, and many of the kids I transport have special physical and behavioral needs that require special accommodations and increased attention,” said Mike McDermott, a bus driver at the metro yard in Cranston. “We are happy that First Student was finally willing to come to the table with proposals that will help us better take care of our families and do our jobs. Even before the pandemic, First Student could not recruit bus drivers, monitors to do this work, and we are hopeful that better hours and pay will go a long way in attracting more workers to the field. At the end of the day, it’s our students who benefit most.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGrenville: Voters in Greenville County will be allowed to wear “Black Lives Matter” and “Make America Great Again” paraphernalia to the polls this Election Day, according to a notice sent to poll workers by county Elections Director Conway Belangia. He said the county’s decision is the result of a court ruling in Minnesota allowing the same practice. He said the American Civil Liberties Union alerted the county to the ruling. The county attorney was brought in to review the situation, and he determined the Minnesota court ruling, which found BLM and MAGA gear should not be considered prohibited campaign materials, applied to Greenville County. Belangia said the change of interpretation applies only to voters in Greenville County, but the state election commission had previously ruled in a similar manner. The county was a “Johnny-come-lately” in its determination to allow BLM and MAGA gear, Belangia said. Voters are still prohibited from wearing gear for any specific candidate inside polling places.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A federal appeals court on Tuesday upheld a lower court’s decision to block parts of a South Dakota law that would have required ballot petition workers to publicly disclose their personal identification information. The Republican-controlled Legislature in 2020 passed a law that would have required paid ballot measure circulators to list their personal information, including phone number, residential address, email address and driver’s license information, in a directory. The law was just one attempt by lawmakers in recent years to add barriers to ballot measures, which have given progressive causes a chance at enactment in the politically red state. Circuit Judge Steven Grasz wrote in an opinion for a three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that being forced to disclose the information would be “chilling in today’s world” and the law would violate the First Amendment. United States District Judge Lawrence Piersol issued a temporary injunction against the law last year. Dakotans for Health, an organization that was formed around a ballot measure to expand Medicaid eligibility, sued to have the law overturned. The organization is now focused on placing a proposed constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot to codify abortion rights.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A man accused of intentionally setting fire to a Planned Parenthood clinic and of firing shots later at a federal courthouse died months ago, officials announced Monday in disclosing both the man’s death and the allegations. Federal court documents indicate that the man, Mark Thomas Reno, 64, died Aug. 15. Yet many of the documents in his case were sealed until this week, including records showing he had been arrested in connection with the Planned Parenthood arson fire. “The government’s investigation has revealed that (Reno) engaged in a series of violent acts of property destruction in Knoxville since early 2021,” a newly unsealed complaint said. The complaint said Reno fired a shotgun at the clinic’s doors in early 2021, shattering glass and leaving holes in the reception area. Reno then set the clinic ablaze in December 2021, the document said. The building was unoccupied during the fire but had to be closed for months to undergo an $2.2 million renovation. Other court documents show that the FBI began surveillance of Reno in April of this year after he told an undercover agent he belonged to a group with a mission to resist actions opposed to Catholic orthodoxy. The agent was secretly recording Reno, who said that his group had “plenty of targets,” according to the documents.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The leaders of a group that promotes election conspiracy theories were jailed Monday for not complying with a court order to provide information in a defamation lawsuit over some of their claims. Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, who run True the Vote, were ordered detained by U.S. marshals, according to an order signed by U.S. District Judge Kenneth Hoyt in Houston. They will be held for at least one day or “until they fully comply with the Court’s Order,” Hoyt wrote. Houston-based True the Vote provided research for a debunked documentary that alleged widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Engelbrecht, Phillips and their nonprofit organization are being sued by Michigan-based election software provider Konnech Inc. over True the Vote’s claims of a Chinese-related conspiracy involving U.S. poll workers’ information. Alfredo Perez, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service in Houston, said Monday that Engelbrecht and Phillips were in the law enforcement agency’s custody. True the Vote said in a statement read during a video livestream Monday that its attorneys would appeal Hoyt’s ruling.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: For years, water conservation advocates have urged the state to offer money to residents to incentivize them to remove their lawns. For some, at least, that proposal came closer to reality Friday, with water officials set to start taking applications for a pilot program that could pay up to $1 per square foot to Utahns who want to replace their water-guzzling grass with drought-resistant landscaping. The Legislature earlier this year approved a $5 million expenditure to fund a statewide grass removal rebate program. State water officials plan a full launch of the program next spring via a new website, UtahWaterSavers.com, but in the meantime, residents can apply for the pilot program on the Utah Division of Water Resources website, conservewater.utah.gov/grass-removal-rebates, with a limited number of spaces available. Applicants who are approved get a year to complete their landscaping project as long as they meet the criteria, which include requirements for the type of replacement landscaping allowed in each part of the state. Turf removal programs have proven successful in desert cities like Las Vegas, dropping per-capita use, but have been slow to develop in Utah, with water managers often citing a lack of funding.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: In a national assessment of learning, Vermont student performance in math and reading was about average compared to the nation but continued a downward trend the state has seen on national standardized tests since before COVID-19. Vermont students predictably performed below 2019 levels – the last time the test was administered – in math and reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress test and in most cases aligned with the average U.S. score. The test was administered to fourth and eighth graders in math and reading. The test is usually given every two years as a way to measure national and statewide progress over time but was postponed in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Vermont, 202 schools participated in 2022. For the second time in a row, Vermont’s fourth grade math scores dipped below the national average, albeit by one point. Vermont fourth graders’ math scores fell five points overall compared to 2019. This year’s score was 234 on a scale of 500. Math proficiency for both fourth and eighth graders in Vermont had been increasing from the mid-1990s until about 2013, when the scores turned the other direction, and have been in a gradual decline ever since. In 2022, about 35% of fourth grade students were proficient in math.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: In the past four years, the state has seen opioid overdose deaths among Black residents more than triple – the highest death rate, by far, of any demographic. The numbers underscore the lethality of a fentanyl-polluted drug supply, as well as structural barriers to entering recovery, a critical first step in preventing fatal overdose, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports. The numbers – made publicly available by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention death certificate database – tell the story of a striking rise, particularly in the Richmond metropolitan area. Chesterfield County had 34 deaths in 2021, up from 11 in 2018. Henrico County spiked similarly, up to 44 deaths from 14, and Richmond accounted for 135 deaths, up from 41 deaths in 2018. The spike was more acute in Richmond than in any other county in the state. “It desensitizes you to death,” said Darryl Cousins, whocounts three friends who have died of an overdose in the past two months. Cousins, a Black man, works for Starfish Recovery and Wellness, a Richmond-based recovery residence for people with addiction. He’s been sober for 15 years, he said, and shares a long view on how the city has changed in that time. Most frightening is the drug that seems to be everywhere these days. “All of a sudden it’s in every drug being sold,” Cousins said. “Fentanyl has taken over the drug world.”\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: A flatbed truck carrying 500 gallons of liquid detergent hit the median on Highway 3 on Monday evening near Gorst, spilling the fluid onto the road and then into the Puget Sound. The crash near milepost 35 was reported at 5:40 p.m. and cleared about 7 p.m., blocking traffic in each direction for the duration, according to Washington State Patrol Trooper Katherine Weatherwax. The driver told investigators he fell asleep, Weatherwax said. The state Department of Ecology was notified. The detergent that spilled is designed to clean trucks.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State transportation officials say construction has begun on a full-service Division of Motor Vehicles regional office in Morgan County. The new office being built in Berkeley Springs will bring additional driver’s licensing and vehicle services to the citizens of the Eastern Panhandle, officials said in a news release Thursday. It is expected to open in the spring of 2023. “We know how busy our Martinsburg and Charles Town Regional Offices are on a daily basis,” said Everett Frazier, commissioner of the state’s Division Of Motor Vehicles. “Population continues to grow in that location, and opening an office in Morgan County will help us to provide accessible, more efficient and convenient customer service to that area.” A staff of a dozen people or more could be employed at the Morgan County office, and hiring will begin soon, Frazier said. Full-service DMV regional offices offer driver’s license skills testing, written knowledge tests, vehicle registration renewals, title work and other services. A motorcycle course will also be built at the new office.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge on Monday scheduled a two-day sentencing hearing for a man who killed six people when he drove his SUV through a Christmas parade in suburban Milwaukee last year. Waukesha County Circuit Judge Jennifer Dorow set Darrell Brooks’ sentencing for Nov. 15-16 to accommodate dozens of people who want to speak at the proceeding. Prosecutors told the judge they expect at least 36 people will speak. Brooks said he anticipates about 20 people will speak on his behalf. A jury last Wednesday convicted Brooks of 76 counts in connection with the Nov. 21, 2021, incident in Waukesha. The charges include six counts of first-degree intentional homicide and 61 counts of recklessly endangering safety.

Civil engineer David Robinette, owner of Site Inc., is representing both owners.\n\nThe two properties have frontage on Union Road; the 28.76-acre Swan parcel extends from Union Road south to Kingston Pike while the Ivey farm is about 115 acres, with frontage on the north side of Union. The poor condition of Union Road is the sticking point. According to Community Development Director Mark Shipley, improvement of the road will be done in partnership with TDOT, and completion is estimated to take four years or more.\n\nThe sites are somewhat tied together now as Robinette advocates for both owners, noting that development would be coordinated with Union Road reconstruction and would take at least two years to break ground. Given the length of time needed for rezoning, concept and site plan approval, he feels the work can be done concurrently.\n\nRobinette’s proposal includes a privately funded public street along the western edge of the Swan parcel, connecting Union Road to Kingston Pike. A traffic circle near the Ivey farm entrance would help mitigate traffic.\n\nOver the years, each site has been before the commission; previous developers abandoned their plans. In the last application for the Swan parcel in April 2015, a roughly eight-acre section was set aside as open space, buffering Saddle Ridge and Fox Run subdivisions from the proposed commercial area. This new application would allow for attached single-family use on that portion.\n\nA group of local residents attended, with Cynthia Gallentine, Scott Meyer and Judith Small taking the podium. Their position is that rezoning should be postponed until Union Road is ready to take on the additional traffic load, with Gallentine stating, “We are very concerned. There are so many different factors and then to be tearing up that land and not really having the road situation (corrected), we just wanted to communicate that to the commission.”\n\nShipley suggested a “master plan,” clearly laying out the timeline and details. While not required, it would provide a more accountable picture of the process and “how it all interrelates.\" Commissioner Ed St. Clair was in favor of a master plan, as were other members. As this was a discussion only, all parties will have the opportunity to present more information and comments.\n\nOne unusual part of the meeting was the videotaping and audio transcription arranged by attorney John King, working with Robinette on behalf of the owners. King, a partner in the law firm Lewis Thomason King Krieg & Waldrop, took the case because he believes it is valid. “More projects are killed by time,” he said, adding, “Owners have agreed to pay for a public road and work with the town on timing, so they may have a precedent and case to move this forward.”\n\nBEARDEN\n\nChalk paint, decor business expands in former Orangery\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nA few years ago, Jenny Parkhurst was looking at repainting an old desk that had belonged to her grandmother. With all the stripping and prep work involved, however, it became a time-consuming process, so she literally stripped the idea of doing that regularly.\n\nShe began researching a quicker and easier way to paint furniture but also one that maintained a classic look, and started looking at chalk paint. That is when she came across the Annie Sloan brand.\n\nWhat was soon born was a paint-selling business that eventually became the Back Porch Mercantile in Bearden.\n\n“Within two years she went from selling it out of her home to selling it in a brick and mortar store,” said Brittany Highland, the creative lead and manager of the business.\n\nIn mid-November, the business relocated a short distance west of the Bearden shopping center where the Egg & I restaurant is. It's now in a larger facility in the remodeled Orangery building, now called the Orangery Village, at 5440 Homberg Drive.\n\n“It’s been really wonderful,” said Highland, who said they had outgrown the other space. “We’ve really enjoyed the expansion. We have more furniture and we have a larger workshop space.”\n\nThe past as well as the present also seems to be helping them, Parkhurst added. “We have had a great response from the community due to the history of the Orangery,” she said of the popularity of the former restaurant and event facility.\n\nThe Back Porch Mercantile not only sells the chalk paint products, but also teaches customers how to use them and offers other tips through classes. Several are being planned in the near future and will be announced on the store’s website and through social media.\n\nThe expansion has also allowed the business to offer other kinds of products and to help the store establish its goal of being what Parkhurst and Highland call a lifestyle shop.\n\n“We carry everything from home décor and gifts, to bedding and rugs,” said Highland, who attended school at Winthrop College in South Carolina before later working in retail management for such clothing businesses as Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister Co.\n\n“We also carry personal care items as well and fashion. And we are the only store that stocks Annie Sloan chalk paint in Knoxville.”\n\nFor Parkhurst, who is formerly from Johnson City and attended the University of Tennessee, this is a dream come true seeing her business grow enough to require a larger location.\n\n“I’m excited and very happy,” she said. “It’s gone beyond anything I thought I would ever do.”\n\nAlso moving into the Orangery Village in recent weeks have been the Kitchen 919 restaurant and the CycleBar spin exercise class facility. One retail space is still available, and Hatcher-Hill Brokerage LLC has been marketing it.\n\nKARNS\n\nChurch fosters community through Tech for Life ministry\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nStefan Holt and Kyle Beanblossom my look like they’re teaching a computer class, but they’ll both tell you what they’re really doing is building community through their Tech for Life computer skills classes held at West Park Baptist Church each Thursday at 6 p.m.\n\n“We do more than just technical support,” said Holt. \"We try to help our neighbors. You can’t apply for a job at Walmart without computer skills, and you can’t order at McDonald’s using their new kiosk without computer skills.\n\n“Many applicants don’t know how to use a mouse, so we help with those challenges so they can get the job they need.”\n\nHolt said they’ve even gone over to Dogwood Terrace senior housing to help out with things like answering machines and DVR players.\n\n“You never know what you might do to help your neighbor. Something really simple for you might be huge for them, so we do whatever we can to help. Sometimes they can’t come to us so, when time permits, we go to them.”\n\nWhat started as a GED class turned into full-fledged computer classes in 2014.\n\n“Originally, we started with the GED program. When it changed from paper tests to computerized tests, we found that many people didn’t have the computer skills necessary to take it. The church bought 16 laptops, enlisted the help of about 10 volunteers and started the Tech for Life ministry to answer that need.”\n\nClasses include the basics, how to get the most out your computer, computer security, how to work your digital camera, how to make great looking documents, exploring web apps, and how to use your smartphone for pictures, communication, and fun.\n\nThe classes aren’t so much about what buttons to push in a particular program, but more how to find clues and search the screen to find ways to accomplish your goals.\n\n“We teach so that a student can work on any platform. We teach them how to visually search the screen and what to look for. A menu is a menu in any platform. We don’t want them to memorize where to press a button, we want them know how to find the function.”\n\nRather than stop the class to answer the many individual questions that might arise, the church also offers Tech for Life the first Saturday of the month at 10 a.m. Students get one-on-one help with anything tech related such as how to navigate a web page or download your digital photos onto your laptop.\n\nEmail: info@tech-for-life.com\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nRecognizing heroes from the past\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\nBeing a hero isn’t easy, but for the brave men and women who operated and traveled the Underground Railroad in pre-Civil War years it was truly a perilous undertaking. That era in America’s history will be re-created in the play “Heroes of the Underground Railroad,” presented by the Farragut Museum, 11408 Municipal Center Drive, on Sunday, Feb. 25.\n\nNeither underground nor a railroad, the Underground Railroad got its name in the early 1830s when escaping slave Tice Davis plunged into the Ohio River with his owner not far behind. Disappearing almost instantly, Davis confounded his owner, who later was reported to have said, “It was as if he had escaped into an underground railroad.”\n\nOver the years the secret network developed methods to communicate with and guide travelers. Songs offered hints about how to begin the journey; clues were hidden in the lyrics. Directions about what signs to follow, what time of year was best and how to reach a safe house came in the form of music. A song about a water dipper gourd guided slaves to follow the stars of the Big Dipper.\n\nOther symbols used were carvings on trees, lanterns placed in specific windows and different patterned quilts hung for travelers to see. Coded language was used; “passengers” or “baggage” referred to slaves, and those who operated the railroad were known as “conductors.”\n\nHarriet Tubman is a familiar name to many, but less prominent characters are noted in the play. Abolitionists Levi Coffin, John Fairfield and Rev. John Rankin operated stops along the way, helping thousands make their way to freedom. Once free, former slaves like John Parker made risky trips back to slave-holding areas to guide others to the North.\n\nHenry “Box” Brown got his nickname when he shipped himself to Philadelphia in a crate labeled “fragile goods.” Other slaves followed his lead; even a pregnant woman survived the long overland trip. Willing to risk their lives for freedom, slaves took desperate measures, and with the courageous aid of conductors on the railroad, many succeeded. This is that story.\n\nMembers of the Bright Star Touring Theatre will enact the play; the touring company travels throughout the United States and internationally, appearing at venues like museums, schools and churches. This particular play has earned wide acclaim after performances at the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati and is one of the most requested in their repertoire.\n\nAppropriate for kids in third grade and up, Sunday's event is open to the public and free. A reception begins at 1 p.m. with the play starting at 2 p.m. Accompanied by a small band, the production promises to be inspiring, fun and educational.\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nFarragut High dance team brings home first place trophy\n\nHALLS\n\nHalls Elementary students spread love and smiles at Elmcroft\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nStudent Council members at Halls Elementary visited Elmcroft last week to take gifts and hot chocolate to the residents.\n\nThe fourth- and fifth-grade students are led by teacher Kelli Smith, who teaches the members the importance of giving back to the community through service.\n\nMember Sophia Elkins was thrilled to visit the assisted living facility, as \"serving others makes her very happy.\" She greeted guests with her classmates and stopped to listen to stories, receiving a hug from a resident as she left.\n\nThe Student Council members had collected items during the weeks prior to the visit, including tissue, lotion, blankets, stuffed animals, puzzle books and Valentine cards.\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nAfter-school learning center raises the bar\n\nMargie Hagen, Shopper News correspondent\n\nStudents have a new locale for improving academic progress with the opening of Kumon of Farragut, an after-school program designed around the principal of mastering reading and math skills on an individual level and progressing at the student’s own pace.\n\nPart of the educational network Kumon International, the largest supplemental instruction company in the world, the Farragut center has recently opened at 727 North Campbell Station Road (New Midland Plaza, a few doors down from Dunkin’ Donuts).\n\nOwners Kumiko and Kelly Franklin operated their Kumon center in the Alcoa-Foothills area for 15 years before deciding to relocate to Farragut. “Most of our students are from the Knoxville area, so it just made sense to move to a more accessible location, right off I-40,” said Kelly Franklin.\n\nBoth Kumiko and Kelly have extensive backgrounds in education and hold Master's of Linguistics degrees. Both taught at Maryville College; ESL for Kelly and Japanese language for Kumiko. It was 1988 when manufacturing giant Denso opened facilities in the area and Kumiko was enlisted as a de facto translator, helping employees and executives acclimate to their new homes and way of life. She later was a founder of the East Tennessee Japanese School and worked at the Blount County Chamber of Commerce.\n\nWhat makes the Kumon method different? “It’s a long-term approach to lifelong learning,” says Kelly. “This is not a tutoring program. We don’t take students cramming for SAT tests; we develop the learning habits that reinforce persistence and discipline to achieve life skills.”\n\nThe program itself is simple; after an initial assessment, students begin at their own level. Using weekly worksheets, they progress incrementally, always mastering assignments before moving on. Reinforcing knowledge builds confidence to tackle more complex problems.\n\nStudents come to the center once or twice a week to have their previous worksheets graded, do some assignments on site and pick up new worksheets. The new worksheets are completed at home, generally taking 15-30 minutes per day. The goal is to challenge students but not overwhelm them. “Whether students need help coming up to their grade level or want to excel beyond that, Kumon provides those tools,” said Kelly.\n\nRight now sessions are held every Monday and Thursday, 4-7 p.m. It’s a flow, with parents dropping kids off for a 30-45 minute period. Students range in age from 4 years through high school seniors. Interested parents should call 865-984-3131 to set up a private appointment for an individual evaluation.\n\nYou can also learn more about Kumon of Farragut at an open house on Feb. 24, 1-4 p.m. “We want to thank our continuing parents and students and introduce ourselves to new families,” said Kelly.

For the past three years, Central and its feeder schools (Shannondale, Sterchi, Inskip, Fountain City Elementary, Gresham Middle) have worked together to build a stronger community. Stickers and T-shirts can be spotted around town, noting that they are Fountain City Strong.\n\n\"I want Fountain City to be the best. I want people to talk about what is going on in this community.\" He added, \"If you want to create change, create change in the hearts and the minds of the young people.\"\n\nWhen asked what the community can do to help Central, Reynolds immediately answered, \"Tell your neighbors.\" In addition to having solid athletic programs, strong academics and a show-stopping musical program, Central High has one of the best (if not the best) English Language Learners programs in the state.\n\nMore:LUCKY DUCKS: Fountain City Lake free of algae and muck, ready for plants\n\nMore:'Yoga for everyone' offered at one-stop wellness shop\n\nFARRAGUT\n\nHunter Green signs with Virginia Tech\n\nMore:Who signed where on National Signing Day?\n\nMore:National signing day photos\n\nWORDS OF FAITH\n\nGrampa's gray day turns bright with glimpse of love\n\nLarry Trotter, Shopper News columist\n\nSometimes, the smallest things, like a text, can save the day. I was recently having one of those mornings when you question why you bothered to get out of bed. The sky was dark from a passing cold front and my soul was reflecting the drizzly gray. Each time I thought things were getting a little brighter, I realized it was just the glow from another brush fire I needed to extinguish. Then, a text alert diverted my sullen gaze away from the parade of problems to a video from my daughter. There wasn’t much to see, but what I heard transformed the moment.\n\nMy older daughter had been in the car with her 21-month-old son. Out of the blue, he blurted out, “Grampa!” This was the first time he had referred to me on his own so Lauren asked, “What was that?” He replied, “Umm, Grampa!” She stopped for a red light and started recording on her phone just in time for him to again enthusiastically say, “Grampa,” which he repeated a couple of more times. Later, she sent me the recording and said that he had been saying Grampa all day. What she then wrote in the text moved me to tears. “He’s thinking about you, daddy. He’s been thinking about you all day.”\n\nWow! My grandson was thinking about…me. I felt so special. Lynn and I spent a lot of time with his older brother before they moved. We haven’t had as much time with him. And though our love for him is equal with the other two grandchildren, we don’t yet know him in quite the same way and don’t feel as intimately connected. However, after that text, I felt as though a bridge had been built between our little guy and me. The next time I saw him, it just felt different. There was the beginning of a deep, precious bond that I already felt with his brother and my granddaughter.\n\nIn some translations of Jeremiah 29:11 it says, “For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope.” (NKJV) God sent a “text” to his people who, in that particular moment, were in exile and undoubtedly feeling disconnected and distant from their God. He built a bridge of hope by telling them that though they felt far away, he was thinking about them and wanted the best for them.\n\nMost of us go through seasons when we don’t feel as close to God as we’d like. It’s not that we don’t have faith; we just can’t always get our head and heart connected. But there’s good news! God is always thinking about you and me and thinks enough of us to build a bridge of hope through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Yes, you’re that special. The next time you think God is watching from a distance, remember, he isn’t. He’s right here, right now, and forever. Amen.\n\nNORTH/EAST KNOXVILLE\n\nNortheast Knoxville residents go operatic\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThree Knoxvillians from the northeast side of town are venturing far beyond their home base this month – all the way to a mythical kingdom in Peking, China, hundreds of years ago.\n\nWell, sort of. What they’re actually doing is going down to the Knoxville Opera Company (KOC) off Magnolia Avenue. That’s where rehearsals for Giacomo Puccini’s grand opera “Turandot,” to be presented at the Knoxville Civic Auditorium this weekend, have been taking place.\n\nHarry House, who sings the tenor role of the Emperor, says, “It gives you a chance to step aside from the day. You get to wear someone else’s shoes for a while.” House is an account executive for Amedisys Home Health Care. He and his wife, Sharon, also manage about 200 chickens on their farm in Strawberry Plains. He’s a longtime veteran of KOC. “My first opera was ‘Faust’ with Jerome Hines in 1985.” He’s been in several productions of “Turandot” and has also done the roles of Pang, Pong, and the Prince of Persia.\n\nBaritone Michael Rodgers has long thrilled Knoxville audiences with his deep, rich voice. A soloist at Cokesbury United Methodist Church, he plays the role of “the Mandarin,” and is the first person you hear as he gathers the townspeople with his ringing cry of “Popolo di Pekino!” – “People of Peking!”\n\n“I’m enjoying rehearsals,” Rodgers says. “And being in the same company with Othalie and John (Graham and Burton, who play the roles of “Turandot” and “Calaf,” the man who wins her heart) – oh my goodness, what an experience!”\n\nRodgers has played the role before, in KOC’s previous production of the opera in 2003, and he’s played numerous parts in other productions. A special education teacher in the Knox County school system for 21 years, Rodgers says, “I support kids who need intervention in reading, math and social skills” at Maynard Elementary and South Knoxville Elementary Schools.\n\nErnie Roberts, well known as East Tennessee PBS’s director of educational services and host of “TN Learn: Mathline,” is enjoying his time as part of a bloodthirsty mob. In other words, he’s singing in the chorus.\n\n“I’m actually two characters – a wise man and a crazy person. One time I’m holding scrolls and the other time I’m holding a knife. But that’s opera! And that makes it fun.”\n\nThe Knoxville Opera Company’s production of Puccini’s “Turandot” takes place at 7:30 p.m. this Friday, Feb. 23, and 2:30 p.m. this Sunday, Feb. 25, at the Knoxville Civic Auditorium, 500 Howard Baker Jr. Blvd. Ticket prices start at $23.

Students wanted a variety of options when it came to healthy items.\n\n“We have listened to the kids and offered choices such as more fresh fruits and vegetables on the serving line.\"\n\nTeaching elementary age students to live a healthy lifestyle has to extend beyond the lunch line. Teachers have made an effort to model better eating habits to their students and to encourage physical activity.\n\n\n\n“All of our teachers and staff work together to provide teachable moments for encouraging healthy eating habits,” says Nicely.\n\nPhysical education is a great way for students to take a break from sitting at a desk, but it also serves the important role in teaching healthy habits. South Knoxville Elementary students have said that PE is a class they look forward to attending.\n\n“Our PE teacher and our school nurse are so loved by our staff and kids,” says Nicely. “In fact they teach after-school clubs as well on fitness and the human body.”\n\nAs part of the healthy eating program, the school offers healthy afternoon snacks to its students. This effort has created an environment where students get excited to see what fruits they are offered.\n\n“The afternoon snacks are a big hit!” says Nicely. “They are munching on apples and grapes while doing their math and kids are talking about what cool fruits they are snacking on in the afternoons.”\n\nPrincipal Nicely admits that her favorite meal the school provides is the Thanksgiving lunch each year, which is filled with delicious vegetable side dishes and the expected turkey and dressing. She also enjoys lunching on the daily healthy options.\n\n“I do love the fresh fruits and cheese that are served,” says Nicely.\n\nThese efforts at South Knoxville Elementary School will help combat childhood obesity and create healthy habits the students will, it is hoped, continue in their adult lives. The school hopes its efforts also encourage the community to become healthier throughout the year.\n\n\n\nPOWELL\n\nThree Powell athletes sign letters of intent\n\nRuth White, Shopper News\n\nLauren Wood, Powell High senior, signed a letter of intent to play soccer at Lincoln Memorial University next year.\n\nShe is the daughter of Bryce and Jennifer Wood and sister to Makenna Wood. While at LMU she plans to study veterinary medicine. Lauren likes the idea of having smaller class sizes in college and is glad that the school is close enough that her family can watch her play.\n\nPanther teammate Ashlyn Miller is also attending LMU to play soccer. She and Lauren have played together since they were in sixth grade and have a great friendship.\n\n\"We have been good friends for a long time. Knowing that Ashlyn and I will be able to play soccer together for four more years made my decision easier.\"\n\nAshlyn is the daughter of Bill and Tara Miller and sister to Emersyn Miller. She loved the coaching staff at Lincoln Memorial University and is excited to be part of a rebuilding season for the soccer program. The school is close enough to home, providing a good balance of being away and seeing her family.\n\nShe is undecided on her college major at this time, but loves the fact that LMU has a small class size.\n\nPHS soccer coach Mark Smith was a big motivator for Ashlyn this season, helping her come back from an injury and playing in a record-breaking season last fall.\n\nSmith said of the pair, \"We believe in these girls, their great work ethic and desire to play the game. Go and enjoy.\"\n\nGrace Steely signed a letter of intent to play tennis at the University of the Cumberlands next year.\n\nShe is the daughter of Dan and Jennifer Steely and brother to Jackson Steely. Both of Grace's parents attended the University of the Cumberlands, and she is thankful that the school is close enough for her parents to watch her play tennis in college.\n\nGrace selected UC because of the great bio/chem program and the quality tennis team. She and teammate Kelli Hurt represented Powell in the Class AAA state tournament last season.\n\nHALLS\n\nWomen's league hosts chili supper\n\nThe Halls Crossroads Women's League hosted its annual Chili Chowdown at the Halls Senior Center on Friday, Feb. 9, and the community lined up, waiting to enter from the moment the doors opened.\n\nThe event featured tables filled with homemade chili, hot dogs and all the fixings and desserts galore. The Women's League and the Junior Women's League (Halls High students) were on hand to serve up bowls of chili and make sure their guests had a great time at this popular Halls community event.\n\nThe Dave Hall band entertained guests with toe-tapping bluegrass music, and friends had a great time enjoying a great supper and chatting the night away.\n\nBEARDEN\n\nHard work pays off for Bearden dance team\n\nJohn Shearer, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThe Bearden High School dance team is used to performing its routines with plenty of precision, practice and planning.\n\nBut when the members realized they had won the Universal Dance Association’s national championship in the large varsity pom division recently, a more spontaneous and unrehearsed happy dance and celebration followed.\n\n“It was indescribable,” said senior Shaylie Rutherford after learning they had won during the competition on Feb. 4 in Orlando. “I felt so proud and I know the whole team felt proud to be recognized for the hard work.”\n\nJunior Sydney Schriver called the experience of learning the good news weird and surreal, and said the celebration began as soon as Collierville was announced as the runner-up.\n\n“Getting all the texts and messages from everyone was awesome,” she said of the moments afterward.\n\nThey had won the competition with a roughly two-minute routine that included several synchronized jumps and turns with pom poms in their hands. They had also finished fourth in the large jazz division with a similarly high-energy maneuver.\n\nIt was a good time for Knox County overall, as Farragut High won the small varsity jazz division and was second in small pom.\n\nLooking back on the event as several talked outside the team’s dance room by the school gym last week, the Bearden girls were calmer than a few days earlier, but were still smiling quite a bit. And that included the coaches, too.\n\n“It was very meaningful to all of us because of all the hard work the girls put in,” said head coach Hannah Keathley, who danced for Oak Ridge High and the University of Tennessee before joining Bearden’s program.\n\nA consistent and steady pattern has been characteristic for the Bearden girls in competition results as well as individual routines, as they have won the state five times and also done well nationally before breaking through this year.\n\nBut it has not come easily. When school starts back in January, the team practices two hours a day on school days and four hours each on the weekends leading up to the competition.\n\nThey also work hard during the rest of the year, including when getting ready for state competition in November and regional qualifying about the time of camp in August.\n\n“We do whatever it takes to get us where we can,” said Schriver.\n\nBut fun camaraderie is also enjoyed while doing all the hard work.\n\n“We are with each other all the time,” said sophomore Meaghan Chase. “We love each other.”\n\nGracie Benevicz, another senior, said what also helps the team and encourages unity is that many of them are on the dance team at West Valley Middle School, and they are encouraged to stay involved when they go to Bearden. And seeing the high school girls perform as youngsters is also motivational, they added.\n\nThe team also provides support for other Bearden sports teams by performing at their games.\n\nAs a result, it all makes for an overall fun and rewarding time, despite the work involved, the girls said.\n\n“I like the bond and being able to experience everything,” said Chloe McClish, another senior.\n\nOther members of the championship team include senior Jade Gatton-Bumpus; juniors Chloe Anders, Sydney Hansen, Lauren Jacoby, Ansley Pacetti, Bailey Simpson and Taylor Tarquin; sophomores Summer Davis, Lauren Hall, Lauren Hull, and Alina Serafin; and freshmen Natalie Adkins, Ali Berg, Abbie Drum, Emma Mañalac, Katherine Newman, and Anna Snyder.\n\nBesides head coach Keathley, the team is also led by technique coach Kathyrn Brasfield, choreographer Katie Fear Lane, and faculty sponsor Rebecca Nutter.\n\nMore:Lady Panthers put together the pieces for a state softball run\n\nKARNS\n\nAll Saints Mardi Gras brings smiles, aids charity\n\nNancy Anderson, Shopper News correspondent\n\nNeither rain nor flu dampened the spirits of nearly 80 people attending the second annual Mardi Gras Party fundraiser held at All Saints Catholic Church Saturday, Feb 10.\n\nThe party was a joint venture between All Saints and Louisiana State University Alumni.\n\nThis year’s recipient was the Ladies of Charity Knoxville\n\nExecutive director Susan Unbehaun said the event was a pleasant surprise for the Ladies of Charity.\n\n“This is an unexpected pleasure.

Those who weren’t dancing couldn’t sit still to the toe-tapping music.\n\nNew this year was a mini Mardi Gras parade featuring “wearable” floats and the LSU tiger throwing beads to a cheering crowd.\n\nCo-host Cathy Ernst said the parade was the most fun part of the evening besides the food.\n\n“We only had three people, but this is the first year to do the mini parade. I’m hoping it will become a 'thing' and people will decorate their own floats and be in the parade. It went over really well, I think people really got a kick out of it.”\n\nErnst said her biggest challenge was figuring out how to get people to come.\n\n“I really couldn’t advertise publicly because we can only hold 250 people. I literally stood outside every Mass for a week in my Mardi Gras finery personally inviting people to come. We don’t have as many people as last year, but I think the rain and the flu had something to do with that. The people who are here are having a ball.”\n\nThe evening featured a silent auction containing high-end works of art such as Murano Glass rooster figurines and a 150-year-old Polish cut crystal vase.\n\nThere was also a white elephant raffle for interesting knickknacks donated by All Saints Catholic Church parishioners.\n\nInfo: www.allsaintsknoxville.org\n\nNORTH/EAST KNOXVILLE\n\nGo wild – and do good – at Seven Islands this weekend\n\nCarol Z. Shane, Shopper News correspondent\n\nThis weekend you’ll have a chance to help out in one of East Tennessee’s most beautiful parks when Seven Islands State Birding Park holds its first Volunteer Day of 2018.\n\nPark ranger Justine Cucchiara says, “We typically host one Volunteer Day per month. We’ve found that with our staff of two it is tough to keep up with the maintenance demands of the park. Volunteers are essential. It is also a great way for people to get involved, get outside and get some exercise.”\n\nThat’s all great, but it’s winter, right? Not much to see? Cucchiara says, “Winter is a good time to see deer and sparrows. Also, Northern Harriers – grassland obligate hawks with a distinctive bright white rump – overwinter at the park.”\n\nParticipants will assist park staff with exotic plant management, native gardening and various other park projects.\n\n“We have a new ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) trail and pedestrian bridge under construction,” says Cucchiara. ”New permanent restrooms are coming soon. We have two new trails in the works: one wooded trail leading to a stunning vista and a loop trail for the island. We are also working on lots of new interpretive elements in an attempt to make the park even more ‘birder friendly.’”\n\nYou and your family and friends can help with all of that. Plus, you can get a good look at one of the newest features of the park.\n\nMore:Public input sought on future of John Sevier Highway\n\n“The Wild Yards Garden is a demonstration area at the entrance of the park that help to translate what we do at Seven Islands on a very large scale to something folks can take home with them. The landscaping utilizes only native plants. Every section is planted very intentionally to demonstrate how native flowers, shrubs, and trees can be used to create beautiful and low-maintenance yards that will attract and sustain wildlife such as birds and butterflies.” Such a sustainable landscape also lessens the need for lawn mowing, and contributes to a healthier environment for everyone. It’s totally win-win, and you can get tips for your own yard.\n\nCucchiara hopes for a good turnout for the event. “It’s a feel-good thing!” she says. “And it gives us a chance to meet folks that really care about the park.”\n\nSeven Islands State Birding Park’s first Volunteer Day of 2018 happens from 9:30 a.m. to roughly 12:30 p.m. this Saturday, Feb. 24. Participants should park in the gravel parking lot and meet at the Blue Bird Barn at the park entrance, 2809 Kelly Lane in Kodak, Tenn., accessed from exit 402 on I-40 East. Participants should be prepared with sturdy footwear, work gloves and appropriate dress for the weather. Bring plenty of water and snacks or lunch.

Larry Smith has served as president of the foundation and as the president of the CHS Alumni Association. McBee Nevader said that Smith has graciously agreed to step back from the foundation and focus on the alumni association.\n\nOn Feb. 5, the former foundation board voted in John Meade and McBee Nevader as co-presidents, Courtney Shea as secretary/treasurer and Brian Shupe and principal Michael Reynolds as board members. Teacher and PTSO representatives will be confirmed soon and interested parties can also apply.\n\nMore:Knox Board of Education members say security is adequate, but they will review any proposed changes\n\n“We have so much at stake, the more people involved the more you can get done,” said Reynolds. “We want to make sure our community is well informed about what we have to offer. Magnet schools are reaching out to our children before we have had the opportunity to speak to them.”\n\nReynolds and his staff submitted a “Wish List” to serve as the foundation’s initial funding goals. The list includes access to ACT Pareto Analysis Ed for all 10th and 11th grade students; creation of a “maker space” to make Central a STEM/STEAM hub for north Knox County schools, and North Knoxville’s first high school-based summer STEAM Camp.\n\nBy funding these initiatives, McBee Nevader said they hope to retain students who would otherwise transfer to other schools. Reynolds added that it should also assist with teacher retention.\n\n“We are all sort of “gala’d” out and it’s a ton of work,” said McBee Nevader. At this point the board is planning to host an annual luncheon where the principal and some students will speak to potential sponsors about their wish list of initiatives.\n\n“If someone wants to just go ahead and invest, that’s great,” said McBee Nevader. “But above all, we want to start raising awareness and education about what the foundation is.”\n\n“We wanted to start out with something manageable for the first few years,” said Meade, foundation co-president. “We want to rely on the supporters of the Shannondale and Gresham foundations. We have a pretty good base that we have been working with and we want to continue that tradition.\n\n“We are trying to involve all aspects of the community that are interested in seeing Central continue to grow and thrive,” said Meade. “Members of the community that have been leaders in the Fountain City area for generations – such as Tommy Schumpert, Phil Keith, Jean Payne and Dr. Bill Snyder will form the Executive Advisory Committee.”\n\nCHS Foundation’s new mission statement is, \"The Central High School Foundation exists as a private fund-raising group to support Central High School’s pursuit of academic excellence for all students.\"\n\nStudents are currently creating a website at www.centralhighschoolfoundation.com.

And if I was feeling brave I might add, “It’s not hash. It’s leftovers.”\n\nUndeterred by my misery, my dad would say what he always said when someone complained about hash night: “Waste not, want not.” Then he’d raise an eyebrow and declare, “It’s hash if I say it’s hash.”\n\nAnd that was that. My dad could pronounce something and make it so. As a child, I felt powerless in his presence. I had to eat the hash.\n\nBut it really wasn’t hash. It was all the week’s leftovers cooked together in one giant sauté pan and bravely consumed by all of us. Hash could be anything. Your meal might be green beans, spaghetti, meatloaf and carrots. Or it could be grilled fish, peas, mashed potatoes, and chicken. Caution was thrown to the wind. There was no combination of ingredients too horrible. If we ate it during the week, it was hash at the end of the week.\n\nMore:Shopper News blog: Brent Waugh takes the reins for Big Brothers Big Sisters\n\nI didn’t hate hash just because it tasted terrible, and most nights, it did. I hated hash night because somewhere deep inside, I thought it was weird. It made us different. It embarrassed me even if no one outside of our family knew about it. We were the kind of family that mixed all our food together at the end of the week and ate it. And I didn’t want to be part of that family. I wanted to be part of the white-bread families I saw on television who ate beef tenderloin and had little plates for their rolls and butter.\n\nI haven’t thought about hash night in years. That was one tradition I was happy to give up when I started a family of my own. But the other night, when my husband was out of town, I stared into the refrigerator and my leftovers stared back at me.\n\nWithout giving it much thought, I diced up rotisserie chicken, some broccoli and zucchini I’d had earlier in the week, and a few cooked mushrooms I’d put over steak the day before. Then I took broth from some chicken soup I had for lunch and used it to make a stir fry sauce. I tossed all the ingredients together in one big sauté pan and called it dinner.\n\nIt wasn’t until I was sitting in front of the nightly news eating my meal that I realized what I’d done. While it wasn’t the best meal I ever made, it wasn’t terrible. Bland but edible. It made me wonder about my memories. Was the hash of my childhood as horrible as I remember? Was it as embarrassing as I thought?\n\nThat’s the funny thing about childhood memories. They’re trapped in time. They’re the thoughts of a person who doesn’t exist anymore, a person who has grown and become someone else over the years. I’ll never know what was real, only what was real for me when I was a little girl who resented her father.\n\nBut as an adult, I made an end-of-the-week hash of my own. And I thought of my dad and his awful concoctions, not with embarrassment or misery, but with a smile.\n\nLeslie Snow may be reached at snow column@aol.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/19"}]}

Among its stars is Scott Kelly, a former astronaut and test pilot who commanded three International Space Station expeditions.\n\nTechnically the group is studying unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs. NASA says UAPs are of interest for national security as well as air safety. And without access to an extensive set of data, it is nearly impossible to verify or explain any observation, NASA says.\n\n“I want to emphasize this loud and proud: There is absolutely no convincing evidence for extraterrestrial life associated with” unidentified objects, NASA’s Dan Evans said after the hearing.\n\nStill, hundreds of questions from the public that poured in ahead of time were skeptical and veered into conspiracy theories.\n\n\"It is our collective responsibility to investigate these occurrences with the rigorous scientific scrutiny that they deserve,\" Evans, an associate administrator at the space agency, said at the hearing. \"It's an opportunity for us to expand our understanding of the world around us. This work is in our DNA.\"\n\nThomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA, said understanding data surrounding UAPs is crucial to drawing \"scientific conclusions about what is happening in our skies. Data is the language of scientists and makes the unexplainable explainable.”\n\nThe panel gathered at NASA's headquarters in Washington, but the public took part remotely. The panel's final report is expected this summer.\n\nNASA announces 16 people who will study UFOs to see what's natural - and what isn't\n\nOther developments:\n\n∙ In June 2021, the office of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence released a report examining unidentified aerial phenomena, determining that no \"firm conclusions\" could be drawn on more than 140 instances.\n\n∙ In July 2022, the Pentagon set up the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office to, among other things, identify unidentified anomalous phenomena that might pose a threat to national security.\n\n∙ Last May, Congress held its first public hearing on UFOs in more than 50 years.\n\nPanel members subject to online harassment\n\nEvans said that some members of the team have faced online harassment for participating in the study and that NASA security was addressing it. He did not reveal details of the harassment.\n\n\"We at NASA are acutely aware of the considerable public interest in UAPs,\" Evans said. \"However, it is critical to understand that any form of harassment toward our panelists only serves to detract from the scientific process, which requires an environment of respect and openness.\"\n\nHe urged Americans to allow for \"respectful discourse\" that befits the panel's expertise and the significance of its work.\n\nSafe skies, national defense are top priorities\n\nThe team is trying to determine how data gathered by civilian government agencies, commercial data and data from other sources can be analyzed to shed light on UAPs. It will then recommend a \"road map\" for potential UAP data analysis by the agency going forward.\n\nSean Kirkpatrick, director of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO, says the majority of unidentified objects reported to his agency appear to be nothing more than balloons, unmanned aerial systems, clutter, natural phenomena or other readily explainable sources, he said.\n\n\"We cannot answer decades of questions about UAP all at once, but we must begin somewhere,\" Kirkpatrick said in front of a Senate subcommittee last month. \"I assure you that AARO will follow scientific evidence wherever it leads.\"\n\nStudy may shed little light on UFOs\n\nThe study will focus solely on unclassified data. A full report containing the team’s findings will be released, but don't look for fantastic revelations surrounding the suspected Chinese spy balloon that was shot down in February. Or any highly classified government files out of Area 51, a remote and secretive U.S. Air Force testing facility in the Nevada desert. The area draws UFO fanatics from around the world, and the small town of Rachel has become a popular tourist destination on the \"Extraterrestrial Highway.\"\n\n\"Science is built on evidence, it thrives on scrutiny, it demands reproducibility and above all objectivity,\" Evans said. \"We do not come in with an agenda. ... The primary objective of this incredible team of experts is not to go back and look at grainy footage of UAPs, but rather to give us a road map to guide us for future analysis.\"\n\nContributing: Jordan Mendoza; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/31"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/24/world/ufos-nasa-team-study-scn/index.html", "title": "UFO study by NASA-selected study team kicks off | CNN", "text": "Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nOfficials at NASA selected a team of 16 scientists and experts who will delve into the mysteries surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena — more popularly known as unidentified flying objects or UFOs. The independent study kicked off Monday.\n\nThe group will include experts across numerous disciplines — including astrobiology, data science, oceanography, genetics, policy and planetary science — as well as retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly, a former fighter pilot and test pilot and retired US Navy captain.\n\nAn independent study on unidentifiable objects in the sky by a NASA-selected team started October 24. Stefani Reynolds/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe space agency, which first announced it was forming the group in June, previously revealed that the team would be led by astrophysicist David Spergel, who is president of the Simons Foundation in New York City. ​​\n\nThe new group won’t necessarily seek to determine exactly what the UAPs, which have been seen moving through restricted military airspace over the past several decades, are. Rather, the team will look to hash out exactly how it’s best for NASA to approach further study of the phenomenon.\n\nThe space agency has already noted that the limited number of observations of UAPs has made it difficult to draw scientific conclusions about the nature of such events.\n\n“Without access to an extensive set of data, it is nearly impossible to verify or explain any observation, thus the focus of the study is to inform NASA what possible data could be collected in the future to scientifically discern the nature of UAP,” according to a NASA news release.\n\nThere have been several studies of UAPs carried out by various arms of the US government, including a Pentagon report that was declassified in June 2021, though none have given the public a clear answer about what the UAPs could be. Officials at NASA have been thinking about how to study UAPs in a formal way for a long time, but they wanted to ensure that they approached it in the right way, said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, in June.\n\nThis study, expected to last about nine months, will also be entirely unclassified and within the public domain.\n\n“Exploring the unknown in space and the atmosphere is at the heart of who we are at NASA,” Zurbuchen said in a Friday statement. “Understanding the data we have surrounding unidentified aerial phenomena is critical to helping us draw scientific conclusions about what is happening in our skies. Data is the language of scientists and makes the unexplainable, explainable.”\n\nThe team will gather data on “events in the sky that cannot be identified as aircraft or known natural phenomena – from a scientific perspective,” the agency said.\n\nNASA said it was interested in UAPs from a security and safety perspective. There was no evidence UAPs are extraterrestrial in origin, NASA added. The study will begin this fall and is expected to take nine months.\n\nThe search for life\n\nNASA has long been tasked with finding life elsewhere, which is why astrobiology programs are part of the agency’s focus, Zurbuchen said. The Perseverance rover is currently searching for signs of ancient life that may have once existed on Mars while future missions are being developed to seek signs of life on ocean worlds in our solar system. The agency seeks to explore the unknown in air and space, Zurbuchen said.\n\n“We’re looking for the question of whether certain environments are in fact part of, if you want, the ladder of life that got us to where we are,” he said during news conference Thursday.\n\nThe agency will approach the UAP study like they would any other science study – taking a field that is poor in data and making it worthy of scientific investigation and analysis.\n\n“There’s many times where something that looked almost magical turned out to be a new scientific effect,” Zurbuchen said.\n\nGiven the national security and air safety issues that have been raised with UAPs, scientists want to look at the observations and establish if these are natural or need to be explained otherwise.\n\nWhile talking about UAPs in a traditional science environment may be looked down on or regarded as something not related to science, Zurbuchen “vehemently opposes that.”\n\n“I really believe that the quality of science is not only measured by the outputs that come behind it, but also the questions we’re willing to tackle with science,” he said.\n\nThe intent of the study is to make a proposal for a research program that can be implemented once the researchers assess the data that exists and should be reviewed.\n\nThe full report will be made available to the public, and the research team will hold a public meeting to discuss the findings, said Daniel Evans, NASA Science Mission Directorate assistant deputy associate administrator for research, during the news conference. Like NASA’s other standard grant review panels, the budget estimated for this project is between a few tens of thousands of dollars and no more than $100,000, Evans said.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to anticipate what the study will reveal, Spergel said “we should be open to the idea that we’re looking at several different phenomena.”\n\n“I think we have to approach all these questions with a sense of humility,” Spergel said. “I’ve spent most of my career as a cosmologist. I can tell you, we don’t know what makes up 95% of the universe. So there are things we don’t understand. I hope this study moves us forward to understand these phenomena better. But at the end of the day, we may conclude that we still don’t understand many aspects of them and perhaps have a road map on how to make progress.”", "authors": ["Katie Hunt Ashley Strickland Jackie Wattles", "Katie Hunt", "Ashley Strickland", "Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/10/24"}]}

Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nCNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n“A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,” the governor said Monday.\n\nJackson’s ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoods before this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter – where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending – to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nSome on social media also pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of the city’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources, given that 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n”.@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,” Johnson’s tweet read. “Make the damn call. This is personal.”\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city’s population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city’s residents were Black.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/17/football/qatar-2022-world-cup-migrant-workers-human-rights-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Migrant workers helped build Qatar's World Cup tournament, now ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nKamal was standing outside a shop with other migrant workers, having finished yet another grueling working day, when he and – he says – a few others were arrested this August. Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/15/business/railroad-strike-averted-tentative-deal/index.html", "title": "Railroad strike averted after marathon talks reach tentative deal ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN Business —\n\nUnions and management reached a tentative deal early Thursday, averting a freight railroad strike that had threatened to cripple US supply chains and push prices higher for many goods.\n\nThe deal with unions representing more than 50,000 engineers and conductors was announced just after 5 a.m. ET in a statement from the White House, which called it “an important win for our economy and the American people.”\n\nA verbal agreement between the two sides was reached at about 2:30 am ET according to sources, and the final hours were spent getting the details worked out.\n\nThat concluded about 20 hours of talks between the unions’ leadership and the railroads’ labor negotiators hosted by Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. They began their meeting Wednesday morning with the clock ticking down to a strike that had been set to start at 12:01 am ET on Friday.\n\nPresident Joe Biden called in personally to talk to negotiators around 9 pm ET Wednesday, according to a person familiar with negotiations. Biden stressed that catastrophic harm could come to families, businesses and communities if the rail system shut down. Sources within the unions were giving Biden’s call credit for helping to get the deal completed without a strike.\n\n“We’re very proud of what was accomplished,” said Jeremy Ferguson, president of the conductors union and one of the leaders involved in the marathon session. He thanked Biden and Labor Department officials involved in the talks for the deal.\n\n“Everybody pulled together to make sure that we could get our members what they deserved,” he said.\n\n“This is the quality of life issue we have been trying to get for our members since bargaining started,” said Dennis Pierce, president of the engineers’ union and the other union official involved in the talks.\n\nPierce and Ferguson met with Biden at the White House later Thursday morning. At a Rose Garden appearance, Biden thanked them, the railroads’ negotiators and administration officials who participated in the talks.\n\n“You’ve reached an agreement that will keep our critical rail system working and avoid disruptions of our economy,” Biden said. “I’m grateful. This agreement is validation…of what I’ve always believed: Unions and management can work together…for the benefit of everyone.”\n\nThe deal needs to be ratified by union members before it can go into effect and totally end the threat of a strike. But it’s good news for a wide range of businesses that depend upon the freight railroads to continue to operate, and for the wider US economy. About 30% of the nation’s freight moves by rail.\n\nA win for workers, railroads and the economy\n\nThe deal gives the union members an immediate 14% raise with back pay dating back to 2020, and raises totaling 24% during the five-year life of the contract, that runs from 2020 through 2024. It also gives them cash bonuses of $1,000 a year. All told, the backpay and earlier bonuses will give union members an average of an $11,000 payment per person once the deal is ratified.\n\nFew other details of the deal have so far been made public. But the statement from Biden indicated that the major sticking point – involving work rules and scheduling issues – that had brought the country within a day of its first national rail strike in 30 years had been addressed in the unions’ favor.\n\n“It is a win for tens of thousands of rail workers who worked tirelessly through the pandemic to ensure that America’s families and communities got deliveries of what have kept us going during these difficult years,” said Biden in a statement. “These rail workers will get better pay, improved working conditions, and peace of mind around their health care costs: all hard-earned.”\n\nThe dispute was about staffing shortages and scheduling rules that union leaders said had brought their membership to a breaking point. The unions say the railroads have been requiring their members to be “on call” and ready to report to work on short notice as often as seven days a week. Leadership of the two unions had said their members would not accept a contract without changes to those work rules.\n\nThe union said the deal provides one additional paid day off a year as well a protections against discipline if they need time off to attend to routine and preventative medical care, as well as exemptions from attendance policies for hospitalizations and surgical procedures. Railroad actions against workers who were unable to be on call or report to work due to medical issues had stoked anger among union members.\n\nBiden described the deal as “also a victory for railway companies who will be able to retain and recruit more workers for an industry that will continue to be part of the backbone of the American economy for decades to come.”\n\nIt is an important victory for Biden, who faced nothing but bad choices if a deal had not been reached. Backing Congressional action sought by the business community to impose a contract on workers would have angered his supporters among the unions. Letting the work stoppage play out risked massive economic consequences just ahead of the midterm elections.\n\nHow we got here\n\nRailroad workers are governed by a different labor law than most workers, one that limits their freedom to strike and allows for more governmental intervention. In July, Biden issued an order that prevented a strike at that time and created a panel, known as a Presidential Emergency Board, to try to find a solution to the dispute.\n\nIt also imposed a 60-day cooling off period during which the unions could not strike and management could not lock out workers. That cooling off period was due to end early Friday.\n\nBiden could not have ordered the railroads to keep operating once the cooling off period ended Friday. Only Congress could have acted to get the unions back to work if a strike had begun.\n\nWith a wide range of business groups calling on Congress to act, Republicans had prepared legislation that would have given railroad management the deal they wanted. But Democrats were opposed to taking such action.\n\nA union source said that Democrats’ refusal to side with management had been a key to the talks.\n\n“Senate leaderership not acting gave space for these negotiations,” said the union source. He said that Walsh had “hung in” with the union during the negotiations.\n\n“it was a slog yesterday,” he said, with lots of back and forth.\n\n“Our people were not going to give up,” said the source. “Our people would have gone on strike” if a deal was not reached by the Friday deadline.\n\nRank and file ratification still needed\n\nThe agreement does not mean the threat of a strike has gone away entirely. The deal needs to be ratified by rank-and-file union members.\n\nSome union members appeared to criticize the deal on social media, and the unions’ leadership conceded that some rank-and-file members may be unsatisfied with the deal.\n\n“We got a little bit of paid time off, but we’ll live to fight another day. You know, that’s part of bargaining,” Michael Baldwin, president of the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen, told CNN. “When the members look at what is in the contract, I think they’re going to see that the wages and extra day of paid leave is going to be beneficial to them. …Sometimes you can’t accomplish everything, so you come back next time.”\n\nAnother union leader was confident the tentative deal would be accepted.\n\n“I think we got everything we could,” Dennis Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen told CNN. “And I think once our membership understands where we sit and what’s in it, I think it’ll ratify.”\n\nRecently, the members of some unions have balked at approving deals, even when recommended by their union’s leadership.\n\nAbout 10,000 members of the United Auto Workers union at farm equipment maker John Deere went on strike last fall after rejecting a lucrative tentative agreement, and then stayed on strike after rejecting a subsequent deal. They finally returned to work after five weeks.\n\nStriking workers at cereal maker Kellogg (K) also rejected a tentative deal and decided to stay on strike in December before finally agreeing to deal weeks later. And only 50.3% of film production workers voted in favor of a deal that achieved virtually all bargaining goals of their union, averting a strike by 63,000 technicians, artisans and craftspeople which could have brought production of movies, television and streaming shows to a halt.\n\nThe Association of American Railroads also praised the deal and thanked the Biden administration, as well as the unions themselves, for their role in reaching an agreement.\n\nThe pay raises and bonuses had been recommended by a presidential panel charged with trying to find a solution to the impasse in negotiations at that time.\n\nThose terms were lucrative enough for most of the rail unions to agree to tentative deals in recent weeks, the engineers and conductors, who were faced with work and scheduling rules that did not apply to others, refused to sign on without relief on the scheduling issue.\n\nShares of the major freight railroads were mixed. Union Pacific (UNP) and CSX (CSX) were a bit higher, while Norfolk Southern (NSC) shares fell. Shares of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), which owns the fourth national freight railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, was narrowly lower.\n\nDisruptions had already started\n\nThe threat of the strike had already started to disrupt operations. Amtrak, whose 22,000-mile system is almost exclusively over freight rail lines outside of the Northeast Corridor, had already canceled all long-distance trains. Amtrak said it “is working to quickly restore canceled trains and reaching out to impacted customers to accommodate on first available departures.” It said it will provide update soon as information becomes available.\n\nThe railroads had already stopped accepting shipments of hazardous and security-related materials a week ago. And Wednesday some of the railroads had stopped accepting shipments of crops from the agricultural industry.\n\nCustomers of the railroads who had been braced to major problems expressed relief that a strike had been avoided.\n\n“This is fantastic news for the economy,” said Eric Hoplin, CEO of the National Association of Wholesale Distributors, in an appearance on CNN’s New Day Thursday. “My phone has been ringing off the hook over the last 48 hours, talking to distribution leaders from across the country, who were spelling out what some of the catastrophic consequences could have been to America’s supply chain and the economy.”\n\nThe US economy avoided several economic blows, including a potential spike in gasoline prices that could have undone the 26% decline in prices at the pump over the last three months. Although refineries get most of their oil through pipelines and ship out most of the gasoline they produce the same way, they still needed railroad tank cars to deliver other materials to refine gasoline and to take away waste products.\n\nHigher prices for food and cars and a shortage of consumer goods well into the holiday shopping season were likely if there had been a prolonged strike, according to business leaders and economists.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore Vanessa Yurkevich Jeremy Diamond", "Chris Isidore", "Vanessa Yurkevich", "Jeremy Diamond"], "publish_date": "2022/09/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/weather/buffalo-winter-storm-new-york-blizzard-wednesday/index.html", "title": "Winter storm in Buffalo: Crews work to clear snow-covered roads ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe winter storm death toll has risen to 37 in Erie County, New York, as crews continue to clear roads and first responders check on people they couldn’t reach days ago when the catastrophic weather system swept the nation, officials there said Wednesday.\n\nAt least 25 others across 11 US states also have been reported dead in the storm, which buried the city of Buffalo in nearly 52 inches of snow, trapping residents in western New York at home – many without heat as the Christmas weekend blizzard took out power lines.\n\n“It’s a horrible storm with too many deaths,” Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said at a news conference as he praised first responders, without whom “more people would have died.”\n\nNow, authorities are going door-to-door to conduct wellness checks, Poloncarz said: An EMS task force is checking locations of emergency calls that authorities could not reach during the storm, while the National Guard will spend the next couple days checking every house in neighborhoods that lost power.\n\n“We are fearful that there are individuals who may have perished living alone or people who were not doing well in an establishment, especially those that still don’t have power,” Poloncarz said.\n\nBuffalo police completed sifting through 911 calls going back to the early days of the storm, Commissioner Joseph A. Gramaglia said Wednesday. He told CNN’s Pamela Brown that it was a “tremendous” effort that also resulted in the recovery of a “substantial” number of bodies. The task included requests for welfare checks.\n\nGramaglia said he expects rising temperatures in the coming days will melt the snow and uncover more storm victims.\n\nAmid the frigid, whiteout conditions, “people … got stranded in their vehicles and passed away in their cars.

Two-thirds of the equipment dispatched to help clear winter snow during the height of the storm also got stuck, he said.\n\nPoloncarz was asked Wednesday about the timing of the driving ban, which went into effect Friday at 9:30 a.m. as the storm hit, and whether there had been discussion among officials about issuing such a ban earlier.\n\nOfficials started discussing a potential ban last Thursday, Poloncarz said, but they initially believed the snow band wouldn’t reach the Erie County until 10 a.m. the next morning. They opted to wait, in part, because officials wanted workers to be able to get home before temperatures dropped below freezing, he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, temperatures “dropped dramatically,” going from rain to sleet to snow within five minutes around 8:40 a.m., he said. Whiteout conditions didn’t occur until about 10 a.m., he noted, after the ban was issued.\n\n“But we have to take a lot into consideration,” Poloncarz said. “If anyone is to be blamed, you can blame me. I’m the one who has to make the final call on behalf of the county.”\n\nCity faces criticism over cleanup; mayor says city working hard\n\nPoloncarz, the county executive, on Wednesday criticized how Buffalo’s mayor has handled storm cleanup efforts, saying Brown has not been on daily coordination calls with other municipalities and that the city has been slow to reopen.\n\n“I am a city resident myself, I live in the city of Buffalo, and it pains me to see the other 25 towns and two small cities opened in times when the city isn’t,” Poloncarz said, adding that the county should take over cleanup efforts so the city can fully reopen.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks, the mayor dismissed the criticism, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday evening, “I’m not concerned about those comments, my concern is for the residents of the city of Buffalo.”\n\n“I’ve just completed hours of touring neighborhoods throughout the city, watching the plowing operations,” Brown said, adding there were agencies from the city, county and state working in recovery efforts who have been doing a “great job working together, working around the clock.”\n\n“We believe that by tonight, we’ll have 100% of streets opened up in the city of Buffalo and it’s my hope to be able to lift the … driving ban before the start of business tomorrow,” Brown added.\n\nOther local leaders have urged a review of how the storm was handled.\n\nA person clears snow along a Buffalo road on Wednesday, December 28. Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n\nDozens of people rescued by National Guard\n\nThere were 580 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen on the ground Wednesday in the Buffalo area, according to the force’s public affairs office.\n\nThey have two separate missions: Teams of four soldiers go door-to-door to see if residents have power, heat and food – and distributing ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, and water as needed; and teams of two soldiers and two medical providers conduct wellness checks, spokesperson Eric Durr told CNN.\n\nAs of Tuesday, they had rescued at least 86 people “from hazardous situations,” according to a news release, including a woman taken to a hospital just before giving birth.\n\nSeparately, a member of the 105th Military Police Company “learned from his mother that a pregnant woman he was close to had gone into labor,” the release said.\n\n“He went to her home,” it said, “helped deliver the baby, then reported for duty.”\n\nPreparations for flooding\n\nMeantime, Buffalo faces a small risk of flooding as rising temperatures begin to melt the massive amount of snow and 2 inches of rain is forecast through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she directed state agencies to help support the affected communities with flood response resources.\n\nResources including generators, pumps and more than 700,000 sandbags were available for deployment from state stockpiles in Erie and Monroe counties, the release said.\n\nNationwide death toll rises\n\nIn Erie County, 29 who died were in the city of Buffalo, while seven were located in the suburbs, Poloncarz said Wednesday, adding he did not know where one person was found. Multiple bodies remain unidentified, Poloncarz added.\n\nHe has asked that anyone with a missing family member to call local police to help with the ID process.\n\nAmong the storm’s victims is Anndel Taylor, 22, whose family said she was found dead in Buffalo over the holiday weekend after getting trapped in her car by the blizzard.\n\nAfter losing contact with her, the family posted her location to a private Facebook page related to the storm to ask for help, and a man called to say he had found her without a pulse, her sister said.\n\nThe winter storm’s grim effects have been widespread, with at least 62 storm-related deaths reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 37 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning was reported in Niagara County. The preliminary investigation indicates snow “covered the external furnace causing carbon monoxide to enter the residence,” the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Wednesday, identifying the victim as 27-year-old Timothy M. Murphy of Lockport.\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a building’s power transformer, possibly seeking warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people died, officials have said, including one involved in a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a van slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New Hampshire: A hiker was found dead in Franconia on Christmas morning, said Lt. James Kneeland, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• South Carolina: Two men – including a 91-year-old who went outside on Christmas Day to fix a broken water pipe – died due to the storm in Anderson County, the coroner’s office there said. The other victim died on Christmas Eve after his home lost power.\n\n• Tennessee: The Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Vermont: One woman in Castleton died after a tree fell on her home, according to the police chief.\n\n• Wisconsin: The State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Nouran Salahieh Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Nouran Salahieh", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2022/09/14/gov-ron-desantis-sends-undocumented-immigrants-to-marthas-vineyard-unannounced/10383220002/", "title": "Martha's Vineyard: Migrants flown to Massachusetts by Ron DeSantis", "text": "Editor's note: This story has been updated to add new information and comments from public officials.\n\nMARTHA'S VINEYARD — St. Andrew's Warden Palmer Marrin stood sentry before the door to the church's side room on Thursday in Edgartown.\n\nThe 50 migrants — men, women and children as young as 3 — who had spent the night on church property after arriving unexpectedly late Wednesday afternoon on one-way charter flights, walked between the church and the parish house.\n\nCommunity organizations and residents had come on Thursday to help, as did students from an advanced placement Spanish class from the high school. The students came with their teacher, Justine DeOliviera, to help with translation.\n\nCommunity members who were helping the migrants, many if not all of whom are from Venezuela, asked that reporters not speak with the island visitors, citing a concern that the migrants would endanger their situation.\n\nAttempts by a Times reporter to greet the individuals directly in Spanish were received politely but did not lead to a conversation.\n\nMigrants in Massachusetts:Martha's Vineyard is asking for donations for migrants. Here's how you can help.\n\nDeOliviera politely declined to talk to a reporter, as did the students.\n\n\"We're just trying to give them shelter and keep them safe,\" Palmer said.\n\nAt 10 a.m. Thursday, officials were still trying to complete information about the migrants, such as where they came from, what airplane company delivered them unannounced on Wednesday, and what the next steps would be.\n\nMigrants likely headed from Martha's Vineyard to Joint Base Cape Cod\n\nState officials were exploring setting up a temporary shelter and humanitarian services at Joint Base Cape Cod on Thursday for the migrants who with no place to stay.\n\n“On behalf of the commonwealth, I thank everyone on the ground who quickly came together to provide assistance on the Vineyard,\" Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement.\n\nMassachusetts has many resources to assist individuals who arrive with varying immigration statuses and needs, Baker said. The state is working with all partners involved to make sure those resources are available to the migrants that arrived on Wednesday, he said.\n\nThe 22,000-acre military base straddles Bourne, Sandwich, Mashpee and Falmouth and is home to five military agencies.\n\nWhere did the planes come from that landed as Martha's Vineyard Airport\n\nBaker's announcement came a day after two planes from Ultimate Air Charters landed at Martha’s Vineyard Airport within a half hour of each other, Airport Director Geoffrey Freeman told the Times.\n\nThe 50 men, women and children are believed to be from Venezuela or nearby countries. A spokesperson for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Wednesday that the migrants were flown to Martha's Vineyard as part of the governor's \"promise to drop off undocumented migrants in progressive states.\"\n\nThe planes took off from Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas, then went to Bob Sikes Airport in Crestview, Florida, Freeman said. From there, one plane went to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and then to Martha’s Vineyard. The other plane went to Charlotte, North Carolina, and then to Martha's Vineyard.\n\nPrivate charters aren’t required to give manifests so Freeman said there was no reason for airport officials to process the flight.\n\nSpeaking in Northwest Florida on Thursday morning, DeSantis defended his decision to transport dozens of migrants to the island, saying the Biden administration’s border security policies were failing and that Florida is not a “sanctuary state.”\n\n“We take what's happening at the southern border very seriously, unlike some, and unlike the president of the United States who has refused to lift the finger to secure that border,” he said, noting the record number of people and drugs transiting across the 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAs part of a broader plan to keep immigrants attempting to enter the country illegally, DeSantis said he wanted to send a message that they were not welcomed in Florida.\n\nHelping hands offered in Edgartown on Thursday\n\nLisa Belcastro, the director of the homeless shelter on Martha's Vineyard, said the migrants arrived without warning.\n\n\"It was a complete surprise,\" she said. \"Community Services got the notice first and they called me. Everyone was in shock. … We had to create an emergency shelter.\"\n\nThey couldn't use the school because classes are in session, Belcastro said.\n\nPeople have been dropping by the church with offers to help including Bella Carillo, who brought Gracie, a yellow lab. She's not a therapy dog, Carillo said, but she thought the dog could help break through the language barriers.\n\nGracie did. Hands reached out without hesitation to pat her.\n\nState Rep. Dylan Fernandes, D-Woods Hole, talked to reporters in front of the parish house.\n\n\"These people need immigration services, immigration attorneys, and resources,\" Fernandes said. \"These people were sent here on a lie. They were told that people would be meeting them with jobs, housing, resources. We got no heads up. Gov. (Greg) Abbott (of Texas) and Ron DeSantis wanted to create as much chaos as possible.\"\n\nJames Joyce, a Vineyard resident, watched the situation unfolding. He was sympathetic to governors of states along the southern border. Those states have to shoulder a heavier burden of dealing with the influx of immigrants, he said.\n\nAnother Vineyard resident who didn't want his name used said the United States should help the countries where immigrants are coming from. The man was a retired physician who came by to check the medical status of the refugees, he said. The borders need to be secure, he said, but he thinks that federal laws may have been violated when DeSantis flew the migrants across state lines.\n\nThe number of Venezuelan refugees and migrants has surpassed 6 million globally, according to the UNHCR, a charity focused on refugees. For the past several years, Venezuelans have been leaving the country due to a lack of food, medicine, energy and due to violence, insecurity and threats, according to the organization.\n\n\"It's really sad,\" the retired physician said. \"We're so divided we're not willing to cooperate to solve any of these problems.\n\nBelcastro choked back tears when she heard what some the migrants have been through on their journey.\n\n\"They need a break,\" she said. \"They've been through rough stuff.\"\n\nImmigrants welcomed on Martha's Vineyard in past decade\n\nFernandes said the Cape and Islands have welcomed many immigrants in the 10 years since the last census. Nantucket is a minority-majority school district, he said. One-third of Martha's Vineyard students are nonwhite.\n\n\"We are incredibly welcoming to immigrants,\" he said, disputing claims he said were made that northern states weren't pulling their weight taking care of an influx of immigrants.\n\n\"I can tell you our population grew by 50% since the last census,\" Fernandes said. \"I don't think any state has grown by 50% on the southern border. In terms of actual land area density, it's probably a higher density here.\"\n\nVineyard taxi driver Peter Bradford called the arrival of the migrants an interesting situation. Bradford is on the Oak Bluffs Affordable Housing Committee and said the island is in the middle of a housing crisis. He said there were people living in cars, sheds, basements, tents, garages and on the streets.\n\n\"We need help out here,\" he said. \"If we had housing, maybe it would work out.\"\n\nA parking lot full of people\n\nA receptionist at Martha’s Vineyard Community Services looked up late Wednesday afternoon to find the group of 50 migrants standing in the center’s parking lot.\n\nThe migrants didn't speak English, but with the help of a Spanish translator from the nearby Martha's Vineyard Regional High School, community services staff learned the group was from Venezuela and had been put on a plane with nothing but a brochure from the island's service center.\n\nThey had walked the two miles or so from the airport to the center.\n\n\"We COVID-tested them all. Everyone was negative. A little girl had a temperature so we separated her with her family. A lot of them were shellshocked and afraid,\" said Janet Constantino, a therapist and nurse practitioner working at the center.\n\nA sanctuary state or not:Why is Florida Gov. Ron Desantis sending migrants to Martha's Vineyard?\n\nThe crowd wouldn't fit in the building so staffers gave them water and snacks in the parking lot while a plan was made.\n\nOct. 2021:Ted Cruz wants to send migrants from the Mexican border to Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket\n\nMartha's Vineyard residents step up to help the migrants\n\n\"This all started to transpire late (Wednesday) afternoon. They came unannounced,\" said The Rev. Vincent G. “Chip” Seadale, rector of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edgartown. \"Since we had several years ago spearheaded efforts to help the homeless on the island, we opened our doors.\"\n\nSeadale, who has been monitoring the situation by phone from a clergy conference in North Carolina, said his church was providing an immediate place for the migrants and reaching out to other churches Thursday.\n\n\"Overnight they can sleep on the pews or in the parish hall on the floor. We are in communication with the governor's office for possible help but these are people just like me and you and they need care and attention.\"\n\nMore than an island:What you need to know about Martha's Vineyard\n\nDukes County officials also announced it had opened emergency shelters across the island on Wednesday and asked for volunteers to help with what they described as “an unexpected ongoing urgent humanitarian situation.”\n\nAt about 7:15 p.m. Wednesday, Fernandes tweeted from the ferry: \"Currently migrants are being dropped off on Martha's Vineyard by chartered flights from Texas. Many don't know where they are. They say they were told they would be given housing and jobs. Islanders were given no notice but are coming together as a community to support them.\"\n\nCarla Cooper said volunteers ordered pizza, salad and soup to feed the people, aged 3 to adults in their 40s, \"who had had no food or water since 6 a.m.\"\n\n\"People were just showing up (at the church) with food, rice and beans,\" she said. \"When something happens to our island, we come together to help. We are going to take care of these people.\"\n\nCooper, head of the Democratic Council of Martha's Vineyard, said, \"It is disgusting and repulsive that these people were herded like cattle onto a plane, not told where they were going and our community was not notified. This is not a joke, this is insanely ridiculous.\"\n\nMartha's Vineyard and its residents will take care of the strangers, she said, who all spoke Spanish and were using translation apps on their phones to express their gratitude.\n\nMartha's Vineyard officials were not sure where the planes came from\n\nThe Martha's Vineyard Times reported that West Tisbury Town Administrator Jennifer Rand told selectmen, at their meeting late Wednesday afternoon, that only one plane had landed but more are expected. She and other officials were not sure where the plane or planes had originated.\n\nIn an interview with foxnews.com Wednesday evening, Taryn Fenske, DeSantis' communications director, said, \"Florida can confirm the two planes with illegal immigrants that arrived in Martha's Vineyard today were part of the state's relocation program to transport illegal immigrants to sanctuary destination.\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama owns a home on Martha's Vineyard along with people in the entertainment industry and corporate CEOs. The island is also a vacation spot for Democratic politicians.\n\nDeSantis’ immigration policies include a plan to use $12 million to pay for the transportation of undocumented immigrants dropped in Florida from the U.S.-Mexico border, the Tallahassee Democrat reported last month.\n\nThe Biden administration’s border security and immigration policies have become a favorite target for DeSantis and other Republicans nationwide, the paper reported. The debate ratcheted up earlier this year when two GOP governors — Greg Abbott of Texas and Doug Ducey of Arizona — called out Biden and sent busloads of migrants from their border states to New York City and Washington.\n\nBy late August, almost 8,000 migrants have arrived on state-sponsored bus trips, straining resources and humanitarian services of both cities, which have also sought assistance from the federal government.\n\n\"History does not look kindly on leaders who treat human beings like cargo, loading them up and sending them a thousand miles away without telling them their destination,\" U.S. Rep, Wiliam Keating said in a statement late Wednesday night. \"Still, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis made that choice today. ... Instead of trying to help them, he chose to charter a private jet and send them to a rural island community late in the day and without warning so they wouldn't have the resources at the ready to support them.\n\n\"But the people of Martha's Vineyard, its vibrant immigrant community, and the Commonwealth as a whole are already calling Governor DeSantis' bluff and rising to meet the challenge because that's what Americans do — we help those in need.\"\n\nFlorida Venezuelan-American community angry with DeSantis\n\nVenezuelan-American leaders in Florida denounced the “flights of asylum seekers” to Martha’s Vineyard, blasting DeSantis, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.\n\n“Venezuelan leaders are rightfully outraged,” said a joint statement of five Venezuelan-American groups on Wednesday night. They plan a news conference on Thursday.\n\n“Venezuelan leaders and other immigration advocates will come together to denounce this blatant disregard for human life and the lies that Governor Ron DeSantis has told to the Cuban and Venezuelan communities as recently as his September 7th press conference in Miami where he promised that neither Cubans or Venezuelans would be sent out of the state.”\n\nStaff writers Anne Brennan and Mary Ann Bragg contributed to this report.\n\nContact Gwenn Friss at gfriss@capecodonline.com.

Andy Beshear said Friday.\n\nAn unknown number of people were missing, Beshear said at a news conference Friday morning, as rescuers scrambled to reach areas difficult to access.\n\nThe official statewide death toll “could potentially double” as more information comes in from county officials, the governor told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer Friday night. Getting a reliable number of the people who are missing or were killed has been difficult due to the damaged infrastructure, he added.\n\n“There’s going to be multiple families that we’ve lost,” Beshear told CNN’s “New Day” earlier.\n\nDrone footage captures devastating flash flooding in Kentucky 02:06 - Source: CNN\n\n“This is so deadly, and it hit so hard, and it hit in the middle of the night,” the governor said, adding although eastern Kentucky often floods, “we’ve never seen something like this.”\n\nOfficials “may be updating a count with how many we lost for the next several weeks,” Beshear said Friday afternoon, after taking a helicopter tour of some devastated areas.\n\nThe deadly floods come less than eight months after a series of tornadoes ripped through Kentucky, killing at least 74 people. The city of Mayfield, in southwestern Kentucky, was among the hardest hit areas. Now, officials there are assisting in the flood response efforts in the eastern part of the state.\n\nFour young siblings were killed, aunt says\n\nThe deaths were reported in Knott, Perry, Letcher and Clay Counties.\n\nFourteen people, including four children, were confirmed dead Friday afternoon in Knott County, according to the county coroner. It was not immediately clear how it factors into the state’s overall death toll. The last official update of 16 deaths statewide included 11 deaths in Knott County.\n\nLive updates: Deadly flooding in eastern Kentucky\n\nThe governor did not provide an updated toll Friday afternoon, saying officials were still getting updates from local leaders. Reports of more deaths are coming in, Beshear said, but the deaths have to be verified by the department of health before they can be reported.\n\nAt least six children were confirmed dead after the bodies of four missing kids in Knott County had been found, the governor said.\n\nThe four children were siblings, their aunt, Brandi Smith, told CNN Friday.\n\nSmith is the sister of the children’s mother, Amber Smith, and identified the four children as Chance, 2; Nevaeh, 4; Riley Jr., 6; and Madison, 8.\n\nThe family’s mobile home became quickly flooded with water during the floods and forced the family to seek shelter on the roof, according to Smith, who learned of the deaths from the children’s mother.\n\n“They were holding on to them. The water got so strong it just washed them away,” Smith said, and said her sister and her partner tried to save their children.\n\nAn elderly man and woman died after being swept from their homes in the Oneida Community near Manchester, Kentucky, according to Clay County Coroner Jarrod Becknell.\n\nIt is not clear whether the two deaths are included in the statewide toll Beshear announced.\n\nHard to know how many people missing, governor says\n\nRescuers worked around the clock to reach areas where flooding washed away roads or left them underwater after heavy rain Wednesday night into Thursday.\n\n“Whole roads washed out – we still can’t get to a lot of people,” Beshear said earlier Friday.\n\nSwollen floodwaters washed out bridges, wiped out power and sent some residents scrambling to their rooftops as water gushed into their homes. Some families’ houses and cars were submerged or swept away completely by the flooding, which has been exacerbated by creeks and grounds already soaked from ongoing rainfall.\n\nHundreds of Kentuckians have lost everything they have, the governor said. Officials believe thousands have been affected, he said at the news conference.\n\nThere is no reliable number of people unaccounted for, Beshear said. Part of the problem is “communication is still very difficult,” with cell service out in many areas.\n\n“It’s going to be very challenging to get a good number” of missing, the governor said.\n\nMore than two dozen employees of Appalachian Regional Healthcare – the largest health service in eastern Kentucky – were still unaccounted for Friday afternoon, CEO Hollie Phillips told CNN.\n\nTeresa Reynolds sits exhausted as members of her community clean debris from flood-ravaged homes in Hindman, Kentucky, on Saturday, July 30.

But in the outlying areas, it’s devastating,” said Mobelini.\n\nSome houses standing for 50-75 years without water ever coming close to them are now flooded, he said.\n\nSeven of the city’s nine bridges are impassable, and “that’s unheard of,” the mayor said.\n\nThe town is bracing for news of more deaths, he said.\n\n“This is the first time I remember that there’s been a loss of life, and at this point we don’t know what that looks like,” Mobelini said.\n\nThe storm “totally annihilated” Perry County’s infrastructure, Sheriff Joe Engle told CNN. “Water, telephone, internet, electricity, all the basic roads, all the basic things you would build a community around have just disappeared,” he said.\n\n“There is a big swath of the county that’s totally isolated, the state highways are just totally gone,” the sheriff said.\n\nThe first confirmed death in the county was of his 82-year-old great aunt, Engle said.\n\nRecord water levels at a river\n\nBeshear warned the destruction was not over as rain continued Friday. The governor had planned to take an aerial tour of Hazard, but bad weather prevented it.\n\n“The water hasn’t crested in some areas, and won’t until tomorrow,” he said.\n\nAnd in the region of Jackson, Kentucky, downstream from the hardest-hit flood areas, “streams continue to rise due to excess runoff from earlier rainfall,” the National Weather Service office there said Friday.\n\nThe North Fork Kentucky River gauge, in Jackson, crested early Friday at 43.47 feet – setting a record. A river crest is the highest level a river reaches before water levels begin going down again.\n\nThe previous record crest, at 43.10 feet, was set on February 4, 1939.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Kentucky officials recommended people evacuate the homes and businesses in the flood plain of Panbowl Lake in Jackson, citing the Kentucky River’s rising water level and a “muddy discharge” seen near the lake’s dam.

National Guard troops from multiple states are assisting rescue efforts, he said.\n\nIn Floyd County, approximately 80 people were rescued after heavy rains began in the area Tuesday, county Judge-Executive Robbie Williams told CNN.\n\n“I’ve never seen this much water before,” Williams said. “We’ve got, you know, some small towns that are completely underwater.”\n\nWidespread water and power outages in the region were hindering recovery efforts, Beshear said Thursday. He noted the flooding was making it difficult for utility workers to access areas needed to restore power.\n\nA group of stranded people are rescued from the flood waters in Jackson, Kentucky.

In an effort to assist the state’s recovery efforts, both West Virginia and Tennessee sent helicopters with hoisting abilities to Kentucky.\n\nWest Virginia has also deployed National Guard troops to aid its neighboring state, Gov. Jim Justice announced.\n\nCommunities also jumped into action to help their neighbors, including residents in the town of Whitesburg.\n\n“We took kayaks, Jet Skis, boats, chain saws and hatchets to every place that we could,” resident Zach Caudill told CNN.

Pat McDonogh/Courier Journal/USA Today Network\n\nClimate crisis drives more intense flooding\n\nKentucky was one of several states, including Missouri and Arizona, experiencing severe flooding Thursday amid increasingly extreme weather events amplified by the climate crisis.\n\nIn St. Louis, record-breaking rainfall at the beginning of the week triggered dangerous flash floods persisting for days and leaving at least one person dead.\n\nAs global temperatures climb, the atmosphere is able to hold more and more water, making water vapor more abundantly available to fall as rain.\n\nRainfall over land has become more intense since the 1980s, according to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report’s authors say human influence is the main driver.\n\nHuman-caused fossil fuel emissions have warmed the planet a little more than 1 degree Celsius, on average, with more intense warming over land areas. Scientists are increasingly confident in the role the climate crisis plays in extreme weather, and have warned such events will become more intense and more dangerous with every fraction of a degree of warming.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Wolfe Theresa Waldrop", "Elizabeth Wolfe", "Theresa Waldrop"], "publish_date": "2022/07/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/30/asia/seoul-itaewon-halloween-crush-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Itaewon: What we know about the deadly Halloween disaster in ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nMost weekends, the narrow alleys of Itaewon, the neon-lit nightlife district in South Korea’s capital Seoul, are busy with partygoers and tourists.

Some even fly into Seoul from other countries in the region for the festivities.\n\nBut for the past two years, celebrations were muted by pandemic restrictions on crowd sizes and mask mandates.\n\nSaturday night marked the first Halloween since the country lifted these restrictions – lending it particular significance for many eager participants in Seoul, as well as international visitors including foreign residents and tourists.\n\nHotels and ticketed events in the neighborhood had been booked solid in advance, and large crowds were expected.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nWitnesses told CNN there was very little – if any – crowd control before the mass of people turned deadly.\n\nVideos and photos posted to social media show people crammed together, standing shoulder to shoulder in the narrow street.\n\nCNN reporter returns to Itaewon's narrow alley one day after the Halloween disaster. See what's it like 01:39 - Source: CNN\n\nCrowds are not unusual for that area, or for Seoul residents, who are used to jam-packed subways and streets in a city of almost 10 million.\n\nOne eyewitness said it took some time for people to realize something was wrong, with people’s panicked screams competing with music blaring from the surrounding clubs and bars.\n\nOnlookers, police and paramedics gather in the popular nightlife district of Itaewon in Seoul on October 30, 2022. Jung Yeon-Je/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter the first emergency calls came in around 10:24 p.m., authorities rushed to the scene – but the sheer volume of people made it difficult to reach those who needed help.\n\nVideo posted to social media showed people performing compressions on other partygoers lying on the ground as they waited for medical assistance.\n\nThe thousands of people in Halloween costumes contributed to the widespread sense of confusion and chaos. One witness described seeing a police officer shouting during the disaster – but some revelers mistook him for another partygoer.\n\nThe cause of the crush is still under investigation, though officials said there were no gas leaks or fires on site.\n\nWho were the victims?\n\nThe casualties were young, mostly in their teens and early 20s, authorities said. Known for its nightlife and trendy restaurants, Itaewon is popular among backpackers and international students.\n\nAmong the 154 dead were at least 26 foreign nationals, according to authorities, with victims from countries including the United States, China, Iran, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Japan, Australia, Norway, France, Russia, Austria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.\n\nAll but one of the victims have been identified, South Korea’s Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said in a briefing on Monday. The toll included 56 men and 97 women, South Korea’s Interior and Safety Ministry reported.\n\nSurvivors recount horror of Halloween disaster in Seoul 02:07 - Source: CNN\n\nSouth Korea’s Ministry of Education said Monday that six school students were among the dead, including one in middle school. Three teachers also died.\n\nAs of 5 p.m. local time Sunday (4 a.m. ET), the number of injured had risen to 133, of whom 37 were seriously injured, the ministry said.\n\nThe Seoul city government said more than 4,000 missing people reports had been received. That number could include multiple reports for the same person, or reports filed Saturday night for people who have since been found.\n\nPolice said there is no active search for those reported missing as they believe no one went missing from the scene; rather, they said the missing person reports have been used to help identify those who died.\n\nEmergency services treat injured people in Seoul on October 30. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nWhat was the official response?\n\nLee Sang-min, Minister of the Interior and Safety, said on Sunday that “a considerable number” of police and security forces had been sent to another part of Seoul on Saturday in response to expected protests there.\n\nMeanwhile in Itaewon, the crowd had not been unusually large, he said, so only a “normal” level of security forces had been deployed there.\n\nAs the disaster unfolded Saturday night, more than 1,700 emergency response forces were dispatched, including more than 500 firefighters, 1,100 police officials, and about 70 government workers.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol called an emergency meeting and urged officials to identify the dead as soon as possible.\n\nBut even hours later, families were still waiting to find out if their loved ones survived.\n\nRelatives of missing people weep at a community service center on October 30 in Seoul, South Korea. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, many people were transferred to nearby facilities, while bodies were taken to multiple hospital mortuaries. Families gathered at sites near the scene, where officials were compiling the names of the missing and deceased.\n\nYoon promised to implement new measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again, saying the government would “conduct emergency inspections not only for Halloween events but also for local festivals and thoroughly manage them so they are conducted in an orderly and safe manner.”\n\nThe government will also provide psychological treatment and a fund for families of the deceased and injured. Authorities have declared a national mourning period until November 5, and designated the district of Yongsan-gu, where Itaewon is located, a special disaster area.\n\nFlowers are seen at the scene of a deadly accident in Seoul, South Korea, Sunday, Oct. 30, 2022. Ahn Young-joon/AP\n\nQuestions being asked\n\nAs a stunned and grieving nation grapples with the tragedy, questions are also emerging about how such a disaster could have unfolded in a popular area where people are known to gather.\n\nIt’s hard to pinpoint what might have triggered the crush – but authorities “would have anticipated high numbers … before Saturday night,” said Juliette Kayyem, a disaster management expert and national security analyst for CNN.\n\n“There is a responsibility on the part of the authorities to be monitoring crowd volume in real time, so they can sense the need to get people out,” she added.\n\nSuah Cho, 23, was caught up in the crowd but managed to escape into a building along the alley. When asked whether she had seen any officials trying to limit the number of people entering the alley, she replied: “Before the incident, not at all.”\n\nAnother eyewitness described the situation getting “worse and worse,” saying they could hear “people asking for help for other people, because there were not enough rescuers that can just handle all that.”", "authors": ["Sophie Jeong Gawon Bae Paula Hancocks Hilary Whiteman Jessie Yeung", "Sophie Jeong", "Gawon Bae", "Paula Hancocks", "Hilary Whiteman", "Jessie Yeung"], "publish_date": "2022/10/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/business/southwest-airlines-service-meltdown/index.html", "title": "Flight cancellations: Why Southwest Airlines is melting down | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nA punishing winter storm that dumped multiple feet of snow across much of America led to widespread flight cancellations over the Christmas holiday. By Monday, air travel was more or less back to normal – unless you booked your holiday travel with Southwest Airlines.\n\nMore than 90% of Wednesday’s US flight cancellations were Southwest flights, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Southwest canceled more than 2,500 flights. The next highest: SkyWest, with 77.\n\nSouthwest warned that it would continue canceling flights until it could get its operations back on track. The company’s CEO said this has been the biggest disruption he’s seen in his career. The Biden administration is investigating.\n\nWhat gives? Southwest had a combination of bad luck and bad planning.\n\nThe storm hit Chicago and Denver hard, where Southwest has two of its biggest hubs – Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.\n\nMore bad luck: The storm hit just as the so-called tripledemic surged across America, leaving people and their families sick with Covid, the flu and RSV. Although Southwest says it was fully staffed for the holiday weekend, illness makes adjusting to increased system stress difficult. Many airlines still lack sufficient staff to recover when events like bad weather cause delays or flight crews max out the hours they’re allowed to work under federal safety regulations.\n\nUnderinvestment\n\nBut Southwest (LUV) also hurt itself with an aggressive schedule and by underinvesting in its operations.\n\nSouthwest’s schedule includes shorter flights with tighter turnaround times, which are causing some of the problems, Kathleen Bangs, a FlightAware spokesperson, told CNN.\n\n“Those turnaround times bog things down,” Bangs said.\n\nStranded customers have been unable to get through to Southwest’s customer service lines to rebook flights or find lost baggage.\n\nEmployees also said they have not been able to communicate with the airline, the president of the union that represents Southwest’s flight attendants told CNN Monday.\n\n“The phone system the company uses is just not working,” Lyn Montgomery, President of TWU Local 556, told CNN’s Pamela Brown. “They’re just not manned with enough manpower in order to give the scheduling changes to flight attendants, and that’s created a ripple effect that is creating chaos throughout the nation.”\n\nOn a call with employees Monday, Southwest Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson explained that the company’s outdated scheduling software quickly became the main culprit of the cancellations once the storm cleared, according to a transcript of the call that was obtained by CNN from an aviation source.\n\nThe extreme cold, ice and snow grounded planes and left some crew members stranded, so Southwest’s crew schedulers worked furiously to put a new schedule together, matching available crew with aircraft that were ready to fly. But the Federal Aviation Administration strictly regulates when flight crews can work, complicating Southwest’s scheduling efforts.\n\n“The process of matching up those crew members with the aircraft could not be handled by our technology,” Watterson said.\n\nSouthwest ended up with planes that were ready to take off with available crew, but the company’s scheduling software wasn’t able to match them quickly and accurately, Watterson added.\n\n“As a result, we had to ask our crew schedulers to do this manually, and it’s extraordinarily difficult,” he said. “That is a tedious, long process.”\n\nWatterson noted that manual scheduling left Southwest building an incredibly delicate house of cards that could quickly tumble when the company encountered a problem.\n\n“They would make great progress, and then some other disruption would happen, and it would unravel their work,” Watterson said. “So, we spent multiple days where we kind of got close to finishing the problem, and then it had to be reset.”\n\nIn reducing the company’s flights by two thirds, Southwest should have “more than ample crew resources to handle that amount of activity,” Watterson said.\n\nA lack of tools\n\nThe problems Southwest faces have been brewing for a long time, said Captain Casey Murray, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association.\n\n“We’ve been having these issues for the past 20 months,” he told CNN. “We’ve seen these sorts of meltdowns occur on a much more regular basis and it really just has to do with outdated processes and outdated IT.”\n\nHe said the airline’s operations haven’t changed much since the 1990s.\n\n“It’s phones, it’s computers, it’s processing power, it’s the programs used to connect us to airplanes – that’s where the problem lies, and it’s systemic throughout the whole airline,” he said.\n\nSouthwest CEO Bob Jordan, in a message to employees obtained by CNN, acknowledged many of Murray’s concerns, and promised the company will invest in better systems.\n\n“Part of what we’re suffering is a lack of tools,” Jordan told employees. “We’ve talked an awful lot about modernizing the operation, and the need to do that.”\n\nHe said the airline is “committed to and invested in” improving its systems, but “we need to be able to produce solutions faster.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday urged consumers to check if they’re eligible for compensation as cascading airline delays have disrupted holiday travel across the country.\n\n“Our Administration is working to ensure airlines are held accountable,” Biden tweeted.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation said it is investigating.\n\n“USDOT is concerned by Southwest’s unacceptable rate of cancellations and delays & reports of lack of prompt customer service,” the agency tweeted. “The Department will examine whether cancellations were controllable and if Southwest is complying with its customer service plan.”\n\nTo recover, Jordan told the Wall Street Journal the company plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in upcoming days to give itself the ability for crews to get into the right positions.\n\nNot Southwest’s first rodeo\n\nIf this is all ringing a bell, that’s because this isn’t the first time Southwest’s service melted down in epic fashion. In October 2021, Southwest canceled more than 2,000 flights over a four-day period, costing the airline $75 million.\n\nSouthwest blamed that service meltdown on a combination of bad weather in Florida, a brief problem with air traffic control in the area and a lack of available staff to adjust to those problems. It has admitted it was having service problems caused by short staffing even before the thousands of canceled flights stranded hundreds of thousands of passengers.\n\nSimilar to this month’s service mayhem, Southwest fared far worse than its competitors last October. While Southwest canceled hundreds of flights in the days following the peak of October’s disruption, competitors quickly returned to normal service.\n\nLater that month, on a call with Wall Street analysts, then-CEO Gary Kelly said the company had made adjustments to prevent a similar meltdown in the future.\n\n“We have reined in our capacity plans to adjust to the current staffing environment, and our ontime performance has improved, accordingly,” said Kelly on October 21. “We are aggressively hiring to a goal of approximately 5,000 new employees by the end of this year, and we are currently more than halfway toward that goal.”\n\nAnd, just like the latest disruption, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association claimed the cancellations were due to “management’s poor planning.”\n\n– CNN’s Ross Levitt contributed to this report", "authors": ["David Goldman"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/08/live-election-coverage-pa-governor-mastriano-shapiro-senate-dr-oz-fetterman/69626269007/", "title": "Live election coverage: Shapiro wins governor; Fetterman Senate ...", "text": "Staff reports\n\nThis is live coverage of Pennsylvania's 2022 general election.

He is a former state representative who cast himself as someone willing to take the fight to the status quo. Shapiro defended the state’s presidential election results in 2020 against an onslaught of legal challenges.\n\nMastriano, a state senator and retired Army colonel, marched on the U.S. Capitol in the Jan. 6 attack and was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, who visited the state to rally for him.

Sharif Street warms up the crowd at Shapiro event\n\nDemocratic Senator Sharif Street, of Philadelphia, drew a roar of applause as he took the podium at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks, where a crowd of more than 400 attendees had already gathered.\n\n“This is going to be a great night for Democrats,” he said. “We respect a woman's right to choose, and we are going to vote to make sure it happens. A woman's right to choose is between her and her doctor.”\n\nBefore leaving the stage, he offered his gratitude to voters and workers. “We want to thank you for coming together to reject the politics of hate.\n\n— Marion Callahan\n\n9:43 p.m. God praised for Mastriano's rejection of 'dictatorial mandates'\n\nDoug Mastriano took the stage around 9:15 at the rally to an uproar of applause from the roughly 300-plus attendees. Mastriano, his Lieutenant Governor candidate Carrie DelRosso and Mastriano’s wife Rebecca came out throwing campaign shirts into the crowd with a song emphasizing faith and God blaring on the speakers.\n\nCharles Stock Senior Pastors at Life Center Church in Harrisburg then came on stage and prayed over the rally. In his prayer he thanked God Mastriano “stood up against the unconstitutional overreach of dictatorial mandates” and asked for great victories.\n\n— Jack Panyard\n\n9:15 p.m. Fetterman's Pittsburgh-area supporters await his arrival\n\nSupporters of Democrat John Fetterman gathered at the Stage AE entertainment complex in Pittsburgh, where Fetterman is expected to speak later tonight. By 9 p.m., more than 100 people had arrived at the venue amid classic rock hits from a loud speaker and CNN election results blasted onto a giant screen above the stage.\n\nSupporters like Connor Scatte, of Slippery Rock, were hopeful their candidate would be victorious.\n\n\"I'm feeling pretty optimistic even if the race isn't called tonight,\" Scatte said. \"I just have a really good feeling.\"\n\n9:05 p.m. Mastriano and DelRosso now at Harrisburg-area watch party\n\n9:04 p.m. The waiting game begins for Oz supporters at Newtown Athletic Club in Bucks County\n\nThe auditorium of the Newtown Athletic Club filled quickly with supporters of Republican Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz after polls closed at 8 Tuesday night. The crowd of about 200 people buzzed around the floor of the Bucks County health club as two large monitors blared Fox News results as early results began to trickle in.\n\nEarly results put Democrat Lt. Gov. John Fetterman ahead of Oz by about 223,636 votes just before 9 p.m., but most of the 401,251 votes counted so far were mail-in ballots. Democrats tend to vote by mail in overwhelmingly greater margins than Republicans, and Oz so far had about 62% of the 40,455 Election Day votes tallied early Tuesday night.\n\nSuburban areas like Bucks and Montgomery counties will likely play a key role in the outcome of the race to replace Republican Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\n— Chris Ullery\n\n8:40 p.m. At Shapiro watch party, supporter confident of victory\n\nFrom inside the sprawling Greater Philadelphia Expo Center in Oaks, Pa., governor candidate Josh Shapiro’s supporters began to arrive, closely eying large screens televising CNN results coming in and posing for pictures beside the podium, where Shapiro is expected to speak later.\n\nRobert Reed, executive deputy attorney general for special initiatives at the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, stood confident early in the evening, though less than 4% were in for the governor’s race.\n\n“It’s finally here,” he said. “As much as I have great trepidation and nervousness about the night, I have great confidence that Josh Shapiro will win. He is a trillion … infinity times better than Mastriano, and I can say that in my private capacity as a voter, and I work with him.”\n\n-- Marion Callahan\n\n8:34 p.m. Mastriano supporters gather in Camp Hill\n\nAt the event for gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano in Camp Hill, 300-plus have arrived. Many are wearing party hats. There are photo booths and balloons, and classic hits such as Queen's \"Don't Stop Me Now\" and Rush's \"Tom Sawyer\" playing over the speakers.\n\nFox News is being shown on two projectors with election results. Crowd members are talking about high attendance at polls today, generally saying it's a reaction to how the past few years have been.\n\nMastriano is rumored to be making an appearance at approximately 9:30 p.m. \"American Idol\" contestant and Christian music singer Danny Gokey is supposed to perform as well. He was in attendance when Mastriano first announced.\n\n-- Jack Panyard\n\n8:03 p.m. No rest for county election officials on Veterans Day\n\nFriday is Veterans Day, a holiday for some. But it will not be a day off for county boards of elections as they must start the official canvass and compute returns, no later than 9 a.m. that day, according to a Pennsylvania Department of State spokesperson.\n\nThis multi-day process is when county election boards compile returns from precincts, adjudicate provisional ballots, count military and overseas civilian ballots and conduct post-election testing of equipment and a required 2% statistical sample, the spokesperson said in an email.\n\n-- Teresa Boeckel\n\nThe Keystone Party:It's Pa.'s newest political body.

In the past, that was never an issue. Now it's a big issue. And people are looking at how much it costs to either heat their home or to eat. They're looking at a winter and hoping that it's not real cold.\n\n\"I represent a district that's hard working. They're faith-based, they're hard working and they understand how life goes.

That's a real privilege.\"\n\n— Erie Times-News staff report\n\n7 p.m. All Voting is Local PA rips York County\n\nAn organization is calling out York County as it intends to conduct a limited accountability review of three randomly selected voting precincts in the Nov. 8 election. It is not known which precincts will be selected.\n\nOn Election Day, All Voting is Local Pennsylvania state director Nick Pressley issued a statement that said, in part, \"York County’s decision to hand count ballots on Thursday caves to conspiracy theorist rhetoric and has the potential to put countless votes in jeopardy.\n\n“Bad faith actors in York County are seeking to actively undermine voters by insisting on a hand count of ballots, which is less accurate and more time consuming than the electronic tabulation that is already in use. This is meant to sow distrust into our elections.”\n\n— Teresa Boeckel\n\n6 p.m. Common Cause of PA: 'a great Election Day in Pennsylvania'\n\n\"I would say overall we've had a great Election Day in Pennsylvania,\" said Khalif Ali, executive director of Common Cause of Pennsylvania, \"and we encourage voters to continue to come out and make their voices heard.\"\n\nThe polls are open until 8 p.m. Voters who have a mail ballot can hand deliver them until 8 p.m. as well.\n\nAs of 4 p.m. Tuesday, Common Cause of Pennsylvania had received more than 500 calls from voters asking how to make sure they have a say in the election. Most of the questions were about polling locations, voter registration confirmation and vote by mail, he said.\n\nThe organization received a few isolated reports of harassment and electioneering at some polling places, but nothing was coordinated, Ali said. Election officials were quick to address the situation.\n\nHe noted it was able to get a court order, forcing Northampton County to provide a replacement ballot to a disabled voter whose mail ballot was cancelled. The voter will be able to cast a ballot with the help of a designated agent.\n\nPolling hours in Luzerne County also have been extended to 10 p.m. because of a paper ballot shortage.\n\n— Teresa Boeckel\n\n4:15 p.m. Luzerne County polling places will be open until 10 p.m.\n\nAbout a fifth of Luzerne County's polling places are experiencing a shortage of paper for printing out ballots after someone has voted on a machine, Council member Tim McGinley said. In response to the issue, a judge on Tuesday ordered the county to keep its voting sites open until 10 p.m.\n\nMcGinley, who said he started hearing about the problem at about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, said he doesn't know why the shortage occurred and isn't sure if any voters had been unable to cast ballots as a result. He said polling places without paper have been instructed to let people cast provisional ballots.\n\nThough officials are working to restock the polling places, it will take \"awhile\" to reach some sites across the county, one of Pennsylvania's largest by land area, McGinley said. \"I am frustrated and disappointed,\" said McGinley, who wants to discuss the problem during a Wednesday night council work session. \"Because the goal is to have as many people get out and vote as possible.\"\n\n— Bethany Rodgers\n\n4 p.m. What to know about the election lawsuits filed so far\n\nAs ballots are cast and tallied across Pennsylvania, important election developments are also happening concurrently in state and federal courts.\n\nTwo cases have already affected today’s process. Philadelphia commissioners this morning acquiesced to a GOP lawsuit and agreed to reinstate a time-consuming double-check for double votes, which means the city’s results will take longer.\n\nAnd in Luzerne County, a judge extended polling place hours until 10 p.m. after a paper shortage dramatically slowed voting in three dozen precincts.\n\nOther lawsuits are still active.\n\nTwo different groups have filed suit in federal court, challenging a state Supreme Court ruling that held undated and misdated mail ballots should not be counted in this year’s election. One suit came Monday from U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman’s campaign, as well as the Democratic Congressional and Senate Campaign Committees and individual voters.\n\nAnother was filed last week by Pennsylvania’s NAACP, League of Women Voters, and other groups.\n\nBoth suits argue the state Supreme Court’s decision violated federal civil rights law — an argument that previously saw success in federal court before the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the decision on procedural grounds.\n\nThe U.S. District Court for Pennsylvania’s Western District is holding a joint conference on both cases Wednesday at 9:30 a.m.\n\nOther challenges have already been knocked down. In Monroe County, the county GOP committee sued late last week to bar election workers from curing flawed ballots — which the state Supreme Court has held that counties are allowed to do — saying that election workers were “tampering” with ballots.\n\nA Monroe County Common Pleas judge held Monday that he did not “find that there was fraud involved or that there was political partisanship undertaken by [county] staff,” and denied the injunction. So far, there has been no appeal.\n\n— Spotlight PA\n\n12:32 p.m. Philadelphia: Voters can still fix issues on mail-in ballots\n\nPhiladelphia voters who had missing or incorrect dates on their mail-in ballots were being allowed to file replacement ballots at City Hall or vote provisionally at their regular precincts Tuesday.\n\nHundreds of people whose names were published Friday by the Philadelphia City Commissioners, which is the city's election board, showed up at City Hall on Monday to correct errors with dates as well as other flagged issues, including missing security envelopes and missing signatures.\n\nIt’s unclear how many ballots have been flagged across the state; Philadelphia's lists contain more than 3,500 names, almost 2,400 of which were cited for missing or incorrect dates. The Philadelphia office stayed open until 7 p.m. Monday, but voters who had gotten in line to correct the issues after 3:45 p.m. were turned away, said Deputy Commissioner Nick Custodio. He said election workers were strongly encouraging those voters to return to City Hall on Tuesday to file a replacement ballot. They can also file a provisional ballot at their polling places, he said. But he said it was important for them to do it early.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nMore coverage:Meet Erik Gerhardt, the man who could be the difference in Pa.'s pivotal U.S. Senate race\n\n12:05 p.m. PA governors: Respect outcome of election\n\nPennsylvania’s four living former governors on Monday sent a letter to the main party candidates vying for the position on Nov. 8, urging them to respect and accept the results of the election regardless of the outcome.\n\nIn their one-page letter to Democrat Josh Shapiro and Republican Doug Mastriano, former Govs. Tom Ridge, Mark Schweiker, Ed Rendell, and Tom Corbett said the state’s election process will be “open and transparent,” and “overseen by thousands of Pennsylvanians who care deeply about fairness.”\n\n“We are asking you, as the leaders of the Pennsylvania Republican and Democratic parties, to pledge to honor that process, respect the law, abide the peoples’ will and support a peaceful transfer of power,” the four former governors wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to Spotlight PA from a spokesperson for Ridge. “In doing so, you will demonstrate to all Pennsylvania candidates who will be looking to you for leadership that love of Commonwealth and Country must come above all.”\n\n— Angela Couloumbis and Katie Meyer, Spotlight PA\n\n12 p.m. 2020 election brings out first-time poll watcher\n\nDave Whyno greeted voters outside the Bristol Township municipal building in Bucks County, a suburb of Philadelphia that political watchers say will be key to Election Day wins for state candidates. He’s a Republican and, at 52, a first time poll watcher. He pulled out his credentials that allow him to observe the Election Day vote count. Trump’s loss to Biden two years ago remains a bitter taste.\n\n“I decided to become a poll watcher because of it. I’m tired of all the (nonsense) from the other side, dragging out the vote count for days,” said Whyno, wearing a black baseball cap labeled “Let’s Go Brandon.”\n\n“After 2020, I don’t trust the system, so I decided to get involved. This lets me observe the count within 10 feet. I can see pretty good from ten feet. I won’t need my theater glasses for that.”\n\n— JD Mullane\n\nMore:Poll watchers are a part of every Erie County election. Here's why they do it\n\n11:46 a.m. 'Pocono Patriot' truck causes a stir at polling place\n\nAt the Pocono Summit Volunteer Fire Dept. polling place, numerous voters complained about a truck flying \"intimidating flags.\" A campaign volunteer pointed out the driver to reporters as a deputy constable named \"Larry,\" noting that his role at the polls that morning was to \"keep the peace.\"\n\nWhen asked if he was \"Larry,\" the man behind the wheel of \"America's Flag Truck\" said: \"On my life!\"\n\nLawrence \"Larry\" LoSchiavo Jr. has been Deputy Constable for elections in Pocono Summit for five years, and where the truck goes, he goes.\n\n\"I just make sure everything goes 'according to Hoyle'.\" At that moment Larry was interrupted by a poll worker to discuss the presence of his truck.\n\nAfter the brief discussion, Larry explained his role as Deputy Constable, which entailed monitoring the line and keeping people from getting \"violent.\"\n\n— Ashley Fontones\n\n10:45 a.m. The PA mail ballot count continues\n\nAcross Pennsylvania, more than 1.4 million people requested to vote by mail. As of Nov. 7, 1.16 million absentee and mail ballots had been returned, according to Department of State data.\n\nBefore Election Day, some of the state’s largest counties said it would likely take until Wednesday to finish counting absentee and mail ballots.\n\nElections director Christa Miller said roughly 25% of those ballots had been opened. As of 10 a.m., approximately 300 voters had dropped off mail ballots Tuesday at the election office as they may do until 8 p.m.\n\nPer an order from the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the county is not counting but is setting aside undated and incorrectly dated ballots. Miller did not have an estimate of how many of those ballots the county had received.\n\n— Carter Walker, Votebeat / Spotlight PA and Sarah Anne Hughes, Spotlight PA\n\n11:25 a.m. Women's rights a top issue for Erie voter\n\nIn Erie, Angela Leggett said she came out early to vote for women's rights.\n\n\"I voted today because there's a lot counting on today's vote,\" said Leggett, 48, who voted at Harding School on Erie's west side. \"Especially being a woman. I voted women's rights, for one thing. They say that today makes a difference. So that's why I'm out, and I came early.\"\n\n— Erie Times-News staff report\n\n10:50 a.m. Watchdog group: We're not seeing systemic problems at PA polls\n\nPennsylvania has not experienced any reports of systemic problems with voting machines or polls in the first few hours of voting Tuesday, according to the government watchdog group, Common Cause.\n\nIn an Election Day update at 10 a.m., the first of three planned Tuesday, the group’s Pennsylvania Executive Director Khalif Ali reported the organization has received a few calls about late openings at polling places in the eastern part of the state, and a few reports of inoperable machines in a few polling places.\n\nSo far, though, all the issues reported were easily resolved, including three incidents in Allegheny County where individuals were too close to polling places and poll workers had to tell them to move within the 10-foot threshold.\n\nAli said he has not yet heard how many mail-in and absentee ballots in Pennsylvania had been rejected because of missing dates or signatures, which required the voter to either fix the mistakes or cast a provisional ballot in-person.\n\nCommon Cause Vice President for Campaigns Jesse Littlewood also reported volunteers monitoring social media platforms were seeing typical early election day misinformation and disinformation being amplified.\n\n“The level of disinformation is concerning, but it's not at a higher level than in 2020,” Littlewood added.\n\nAmong the more popular narratives circulating on Twitter and Facebook surrounded posts involving reports of voting machine problems that were framed to “intentionally undermine people’s faith” in the elections, Littlewood said.\n\nAnother common narrative bubbling up around an existing conspiracy theory from the 2020 election is that all results are counted and confirmed on election night, or the election is fraudulent.\n\n— Jo Ciavaglia\n\nFact check roundup:False claims about election fraud, candidates swirl ahead of 2022 midterms\n\n10:25 a.m. Challenger to Rep.

Mike Kelly, of Butler, R-16th Dist.\n\nPastore, 63, voted with his wife Melissa Pastore just after 8 a.m. at the Weis Library United Methodist Church on the eastern edge of Fairview Township, Erie County.\n\nOutside, afterward, Dan Pastore was confident. \"I think our chances are really good,\" he said. \"We talked to the voters up and down the district. We're getting support not only from Democrats but moderate Republicans and independents who really are looking for a change. Less divisiveness and more positive attitude. They want someone who will work in a bipartisan way to focus on the issues that are important to the people of western Pennsylvania.\"\n\n— Erie Times-News staff report\n\n9:12 a.m. Bucks County allowing voters to 'cure' ballots\n\nBucks County is allowing absentee or mail-in ballot voters to “cure” or fix mistakes, such as a missing date or signature, on their ballot or advising people to vote by provisional ballot. If the county Board of Election finds problems with a mail-in ballot, it will not directly notify voters of the problem, county spokesman James O'Malley said.\n\nInstead, the ballot will be entered as canceled in the state’s tracking website for mail-in ballots. The state system will notify a voter by email about the cancellation, but only if it has an email address on file.\n\nOtherwise, the only option is to cast a provisional ballot at their polling place.\n\nNot all Pennsylvania counties are allowing mail-in voters to fix ballot mistakes. York County election officials are not allowing curing, meaning the only option for those voters is to cast a provisional ballot.\n\nBucks County sent out 98,506 mail-in and absentee ballots for the 2022 midterms, roughly half the number it sent out for the 2020 presidential race during the COVID-19 pandemic, O’Malley said.\n\nAs of last night, 82,789 of those ballots, roughly 82% had been returned, slightly lower than the 85% return rate as of 2020 election eve, O’Malley said.\n\nThe mail-in and absentee ballot requests heavily favored registered Democrats with 63,562 compared to 22,847 ballots requested by registered Republicans.\n\nThe breakdown of the political affiliations of others requesting mail-in or absentee ballots was: “No Affiliation” (8,565), “No Party” (1,752), Independents (997) and the remaining 783 ballots for voters registered in other parties including “Pizza Party” and “Trump Party,” which each had one ballot request.\n\n— Jo Ciavaglia\n\n8:30 a.m. Oz talks after voting in Montgomery County\n\nAfter voting in Montgomery County, Dr. Mehmet Oz told reporters he’s proud of the campaign he’s run and that “Pennsylvania is going to send a message to Washington.”\n\nThat message is one of balance, not extremism, he said.\n\nAfter his brief remarks, Oz did not answer questions about whether he would accept election results “no matter what” or offer a reaction to his opponent’s recent federal lawsuit to have mail-in ballots counted regardless of date discrepancies.\n\n— Candy Woodall\n\n8 a.m. York County Democrats blast county's mail ballot plans\n\nYork County elections officials said they will not “cure” mail ballots that were not properly signed and dated. Instead, the county will designate those ballots as “canceled” on Election Day, a status that will be visible to voters if they check their ballot on the state’s tracking website. Someone who sees their ballot is canceled can then head to a polling place and vote provisionally, said President Commissioner Julie Wheeler.\n\nWheeler said York County has been separating out undated ballots all along, so they won't have to go back through in response to a court order.\n\nThat drew fire from York County Democratic Chair Chad Baker, who urged the immediate release of data pertaining to rejected mail ballots by the county.\n\nBaker called that a partisan decision by the Republican majority board of commissioners. “The commissioners have decided to not input rejected ballots into the state system starting at 7 a.m. on Election Day,” said Baker in a news release. “This means that those voting by mail, predominantly Democratic voters, will not be contacted until Election Day that their ballots have been rejected, and that is only true if their email address is on file with the county. If there is no email address, the voter will not be contacted.”\n\nBaker said the only alternative for voting at that point would be to go to the polls and vote with a provisional ballot.\n\n“Given that many voters vote by mail due to work conflicts, health issues, etc., these voters will most likely have their votes suppressed and will be denied their right to vote,” said Baker. “This data must be entered immediately so that voters in York County have an opportunity to cast their votes and be assured they will be counted.”\n\n— Staff\n\n6:48 a.m. Pennsylvanians scurry to fix mail-in ballots after ruling\n\nSome of Pennsylvania’s largest counties scrambled Monday to help voters fix mail-in ballots that have fatal flaws such as incorrect dates or missing signatures on the envelopes used to send them in, bringing about confusion and legal challenges in the battleground state on the eve of the election.\n\nElections officials in Philadelphia and Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, announced measures they were taking in response to state Supreme Court rulings in recent days that said mail-in ballots may not be counted if they lack accurate handwritten dates on the exterior envelopes.\n\nAhead of Tuesday’s midterms, more than a million mail-in and absentee ballots have already been returned in Pennsylvania, with Democrats far more likely than Republicans to vote by mail. The numbers are large enough that they might matter in a close race, such as the contest between Democrat John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz that could determine majority control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe Department of State said it was unclear just how many ballots are at issue across the state. The agency over the weekend asked counties to provide the numbers, broken down by political party. Officials said some counties were not letting voters fix their mistakes.\n\nLines formed at City Hall in downtown Philadelphia on Monday and over the weekend with voters waiting to correct their ballots. Some people on social media said the office did not get to everyone Monday.\n\nThe Pennsylvania litigation was filed by Republican groups and is among legal efforts by both political parties in multiple states to have courts sort out disputes over voting rules and procedures ahead of the midterm election.\n\nA new federal lawsuit over the envelope dates was filed Monday in Pittsburgh federal court by the national congressional and senatorial Democratic campaign organizations, two Democratic voters and Fetterman’s U.S. Senate campaign. They sued county boards of election across the state, arguing that throwing out ballots that lack proper envelope dates would violate a provision in the 1964 U.S. Civil Rights Act that says people can’t be kept from voting based on what the lawsuit calls “needless technical requirements.”\n\nA separate federal lawsuit filed Friday makes a similar argument.\n\n— Associated Press\n\nPA heads to the polls to decide Senate, governor races\n\nIt's Election Day in Pennsylvania, and the nation is closely watching the commonwealth as it could decide the balance of power in Washington.\n\nThe U.S. Senate race between Democratic Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Republican Mehmet Oz may decide whether Democrats maintain their slim majority or the upper chamber flips to Republicans, all but grinding President Joe Biden's agenda to a halt if the House of Representatives turns back to the GOP as expected.\n\nFetterman's lead over Oz has narrowed in recent weeks and the race is now considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report and other analysts.\n\nThe governor's race is also being closely watched. Attorney General Josh Shapiro is hoping to succeed Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf in a contest against Republican state Sen. Doug Mastriano.\n\nPennsylvania can expect changes no matter who wins. Both candidates have said they would move the commonwealth in a different direction from Wolf, though in different ways.\n\nMastriano, a Trump loyalist who attended the Jan. 6, 2021 rally at the U.S. Capitol before it devolved into a riot, has signed onto dozens of bills vetoed by Wolf since joining the General Assembly in 2020. His governorship would likely give the green light to many or all of these measures, which include restrictions on trans athletes in sports, more lenient gun laws and the expansion of poll watching.\n\nShapiro has broken with Wolf in expressing support in concept for the kind of Lifeline Scholarship Program advanced by Republican lawmakers. This program would give tax dollars to families in low-performing districts to help their children attend private schools.\n\nShapiro is also calling for a $250-per-vehicle gas tax rebate for car owners and more aggressive tax cuts, including an accelerated plan to reduce corporate net income tax and the elimination of \"nuisance\" fees such as the commonwealth's cellphone tax.\n\nBut don't expect election results Tuesday night — or, possibly, for several days. That's largely because of the new mail-in ballot law prohibiting officials from counting them before Election Day, making it a challenge for those officials while also sowing confusion among the public.\n\nPennsylvania's importance this cycle was illustrated over the weekend as Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump visited to make closing arguments for their preferred candidates.\n\n— Staff\n\nElection 2022:Don't count on PA election results on Nov. 8, secretary of state says. Here's why.\n\nWhat you need to know about voting today\n\nPennsylvania's general election is being held today. Voters will be choosing candidates for top seats in the state, including U.S. Senate, U.S. House, governor and lieutenant governor, as well as the state General Assembly.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\nPolls: They will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. statewide. Many counties also offer drop boxes where voters can take their completed mail-in ballots. You can also return your mail ballots to the elections office in your county. Check your county website for locations and times.\n\nWhere do you vote? The state has a website that helps voters find their polling place. Begin by typing the county of residence and city in the dropdown menus. Then enter the street name, the house number and ZIP code.\n\n— Staff\n\nHow to check on results\n\nTo see the unofficial results on election night, go to: www.electionreturns.pa.gov\n\nWhat if I didn't get my mail ballot?\n\nIndividuals who didn't receive their mail ballot, lost it or now want to vote in person can head to the polls.\n\nIf voters have their mail ballot packet, they need to take it with them to have it voided. They also will have to sign a declaration.\n\nThose without a mail ballot packet will have to vote with a provisional ballot.\n\nElection officials will be checking to see if the mail ballot was returned. If the mail ballot is confirmed, that is the one that will count.\n\n— Teresa Boeckel\n\nHow to return your mail ballot\n\nVoters who have not returned their no-excuse mail ballot or absentee ballot should drop it off in person at this point. It is too late to drop it in the mail because the local elections office must receive it by no later than 8 p.m. on Election Day. Postmarks do not count. Voters must return their own ballot.\n\nTo see if your ballot was received, visit www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/ballottracking.aspx\n\n— Teresa Boeckel\n\nHow to make sure your ballot counts\n\nThe state Supreme Court recently ordered that mail-in and absentee ballots that arrive without a date or are incorrectly dated should not be counted. Mail ballot envelopes must be dated between Sept. 19 and Nov. 8, and absentee ones must be dated between Aug. 30 and Nov. 8.\n\nTo make sure your vote counts, follow the instructions provided. After filling out the ballot, place it in the secrecy envelope marked \"Official Election Ballot\" and seal it. Do not make any marks on the envelope.\n\nThe secrecy envelope then goes inside the pre-addressed outer return envelope. The voters declaration on the back must be signed and dated. Seal this envelope, too.\n\nVoters who already returned a mail ballot and are concerned that it might be cancelled because of an error should contact their local elections office or the state's voter hotline at 1-877-VOTESPA, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State.\n\n\"If you learn that your mail ballot did contain a technical error and the county will not allow you to fix it, then you should go to your polling place on Election Day and ask for a provisional ballot,\" Acting Secretary of State Leigh Chapman said Monday during a news conference.\n\nVoters also can track their ballot to see if it has been accepted or rejected. Go to www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/ballottracking.aspx\n\nIf it has been rejected, voters can head to the polls and cast a provisional ballot.\n\n— Teresa Boeckel\n\nKnow your voting rights\n\nCan I drop off a completed mail-in ballot at my polling place? No.\n\nCan I take a selfie in the voting booth? Pennsylvania allows people to take selfies in the voting booth, and photos both inside and outside your polling place, but the state strongly discourages photos of other people voting, according to the Pennsylvania Secretary of State. It is also recommended that you wait until you've left a polling place before posting photos on social media.\n\nDo I need to show ID at my polling place? Only if you are voting for the first time at a new polling place. Otherwise, voters are not required to show identification. There have been efforts by state Republicans to require Pennsylvania voters to show ID every time they vote, but no changes have been made to the state's election law.\n\nWhat do I do if someone tries to challenge my right to vote? The only people allowed to challenge a voter's qualifications to vote are poll workers and poll watchers, who must direct any good-faith challenges to an elector's \"identity, continued residence in the election district, or qualifications as an eligible voter\" to the judge of elections only, not the voter. The decision ultimately rests with the judge of elections. But, in most cases, a voter would be provided a provisional ballot and permitted to vote. Election workers would later determine if the voter is indeed registered to vote and, depending on their decision, either include or exclude the ballot in the official count. Poll workers include inspectors, clerks and election judges. Poll watchers are people appointed by a candidate or political party to observe the voting process. Poll watchers cannot, however, engage or intimidate a voter, especially in an effort to influence how they vote. Poll watchers are not permitted near the space where a voter casts their ballot. If you are the victim of or witness any type of voter intimidation, report it immediately to the Board of Elections or the district attorney.\n\nWhat is considered voter intimidation or discriminatory conduct? The Secretary of State's Office lists the following:\n\nAggressive or threatening behavior inside or outside the polling place.\n\nBlocking or interfering with access to the entrance or exit to the polling place; accessible accommodations for voters with disabilities; voter sign-in tables or voting booths/voting machines.\n\nDirect confrontation or questioning of voters, including asking voters for documentation or proof of eligibility, when none is required.\n\nDisrupting voting lines inside or outside of the polling place.\n\nDisseminating false or misleading election information, including information on voting eligibility, polling place procedures, polling place hours or voting methods.\n\nElection workers treating a voter differently in any way based on race, ethnicity, national origin, language, disability or religion.\n\nAggressive or threatening brandishing of weapons.\n\nPhotographing or videotaping voters to intimidate them.\n\nPosting signs in the polling place to intimidate voters or drive support for a candidate.\n\nRoutine and frivolous challenges to voter's eligibility by election workers or private citizens that are made without a stated good-faith basis.\n\nQuestioning voters about citizenship, criminal record or political choices.\n\nUsing raised voices, screaming, yelling or shouting; use of insulting, offensive or threatening language; chanting taunts, or threatening songs inside the polling place.\n\nVandalism of polling places or polling place equipment/materials.\n\nVerbal or physical confrontation of voters by persons dressed in official-looking uniforms.\n\nFalsely representing oneself as an election official or law enforcement authority.\n\nViolence or using the threat of violence to interfere with a person's right to vote.\n\nInterfering with or violating a voter's right to a secret ballot at any point in the process.\n\n— Matt Rink\n\nCheck out this USA Today Network 2022 campaign coverage:\n\nA crucial race:Why the Pa. gov race means the difference between life & death to some\n\nA third term for Wolf?

No period in the sporting calendar brings with it such a dramatic clash of emotions as the end of the football season. And where despair is concerned, few clubs could have felt it as abjectly this weekend as Leicester City, said James Gheerbrant in The Times. Seven years ago, the “feisty Midlands club wrote the great fairy tale of the Premier League era”, when they won it after starting the season as 5,000/1 outsiders. And in their 2-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday, they “showed the quality of a side who should have stayed up, comfortably”. But “this season has been a mess” of bad management and poor recruitment. And so it was that their victory over West Ham was not enough. Everton’s 1-0 win over Bournemouth meant that they survived at the expense of the Foxes, who, along with Southampton and Leeds, have now been relegated to the Championship.\n\nBut Leicester’s misery was Luton Town’s joy. After 31 years out of the top flight, the club joined Burnley and Sheffield United in being promoted to the Premiership, after beating Coventry in the Championship play-off final at Wembley on Saturday. The match got off to a terrible start for Luton, said Matt Barlow in The Mail on Sunday: shortly after kick-off, captain Tom Lockyer collapsed on the pitch and was rushed to hospital. It was 1-1 at full time so it went down to a penalty shoot-out, only settled – after 11 consecutive successful spot-kicks – when Coventry’s Fankaty Dabo skied his effort into the stands.\n\nTo get an idea of the extraordinary feat achieved by Luton, consider the career of Pelly Ruddock Mpanzu, said Tom Allnutt in The Times. When he joined the club in 2013, it was languishing in the fifth-tier Conference (now National) League, losing to the likes of Braintree and Halifax Town. Back then, the team trained on a public field – sessions regularly interrupted by dog walkers. Mpanzu’s first-team debut, away to Staines Town, was witnessed by just 621 people.

Leeds’ miserable campaign ended in a 4-1 loss at home against Tottenham.\n\nLeicester’s demise stands out because of the dramatic nature of its fall after experiencing the most spectacular period in its history in recent years.\n\nBy winning the title as a 5,000-1 shot in 2016, it provided the Premier League with its greatest fairy tale - being crowned champion in only its second season after being promoted from the second tier.\n\nLUTON TOWN: Club with tiny, neighborhood stadium earns Premier League promotion\n\nNEVER MISS A MOMENT:Follow our sports newsletter for daily updates\n\nJust two years ago it was celebrating victory against Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium, a period that also saw it achieve back-to-back fifth-place finishes.\n\nRelegation was not seen as a realistic threat this season — even after a summer in which Leicester failed to make major moves in the transfer market.\n\nIn the Premier League, however, fairy tales do not guarantee happily-ever-after endings and Leicester now faces an uncertain future with interim manager Dean Smith out of contract and a host of its star players likely to leave in the summer.\n\n“The Premier League is where everybody wants to be playing,” Smith said afterward. “It feels raw now, it hurts and everybody will be devastated. But with the infrastructure it’s got it will bounce back.”\n\nWhile those words were encouraging, there is no guarantee that Leicester will be back in the top flight any time soon.\n\nTop players like James Maddison, Youri Tielemans and Harvey Barnes could all depart and will have suitors from leading clubs.\n\nSmith could offer no guarantees about his own future, saying his interim deal was now over after completing the final eight games of the season.\n\n“There have been plenty (of clubs) over time where you’ve had knocks and your job is to bounce back and make sure you improve on the things that have let you down and I’ve no doubts the club will.”\n\nRelegation closes a chapter on a remarkable period in Leicester’s history and it remains to be seen how the club’s chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, reacts to the disappointment.\n\nIn March the club announced a pre-tax loss of 92.5 million pounds ($114 million) for the previous financial year.\n\nIt is likely to have to spend again to rebuild from here.\n\nEverton survives relegation battle\n\nWhile it was a day of anguish for Leicester, Everton was celebrating once again as the league’s great survivor.\n\nHaving been in the top division since 1954, it pulled off another great escape, having avoided relegation on the final day of the season in both 1994 and 1998 previously.\n\nThe Merseyside club, which only narrowly avoided the drop last year, took it to the wire yet again this season.\n\nAbdoulaye Doucouré smashed home a 57th-minute goal to earn the win that sparked jubilant scenes at Goodison.\n\nEverton’s fate was always in its own hands, starting the day in 17th place, two points above Leicester and Leeds.\n\nIt is a triumph for manager Sean Dyche, who was hired in January and tasked with the job of turning the club’s season around.\n\n“I’ve just told the players we can’t be in this state,” he said. “A magic day but at the end of the day we shouldn’t be in this shape.\n\n“You are only a big club if you are doing big things.

For Erik ten Hag, it has been a strong first season at Manchester United.\n\nUnited rallied to beat Fulham 2-1 thanks to goals from Jadon Sancho and Bruno Fernandes to move above Newcastle into third place on the last day.

Emery has won the Europa League with Sevilla and Villarreal.\n\nVilla’s win meant Tottenham finished in eighth place and out of the European positions.\n\nErling Haaland wins Golden Boot\n\nManchester City striker Erling Haaland finished his first season in English soccer with the Golden Boot award as the Premier League’s top scorer.\n\nHe didn’t get to add to his 36 league goals this season, though, with the Norway international not getting off the bench in City’s 1-0 loss at Brentford, which completed the home-and-away double over the champions.\n\nHarry Kane was second in the scoring charts on 30 goals.\n\nPremier League farewells\n\nRoberto Firmino finished his eight-year Liverpool career with two goals in a wild 4-4 draw with Southampton. A slew of other scorers on Sunday might yet have played their last games for the clubs, too.\n\nLike Granit Xhaka, who scored two of second-place Arsenal’s goals in its 5-0 thrashing of Wolverhampton. Xhaka has been linked with a move back to Germany.\n\nKane refused to comment on his future at Tottenham after scoring two of the team’s goals against Leeds.\n\n“I have focused on this season and helping the team as much as possible,” Kane said. “I am just looking forward to a nice break and some games with England.”\n\nJames Ward-Prowse led Southampton’s fightback from 2-0 down against Liverpool in what is likely his final game for a club where he came through the academy.\n\nAs for farewells among managers, Frank Lampard signed off his interim spell in charge of Chelsea with the draw against Newcastle ahead of the team’s likely appointment of Mauricio Pochettino.

The typical family’s annual grocery bill is £837 higher than it was a year ago, said market research firm Kantar, with the prices of staples such as eggs, milk and cheese rising the fastest.\n\nReports abound of “increasing desperation among customers stealing to feed their children – claims promoted by opposition politicians, but strongly contested by many retailers”, said The Guardian.\n\nA separate national report found that one in 10 young adults has admitted to stealing items from supermarket self-checkouts , reported the Evening Standard .\n\nMeanwhile, the BBC reported last month that Calpol, the pain relief medicine for children, was the most shoplifted item in an east London borough. “Desperation has led to an increase in theft,” said the report from Tower Hamlets, adding that instances of baby products being stolen are “utterly devastating”.\n\nThe rise was tracked soon after the cost-of-living crisis began. Shoplifting levels, particularly of everyday items, were “off the charts”, reported The Grocer last May. Store managers told the magazine of “higher crime rates as they’re noticing ‘new first-time shoplifters’ as opposed to ‘the usual suspects only’”.\n\nIn March, police forces in England, Wales and Northern Ireland recorded nearly 33,000 incidents of shoplifting, according to data analysed by the BBC . That represents a 30.9% increase year on year.\n\nYes. The most recent statistics for England and Wales from the Office for National Statistics show that shoplifting rose by 22% in the year to September. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) estimated that there were 8 million “theft incidents” in British shops last year, costing £953 million. The BRC said shop theft is a “long-term rising trend”, The Guardian reported, with incidents more than doubling since 2016-17.\n\nBut what impact does the crime have and what happens if you get caught?\n\nThe cost-of-living crisis is being blamed for the increase in shoplifting and stores report that many people are stealing products for the first time in their lives as their financial circumstances lead them to take desperate measures.\n\nSupermarkets are responding to a rise in shoplifting by putting empty coffee jars on the shelves, limiting the number of steaks on view and adding security tags to everyday items such as milk.\n\nTherefore, “people are shoplifting their way out of the cost of living crisis,” said Novara Media. “Given the dire economic climate, it’s no wonder shoplifting is on the rise,” argued Sophie K. Rosa.\n\n“It’s always been the case that some people shoplift because they have to and others because they want to,” said Refinery29. But “there’s now a widening group in the middle who are shoplifting to save money for essentials or bills, or as one of many ways to stick two fingers up to what they see as a broken Britain”.\n\nThese demographic shifts may not be entirely new. As far back as 2012, the BBC reported that a “new wave of middle-class shoplifter [was] targeting high-end delicacies from supermarkets in order to maintain a lifestyle they could no longer afford”. They “appear to be reputable and often justify their actions by arguing that they have become victims to the economic recession”, it said.\n\nWhat steps are stores taking?\n\nTighter security measures are becoming more commonplace in supermarket aisles.\n\nA Co-op store in London has put empty “display only” coffee jars on shelves in an apparent bid to deter shoplifters, said Metro. The Walthamstow branch made the move after the price of 200g of Kenco Smooth instant coffee went up to £10.50, while a similar size jar of Nescafé Gold Blend was removed after being put on sale for £9.35.\n\nA Co-op spokesperson told the BBC that these are not nationwide policies at their stores.\n\nThey added: “Protecting the safety of our colleagues is a priority and we know shoplifting can be a flashpoint for violence against shop workers so whilst this is not a nationwide policy, a decision to implement product security measures at a local level can be made, if a store is experiencing a particular issue.”\n\nMarks & Spencer has “resorted” to placing just one steak in some of its fridges to “try to curb shoplifting”, said The Telegraph. The retailer told the paper that “in certain stores where there have been high incidences of theft, we will sometimes limit the number of higher value items that are on display”.\n\nSupermarkets have attached security tags to everyday items including cheese, butter and baby formula, reported Metro last summer. Shoppers were “stunned” to see milk containers “treated like expensive alcohol bottles”, it noted in a separate report.\n\nTracey Clements, the head of BP convenience stores, told The Independent that the chain’s outlets have been forced to employ more security staff, and workers are using extra body cameras to catch shoplifters.\n\nWhat is the impact of shoplifting?\n\nA 2022 study by the Centre for Retail Research found that shoplifting cost the British economy £660 million in 2021-22. Some individual UK stores are losing as much as £50,000 in stock a week, said Refinery29, while the Daily Express said that the trend is costing retail companies “around £1billion in losses”.\n\nBut shoplifting offences recorded by UK police “have remained more or less static over the past decade, at about 300,000 each year”, said The Guardian, noting that the “gulf between those numbers and the 8 million incidents logged by retailers suggests not even 4% of shoplifting crimes are reported to the police”.\n\nProsecutions are also dropping quickly. According to government figures, in the year to June 2022, 21,279 people were prosecuted in England and Wales for shoplifting, down from 80,352 a decade earlier.\n\nIf caught shoplifting, you may be offered a police caution as an alternative to prosecution but this still counts as a criminal conviction, said the Sentencing Council.\n\nIf you are convicted in court of shoplifting, you can be jailed for up to six months if the goods are worth less than £200, or for a maximum of seven years if they are worth more than £200.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden"], "publish_date": "2023/05/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/us/minneapolis-crime-defund-invs/index.html", "title": "Once nicknamed \"Murderapolis,\" the city that made itself the center ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nMarnette Gordon was doing laundry at home in Minneapolis one summer morning last year when a call came from her 36-year-old son.\n\nShe figured her son, Telly Blair, was checking in to see if she wanted a soda from a gas station down the street, where he often went for fuel and snacks.\n\n“Mom, I’ve been shot,” he said. “Call the police!”\n\nMarnette, her other son Tamarcus and his 12-year-old daughter rushed to the gas station from their home in the city’s north side, a part of town long beset by violent crime.\n\nBlair’s family came upon his blue 1986 Chevy Caprice at pump No. 5 — beating police and paramedics by a few minutes, they said — only to find him slumped in his car, bleeding from multiple bullet wounds in his chest. A 17-year-old male in an orange hoodie had fired nine rounds from a handgun into Blair’s car before running off.\n\nWhile an off-duty nurse in scrubs who’d been at the gas station tried to stop his bleeding, Marnette — a heart-transplant recipient — couldn’t bear to watch and stood at a distance. Telly was her caretaker.\n\n“It was just horrible to see him sitting there, waiting on the ambulance,” she told CNN.\n\nThe 12-year-old called 911 while watching her uncle struggle to breathe.\n\n“Oh my God, please,” the girl, who was crying, said to a dispatcher, according to 911 transcripts of the August 9, 2021 shooting obtained by CNN. “Hurry up, hurry up, hurry, hurry, he’s dead, hurry up!”\n\nTelly Blair was among 93 people who were murdered in Minneapolis last year, city crime data shows. That’s just a few shy of the total killings in 1995, when the city earned the nickname “Murderapolis.” (Neighboring St. Paul witnessed 38 murders last year — a historic high.)\n\nA photo of Telly Blair and his mother, Marnette, rests on a table in their home in north Minneapolis. Marnette Gordon, 61, mother of Telly Blair, 36, who lost his life to gun violence in north Minneapolis, photographed in her home.\n\nAfter the police murder of George Floyd in May of 2020, Minneapolis became a worldwide symbol of the police brutality long endured disproportionately by Black people. In a kind of Newtonian response, the city became the epicenter of the culturally seismic “Defund the Police” movement. But that progressive local effort fizzled with a decisive referendum last November.\n\nNow, with its police department under investigation by the Department of Justice, the city of 425,000 is trying to find a way forward amid a period of heightened crime that began shortly after Floyd’s death.\n\nThat year, the number of murders soared to nearly 80 — dwarfing the 2019 body count of 46. It has cooled somewhat this year, though the amount of killing — and violent crime in general — remains elevated far above 2019 levels and homicides are on pace to surpass the 2020 figure. The reasons why are far from clear.\n\nKG Wilson, a longtime resident of the Twin Cities, said police withdrew from violent neighborhoods in the aftermath of Floyd’s killing — a common sentiment among locals.\n\n“The criminals were celebrating. They were getting rich,” he said. “They were selling drugs openly.”\n\nWilson told CNN the violence devastated his own family: His 6-year-old granddaughter was killed in May of 2021 after getting caught in the crossfire of a gunfight in north Minneapolis. The culprit remains at large.\n\nAnother factor was the pandemic, which some observers see as the biggest impetus for the crime surge.\n\n“It unsettled settled trajectories,” said Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who is now a professor at St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis. “Kids who were going to school, who would have graduated but drifted off because there is no school — we’re seeing a lot of the violent crime is by juveniles.”\n\nCiting sinking morale in the wake of the unrest after Floyd’s killing, leaders at the Minneapolis Police Department say the officer head count has shrunk from 900 in early 2020 to about 560 in August — a loss of more than a third of the force.\n\nKG Wilson created a memorial for his granddaughter Aniya Allen in his SUV. The car seat cover of her face rests on the seat where she would ride with him. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the political pendulum on public-safety matters in this reliably liberal city — the “Mini Apple” hasn’t had a Republican mayor since 1973, and that was for just a single day — seems to have swung away from a progressive mindset towards the middle.\n\nAnd on matters of public safety, the middle is where many of the city’s Black residents already were.\n\nLast year, progressives touted a ballot measure that was said to be a referendum on the “defund” concept. Question 2, as it was known locally, would have replaced the Minneapolis Police Department with a new “public health-oriented” Department of Public Safety and removed a minimum staffing requirement from the city charter.\n\nIt failed in November, with 56% of voters rejecting it. That figure was 61% in north Minneapolis, a pair of neighboring city wards where Blacks make up a strong plurality of the roughly 66,000 residents. All but one of the 17 precincts in the north voted against the measure.\n\n“We did not believe that the police should be defunded, but we do believe in police reforms,” said Bishop Richard Howell of Shiloh Temple, a north-side church founded more than 90 years ago.\n\nRae McKay-Anderson — Telly Blair’s sister — said “you can’t possibly defund the police in a way that’s going to benefit the Black community.”\n\nDealing the final blow to the local “defund” movement last year was a city council vote to essentially refund a cut they’d made the prior year. Mayor Jacob Frey is proposing another budget bump for the next two fiscal years.\n\nThe question of the moment is, if the police budget has been restored, and if all the anti-cop shouting by politicians and activists that left officers demoralized has weakened to a whimper, why are citizens — especially in the rough parts of north Minneapolis — still feeling neglected by police and fearful for their safety?\n\nA feeling of lawlessness, a sense of neglect\n\nResidents of the north side describe a landscape that can feel lawless. Indeed, about 60% of police calls for shots fired this year have come from the area, even though it makes up just 15% of the population, according to city data.\n\nPaul Johnson, 56, said young men openly sell drugs during the day in public places, such as a gas station on Broadway Avenue that has been dubbed the “murder station” due to all of the fatal shootings there. (It is near the one where Blair was killed.)\n\n“You pull up to get gas – they try to sell you drugs,” he said. “And not just three or four, but it’s a bulk of people.”\n\nThe perception among many residents is that the police ignore the area.\n\n“They just let it go on,” said Johnson’s friend, Brian Bogan, 42, who said he moved from north Minneapolis to relatively safer St. Paul due to his kids growing up in an area where they don’t know if “it’s fireworks or gunshots.”\n\nA memorial for Aniya Allen lay on the ground of the corner store near where she was shot in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nWhile Minneapolis is far from the nation’s most dangerous city, its rate of increase in homicides — the count in 2021 was about double that of 2019 — is among the highest in the nation, said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri- St. Louis and co-author of an annual study on crime trends.\n\nOn per-capita murders, it has ranked fairly high — 19th out of 70 jurisdictions in the US — during the first half of this year, according to the Major Cities Chiefs Association. The city ranked even higher on other per-capita crime measures, such as robbery (4th), rape (8th) and aggravated assault (13th).\n\nJuliee Oden, 56, can’t even count the times she has called 911 to report gunfire outside her north-side home. One night last summer, a volley of shots jolted her out of bed while she was watching TV — it was coming from her front lawn.\n\n“I hit the floor,” she said. “My phone went flying. I had to crawl on my stomach to get to the phone” to dial 911.\n\nIt got to the point where it was hard to sleep at night and Oden, who works at a construction company, had colleagues install a bulletproof panel behind the headboard of her bed.\n\n“Now I go in my room with complete confidence,” she said. “If somebody is to shoot directly at my house, I know: As long as I’m behind my headboard, I’m 100% safe.”\n\nOden was among eight residents in north Minneapolis who filed a lawsuit in the summer of 2020 calling on the city to replenish the police department by filling vacant positions. The suit singled out city council members who supported the “radical ‘dismantle the police’” idea and accused them and Mayor Frey of creating a “hostile” environment for the police. It was largely upheld by a state Supreme Court decision this summer — meaning the city needs to staff up to at least 731 police officers.\n\nDoug Seaton, an attorney representing the eight residents, said the successful suit was filed in direct response to how progressive city council members had embraced the “defund” idea. It demoralized the police department and ultimately led to a mass exodus of officers, he said.\n\n“That is, we think, the major reason that crime has spiked throughout the city and hasn’t gone away yet,” Seaton said.\n\nMeanwhile, as the MPD headcount has shrunk, wait times have grown for people who call 911 to report serious “priority 1” incidents, which can include shots fired, robberies, assaults and mental health crises.\n\nAverage 911 response times jumped the very month of Floyd’s death — May of 2020 — from around 10 or 11 minutes early that year to 14 minutes, according to public records obtained by CNN. They kept rising in 2021 to 16 minutes; response times in the north side’s fourth precinct last year actually surpassed 17 minutes, where they remain.\n\nSome nights are so busy that the dispatchers are directed to hold all non-priority-1 calls citywide; these would include reports of property damage, suspicious persons or theft. That happened during a frenetic five-hour stretch on the night of September 8, when officers responded to multiple shootings and calls for shots fired — many of them in north Minneapolis; one near the “murder station” — that left two dead and seven wounded.\n\nThe Minneapolis Police Department has even flatly refused to respond to certain crimes in a timely manner. One couple who run a property management business recently took it upon themselves to investigate the theft of their van, box truck and tools by a culprit who brought the stolen goods into a homeless encampment on the north side, according to local news reports.\n\nPolice told KARE 11 that the hostility towards police on the part of some encampment dwellers compels them to take a slower approach when investigating property crimes there.\n\nBut by and large, police officials have said the slower response times are the expected byproduct of a depleted force that has witnessed an overwhelming wave of retirements, resignations and disability leaves due to post-traumatic stress.\n\nMuch of that exodus owes to a bottoming out of morale in the wake of a crisis that left police officers feeling reviled, said interim Minneapolis Police Chief Amelia Huffman.\n\n“There’s really been a very fundamental challenge to our sense of purpose in law enforcement,” Huffman said of the post-Floyd era. “(Minneapolis) is the eye of the storm. So all of those challenges and the pressure is magnified, you know, a hundred fold – a thousand fold.”\n\nSimilar headcount plunges have plagued police departments from coast to coast.\n\nSome law enforcement officials have attributed the mass resignations and retirements to pandemic-related reasons, but Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith of the National Police Association said morale is a major factor.\n\n“It’s no secret that law enforcement … especially in the last two and a half years, has been badly vilified and wrongly vilified,” she told CNN. “You can’t call an entire profession racist and expect people to just sit back and say, okay, you know, keep piling on.”\n\nThe gas station where Telly Blair was fatally shot in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nIn June, the embattled Minneapolis department was hit with more bad press — this time for its abysmal numbers on unsolved murders in recent years.\n\nSince 2016, the clearance rate (or the percentage of homicide cases closed) in Minneapolis sank from around 54% — the most recent national average — to 38% in 2020, according to the latest available data from the FBI. Figures for last year haven’t been released by the FBI, but Huffman insists the rate has improved considerably, claiming that the unofficial figure for this year to date is back to 54%.\n\nEven so, some family members of murder victims say they have felt compelled to take a lead role in the homicide investigations of their own loved ones.\n\nResidents take matters into their own hands\n\nAmong them is Dorothy Royston, a 26-year-old healthcare professional who said she spent weeks proactively feeding police information shortly after her unarmed younger brother, Charles Royston Jr., was gunned down on a snowy street in north Minneapolis on a January night in 2021, according to police reports.\n\n“They had a lot of the information or the logistics of what was – like bullet casings and stuff like that,” Dorothy said. “But when it comes to who was involved with the actual shooting, who was around – and the people information? I actually provided that to the police.”\n\nDorothy provided CNN with text messages between her and a lead investigator on the case. In February of 2021, the investigator told her in a message that there would be a warrant out for the arrest of a suspect by the next day. He still hasn’t been arrested, Dorothy said.\n\nShe said communications from the investigator fell off around March of 2021.\n\nA couple months ago, about a year and a half after the killing, Dorothy said, she called the investigator to ask for an update.\n\n“He told me that he was currently doing something and that he would call me back,” she said. “He never called me back.”\n\n(The investigator agreed to talk with CNN, but a police spokesperson called off the interview. )\n\nTaken together, the current state of crime and policing in Minneapolis — from slow response times to recent brutality complaints to the poor clearance rates — has fostered an atmosphere of distrust.\n\nThe distrust paves the way for some to assume bad intentions. Dave Bicking, a board member of the Minneapolis-based Community United Against Police Brutality, goes so far as to suggest the police since Floyd’s death may have engaged in a “sickout” — that is, that officers are purposefully sluggish to respond to or investigate certain crimes.\n\n“It’s still going on to a considerable extent — it was dramatic in the beginning,” Bicking told CNN. “The police would simply, if they showed up at all, say, ‘Oh, we don’t have anybody to deal with that,’ or ‘You people don’t want us here, so we’re not going to do anything.’”\n\nDave Bicking outside his facility, Communities United Against Police Brutality, in Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nBicking, who has been publicly critical of the “defund” tactic from the get-go, said he bases the sickout claim on a drop-off in jail bookings shortly after Floyd’s death and on more than 2,300 interviews the CUAPB has conducted over the past year and a half with Minneapolis residents about their experiences with the MPD.\n\nHe added that the CUAPB persuaded the Department of Justice to include in its investigation of the MPD the alleged lack of Minneapolis police investigations into murders of people of color.\n\nChief Huffman did not respond to follow-up questions related to sickout allegations, but in her earlier interview with CNN she said Minneapolis has unique challenges.\n\nFor one, she said, Minneapolis has a relatively low rate of domestic murders, which are typically easier to solve, and a high rate of gang murders, which are more difficult.\n\nBut the bigger factor again comes down to attrition. Huffman said the Minneapolis Police Department has lost about 100 investigators in its investigations bureau since early 2020.\n\nStill, Huffman said the MPD is committed to solving homicides, adding that unsolved murders can have serious negative repercussions that ripple through communities for years and devastate families.\n\n“The lack of justice for families who have had family members murdered is completely unacceptable,” she said. “And it’s incumbent on us to make sure that we’re doing everything we can to solve those cases.”\n\nHuffman’s new boss, Cedric Alexander — who was hired in August as the city’s first ever community safety commissioner — said he understands the community’s frustration.\n\n“When you have a body drop and another body drops and another body drops, what you have oftentimes is ongoing violence – it certainly does overwhelm an agency that already is struggling with a great deal of shortages,” he told CNN. “It does give people the perception nothing is being done. But I can assure you that it is. And in any of these violent cases where we have victims, it is taken at a very high priority.”\n\nHow ‘defund’ failed\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey is shouted at by protesters at a Defund the Police march in early June of 2020 to protest the police killing of George Floyd. (Victor J. Blue/The New York Times/Redux) Victor J. Blue/The New York Times/Redux\n\nIn June of 2020, nine of the Minneapolis City Council’s 13 members stood on a stage adorned with an oversized sign saying “DEFUND POLICE.”\n\nAround the same time, in another spectacle that made national news, Mayor Frey was booed and jeered by activists at a George Floyd protest near his home for saying — in response to a question — that he did not support “the full abolition of police.” As he walked away, the crowd broke into a “Go home Jacob!” chant.\n\n“It was a lonely walk,” Frey told CNN recently. “At that moment there was a very loud chorus of people, including elected officials … that were all calling very loudly to defund the police.”\n\nIt’s well established that those widely viewed events boosted a movement in Minneapolis that would later fail at the polls last November. Lesser known is how the very community most directly impacted by crime and policing in the city — the north side — was among the least supportive of the “defund” idea.\n\n“I think what’s at issue is the White progressives’ belief that they’re helping us,” said Lisa Clemons, a former Minneapolis police officer, who is Black and runs a gun-violence organization called A Mother’s Love in north Minneapolis. “Oftentimes they are hurting us.”\n\nClemons said people in north Minneapolis don’t want to get rid of cops – “they just want respectful cops.”\n\nLisa Clemons, a resident of north Minneapolis and former cop, at the Northside Community Center at Cub Foods. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nMinneapolis voters not only resoundingly rejected what was seen as the “defund” initiative, they also voted to strengthen the office of the mayor and reelected Frey, who’d become a local avatar for moderate Democrats put off by the party’s most liberal wing.\n\nThe Minneapolis area with the largest Black population — Ward 5 on the north side — also proved a strong base of support for Frey in his reelection, according to a CNN analysis of voter data.\n\nFrey said that while no demographic group is a monolith, White progressives in the aftermath of Floyd’s death often seemed out of sync with ordinary Black residents.\n\n“I heard a lot of White activists purport to be speaking on behalf of communities of color. And I was listening to them — listening to communities of color — and they weren’t saying the same things,” Frey said. “I’d walk down the street and I’d hear from White people, ‘Defund the police! Defund the police!’ And then I’d hear from a Black person a half block later, ‘Hey, we really need to have some additional help.’”\n\nSheila Nezhad, a community organizer who turned out to be one of Frey’s most competitive mayoral opponents in November, noted that turnout was lower in north Minneapolis than the citywide average, and that the advocacy group — called Yes 4 Minneapolis — that proposed the ballot measure that came to be seen as the “defund” referendum was led by Black people.\n\n“And I’m not White,” she said. “So when Jacob Frey talks about only White people want to defund or whatever … I think that he is perhaps shaping the narrative to benefit his political goals.”\n\nEven before Floyd’s killing, the MPD had drawn criticism for its approach to policing the Black community.\n\nIn 2016, anti-police protests erupted after it was announced that two Minneapolis officers involved in the shooting death of Jamar Clark – a 24-year-old Black man who scuffled with the officers and, according to authorities, reached for one of their guns — would not be charged. Two years later, after responding to calls of a man shooting a gun in the air, police chased and fatally shot 31-year-old Thurman Blevins, who said “please don’t shoot me” as he ran away from them; body cameras showed officers yelling at him to drop his gun. Police say Blevins turned with his gun toward the officers, who ultimately were not charged.\n\nAnd then came May 25, 2020. In a nine-minute video that seemed to last an eternity, a police officer defiantly knelt on the neck of a handcuffed, face-down Floyd, whose pleas for help went unanswered until he fell silent. Now infamous, the officer, Derek Chauvin – who’d already had 18 prior complaints filed against him – was convicted of Floyd’s murder and sentenced to 21 years in federal prison.\n\nA person holds a sign displaying a portrait of George Floyd during a vigil at an art installation honoring victims of police burtaliuty in Minneapolis in June 2020.

It called for ordering a consent decree, which is essentially a court-enforced settlement to reform the department. The report also blasted the MPD for “ineffective accountability,” saying that “almost every investigation of a police misconduct complaint against an MPD officer … is assessed or guided by sworn MPD officers.”\n\nThe city is in negotiations with the human rights department over the consent decree, and Frey has indicated that some of his budget priorities are in direct response to the report.\n\nDon Samuels — a former Minneapolis City Councilman who surprised political observers this summer by nearly defeating US Rep. Ilhan Omar, an icon of progressive politics in America — said the video of Floyd’s death was the most “evil thing I had ever seen.”\n\n“That was so painful — just painful to watch and to see a Black man, of dark complexion, under the knee of a dispassionate White male,” Samuels said. “It conjured up all kinds of slavery imagery.”\n\nAnd yet, Samuels, a 73-year-old immigrant from Jamaica — who lives in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods of north Minneapolis — experienced another kind of dismay when he saw the nine council members on the Defund stage while watching the news on TV with his wife.\n\nDon Samuels, the moderate Democrat who nearly unseated US Rep. Ilhan Omar on August 9, photographed in his home in north Minneapolis. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\n“It was like a World Trade Center moment for us,” he told CNN. “Our jaws fell to the floor. Literally, we were aghast. We looked at each other and said, ‘Oh, my God. It’s going to be Crime City in Minneapolis.’”\n\nThat summer, Samuels joined the residents of north Minneapolis who sued the city for its police shortage. Half of the plaintiffs are Black.\n\nDuring his campaign for Congress, Samuels ran a kind of middle-ground campaign on public safety.\n\n“We don’t have to choose safety or police – we can have both/and,” Samuels said at a town hall campaign event in August. “Let’s get rid of the bad police, let’s fix the fixable police.”\n\nHe lost, but the “both/and” approach appears to be the current path that the city of Minneapolis is on.\n\n‘Both-and’: A post-Defund approach\n\nOn a morning this August, in a scene that offered a sharp contrast from two years ago — when Mayor Frey made his “lonely walk” through an angry crowd — he and Commissioner Alexander, both smartly dressed, strode triumphantly through corridors of City Hall.\n\nAlexander, a 67-year-old former deputy sheriff with a doctorate in psychology who was hand-picked by Frey, had just been confirmed as the city’s community safety commissioner in a contentious council meeting. His newly created position amounts to the first piece of Frey’s proposed plan to combine 911, police, fire, neighborhood safety and emergency management under one roof.\n\nCedric Alexander speaks about policing in America during CivicCon at the Rex Theatre in downtown Pensacola, Florida, in September 2021. (Gregg Pachkowski/News-Journal/USA Today Network) Gregg Pachkowski/USA Today Network\n\n“The number one, first priority is the fact that people in this community don’t feel that they’re safe,” said Alexander — who served on the 21st Century Task Force on Policing under former President Barack Obama — during an impromptu press conference minutes after his hiring. “The fact is that we have violent crime that’s occurring, and occurring way too frequently.”\n\nAlexander, who retired in 2017 as the public safety director in DeKalb County, Georgia, in the metro Atlanta area, added that the MPD isn’t likely to become fully staffed overnight — “probably not even in our careers” — and stressed the importance of data-driven policing and building relationships.\n\n“If we don’t build relationships with these people in our communities, you ain’t solving crime nowhere,” said Alexander, a former CNN contributor on law enforcement issues.\n\nOsler, the St. Thomas professor, said at the moment, people don’t want to work for the MPD, “where officers are not respected. And to be straight-up about it, MPD earned that lack of respect.”\n\nIn the meantime, he said, the department needs to focus on two key metrics: improving homicide clearance rates and executing search warrants for violent criminals, which, Osler acknowledged, is no easy feat.\n\n“Think about it from the perspective of the person executing that warrant,” Osler said. “You’re going to bust down the door and who you know is on the other side is someone who’s probably already shot somebody. That’s a tough job. No wonder people don’t want to do it.”\n\nExterior of the police department's 3rd Precinct in south Minneapolis that was burned by rioters in May of 2020. To this day it remains boarded up. Its officers are currently headquartered a few miles away downtown. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nOn the policy front, the wheels of change seem to be grinding forward, however slowly.\n\nSince Gov. Tim Walz signed a police accountability law two years ago that banned chokeholds and “warrior” style police training, the city of Minneapolis appears to be finding a path forward that avoids having to choose between building the police force and reimagining public safety. The city is not only looking at further beefing up the police budget but is also piloting a slate of programs that send unarmed responders to nonviolent 911 calls. Mayor Frey has proposed making them permanent in his recommended budget for 2023-2024.\n\nFrey argues that the centerpiece of his proposed public safety plan – creating a new Office of Community Safety — captures much of what the “defund” movement was after in the first place.\n\nThe concept is to “match the best possible people with what is actually being experienced on the street,” Frey said. “Anybody who was for that before but is not for it now is pretty disingenuous.”\n\nWhen it comes to hiring, the MPD is trying to entice young blood with incentives — for instance by covering the cost of tuition for potential recruits who need law-enforcement coursework but only have a high school degree. It’s a big challenge — not just because so many officers have left, but also because there is a shortage of young people across the country getting into law enforcement, Alexander said.\n\nThe city has made headway when it comes to filling the top job: Frey recently announced three finalists — all of them from outside Minneapolis — for the permanent chief position, which Huffman has filled on an interim basis since December.\n\nLast summer, the police presence in the city was so thin — and the rate of violence so high — that a group of volunteers in the faith community went to heroic measures to break the cycle.\n\nThe idea was simple. In an initiative called 21 Days of Peace, church volunteers simply hung out in some of the most deadly neighborhoods to engage in violence prevention.\n\nThe effort was considered a success, but for one volunteer it came at a cost.\n\nGloria Howard, a grandmother, had just handed out snow cones to two women with young children at one of the violence hotspots near a liquor store on Broadway Avenue when a barrage of gunfire sent people scattering.\n\nHoward crumpled to the ground. When she tried to get up, she couldn’t — she’d been shot twice.\n\nGloria Howard, a survivor of gun violence, poses for a portrait a few yards away from where she was struck by bullets in north Minneapolis. She was serving snow cones as a volunteer for 21 Days of Peace when it happened. Andrea Ellen Reed for CNN\n\nPeople from a nearby church rushed out of the building to render aid and call the police.\n\n“When I got to the hospital, the doctors were like, ‘Well, you’re some lucky lady and you must be somebody special because you have no metal fragments in your body,’” Howard said. The bullets, she said, “went through and through.”\n\nHoward, who was against the “defund” initiative, said there are specific reforms she would like to see, starting with a push to require more officers to live in the city they serve.\n\n(A 2017 Star Tribune report found that just 8% of MPD officers lived in Minneapolis. Chauvin lived in the suburb of Oakdale, where nearly 72% of the residents are White.)\n\n“All Black men are not big and scary,” Howard said. “All Black women are not angry. So, you know, you have to be able to know the community.”\n\nBut she realizes that even with such reforms, improvement would take time.\n\n“I don’t even walk Broadway anymore,” Howard said, while eying the thoroughfare from a distance, close to where she was shot. “I’ve seen the cars speeding up and down when they’re chasing each other. And then when they start shooting, it can come from anywhere. So I don’t even do that anymore. And I never used to be afraid coming over here.”", "authors": ["Rob Kuznia.

Now, data from the Highway Loss Data Institute, which collects information on insurance claims, confirm these South Korean models are far more likely to get stolen than others.\n\nIn fact, 2015-2019 Hyundai and Kia models are roughly twice as likely to be stolen as other vehicles of similar age. The reason is many of these vehicles lack some basic auto theft prevention technology included in most other vehicles, even in those years, according to the HLDI.\n\nThese models don’t have electronic immobilizers which rely on a computer chip in the car and another in the key that communicate to confirm that the key is authentic and really belongs to that vehicle. Without the right key, an immobilizer should do just that – stop the car from moving.\n\nImmobilizers were standard equipment on 96% of vehicles sold for the 2015-2019 model years, according the HLDI, but were standard on only 26% of Hyundais and Kias. Vehicles that have push-button start systems, rather than relying on metal keys that must be inserted and turned, have immobilizers, but not all models with turn-key ignitions do.\n\nHyundai and Kia operate as separate companies in the United States, but Hyundai Motor Group owns a large stake in Kia and various Hyundai and Kia models share much of their engineering.\n\nThe auto theft trend spread widely on social media last year, according to HLDI. In Wisconsin, where it first became popular, theft claims of Hyundais and Kias spiked to more than 30 times 2019 levels in dollar terms.\n\nSome videos posted on TikTok showed allegedly stolen Hyundai and Kia vehicles being driven recklessly and even crashing. “TikTok does not condone this behavior which violates our policies and will be removed if found on our platform,” a TikTok spokesperson said recently.\n\nThe method of theft, which involves serious damage to the ignition system, indicates that these cars are being stolen for fun rather than for resale, according to the HLDI.\n\n“When you forcibly break the ignition, you’re causing so much damage that it’s not easy to re-VIN and resell the vehicle on the open market,” Darrell Russell, a former auto theft investigator who is now a director of operation at the National Insurance Crime Bureau, said in a statement. To re-VIN a vehicle means to change or replace its Vehicle Identification Number, an identification code made from 17 letters and digits, to make the vehicle harder to trace.\n\nHLDI’s estimates of theft frequency are based on the number of a given model on the road and the frequency of vehicle theft claims. Some vehicles are stolen very often simply because so many have been sold, and so there are simply lots of them on the roads to steal.\n\nIn the case of these Hyundai and Kia models, though, the theft rates are far out of proportion to their numbers on the road.\n\nVehicles produced after November 1, 2021 and those with push button start are not liable to stolen in this way, Hyundai spokesman Ira Gabriel said. Electronic immobilizers became standard on all Hyundai vehicles, including those with keyed ignitions, after that date.\n\nAlso, for those with older vehicles that do not have the immobilizers, Hyundai has identified a kit that can be installed to prevent this sort of theft. Beginning October 1, the security kit will be available for purchase and installation at Hyundai dealerships and at authorized installers, the automaker said in a statement.\n\nKia pointed out the majority of Kia vehicles in the United States have push-button start systems that make theft more difficult. The NICB advises owners who are worried their vehicle may be a target for theft to take easy steps like always locking the doors and parking in well lit areas. Beyond that, owners can also use aftermarket theft prevention devices like add-on alarm systems, steering wheel and pedal locks and kill switches.\n\nAmong newer vehicles, the Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat, a large sedan with a supercharged V8 capable of producing more than 700 horsepower, was most popular with thieves relative to its numbers on the road, according the HLDI. Dodge vehicles are made by the global auto company Stellanits.\n\n“All Stellantis vehicles meet or exceed applicable federal standards for safety and security. We employ industry-standard technologies, including immobilizer capability, across our North American vehicle lineup,” a spokesman said in an email. “Notwithstanding, we urge all motorists to take due care in securing their vehicles.”\n\nCNN’s Brian Fung contributed to this story.", "authors": ["Peter Valdes-Dapena"], "publish_date": "2022/09/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/05/us/fbi-national-crime-report-2021-data/index.html", "title": "The FBI released its crime report for 2021 - but it tells us less about ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe FBI just released its 2021 Crime in the Nation Report, which is typically the most comprehensive snapshot of crime in the United States. But only 63% of the nation’s more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies submitted data for 2021 — the lowest level of participation the FBI has reported since at least 1979. Only 52% of all agencies submitted a full year’s worth of data, the FBI said.\n\nA change in how the FBI requires agencies to report crimes in 2021 has led participation to plummet. Participation is voluntary and several of the biggest police departments in the country, including the LAPD and NYPD, did not submit any data at all to the FBI last year, according to the agency. The agencies that submitted at least partial data serve about 65% of the country’s population.\n\nThe data collection system, called NIBRS (National Incident Based Reporting System), requires greater detail (and effort) in logging crimes, which the FBI said has lowered participation rates. As a result, the 2021 report relies heavily on estimates for their national figures.\n\nThe new report estimates an overall decline in violent crime by 1% from 2020, driven largely by reductions in the robbery rate, which declined by 8.9%. The agency also reported a 4.3% increase in homicides between 2020 and 2021.\n\nNIBRS is intended to “provide more useful statistics to promote constructive discussion, measured planning, and informed policing,” according to its website.\n\nBut it’s unclear how useful this latest release is given the record-low participation from local agencies — just a few weeks before the November midterm elections, where crime has become a dominating topic.\n\n“We are currently in a period in which there’s significant concern awith crime, and violent crime in particular,” said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist and professor at the University of Missouri–St. Louis. “So this is exactly the wrong time to be producing crime statistics that are so significantly based on estimates.”\n\nSwitching to a more detailed data collection method has lowered participation\n\nIn 2015, the FBI announced that it was transitioning away from its previous data reporting system, the UCR Summary Reporting System (SRS), in favor of NIBRS-only data collection. SRS allowed agencies to aggregate monthly totals of eight categories of crime: murder, rape, aggravated assault, robbery, arson, motor vehicle theft, burglary and larceny.\n\nBut NIBRS provides detailed reporting on dozens of different types of crimes. It gives greater context about each individual crime committed, including the relationship between the victim and the offender, the type of weapon used, the time of day the crime was committed or if the incident was cleared.\n\nAlthough NIBRS was first introduced in the 1980s, law enforcement agencies — from local police departments to county sheriff’s offices — could submit their data to the FBI using the simplified SRS until 2020. Many agencies have been slow to make the switch to NIBRS. While some have been using NIBRS to report their crime statistics to the FBI for decades, many have not.\n\nMany agencies have been slow to make the switch to NIBRS. While some have been using NIBRS to report their crime statistics to the FBI for decades, many have not.\n\nThe 2021 report is the first year all agencies have been required to submit NIBRS data.\n\nWhen the transition was announced, the FBI estimated that they expected an initial participation rate of 75% — much higher than the actual 63% participation rate revealed in Wednesday’s report.\n\nThe lack of comprehensive data — and monthslong delay between the end of the year and when the report is published — has led other organizations to fill in the gaps.\n\nThe Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ), a nonprofit that studies criminal justice policy, published a study in January analyzing 2021 crime trends across 27 major cities in the US. Their findings were similar to the FBI’s estimate: homicides rose by 5% and aggravated assault rose by 4% between 2020 and 2021, indicating that the steep increases in violent crime were leveling off.\n\nAnalytics company AH Datalytics, which maintains an up-to-date survey of murders in every major US city with more than 100,000 residents, reported similar findings — a 5.7% increase between 2020 and 2021. But these groups have expressed concern about their role in informing the public.\n\n“I can think of no other system in American culture today where we accept this archaic data collection system,” said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst and co-founder of AH Datalytics. “It’s absurd that people have made private citizens to take it upon themselves to guesstimate what our national murder trend is.”\n\nWhere are the biggest gaps?\n\nThe FBI has spent tens of millions of dollars training law enforcement agencies across the country on how to use this new system, according to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Readers can look up how much money their local law enforcement agency has received from the federal government to make the switch here. Several agencies appear to have received grant money, but did not report any NIBRS data to the FBI in 2021.\n\nThere are many contributing factors to the low participation rates, Asher told CNN, ranging from technical challenges to low incentives to adapt to the new system.\n\n“There hasn’t been a lot of political pressure,” Asher said, citing the voluntary nature of the reporting as another one of the challenges. “You have to train your officers in new ways of doing things … it’s hard to overcome the momentum of a system that’s been around for 80 years or so.”\n\nIn some of the country’s largest states, very few agencies reported last year’s data to the FBI. Only 2% of California’s more than 700 agencies reported any data to the FBI. In Florida, only two agencies reported data.\n\nIt may be years until the share of agencies reporting with NIBRS catches up to pre-2021 participation levels, but data from 2022 does show improvement. By September this year, the FBI reported it had already received NIBRS data from 60% of law enforcement agencies across the country, indicating that next year’s report may be more robust.\n\nA murky picture of crime after years of unrest\n\nLast year’s UCR report saw a nearly 30% increase in homicides from 2019, the highest year-over-year increase recorded in FBI history. The alarming jump came during a year which saw a global pandemic, massive civil unrest following the police killing of George Floyd, and unique economic and social stressors.\n\nThe 2021 report could have provided an essential look into the state of crime in a country emerging from a historic, tumultuous period. But while the NIBRS data does provide new details into certain crimes, the current nationwide picture remains unclear — especially because the FBI’s 2022 report will likely not be published until the end of 2023.\n\nHowever, other sources have indicated that the historic rise in crime the nation saw in 2020 has leveled off.\n\nWhile the FBI has only reported agency-level data from 2022, both CCJ and AH Datalytics have released national findings from this year. In its mid-year report, the CCJ found that across 29 major US cities, homicides had declined 2% from 2022, but aggravated assaults and robberies had increased by 4% and 19% respectively. AH Datalytics has reported a 4.5% decrease in murders across the cities it surveys.\n\nUntil agency participation in NIBRS increases, the FBI may have to continue to rely on estimates for their national crime reports — but comprehensive, up-to-date data about crime in the United States is essential in setting policy, allocating police funding, and for informing the public, experts say.\n\n“Credible crime trend data is more important than it has been in 25 years — but now the numbers are at their most uncertain,” Adam Gelb, CEO of the CCJ, told CNN. “This [information] void allows speculation and manipulation, and further erodes trust and confidence in the justice system, and in government generally.”", "authors": ["Priya Krishnakumar"], "publish_date": "2022/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/business/egg-prices/index.html", "title": "Why eggs have been so expensive this year", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nSeveral grocery items have gotten more expensive this year. But nothing comes close to the rise in egg prices.\n\nIn the year through November, not adjusted for seasonal swings, egg prices jumped 49%, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nSince early this year, a deadly avian flu has been reducing poultry flocks — specifically turkeys and egg-laying hens. That’s one reason for the unrelenting increase in prices. But the situation has been exacerbated by elevated feed and energy costs for producers, in addition to high demand in the supermarket.\n\nExperts think that the peak has passed, but until these conditions improve, expect to pay more for eggs in the grocery store.\n\nWholesale prices hit a record\n\nAvian flu has been a problem in the US for several months now, but in recent weeks wholesale prices have been hitting records.\n\nAs of last week, “prices have been escalating for nine consecutive weeks… setting new record highs on a daily basis since the week of Thanksgiving,” said Karyn Rispoli, editor of the Egg Price Current for Urner Barry, which offers food market data.\n\nOn Friday, Midwest large eggs, the benchmark for eggs sold in their shells, hit $5.46 per dozen, Rispoli said, citing Urner Barry’s data. This time last year, Urner Berry’s data shows, that price was around $1.70.\n\nEggs have gotten much more expensive this year. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nOne reason for the increase? Not enough supply.\n\n“There’s simply not been enough production to support the incredibly strong retail demand we’ve seen this year,” Rispoli said. Supply has been constrained by the deadly bird flu.\n\nThe current outbreak of Highly-Pathogenic Avian Influenza started in the US around February, and has persisted throughout the year. The last major bird flu outbreak in the United States was in 2015. But that one was contained by June of that year, noted Brian Earnest, lead economist for animal protein in CoBank.\n\n“This year, we’ve continued to see flock depopulations throughout the entire year, and there’s an expectation that we’ll continue to see it into 2023,” he said, noting that he expects “we’re going to see a tight supply situation and elevated pricing environment moving forward.”\n\nAbout 60 million birds are gone because of the disease so far, according to the USDA. Of those, about 43 million are egg-laying hens, according to USDA data provided by the American Egg Board, a farmer-funded group which markets eggs.\n\nStill, farmers have been able to moderate the losses. “Our producers learned a lot of hard lessons from 2015,” said Emily Metz, CEO of the American Egg Board. Some farmers have been able to repopulate their flocks, decreasing the net impact on flock sizes and egg supplies. As of early December, there were about 308 million hens laying eggs for consumption, down from about 328 million in December 2021, according to the USDA.\n\nThe supply squeeze isn’t the only thing contributing to higher egg prices, said Metz. Higher fuel, feed and other producer cost are also driving up wholesale prices, she said. And then there’s that high demand for eggs, which spikes this time of year.\n\nEgg demand remains high\n\nPeople buy more eggs around the holidays, when they’re baking and cooking more, and eating breakfast at home more often.\n\nWholesale prices tend to go up in the winter because of those habits, noted Earnest. That has “brought about a very strong market condition.”\n\nYear-round demand for eggs has also also been strong.\n\nEven while prices have soared, sales of eggs have only ticked down about 2% by unit in retail in the year through December 4th, according to data from IRI, a market research firm.\n\nShoppers have been accepting high prices at the grocery store as they pull back on restaurant visits. And even though eggs have gotten more expensive, they still cost less than other proteins.\n\nA deadly avian flu has led to the death of millions of poultry this year. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nAs that peak holiday demand passes, wholesale prices are expected to fall.\n\n“Based on current trade values and market conditions, it appears that the market may have finally reached its peak,” said Rispoli. Friday’s wholesale prices were the same as Thursday’s, the first time pricing held steady since October, she said.\n\n“Several suppliers have reported to us… that they are seeing their orders slow,” in the week leading up to Christmas, she added. By then, “most grocers have pulled in whatever inventory they’ll need for the holidays.”\n\nIt might take another three to six months for prices to moderate in retail, said KK Davey, president of thought leadership at IRI and NPD, and even longer for prices to come down to what they were last year.\n\n“It may take some more time,” he said.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/12/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/12/14/porch-pirates-package-theft-climb-more-americans-shop-online/2218910002/", "title": "Amazon packages stolen?

As soon as he saw the video, he downloaded it and posted it on Nextdoor, a social network for neighborhoods.\n\nWithin an hour he got a response from Hart, chief of his local precinct. A few hours later, he got a note from a nearby neighbor who’d had a package stolen about the same time. It turned out she knew her neighbors and found one who had a security camera positioned at the street level. And that camera had gotten footage of the woman driving off in her car – and its license plate.\n\nThat broke the case. The neighbor emailed the footage to Priskorn, Priskorn sent it to Hart and Hart traced the plate to the owner of the car.\n\nThe captain sent two officers to the address to look for the car, and as they were watching it, the suspected thief got in. “She’s the same person in the video, and there in the back, in plain view, is the $18 Pokémon costume,” one of the items reported stolen, said Hart.\n\nEquipped with a search warrant, the officers searched her apartment, where they found not just Priskorn’s package but multiple others. She was arrested and convicted of second-degree burglary.\n\nAll in the space of 24 hours.\n\nWhen Priskorn posted on Nextdoor that an arrest had been made, 52 people commented. “It was a very pleasant surprise and a testament to community involvement, the Nextdoor platform and excellent police work,” he said.\n\nCheap, fast or good\n\nThere’s an adage in engineering, you can have something cheap, fast or good — choose two. That’s the reality of online shopping. Getting goods delivered quickly and cheaply means that good security tends to go by the wayside.\n\nOne result of making delivery as efficient as possible is that buyers almost never get to choose who will make their delivery. They might know their local UPS driver and even give them keys to their garage, but these days you can’t count on UPS, or any other carrier, being the one to arrive at your house.\n\nVarious companies sell electronic locks, and locked boxes, that consumers can put on their porch for deliveries. But that assumes that you have a porch. And that the delivery person will take the time to use it.\n\nFrom the reviews of such products posted online, that’s frequently a failure point. They're rife with people posting scathing commentary about delivery people who ignored large notes saying \"PLEASE PUT PACKAGES IN BOX\" and instead left them at the door.\n\nIn fact, notes never seem to do much good. Yan Gelman lives in a four-unit condo building and he and his neighbors have a prominent sign asking delivery people to ring all the doorbells to find someone to leave packages with.\n\n“We have a woman who’s retired and who’s home a lot. We have a couple who sometimes works from home and I always work from home,” said Gelman, who heads human resources for a San Francisco startup.\n\nNone of it did any good recently when he received a text at 3:10 p.m. from Amazon telling him his package had been delivered. “I clicked on the link, and it said that at 3:06 it had been directly handed to me,” he recalled.\n\nIt hadn’t.\n\nHe immediately ran outside, but it was too late.\n\n“I found the package, but when I lifted it up it was really light.” He turned it over and realized that the thief had very efficiently used a knife to slice through the tape at the bottom of the box.\n\n“I’d bought a $120 Amazon Cube and two bottles of vitamins. They left the vitamins,” he said ruefully.\n\nA call to Amazon resulted in an immediate refund and the items were sent again. That's an important point to note – almost every e-commerce company will quickly resend a reasonable number of stolen orders, no questions asked. But in a time when many of us are conditioned to order things we need right away, the time lag and hassle of calling, being on hold and then getting the package resent is the real cost of having items stolen.\n\nAnd it's just not right, says Gelman.\n\n“I felt wronged, indignant,” he said. Not only over the theft, but also the fact that the delivery person lied and because of that his package was stolen. “I asked if I could choose the carrier, because I know my UPS guy, and he’d never do that. But they said you can’t.”\n\nA hard crime to combat\n\nPolice departments nationwide are dealing with increasing frustration over package theft, though there’s not a great deal they can do.\n\nDenver has about a 7 percent arrest rate for porch pirates, said Doug Schepman, spokesman for the Denver Police Department. “They can be challenging to investigate and close with an arrest, which is why prevention is so important,” he said.\n\nHe encourages victims to call and report the thefts, to allow the department to track the problem. And he’s a big proponent of video cameras because video evidence of thefts at least gives police a place to start.\n\nSome police departments put out bait packages, to catch thieves and hopefully get the word out on the street that this particular crime does have consequences. In Elk Grove, California, just south of Sacramento, local police launched a bait package program just before Christmas.\n\n“We’re seeing package thefts increase, especially now during the holidays when people are having so many more packages delivered on a daily basis,” said Officer Jason Jimenez.\n\nThe bait packages contain a transponder, so officers are alerted when they’re moved. They then follow the thief and make an arrest.\n\nOfficers also conduct surveillance, linked in part to calls from neighbors. “We really encourage people to call in these thefts and to tell us when they see them happening. I know people think there’s nothing that can be done, but it really helps us,” Jimenez said.\n\nBut in the end it comes down to neighbors looking out after neighbors, said Hart of the Ingleside Station in San Francisco.\n\nTo him, package theft is the symptom, but the disease is that people don’t know their neighbors. There’s almost always someone who works at home or is retired on every block. “Have your package delivered to them, and then you can do something for them in return,” he said.\n\nCameras help, but only if neighbors share information. Priskorn’s case was a great example, said Hart. “They have an email group, they solved it themselves. I didn’t really do anything,” he said.\n\nThe kudos he and his officers earned online was gratifying, but he says it may not have been the most cost-effective thing they did that day, Hart says.\n\n“We have a captain, two sergeants and six officers who wrote four reports and a search warrant — for about $73 worth of goods.”\n\nWhat to do\n\nYou’d think being at home when the package arrives would take care of the problem, but Gelman’s story (and the experiences of countless others) shows that you can’t necessarily depend on a knock on the door.\n\nOf course, you can always opt to have things delivered to your workplace. But that gets in the way of the whole home delivery promise – you still have to carry the package home.\n\nNot only that, but some businesses are beginning to crack down on all those personal deliveries. They can make extra work for receptionists and mailroom workers and create problems in storing all the packages.\n\nThere are other options. Because as much as 50 percent of all U.S. online purchases go through Amazon, let’s start there.\n\nAmazon has three relatively foolproof ways to make sure your package isn’t stolen, but one’s slightly creepy, the other’s not always possible and the third is annoying.\n\nThe first is Amazon Key, a service launched last year. It requires installing an electronic lock on your door. Amazon sends its delivery person a message that allows them to briefly open that lock so they can place packages inside.\n\nThe in-home delivery option comes with multiple security and privacy safeguards but doesn’t appear to have been as popular as Amazon had hoped. That’s probably in part because as secure as it is, some people just aren’t comfortable having an unknown (and frequently changing) delivery person opening their door.\n\nThe second option is in-car delivery. This allows the delivery person to electronically unlock your car and leave packages in the trunk. It deals with the icky stranger-in-the-house feeling, but is still only available on limited car models, and requires that your car be parked on the street where the delivery person can get to it.\n\nThe third option is to have your packages delivered to an Amazon locker. When the item is delivered, you’re sent an email with a six-digit code that unlocks the locker and you have three days to pick it up. Amazon has more than 2,800 lockers in more than 70 metropolitan areas. However some, such as the ones at Whole Foods Stores, can fill up, especially around the holiday. And it does require a trip away from home to pick something up, which the whole idea of online shopping was supposed to save us from.\n\nBoth UPS and FedEx offer similar services allowing packages to be held at a secure location for pickup.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service has long left notes telling customers to come pick up their packages at the nearest post office. The downside of this is that post offices are pretty much 9-to-5 operations and especially around the holidays tend to have long lines, making pickup less than appealing for some.\n\nBack to the old ways\n\nOf course, the ultimate solution to package theft is not to get packages at all, something people in especially crime-prone areas seem to be adopting as a preventive measure.\n\nPriskorn says these days, unless he knows something can fit through his mail slot, he’s more inclined to go to a brick and mortar store and buy it in person, to save the time and hassle of having a package stolen.\n\nAnd his saga isn’t quite over yet. His wife never did get back her purchase, a sweater and some socks. “The police are keeping it as evidence,” he says.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/economy/la-freight-railroad-theft/index.html", "title": "Thieves in LA are looting freight trains filled with packages from UPS ...", "text": "Washington, DC CNN —\n\nPhotos and videos showing piles of empty boxes littered alongside rail tracks in Los Angeles County, California have gone viral as shipping companies say they’ve seen a dramatic spike in railroad theft. Some of the boxes are packages from companies like UPS, Amazon and FedEx.\n\nUnion Pacific, one of the country’s largest railroad companies, says it may avoid operating in Los Angeles County following the spike in thefts, which it blames on lax prosecution of crimes. The containers and trains are locked, but can be broken into.\n\nUnion Pacific said last month in a letter to the Los Angeles District Attorney that it saw a 160% year-over-year increase in theft in LA county. The company claims that a December 2020 special directive issued by District Attorney George Gascón that changed how low-level offenses are prosecuted has contributed to the uptick.\n\nUnion Pacific said in its letter that in the last three months of the year it made over 100 arrests of “active criminals vandalizing our trains” in partnership with the LA police department and Los Angeles Sherriff department. But Union Pacific, which has its own police department with jurisdiction over the 32,000 miles of tracks it owns, said that even as it has expanded its security resources and partnered more closely with local law enforcement, the problem isn’t going away. After being arrested individuals are released from custody within 24 hours, it said.\n\nCrime is associated with increases in poverty, which has increased during the pandemic. The county’s directive was intended to combat social ills that come from misdemeanor convictions, such as difficulties with employment, housing, education, government benefits and immigration.\n\n“Studies show that prosecution of the offenses driving the bulk of misdemeanor cases have minimal, or even negative, long-term impacts on public safety,” Gascón said when the directive was issued.\n\n“Our office is committed to working with law enforcement to ensure collective safety across Los Angeles County’s sprawling infrastructure, whether it’s at our ports or on railroad tracks,” Alex Bastian, Special Advisor to District Attorney Gascón said when reached for comment.\n\n“Some cases presented to our office by Union Pacific have been filed, such as burglary and grand theft, while others have been declined due to insufficient evidence. We make charging decisions based on the evidence. Our office takes Union Pacific’s concerns seriously and hopes to discuss this issue more in the coming weeks,” he added.\n\n“While we understand the well-intended social justice goals of the policy, we need our justice system to support our partnership efforts with local law enforcement, hold these criminals accountable, and most important, help protect our employees and the critical local and national rail network,” Guerrero said.\n\nThe Association of American Railroads expressed concern about the crime increase.\n\n“In coordination with local law and where necessary federal law enforcement partners, the industry is committed to pursuing all avenues necessary to address this criminal behavior,” spokesman Ted Greener said in a statement.", "authors": ["Matt Mcfarland Cheri Mossburg", "Matt Mcfarland", "Cheri Mossburg"], "publish_date": "2022/01/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/business/thanksgiving-prices/index.html", "title": "Thanksgiving dinner will be a lot more expensive this year, report ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nLooks like Thanksgiving will be a lot pricier this year.\n\nMarket research firm IRI predicts that your Thanksgiving meal will cost about 13.5% more compared to last year, based on how retail prices in the four weeks through October 16 compared to the same period in 2021. IRI measures items including turkey and other meat, baking essentials, beverages and popular side dishes in its list of Thanksgiving foods.\n\nEven if retailers offer promotions in the weeks or days leading up to the holiday, those prices will still likely be higher than in the same period a year ago, said Alastair Steel, executive of IRI Client Engagement.\n\n“Promotions could swing the number a little, but I don’t expect [them] to swing it in a meaningful way,” he told CNN Business. “If anything, there are slightly less promotions,” this year, he added, because manufactures have been increasing prices as their own costs rise.\n\nLooks like Thanksgiving is going to be more expensive this year. Joshua Yospyn/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nIt’s no surprise that Thanksgiving is expected to be more expensive this year given how high grocery prices have been in general. Extreme weather conditions such as drought and diseases, including the highly contagious avian flu, among other factors, have contributed to stubbornly high food inflation. In the year through September, not adjusted for seasonal shifts, grocery prices shot up 13%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nShoppers know what’s coming. About 38% of consumers are expecting to pay more for Thanksgiving meals this year, even though they’re planning to buy the same amount of food, according to an IRI survey conducted in September.\n\nThere could still be some relief in the grocery aisle, however. Discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl have promised low prices on some Thanksgiving favorites this year.\n\nAldi said it would lower some prices to 2019 levels, and Lidl said that its typical Thanksgiving basket, including frozen turkey, fresh cranberries, sweet potatoes and more, will cost under $30 and feed 10 people, while supplies last.

Without explanation, the 24-year-old says he was put into a vehicle and, for the next week, kept in a Qatari jail, the location and name of which he does not know.\n\n“When they arrested me, I couldn’t say anything, not a single word, as I was so scared,” he told CNN Sport, speaking at home in southern Nepal where he has been working on a farm since being deported three months ago.\n\nKamal – CNN has changed the names of the Nepali workers to protect them from retaliation – is one of many migrant workers wanting to tell the world of their experiences in Qatar, a country that will this month host one of sport’s greatest, most lucrative, spectacles – the World Cup, a tournament which usually unites the world as millions watch the spectacular goals and carefully-choreographed celebrations.\n\nIt will be a historic event, the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East, but one also mired in controversy. Much of the build-up to this tournament has been on more sober matters, that of human rights, from the deaths of migrant workers and the conditions many have endured in Qatar, to LGBTQ and women’s rights.\n\nKamal says he has yet to be paid the 7,000 Qatari Riyal bonus (around $1,922) he says he is entitled to from his previous employers, nor 7,000 Riyal in insurance for injuring two fingers at work.\n\n“I wasn’t told why I was being arrested. People are just standing there … some are walking with their grocery [sic], some are just sitting there consuming tobacco products … they just arrest you,” he adds, before explaining he could not ask questions as he does not speak Arabic.\n\nA worker is seen inside the Lusail Stadium during a stadium tour on December 20, 2019, in Doha, Qatar. Francois Nel/Getty Images\n\nDescribing the conditions in the cell he shared with 24 other Nepali migrant workers, he says he was provided with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress on the floor he had to sleep on was riddled with bed bugs.\n\n“Inside the jail, there were people from Sri Lanka, Kerala (India), Pakistan, Sudan, Nepal, African, Philippines. There were around 14-15 units. In one jail, there were around 250-300 people. Around 24-25 people per room,” he says.\n\n“When they take you to the jail, they don’t give you a room right away. They keep you in a veranda. After a day or two, once a room is empty, they keep people from one country in one room.”\n\nUsing a smuggled phone, he spoke to friends, one of whom, he says, brought his belongings – including his passport – to the jail, though he says he was sent home after the Nepali embassy had sent a paper copy of his passport to the jail. CNN has reached out to the embassy but has yet to receive a response.\n\n“When they put me on the flight, I started thinking: ‘Why are they sending workers back all of a sudden? It’s not one, two, 10 people … they are sending 150, 200, 300 workers on one flight,’” he says.\n\n“Some workers who were just roaming outside wearing (work) dress were sent back. They don’t even allow you to collect your clothes. They just send you back in the cloth you are wearing.”\n\nKamal believes he was arrested because he had a second job, which is illegal under Qatar’s 2004 Labour Law and allows authorities to cancel a worker’s work permit. He says he worked an extra two to four hours a day to supplement his income as he was not making enough money working six eight-hour days a week.\n\nQatar has a 90-day grace period in which a worker can remain in the country legally without another sponsor, but if they have not had their permit renewed or reactivated in that time they risk being arrested or deported for being undocumented.\n\nHe says he received paperwork upon his arrest, which Amnesty International says would likely have explained why he was being detained, but as it was in Arabic he did not know what it said and no translator was provided.\n\nLaborers rest in green space along the corniche in Doha, Qatar, on June 23. Christopher Pike/Bloomberg/Getty Images/FILE\n\nA Qatari government official told CNN in a statement: “Any claims that workers are being jailed or deported without explanation are untrue. Action is only taken in very specific cases, such as if an individual participates in violence.”\n\nThe official added that 97% of all eligible workers were covered by Qatar’s Wage Protection System, established in 2018, “which ensures wages are paid in full and on time.” Further work was being done to strengthen the system, the official said.\n\nSome workers never returned home\n\nWith the opening match just days away, on-the-pitch matters are a mere footnote because this tournament has come at a cost to workers who left their families in the belief that they would reap financial rewards in one of the world’s richest countries per capita. Some would never return home. None of the three Nepali workers CNN spoke to were richer for their experience. Indeed, they are in debt and full of melancholy.\n\nThe Guardian reported last year that 6,500 South Asian migrant workers have died in Qatar since the country was awarded the World Cup in 2010, most of whom were involved in low-wage, dangerous labor, often undertaken in extreme heat.\n\nThe report did not connect all 6,500 deaths with World Cup infrastructure projects and has not been independently verified by CNN.\n\nHassan Al Thawadi – the man in charge of leading Qatar’s preparations – told CNN’s Becky Anderson that the Guardian’s 6,500 figure was a “sensational headline” that was misleading and that the report lacked context.\n\nA government official told CNN there had been three work-related deaths on stadiums and 37 non-work-related deaths. In a statement, the official said the Guardian’s figures were “inaccurate” and “wildly misleading.”\n\n“The 6,500 figure takes the number of all foreign worker deaths in the country over a 10-year period and attributes it to the World Cup,” the official said. “This is not true and neglects all other causes of death including illness, old age and traffic accidents. It also fails to recognize that only 20% of foreign workers in Qatar are employed on construction sites.”\n\nIt has been widely reported that Qatar has spent $220 billion leading up to the tournament, which would make it the most expensive World Cup in history, though this likely includes infrastructure not directly associated with stadium construction. A spokesperson for the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) which, since its formation in 2011, has been responsible for overseeing the infrastructure projects and planning for the World Cup, told CNN that the tournament budget was $6.5 billion, without expanding on what that cost covered.\n\nEight new stadiums rose from the desert, and the Gulf state expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, rail and highways. All would have been constructed by migrant workers, who – according to Amnesty International – account for 90% of the workforce in a near-three million population.\n\nAn aerial view of Al Janoub stadium at sunrise on June 21 in Al Wakrah, Qatar. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nSince 2010, migrant workers have faced delayed or unpaid wages, forced labor, long hours in hot weather, employer intimidation and an inability to leave their jobs because of the country’s sponsorship system, human rights organizations have found.\n\nHowever, the health, safety and dignity of “all workers employed on our projects has remained steadfast,” a statement from the SC read.\n\n“Our efforts have resulted in significant improvements in accommodation standards, health and safety regulations, grievance mechanisms, healthcare provision and reimbursements of illegal recruitment fees to workers.\n\n“While the journey is on-going, we are committed to delivering the legacy we promised. A legacy that improves lives and lays the foundation for fair, sustainable and lasting labour reforms.”\n\nLast year, in an interview with CNN Sport anchor Amanda Davies, FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that while “more needs to be done,” progress had been made.\n\n“I’ve seen the great evolution that has happened in Qatar, which was recognized – I mean not by FIFA – but by labor unions around the world, by international organizations,” said Infantino.\n\n‘It was difficult to breathe’\n\nWe are, unusually, writing about a World Cup in November because the competition had to be moved from its usual June-July slot to Qatar’s winter as the heat is so extreme in the country’s summer months – temperatures can reach around 43 degrees Celsius (109 degrees Fahrenheit) in June – that playing in such conditions could have posed a health risk to players.\n\nHari is 27 years old and, like many of his compatriots, left Nepal for Qatar as his family – he was one of five siblings with just his father at home – desperately needed money, primarily to eat. Since 2013, Nepal’s government-mandated minimum wage has been set at $74 a month, according to minimum-wage.org. He says that his monthly wage in Qatar was 700 Rial a month ($192).\n\nAfter moving to Qatar in 2014, he worked in four places during his four-year stay: at a supermarket, a hotel and airport, but the most difficult job, he says, was in construction when he had to carry tiles up buildings “six to seven stories above” in overbearing heat, plus lay pipelines in deep pits.\n\n“It was too hot,” he tells CNN. “The foreman was very demanding and used to complain a lot. The foreman used to threaten to reduce our salaries and overtime pay.\n\n“I had to carry tiles on my shoulder to the top. It was very difficult going up through the scaffolding. In the pipeline work, there were 5-7 meters deep pits, we had to lay the stones and concrete, it was difficult due to the heat. It was difficult to breathe. We had to come upstairs using a ladder to drink water.\n\n“It never happened to me, but I saw some workers fainting at work. I saw one Bengali, one Nepali … two to three people faint while working. They took the Bengali to medical services. I’m not sure what happened to him.”\n\nDuring his time in Qatar, government regulations generally prohibited workers from working outdoors between 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. from June 15 to August 31. He said one company he worked for followed these rules.\n\nHe added: “At some places, they didn’t have water. Some places, they didn’t provide us water on time. At some places, we used to go to houses nearby asking for water.”\n\nIn this photo taken in May 2015 during a government organized media tour, workers use heavy machinery at the Al-Wakra Stadium being built for the 2022 World Cup. Maya Alleruzzo/AP/FILE\n\nWorking long hours in extreme heat has, some non-governmental organizations believe, caused a number of deaths and put lives at risk in Qatar.\n\nIn 2019, research published in the Cardiology Journal, exploring the relationship between the deaths of more than 1,300 Nepali workers between 2009 and 2017 and heat exposure, found a “strong correlation” between heat stress and young workers dying of cardiovascular problems in the summer months.\n\nThe government official told CNN that there had been a “consistent decline” in the mortality rate of migrant workers, including a decline in heat stress disorders, “thanks in large part to our comprehensive heat stress legislation.”\n\n“Qatar has always acknowledged that work remains to be done, notably to hold unscrupulous employers to account,” the government official added. “Systemic reform does not happen overnight and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.”\n\n‘Heat does not typically injure on its own’\n\nNatasha Iskander, Professor of Urban Planning and Public Service at New York University, tells CNN that heat can kill “in ways that are confusing and unclear.”\n\n“Fatal heat stroke can look like a heart attack or a seizure. Sometimes, heat kills through the body, amplifying manageable and often silent conditions, like diabetes and hypertension, and turning them into sudden killers,” she explains.\n\n“As a result, Qatar, in the death certificates that it has issued after migrant construction workers have collapsed, has been able to push back against the correlation between heat stress and deaths and claim instead that the deaths are due to natural causes, even though the more proximate cause is work in the heat.”\n\nDetermining the number of workers injured by heat is even harder, she says, because many injuries may not become apparent until years later, when migrants have returned home and young men “find that their kidneys no longer function, that they suffer from chronic kidney disease, or that their hearts have begun to fail, displaying levels of cardiac weakness that are debilitating.”\n\n“Heat does not typically injure on its own,” she adds. “Workers are exposed to heat and heat dangers through the labor relations on Qatari worksites. The long hours, physically intense work, the forced overtime, the abusive conditions, the bullying on site all shape how exposed workers are to heat. Additionally, conditions beyond the worksite also augmented heat’s power to harm – things like poor sleep, insufficient nutrition or a room that was not cool enough to allow the body to reset after a day in the heat. In Qatar, the employer housed workers in labor camps, and workers as a matter of policy were segregated to industrial areas, where living accommodations were terrible.”\n\nForeign laborers working on the construction site of the Al-Wakrah football stadium, one of Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums, walk back to their accomodation at the Ezdan 40 compound after finishing work on May 4, 2015, in Doha's Al-Wakrah southern suburbs. Marwan Naamani/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, Qatari authorities have not investigated “thousands” of deaths of migrant workers over the past decade “despite evidence of links between premature deaths and unsafe working conditions.” That these deaths are not being recorded as work-related prevents families from receiving compensation, the advocacy group states.\n\nIn its statement, the SC said that its commitment to publicly disclose non-work-related deaths went beyond the requirements of the UK’s Health and Safety Executive Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences regulations (RIDDOR), which defines and provides classification for how to document work-related and non-work-related incidents.\n\nThe statement added: “The SC investigates all non-work-related deaths and work-related fatalities in line with our Incident Investigation Procedure to identify contributory factors and establish how they could have been prevented. This process involves evidence collection and analysis and witness interviews to establish the facts of the incident.”\n\nAmnesty International’s Ella Knight told CNN Sport that her organization would continue to push Qatar to “thoroughly investigate” deaths of migrant workers, including past deaths, to “ensure the families of the deceased have the opportunity to rebuild their lives.”\n\nBarun Ghimire is a human rights lawyer based in Kathmandu whose work focuses on the exploitation of Nepali migrants working abroad. He tells CNN that the families he advocates for have not received satisfactory information on their loved ones’ deaths. “Families send out healthy, young family member to work and they receive news that the family member died when they were sleeping,” he says. In a separate interview, he told CNN last year: “The Qatar World Cup is really the bloody cup – the blood of migrant workers.”\n\nLast year, Qatari legislation was strengthened regarding outdoor working conditions, expanding summertime working hours during which outdoor work is prohibited – replacing legislation introduced in 2007 – and additionally putting into law that “all work must stop if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) raises beyond 32.1C (89.8F) in a particular workplace.” The regulations also mandate annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments.\n\n“We recognize that heat stress is a particular issue in the summer months in Qatar,” a Qatari government official said. “In May 2021, Qatar introduced a requirement for companies to conduct annual health checks for workers, as well as mandatory risk assessments to mitigate the dangers of heat stress. Companies are expected to adopt flexible, self-monitored working hours where possible, adjust shift rotations, enforce regular breaks, provide free cold drinking water and shaded workspaces, and adhere to all other guidelines with respect to heat stress outlined by the Ministry of Labour.\n\n“Every summer, Qatar’s labor inspectors carry out thousands of unannounced visits to work sites across the country to ensure that heat stress rules are being followed,” the official added. “Between June and September 2022, 382 work sites were ordered to close for violating the rules.”\n\nWorkers walk to the Lusail Stadium -- one of the 2022 Qatar World Cup stadiums -- in Lusail on December 20, 2019. Hassan Ammar/AP\n\nIskander said a heat point of 32.1C WBGT was “already dangerous.”\n\n“Working at the physical intensity that construction workers do in Qatar for any amount of time at that temperature is damaging to the body,” she explained.\n\n“The regulation relied on the assumption that workers would be able to self-pace and rest as needed whenever they experienced heat stress. Anyone who has ever spent any amount of time on a Qatari construction site knows that workers have no ability to self-pace.”\n\nKnight adds: “The fact investigations into migrant workers deaths are often not happening precludes the possibility of greater protections being implemented because if you don’t know what is really happening to these people how can you then implement and enforce effective measures to increase their protection?”\n\nFor the majority of his time in Qatar, Hari said he felt sad. He would watch planes take off during his six months tending the airport gardens and question why he was in the country. But he had paid 90,000 Nepali rupees ($685) to a Nepali recruitment company that facilitated his move. He was also told, he says, by the company he had joined that he would have had to pay 2,000 to 3,000 Riyal ($549-$823) to buy himself out of his contract.\n\nHis friends, he said, counseled him as he continued to work long, lonely days for, Hari says, not enough money to live and save for his family. Amnesty International says many migrants pay high fees to “unscrupulous recruitment agents in their home country” which make the workers scared to leave their jobs when they get to Qatar.\n\nNow, he is a father-of-two, and work is plowing fields in Nepal as a tractor driver, but Hari hopes one day to work abroad again, his heart set on Malaysia. “I don’t want my children to go through what I did. I want to build a house, buy some land. That’s what I am thinking. But let’s see what God has planned,” he says.\n\n‘Our dreams never came true’\n\nSunit has been back in Nepal since August after working just eight months in Qatar. He had expected to be there for two years, but the collapse of the construction company he worked for meant he and many others returned with money still owed to them, he says. He struggles to find work in Nepal, meaning feeding his two children and paying school fees is difficult.\n\nHe had dreamed of watching World Cup matches from the rooftop of the hotel he had helped build. One of the stadiums – the name of which he does not know – was a 10-minute walk from the hotel. “We used to talk about it,” he says of the World Cup. “But we had to return, and our dreams never came true. The stadium activities were visible from the hotel. We could see the stadium from the hotel rooftop.”\n\nIn helping construct the city center hotel, the name of which he doesn’t remember, he would carry bags of plaster mix and cement, weighing from 30 to 50 kilos, on his shoulders up to 10 to 12 floors, he says.\n\n“The lift was rarely functional. Some people couldn’t carry it and dropped it halfway. If you don’t finish your job, you were threatened saying the salary would be deducted for that day,” he says. “The foreman used to complain that we were taking water breaks as soon as we got to work. They used to threaten us saying: ‘We will not pay you for the day.’ We said: ‘Go ahead. We are humans, we need to drink water.’\n\n“It was very hot. It used to take 1.5 to two hours to get to the top. I used to get tired. I used to stop on the way. Then proceed again slowly. Yes, the supervisors used to yell at us. But what could we do?”\n\nHe says he had paid an agent in Nepal 240,000 Nepali rupees (around $1,840) before leaving for Qatar. He says he has filed a case with the police about the agent as he had been unable to fulfill his two-year contract, but there have been no developments. He says the owners of the company he worked for in Qatar were arrested because they did not pay laborers. The company did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment, neither did it respond to questions from the Business & Human Rights Centre, an advocacy group, about protests over unpaid wages.\n\nQatar has expanded its airport, constructed new hotels, and rail and highways over the last decade. Britta Pedersen/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nFor a month, he says, he was in his accommodation with no work or money to buy food – he borrowed to eat – so he and his fellow workers called the police, who brought food with them.\n\n“The police came again after 10-15 days and said we have arrested the company people. (The police) distributed food again,” he says. “They told us the company has collapsed and the government will send all the workers back home.”\n\n“I’m extremely sad,” he adds. “I mean, it is what it is. Nothing would change by regretting it. I get mad (at the company) but what can I do? Even if I had tried to fight back, it would have been my loss.”\n\nThe SC said it has established what it claims is a “first-of-its-kind” Workers’ Welfare Forum, which it said allowed workers to elect a representative on their behalf and, when companies failed to comply with the WWF, it steps in, demands better and alerts the authorities.\n\nSince 2016, the SC said 69 contractors had been demobilized, 235 contractors placed on a watch list and a further seven blacklisted. “We understand there is always room for improvement,” the statement added.\n\n‘Expertise and heroism’\n\nQatar, a peninsula smaller than Connecticut and the smallest World Cup host in history, is set to host an estimated 1.5 million fans over the month-long tournament, which begins on November 20. There are already reports of accommodation concerns for such a vast number of visitors.\n\nThe spotlight is no doubt on this Gulf state, as has progressively been the case since it was controversially awarded the tournament over a decade ago – though Qatari officials have previously “strongly denied” to CNN the allegations of bribery which has surrounded its bid.\n\nSuch attention has brought about reforms, significantly dismantling the Kafala system which gives companies and private citizens control over migrant workers’ employment and immigration status.\n\nIn Qatar, migrant workers can now change jobs freely without permission from their employer. But Knight adds: “Another aspect of the Kafala system, the criminal charge of absconding still exists, and this, along with other tools that are still available to employers, means that, fundamentally, the power balance between workers and employers, the imbalance remains great.”\n\nKnight says unpaid wages is still an issue as the wage protection system “lacks enforcement mechanisms,” while she also says employers can cancel a worker’s ID at a “push of a button,” meaning they risk arrest and deportation. Additionally, labor committees intended to help workers are under-resourced and “lack the capacity to deal with the number of cases that are coming to them.”\n\nMigrant laborers work at a construction site at the Aspire Zone in Doha on March 26, 2016. Naseem Zeitoon/Reuters/FILE\n\nGhimire agrees that there have been a few positive changes to employment laws but adds that it is “more show and tell.”\n\n“Many workers who work in construction are untouched, so there’s still exploitation going on,” he tells CNN.\n\nQatar’s government official told CNN work remained to be done but that “systemic reform does not happen overnight, and shifting the behavior of every company takes time as is the case with any country around the world.\n\n“Over the last decade, Qatar has done more than any other country in the region to strengthen the rights of foreign workers, and we will continue to work in close consultation with international partners to strengthen reforms and enforcement.”\n\nHuman Rights Watch’s #PayUpFIFA campaign wants Qatar and FIFA to pay at least $440 million – an amount equal to the prize money being awarded at the World Cup – to the families of migrant workers who have been harmed or killed in preparation for the tournament.\n\nFamilies of workers who have died face uncertain futures, HRW says, especially children. Those who survived and returned home, cheated of wages or injured, remain trapped in debt, it says, “with dire consequences for their families.”\n\nGhimire says compensation is key, but so too is making the world aware of what has taken place to make this tournament happen.\n\n“People are concerned about clothing brands, and the meat they eat, but what about mega events? Isn’t it time we ask how this was possible?” he asks.\n\n“Everyone who will watch should know at what cost this was even possible and how workers were treated. Players should know, sponsors should know.\n\n“Would it be the same situation if it was European workers dying in Qatar? If it was Argentinean workers, would Argentina be concerned about playing?\n\n“Because it’s migrant workers from poor south Asian countries, they’re invisible people. Forced labor, death of workers, while making a World Cup is unacceptable. As a football fan, it makes me sad; as a lawyer, it makes me really disappointed.”\n\nEarlier this month, Qatar’s Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri rejected the prospect of a remedy fund.\n\nA Qatar government official said the country’s Workers’ Support and Insurance Fund was “effective in providing compensation for workers and their families” with the fund reimbursing workers with more than $350 million so far this year.\n\nIn terms of the SC’s efforts to ensure repayment of recruitment fees, as of December 2021, workers have received $22.6 million, with an additional $5.7 million committed by contractors, according to FIFA.\n\nLast month, FIFA’s Deputy Secretary General Alasdair Bell said “compensation is certainly something that we’re interested in progressing.”\n\nA general view shows the exterior of the Al-Thumama Stadium in Doha -- one of eight stadiums that will host World Cup matches KARIM JAAFAR/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nIt has been widely reported that FIFA has urged nations participating in the World Cup to focus on football when the tournament kicks off.\n\nFIFA confirmed to CNN that a letter signed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the governing body’s secretary general Fatma Samoura was sent out on November 3 to the 32 nations participating in the global showpiece but would not divulge the contents. However, a number of European federations have issued a joint statement saying they would campaign at the tournament on human rights and for a migrant workers center and a compensation fund for migrant workers.\n\nThe motto for Qatar’s bid team in 2010 was ‘Expect Amazing.’ In many ways, this year’s World Cup has replicated that maxim.\n\nAs NYU’s Iskander says: “One of the things that is not really covered in the coverage of the World Cup and the coverage of this enormous construction boom is the expertise and heroism of the workers who built it.\n\n“They built buildings that were unimaginable to everyone, including the engineers and designers, until they were built. They performed acts of bravery that are unsung. They operated at levels of technical complexity and sophistication that are unparalleled. And yet their contribution to building the World Cup is really rarely featured, downplayed.\n\n“They are represented, generally speaking, as exploited and oppressed. And it’s true that they have been exploited and oppressed, but they are also the master craftsmen that built this Cup, and they are enormously proud of what they have built.”\n\nHosting this tournament has undoubtedly put Qatar under the global spotlight. The question is whether the world can enjoy watching what the migrant workers built, knowing the true cost of this billion-dollar extravaganza.", "authors": ["Aimee Lewis Pramod Acharya Sugam Pokharel", "Aimee Lewis", "Pramod Acharya", "Sugam Pokharel"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/politics/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-ukraine/index.html", "title": "Exclusive: Musk's SpaceX says it can no longer pay for critical ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nSince they first started arriving in Ukraine last spring, the Starlink satellite internet terminals made by Elon Musk’s SpaceX have been a vital source of communication for Ukraine’s military, allowing it to fight and stay connected even as cellular phone and internet networks have been destroyed in its war with Russia.\n\nSo far roughly 20,000 Starlink satellite units have been donated to Ukraine, with Musk tweeting on Friday the “operation has cost SpaceX $80 million and will exceed $100 million by the end of the year.”\n\nBut those charitable contributions could be coming to an end, as SpaceX has warned the Pentagon that it may stop funding the service in Ukraine unless the US military kicks in tens of millions of dollars per month.\n\nDocuments obtained by CNN show that last month Musk’s SpaceX sent a letter to the Pentagon saying it can no longer continue to fund the Starlink service as it has. The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine’s government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n“We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” SpaceX’s director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military’s commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, “SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.”\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX’s own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk’s Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: “F*** off.”\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk’s claimed peace plan for Russia’s Ukraine war by saying: “F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.”\n\n“We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN’s reporting and Melnyk’s comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. “That has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,” said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “Starlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.”\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a “catastrophic” loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn’t dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX’s suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk’s allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he “still very much support[s] Ukraine” but fears “massive escalation.”\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn’t want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, “Russia would accept those terms,” according to a person who heard them.\n\n“Ukraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,” the person familiar with the discussions said. “The decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That’s Elon Musk. He hasn’t been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.”\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine’s infrastructure, Musk replied: “You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.”\n\n“The gall to look like heroes”\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it’s hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It’s not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Starlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,” said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “Without that they’d be really operating in the blind in many cases.”\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX’s request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has “the gall to look like heroes” while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid – or partially paid – for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units’ “exceptional utility” and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine’s new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, “The Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine’s armed forces as they repel Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.”\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level – $4,500 a month – to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink’s website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat’s just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n“You could say he’s trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‘I don’t want to be part of this anymore,’” said the person familiar with Ukraine’s requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk’s reputation for being unpredictable, “Feelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,” this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter – including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he’d made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called “The Weekend,” at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they’ve had recent victories.\n\n“This is the time to do it. They don’t want to do it, that’s for sure. But this is the time to do it,” he said, according to a person in the room. “Everyone wants to seek peace when they’re losing but they don’t want to seek peace when they’re winning. For now.”", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}]}

The bosses at Go As You Please said other casket concepts include the Doctor Who Tardis, a pint of Tennent’s Lager and a bottle of Bell’s whisky. “Most of our coffin designs come from having honest conversations with the person when they are still alive,” a boss told Sky News. “We’re not dealing with novelty, we’re dealing with individuality,” he added.\n\nCrocodile-headed dinosaurs roamed East Sussex\n\n“Fish-eating dinosaurs with crocodile heads roamed southern England 125 million years ago”, said The Telegraph.

For the dad who loves his backyard: The Solo Stove\n\nThe Solo Stove remains one of the most popular gifts our readers buy. If Dad loves a good fire, we recommend the Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0, a smokeless fire pit he can easily carry around his own yard or bring to others’. The Bonfire 2.0 comes with a free carrying case and removable ash pan (so he can clean it out easily).\n\n2. For the dad that loves Apple: Apple AirPods Pro (Gen 2)\n\nThe latest Apple AirPods are some of our favorite wireless earbuds ever, and the best if you have an iPhone. They offer excellent audio quality, noise cancelling, connectivity and much better battery life. If you want simple, no-nonsense earbuds that work for just about any use case, these are the ones to get.\n\n3. For the golf dad: Personalized golf balls\n\nYour dad won’t get these custom golf balls mixed up with his buddies' the next time he plays a round or two of golf, because his name will be on them! While you can buy the standard pack of golf balls on their own, you can also choose to add a personal touch by customizing the balls with a monogram or his name.\n\n4. For the dad who is serious about his car: Chemical Guys car buffer\n\nSome dads treat their cars like their children, so they'd likely appreciate a Chemical Guys car buffer from Amazon. The polisher will spruce up any paint job, remove nicks and scratches, clean headlights and keep your father's prized possession in tip-top shape. The winter can be especially tough on vehicles, so help your dad out ahead of Black Friday and get him something that'll protect what he loves.\n\n5. For the dad who loves pizza: Personalized Pizza Grilling Crate\n\nPizza out of a box is OK, but a gourmet, homemade pizza right off of your own hot grill or pizza oven is way better! The pizza-loving pop in your life will appreciate this Personalized Pizza Grilling Crate from Man Crates that is sure to satisfy everyone's appetite at Dad's next pizza night. The crate comes with a collapsible, stainless steel pizza peel that comes personalized with his name, four pizza grilling stones, a pizza cutter, a recipe booklet and a two-sided pizza roller. Plus, two pounds of artisanal dough and two ounces of pizza seasoning are included to get pizza night off to a delicious start.\n\n6.

The leakproof design features a high-performance zipper, high-density fabric and rubber foam insulation, which make this a cooler your dad will use for years to come.\n\n7.

It connects wirelessly to Nintendo Switch and PC and is perfect for playing old classics and new hits alike. It's even customizable.\n\n8. For the dad who doubles as the family handyman: Makita Cordless Drill Kit\n\nIf Dad is in need of a new drill, look no further: We tested popular cordless drills and then ranked them in a roundup of the best cordless drills you can buy. Pound for pound, the overall best for bigger jobs is the Makita FD07R1. The drill is powerful and features a short snub-nose that makes it easy to maneuver it in tight spots. It's lightweight, but the overall design feels high-quality despite the lack of heft. Most importantly, though, the Makita FD07R1 features a powerful motor that handles most tasks with ease.\n\n9. For the carnivore dad: ButcherBox\n\nAmong the best meat delivery services, ButcherBox stands out thanks to its commitment to ethically sourcing only grass-fed, organic high-quality cuts. Whether Dad prefers 100% grass-fed beef, heritage breed pork or free range organic chicken, he can find all—and plenty more—with a subscription to ButcherBox. Whether you treat him to a full-fledged subscription or shop from the vast selection of gift boxes, it's sure to be one gift that won't go to waste.\n\n10. For the dad who constantly needs his coffee: Yeti Rambler mug\n\nIt's dangerous to talk to many dads before they've had their morning coffee. The Yeti Rambler holds 24 ounces of hot drinks like coffee and tea but fares equally well with water and soda. It keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks warm for hours with its thick insulated walls.\n\n11. For the cozy dad: Casper Snoozewear blanket robe\n\nRelaxing takes on a whole new meaning with this inspired robe by sleep brand leader Casper. With the Casper Snoozewear blanket robe, dad can take the comfort of his bed with him from room to room. Its puffy design is built like a real duvet for optimal coziness. There are even convenient pockets to stash beer and snacks in. It's one of those \"how did I previously live without this?\" gifts for dad.\n\n12. For the outdoorsy fashionista: Dickies Insulated Eisenhower Jacket\n\nDickies' Insulated Eisenhower Jacket is slim and lightweight enough to layer over a pullover, but easily warm enough that it can be thrown over a shirt or button-down or dress up a T-shirt and jeans. It's practical, flexible, and outdoorsy enough that it'll work everywhere from backyard chores to soccer games, fishing trips and even dinner out.\n\n13. For eagle-eyed thermostat-watching dad: Google Nest Learning Thermostat\n\nDads all over the world have something in common: they don't want you touching the dang thermostat. Google Nest is our reviewer's favorite smart thermostat and perfect for dad to keep a lock on the temperature of any living space from a user-friendly smartphone app. It's incredibly intuitive to use even for dads who are less than tech savvy.\n\n14. For casual and formal affairs: Calvin Klein slim fit wool sport coat\n\nYou never know when your dad will have to crash a wedding recital or work party. This eye-catching blue houndstooth Calvin Klein sport coat goes with almost anything and adds a touch of class to even the most casual outfit. It's equally great for formal dinners with the boss or cozy dinner parties with friends.\n\n15. For the dad who needs a massage ASAP: Theragun Elite\n\nIf he doesn't like going to a spa for a massage or needs one on the fly after showing off at the gym, Dad can get one that's (almost) just as good at home. All he needs is the very trendy Theragun. One of our staff members put the handheld massager to the test and liked that it was powerful (perfect for kneading out knots) and could get to even the hardest-to-reach spots.\n\n16. For dads who love tech accessories: Apple Watch Series 8\n\nNothing completes a showstopping outfit like a good accessory. And while a Rolex is nice to have, it doesn't come with a built-in heart rate monitor. Our reviewers crowned the Apple Watch Series 8 as the best smartwatch on the market right now because of its fantastic build quality, QWERTY keyboard and crash-detection capabilities.\n\n17. For the dad who's a coffee connoisseur: Counter Culture\n\nFor the dad who doesn't care for an average blonde (roast)—make his day and every day with coffee from Counter Culture. We dubbed it the best coffee subscription service because the beans are some of the freshest and highest quality you can find, and there's an incredible selection of flavors and roasts to choose from.\n\n18. For homebrewing dads: Mr. Beer Premium Gold Edition kit\n\nMaking your own brand of beer is one of the most rewarding things you can do even if it is a little daunting.

It comes with everything including an attractive plastic fermenter, bottles and all the ingredients to make a case-worth of golden ale.\n\n19. For pit master dads: MasterBuilt Gravity Series 800 Digital Charcoal Griddle, Grill and Smoker\n\nHow many grills out there do you know can smoke pork shoulder as well as make a perfect stack of pancakes? The MasterBuilt Gravity Series 800 is not simply a grill and smoker, but a wide, open griddle that would make Spongebob Squarepants blush. It's powered by the power of gravity, providing more versatility and usability than any overrated pellet smoker.\n\n20. For the dad who likes to layer: Jos. A. Bank Merino Wool Sweater\n\nKeep dad looking sharp in this 100% merino wool sweater, available in sizes small to XL and five lovely colors, including Wine and Rust that are perfect for fall and winter outfits.

For the dad with the messy desktop: Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock\n\nHave you peeped dad's workstation? If it's festooned with knotted cables this is one of the best gifts to give them. Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock is great for gathering all USB connections to a PC or laptop in one place, whether dad uses a PC or a Mac. There's even an easy-access SD card slot.\n\n22. For the dad who swears he's related to royalty: AncestryDNA\n\nIs he really Prince William's long-lost second cousin? Probably not—but he can find out who he is related to, along with other fascinating genetic and family info, with a home DNA kit. AncestryDNA is one of the most well-known (and most popular) ones available because it's very detailed and all he'll need to get started is a simple saliva sample.\n\n23. For the dad who needs comfy footwear: New Balance 574\n\nThe New Balance 574 is the brand’s signature style that’s meant for anyone—but dads can benefit from owning a pair thanks to their rugged yet durable materials and foam cushioning that ups their comfort level, providing all-day support. We've even dubbed it one of the best items you can buy from New Balance.\n\n24. For rugged and stylish dads: Carhartt beanie\n\nLike Ugg boots, Carhartt beanies are popular for a reason. Not only are these simple beanies perfect for keeping warm in colder months but they come in tons of colors to suit any aesthetic. These beanies are so inexpensive that you can own a few different styles to suit any occasion.\n\n25. For a Father's Day picnic: Slate serving board with artisan cheeses\n\nDads love cheese, that's just a fact of life.

For the bookworm dad: Kindle Paperwhite\n\nWhy give Dad one book when you could give him thousands? After all, that's what he'll have access to with the Kindle Paperwhite. It's our favorite Kindle because it has the most storage space of all the models, an automatic light sensor for easy reading and a waterproof exterior.\n\n27. For gaming historians: Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration\n\nBefore Nintendo became a household name, Atari introduced the concept of the video game to audiences worldwide. This game isn't simply a collection of more than 100 classic Atari titles from its home consoles and arcade cabinets. It's a full-blown historical retrospective that also includes tons of trivia, interviews with Atari big wigs and interactive timelines.\n\n28. For the dad who appreciates a perfectly-cooked steak: ThermoWorks Digital Meat Thermometer\n\nThere's nothing more disappointing than overcooking meat, and as much as your dad might think he can pull off a perfect medium-rare without the help of a thermometer, there's no substitute for immediate precision. We've tested the best digital meat thermometers, and this affordable thermometer from ThermoWorks won us over with its rotating display and three-second readout time.\n\n29. For the dad with a home gym: Tempo\n\nWe have the perfect present for dads who want a personalized fitness routine without leaving their living room.

Its AI-powered coaching feature set it apart from the rest, in addition to great strength training, fun classes and motivational instructors.\n\n30. For dads who love to binge-watch: Roku Ultra 4802R\n\nAs far as streaming devices go, Roku Ultra 4802R is unmatched when it comes to speed and usability. It's got voice controls on par with the likes of Siri and Alexa to control everything from switching channels to adjusting volume.

It's not just a great way to stream, it's our pick for the overall best streaming device on the market right now.\n\n31.

For a heartfelt memoir: “Comedy Comedy Comedy Drama: A Memoir” by Bob Odenkirk\n\nBob Odenkirk is one of Hollywood's quadruple threats.

For the dad who is serious about sound quality: Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise-Canceling Headphones\n\nDad may love listening to his favorite jams—but the rest of the family, likely, does not. That’s why he needs a pair of noise-canceling headphones like one of our favorite ones from Sony. We found them to be very comfortable and incredible at blocking noise. Plus, thanks to their customizable Headphones Connect app, he can EQ the sound to his own preference, whether he likes balance, or if he's all about the bass.\n\n34.

For the dad who lives in hoodies: A Carhartt hoodie\n\nHoodies are essential to any man's closet and look good on any dad bod. Dads love them because they're casual, comfortable and easy to wear for weekend projects. Carhartt is known for its durability, and its loose-fit hooded sweatshirt is no exception. It's made from a midweight cotton blend for everyday comfort, comes in a variety of colors and is the perfect choice to wear while playing with the kids.\n\n42. For the dad who just likes to chill: Gravity Weighted Blanket\n\nFrom fixing things around the house to taking off the training wheels for the little ones, dads have a lot to do around the house—so when they need to decompress, a weighted blanket can help. Of all the ones we've tested, we like the Gravity Blanket the best because it's super soft to the touch and provides just the right amount of pressure to be comforting but not suffocating.\n\n43. For igniting a new passion for grilling: recteq RT-B380\n\nIf dad's backyard grill is gathering dust and rust, the recteq may inspire a new love for BBQ. Not all pellet grills are big and wide—some of them are built similarly to a classic Weber, like the recteq RT-B380. Despite its squat stature, its versatility cannot be undersold as it disperses both low and slow and jet engine heat equally well. It accommodates tons of food on its wide cooktop, can run for up to 15 hours non-stop and even comes with a built-in probe thermometer.\n\n44.

For a knife that slays: Dalstrong Shadow Black meat cleaver\n\nA good knife can last a lifetime and offer the dependability you'd only expect out of an old Volvo. The Dalstrong Shadow Black meat cleaver packs a powerful seven-inch blade that dispatches meat, veggies and everything in between quickly and easily. A black titanium nitride coating doesn't simply make this knife look cool, it gives it a non-stick edge complete with corrosion resistance.\n\n47.

It features GPS integration and a comfortable design—plus improved battery life and a brighter display compared to the earlier model.\n\n48. For the dad who likes to cook: A cast-iron skillet\n\nFor a dad who likes to cook, a cast-iron skillet is essential.

Help him out with a personalized toiletry bag from Minted. The cotton bag is made with a water-repellant lining, with leather accents including a zipper pull and name tag, which you can have embossed with your dad's name free of charge. If this pattern isn't his style, there's plenty of other options to choose from as well.\n\n51. For the practical dad: Bombas socks\n\nNever underestimate the value of a good pair of socks. Dad — and his feet — will be more than happy with these ones from Bombas, the highly talked-about brand that's known for its comfortable (and colorful) socks. The best part? For every pair purchased, another pair is donated to someone in need.\n\n52. For couch potatoes: CouchConsole\n\nFor streamers, watchers and gamers there's no better accessory than the CouchConsole.

The cup holder is self-balancing so beer and soda won't spill no matter how tense the action on TV gets. For a limited time, you can apply a coupon and save an additional $10 at checkout.\n\n53. For the dad with a home office: Logitech Wireless Keyboard and Mouse\n\nComfort is key when it comes to setting up an office at home.

For the dad who loves pizza: Hans Grill Pizza Steel PRO with peel\n\nSoapstone is so last century. Stainless steel is far better at providing the massive amounts of heat that good pizza needs, which makes for crispier crusts and consistent browning from base to crust. This pizza steel also comes with a peel to safely deposit your pizza to and fro the oven. It's also great for baking bread and stores conveniently in the bottom rack of your oven. It normally runs for $100 but you can get 25% off the price.\n\n57. For the dad who trains hard: Fight Camp\n\nDoes your dad think he \"could have been a contender\"?

For the classy dad: Whiskey Decanter Set\n\nWhiskey just hits different when it's poured from a vintage-style decanter instead of the bottle — and Dad knows that, so he'll be excited to break out this gift the next time he has his buddies over for a glass (or two) of scotch. The top-rated set is made from handcrafted glass and is as sturdy and durable as it is luxe and distinguished.\n\n61. For the dad who likes a little heat: Hot Sauce sampler\n\nWe all know them: Dads who try to impress us with their tolerance for spicy foods. They shout repeated cries of \"Do you have something other than Tabasco?\" Feed their appetite for heat with this sampler pack of seven different hot sauces from The Good Hurt Fuego.

The Echo Show 8 provides a compact design with the bonus of a screen. It's the next level up from the Dot. The small screen makes it easy to see timers, get news updates and make video calls.\n\n65. For the dad who believes beer should always be ice cold: Cooling pint glasses\n\n\"Pass me a warm beer,\" said no man ever. That's why Dad needs a set of these insulated pint glasses. The insulated plastic walls of the glasses are filled with a cooling gel, which works as a beer chiller when frozen. Pop them in the freezer for two hours to chill the tumbler gel and Dad's beer(s) will stay frosty for hours.\n\n66. For the dad who wants to binge his favorite TV shows: Roku Ultra\n\nWe tested several streaming boxes and streaming sticks in our quest to find the best streaming devices, and the Roku Ultra stood above the competition as the overall best device money can buy. With the Roku Ultra, Dad will be free to stream his favorite shows and movies in 4K and HDR. We love Roku's easy-to-use platform, and the remote control is by far the easiest to use of all the devices we tested, which means you won't waste any precious time showing him how to use it.\n\n67. For the dad who enjoys fine spirits: Top shelf premium liquor\n\nReserveBar makes gifting alcohol a breeze, without having to make a trip to the liquor store. If he's a fan of Scotch whiskey, he'll be a fan of The Glenlivet 14. This smooth, rich Scotch contains notes of citrus with sweet and fruity aromas. Honey, apricot, pear and chocolate round out the intense and rich flavors of this single-malt whiskey. If he prefers tequila, Avión Reserva Cristalino is distilled from hand-selected agaves and is about as smooth as it gets.\n\n68. For the dad who likes to take a hike: Hiking shoes\n\nTell Dad to \"take a hike\" when you gift him a pair of premium Huckberry hiking shoes.

The UK economy will feel ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nFor years, home ownership in Britain has been a one-way bet. Prices have climbed steadily since the global financial crisis, rising in even larger increments after the pandemic began.\n\nFueled by a post-lockdown buying frenzy, the average UK house price hit a record £275,000 ($315,474) in December, a £27,000 increase on the previous year’s high. People buying houses for the first time benefited from cuts to taxes on their purchases and even though homes were more expensive, rock-bottom mortgage rates kept monthly payments affordable.\n\nPrices have risen every year since 2012, when they dropped by 1.1%, according to data from Nationwide, a major mortgage lender. Now, that boom is over.\n\nIt was already fading well before Liz Truss and Kwasi Kwarteng blew up the UK bond market and sent borrowing costs through the roof. But the financial market turmoil sparked by the former prime minister and her then finance minister’s plans for unfunded tax cuts made matters much worse.\n\nThe sharp and sudden increase in mortgage rates that followed has made it much more expensive to buy a house, leading some forecasters to predict a 10%-15% plunge in prices over the next year or so.\n\nThe UK's former finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng and former Prime Minister Liz Truss at the Conservative Party conference on October 02, 2022 in Birmingham, England. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nEven though most of Truss’ tax cuts have been ditched by new finance minister Jeremy Hunt and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, calming bond markets, the era of cheap debt that helped drive house prices ever higher is coming to an an end.\n\nOn Thursday, the Bank of England increased its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point — it’s biggest hike in 33 years — taking it to 3% from near zero at the end of last year. That’s the highest level since November 2008.\n\nThat will keep mortgage rates elevated, even if not at their current inflated levels.\n\n“I think all that can happen in the short term is that we go back to where we were at the end of August,” said Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at broker Knight Frank. “There’s a bigger, wider psychological shift that has to take place after 13 years of ultra-low borrowing costs and the housing market readjusting to mortgage rates that are not below 1% or 2%.”\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nUK mortgage rates have been ticking upwards since spring, in line with rising interest rates. But Truss and Kwarteng’s “mini” budget of Sept. 23 kicked those increases into overdrive.\n\n“The mini budget added a whole percentage point onto mortgage rates,” said Richard Donnell, executive director of research at online property portal Zoopla.\n\nThe promise of sweeping tax cuts but no plan to pay for them caused a bond market rout that pushed up borrowing costs for lenders. “The biggest immediate impact was the accelerated pace of change in mortgage rates,” said David Hollingworth, associate director of communications at broker L&C Mortgages.\n\nWithin days, lenders pulled over 1,500 products and more than half have still not returned to the market, according to financial product comparison website Moneyfacts.\n\nEven though Kwarteng and Truss are out, along with most of their tax cuts, mortgage rates have still not fallen back to where they were before the pair unveiled their doomed economic plan.\n\nThe “mini” budget added a whole percentage point onto mortgage rates.” Richard Donnell, executive director of research at Zoopla\n\nAverage two-year and five-year fixed rates stood at 6.47% and 6.32% on Tuesday, levels not seen since 2008. That compares with around 4.75% before the “mini” budget, according to Moneyfacts.\n\nFor a typical borrower, with a mortgage worth 70% of the price of their home, that would increase monthly repayments by £500 ($574), according to Donnell.\n\nThe dramatic rates reset has seen some homeowners spend thousands of pounds to refinance early for fear that rates could climb higher still.\n\nKaram Heer, a tax adviser based in London, decided to refinance his two-year fixed mortgage a year earlier than planned, taking his rate from 1.75% to 3.57%. That will cost him an extra £375 ($424) a month until January 2028.\n\n“We haven’t had a choice really,” he said. Even though it cost him £4,500 ($5,162) to switch deals early, Heer wanted the certainty of a fixed rate because, as he told CNN Business, “I have absolutely no clue what’s going to happen with interest rates.”\n\nTudor Nanu and his wife, who bought a house in February, are considering doing the same. The health care workers in southeast England are preparing to take a £6,000 charge ($6,883) to refinance early at a rate almost double what they had been paying. The higher rate would cost them an extra £500 ($574) a month, on top of the one-off refinancing hit.\n\nHomes are pictured in south London, on October 3, 2022. Niklas Halle'n/AFP/Getty Images\n\nGovernment bond yields fell back in October and swap rates — a gauge of bank funding costs that are used to price mortgage rates -— are also falling. That means mortgage rates are likely to come down in the next few weeks.\n\nStill, there’s no returning to the “ultra-low levels of recent years,” said Donnell, who thinks mortgage rates of 4% to 5% will become the new norm.\n\nThat will come as a shock to millions of homeowners who bought houses when rates were much lower. According to Bill at Knight Frank, more than 4 million mortgages have been issued to first-time buyers since 2009 when rates “hit the floor.”\n\n“So there’s a lot of people out there who don’t appreciate what it’s like when their monthly outgoings rise,” he told CNN Business.\n\nAs many as 1.8 million borrowers on fixed-rate mortgages will have to refinance next year, according to the Resolution Foundation, a think tank. Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst at research firm BuiltPlace, estimates that about 300,000 fixed-rate deals will come to an end between October and December.\n\n“As more buyers come up against the reality of monthly mortgage bills rising by hundreds of pounds, the financial pain will spread through the housing market,” Bill added.\n\nHouse price falls ‘inevitable’\n\nSigns of a slowdown are already starting to emerge, as banks take a more cautious approach to lending and aspirant home buyers delay purchases in the face of much higher borrowing costs.\n\nUK house prices fell 0.9% between September and October, the first decline in 15 months, according to data from Nationwide. The average house now costs £268,282 ($309,396).\n\nMortgage approvals also declined to 66,800 in September, from 74,400 in August, data published Monday by the Bank of England showed.\n\nZoopla’s Donnell said demand from new buyers has fallen 30% since the Truss budget. “Straight after the mini budget there was a scrabble to do deals, now sales are still happening but at a 20% lower run rate than they would be normally,” he said.\n\nA member of the public looks at residential properties displayed for sale in the window of an estate agents' in London on September 30, 2022. Isabel Infantes/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAlan Edwards, a local government worker from the north of England, was about to start house hunting, hoping to buy early next year, until the mini budget caused mortgage rates to spike.\n\n“I can’t see that happening now,” he told CNN Business. Edwards expected rates to rise over the next few months, but not “this fast this quickly,” he said. “We’ve really got to pay attention to the government now because they can drive our costs up by having a bad week of their own making.”\n\nThose who do buy won’t be able to borrow as much, which will knock prices. Take, for example, someone who a year ago could afford to put £1,500 ($1,700) a month towards a 25-year mortgage. At an interest rate of 1.75%, the low reached in September 2021, that person could have borrowed £378,000 ($433,000). Today, at an interest rate of 5.5%, the monthly payment is enough only for a £244,500 ($280,000) mortgage.\n\nA drop in buying power makes a significant drop in house prices inevitable, according to Andrew Wishart, a senior economist at Capital Economics. The consultancy expects prices to fall between 10% and 15% between now and 2024. Credit Suisse has made a similar projection.\n\nThat’s a wider problem for the UK economy, given that 36% of household wealth is tied up in property, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. When house prices fall, homeowners feel less confident about their personal finances, causing them to cut back on spending and hold off on making additional investments.\n\nHomeowners may already be shoring up their finances, saving more in anticipation of higher mortgage payments. Households deposited an additional £8.1 billion ($9.3 billion) with banks and building societies last month, compared with £3.2 billion ($3.7 billion) in August, the biggest increase since June 2021, according to Bank of England data.\n\nEven if house price declines simply take prices back to where they were before the pandemic-induced buying spree, it will still hit the UK economy hard, because many sectors of the economy, from financial services and construction to moving companies and furniture stores, rely on a strong and active housing market.\n\nAnalysis by Knight Frank and the British Property Federation in 2020 found that for every 100,000 housing transactions involving existing homes, the UK economy benefited to the tune of almost £1 billion ($1.14 billion).\n\n“Higher debt payments, falling property prices and a slump in construction will play a major role in dragging the economy into recession,” Wishart said.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban Hanna Ziady", "Anna Cooban", "Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/11/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/28/economy/house-prices-uk-economy/index.html", "title": "UK house prices could plunge 15% because of soaring mortgage ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nHouse prices in the United Kingdom could plummet by as much as 15% if the country presses ahead with its tax-slashing economic gamble.\n\nCredit Suisse (AMJL) said on Tuesday that UK house prices could “easily” fall between 10% and 15% over the next 18 months if the Bank of England aggressively hikes interest rates to keep inflation in check.\n\n“Once all the rate rises feed through, mortgage debt affordability deteriorates to the same level as the pre [global financial crisis] peak,” Credit Suisse research analysts wrote.\n\nUK finance minister Kwasi Kwarteng last week announced the biggest set of tax cuts in 50 years and a massive increase in government borrowing. The news sent the value of the pound plunging to a record low against the US dollar and UK government bond prices crashing.\n\nSome analysts now expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates to 6% next year, up from its current 2.25%, to prop up the ailing currency. The central bank announced emergency bond buying on Wednesday to try to restore market calm.\n\nThe fallout could make it harder for people to get approved for mortgages, and encourage prospective buyers to delay their purchases. A drop in demand would lead to falling prices.\n\nSince Friday, several lenders have withdrawn hundreds of mortgage products in response to the turmoil.\n\nCapital Economics, which likewise forecasts a drop in house prices of between 10% and 15%, warned the slump could be “devastating.”\n\n“The resulting drop in buying power makes a significant drop in house prices inevitable,” Andrew Wishart, senior economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note on Tuesday.\n\nWishart said that a 6% interest rate would reduce the maximum mortgage a typical first-time buyer with an annual income of £55,000 ($59,000) could secure by 26% to £203,000 ($217,000).\n\n“A surge in UK home values over the pandemic and the rise of mortgage rates means we face a sizable hit to household buying power over the rest of 2022 and into 2023,” Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, a real estate provider, told CNN Business on Wednesday.\n\nThat’s a wider problem for the economy given that 36% of household wealth is held in property, data from the Office for National Statistics shows.\n\nRisk of defaults\n\nMillions of mortgage borrowers are steeling themselves for a nasty hike to their monthly payments as a result of higher-than-expected interest rates, which were already forecast to rise over the coming months.\n\nAt a 6% base rate, a person refinancing a 20-year fixed-rate mortgage of £146,000 ($157,000) — the average outstanding balance on a residential mortgage in the UK — can expect to pay an extra £309 ($333) per month, Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell, told CNN Business on Tuesday.\n\nThat’s £108 ($116) more than the investment firm estimated before this week’s market crash.\n\nAbout 1.8 million people are due to refinance next year, according to the Resolution Foundation.\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a Tuesday report that sharp increases to monthly payments could spark a wave of mortgage defaults, with consequences for the country’s banking sector.\n\n“Mortgage arrears and default would rise just as house prices likely would be tumbling, placing huge strain on banks’ balance sheets,” Tombs said.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/23/business/global-house-price-slump/index.html", "title": "A house price slump is coming. Rising unemployment could make it ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nLast year, Auckland’s largest real estate company couldn’t sell properties quickly enough to meet demand in New Zealand’s biggest city.\n\nHouses were “flying out the door,” said Grant Sykes, a manager at real estate agency Barfoot & Thompson. “There were chin-dropping moments when agents stand around the room and are gobsmacked at the prices being achieved,” he told CNN Business.\n\nIn one example, a property sold for 1 million New Zealand dollars ($610,000) above the asking price in an auction that lasted all of eight minutes. (Most homes in New Zealand are sold at auction.)\n\nThat was in May 2021, when sales attracted thousands of bidders who drove prices ever higher. Since then, Barfoot & Thompson’s clearance rate at auction has plummeted, according to Sykes, prolonging sales times and sending prices lower.\n\nThe time it takes to sell a property in New Zealand has increased by around 10 days on average since October 2021, according to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand. Sales have plunged nearly 35% and median house prices are down 7.5% over the past year.\n\nHouses in the suburb of Devonport across from the central business district of Auckland, New Zealand. Brendon O'Hagan/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nNew Zealand is at the sharp end of a global housing market squeeze that has grim ramifications for the world economy.\n\nThe pandemic boom, which sent prices into the stratosphere, is running out of steam and house prices now are falling from Canada to China, setting the stage for the broadest housing market slowdown since the global financial crisis.\n\nRising interest rates are driving the dramatic change. Central banks on a warpath against inflation have taken rates to levels not seen for more than a decade, with ripple effects on the cost of borrowing.\n\nUS mortgage rates topped 7% last month for the first time since 2002, up from just over 3% a year ago, before pulling back slightly in November as inflation eased. In the European Union and United Kingdom, mortgage rates have more than doubled since last year, chasing would-be buyers from the market.\n\n“Overall, this is the most worrying housing market outlook since 2007-2008, with markets poised between the prospect of modest declines and much steeper ones of 15%-20%,” said Adam Slater, a lead economist at Oxford Economics, a consultancy.\n\nOne key factor determining how low prices go? Unemployment. A sharp increase in joblessness could lead to forced sales and foreclosures, “where steep discounts are common,” according to Slater.\n\nBut even if the correction in prices is mild, a housing market slowdown could have severe consequences because housing transactions in turn boost activity in other sectors of the economy.\n\n“In an ideal world, you’ll get a bit of froth blown off the top [of house prices] and everything is fine. It isn’t impossible, but it’s more likely that housing downturns come with nastier consequences,” Slater told CNN Business.\n\nWarning signs\n\nHouse prices are already falling in more than half of the 18 advanced economies that Oxford Economics tracks, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Australia and Canada, where prices dropped by around 7% from February to August.\n\n“Data lags probably mean that most markets are now seeing falling prices,” said Slater. “We’re in the early period in quite a clear downturn now and the only real question is how steep and how long it’s going to be.”\n\nHouse prices in the United States — which rose during the pandemic by the most since the 1970s — are falling too. Economists at Goldman Sachs expect a decline of around 5%-10% from the peak reached in June through to March 2024.\n\nIn a “pessimistic” scenario, US prices could plunge as much as 20%, Dallas Fed economist Enrique Martinez-Garcia wrote in a blog post recently.\n\nPrices for new homes in China fell at the fastest pace in over seven years in October, according to official figures, reflecting a deepening property market slump that has gripped the country for months and is weighing heavily on its economy. Home sales have fallen by 43% this year, according to China Index Academy, a research firm.\n\nSales are sliding elsewhere too, as banks take a more cautious approach to lending and aspiring homebuyers delay purchases in the face of much higher borrowing costs and a deteriorating economic outlook.\n\nHouse sales in Britain were 32% below the previous year’s level in September, according to official figures. A closely watched survey showed that new buyer inquiries fell for the sixth successive month in October to the lowest level since 2008, excluding the early months of 2020 when the market was largely shut because of the pandemic.\n\nIn the United States, sales of existing homes were down by more than 28% year-over-year in October, the ninth consecutive monthly decline, according to the National Association of Realtors.\n\nMortgage rates in 25 major cities around the world tracked by UBS have almost doubled on average since last year, making house purchases much less affordable.\n\n“A skilled service sector worker can afford roughly one-third less housing space than before the pandemic,” according to the UBS Global Real Estate Bubble Index.\n\nAn estate agent's 'for sale' board is pictured on a house at the end of a row of terraced homes in northern England on November 2, 2022. Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs well as putting off new buyers, the sharp increase in rates has shocked existing homeowners accustomed to more than a decade of ultra-low borrowing costs.\n\nIn Britain, more than 4 million mortgages have been issued to first-time buyers since 2009, when rates were near zero. “There’s a lot of people out there who don’t appreciate what it’s like when their monthly outgoings rise,” said Tom Bill, head of UK residential research at broker Knight Frank.\n\nIn countries with a larger share of variable rate mortgages, such as Sweden and Australia, the shock will be immediate and could increase the risk of forced sales that drive prices down faster.\n\nBut even in places where a large proportion of mortgages are fixed, such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom, the average maturity of these mortgages is quite short.\n\n“This means much more debt will be subject to (often significantly) higher rates over the next year or so than might first appear to be the case,” Slater wrote in a report last month.\n\nJobs are key\n\nWhile interest rates have been the catalyst for the housing market slowdown, the jobs market will play a bigger role in determining how low prices ultimately plunge.\n\nModeling of past house price crashes by Oxford Economics shows that employment is the decisive factor in determining the severity of a downturn, because a spike in joblessness raises the number of forced sellers.\n\n“History shows that if labor markets can remain strong, then the chances of a more benign correction are higher,” according to Innes McFee, chief global economist at Oxford Economics.\n\nEmployment levels in many advanced economies have recovered since falling at the start of the pandemic. But there are early signs that labor markets are starting to cool as weak economic growth hits demand for workers.\n\nA decisive increase in unemployment is a very big danger for housing markets.” Adam Slater, Oxford Economics\n\nAfter recovering strongly at the beginning of the year, the number of hours worked was 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter, amounting to a deficit of 40 million full-time jobs, according to estimates by the International Labour Organization.\n\n“The outlook for global labour markets has worsened in recent months and on current trends job vacancies will decline and global employment growth will deteriorate significantly in the final quarter of 2022,” the ILO said in an October report.\n\nThe unemployment rate in the United States ticked upwards in October to 3.7%. In the United Kingdom, job vacancies have fallen to the lowest level in a year. The UK Office for Budget Responsibility expects unemployment to rise by 505,000 to a peak of 1.7 million — an unemployment rate of 4.9% -— in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n“A decisive increase in unemployment is a very big danger for housing markets,” said Slater of Oxford Economics.\n\nA pedestrian passes unfinished apartment buildings at the West Bund Park residential project in Shanghai, China, on Jan. 14, 2022. Qilai Shen/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA drag on the economy\n\nMost market watchers are not expecting a repeat of the 2008 housing market crash. Banks and households are in better financial shape, and housing supply in some countries remains tight.\n\nBut even a modest a fall in house prices will knock confidence, causing homeowners to cut back on spending.\n\nA slowdown in activity will also deal a blow to many other parts of the economy because of the housing market’s links to builders, lawyers, banks, moving companies and furniture stores, to name a few.\n\nChina’s property market accounts for about 28-30% of GDP because of these linkages. In the United States, housing’s broader contribution to GDP generally averages 15-18%, according to the National Association of Home Builders.\n\nIn a worst-case scenario — one in which house prices fall more sharply than anticipated and price declines are met with a slump in residential investment and tighter lending by banks — Oxford Economics forecasts that world GDP will expand by just 0.3% in 2023, rather than the 1.5% it currently expects.\n\n“An additional negative factor, compared to the [global financial crisis], is that the Chinese housing market is also in a downturn,” according to Slater. “So rather than offsetting the impact on world output of a global housing downturn, as was the case after the GFC, the Chinese housing sector is contributing to the slump.”\n\n— Laura He contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/11/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/19/energy/energy-prices-uk-europe-explainer/index.html", "title": "Why UK energy prices are rising much faster than in Europe | CNN ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nMillions of people in the United Kingdom are steeling themselves for colossal rises to their energy bills over the next few months, a coda to a year already marked by record price increases.\n\nThe crisis is not unique to the country. Prices have shot up across Europe since last fall, driven by a spike in demand as countries lifted pandemic lockdowns. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, and the subsequent drop in Moscow’s oil and natural gas exports to Europe, have pushed prices even higher.\n\nBut UK energy prices are now higher than in comparable economies like France and Italy, analysts told CNN Business. And Brits have suffered much bigger price increases than in most European countries, including Germany, where decades of energy policy has been turned on its head by the Ukraine war.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said this week that UK natural gas prices rose nearly 96% in the year to July, while electricity prices are up 54%.\n\nAnnual consumer price inflation for gas and electricity in the United Kingdom is forecast to soar to an average of around 80% this year, compared to an average of 40% across the 19 countries that use the euro, analysis from Deutsche Bank shows.\n\nThe worst is yet to come. Average annual energy bills could exceed £4,000 ($4,820) from January, and £5,000 ($6,000) later in the spring, up from about £2,000 ($2,400) currently. Millions could be forced into poverty as a consequence. Leaders of the UK National Health Service warned Friday of a “humanitarian crisis.” Many people could fall sick this winter as they “face the awful choice between skipping meals to heat their homes and having to live in in cold, damp and very unpleasant conditions,” they said.\n\nOverall UK inflation exceeded 10% in July, compared with 8.9% in the eurozone. Unlike other problems in the UK economy, Brexit doesn’t appear to be a major factor. So why are British energy bills rising so much faster than across much of Europe?\n\nA broken market\n\nAs wholesale costs ballooned last year, 31 smaller UK energy companies — who traditionally offered competitive prices — went bust, forcing millions of customers onto the books of bigger suppliers, and to pay higher bills.\n\nThe way the British government designed the energy market made this more likely, Henning Gloystein, director of energy, climate and resources at Eurasia Group, told CNN Business. Smaller companies were acting like brokers rather than providers of an essential utility.\n\n“Many UK retail energy providers weren’t real energy producers. Instead, they bought electricity and gas in the wholesale market and then sold it on to retail customers like households,” Gloystein said.\n\nThat meant that as soon as wholesale costs increased far above what suppliers could legally charge, they went bankrupt.\n\nEurope operates in a different way. Most countries have tighter regulations on suppliers, Gloystein said, including rules designed to shield them from sudden price spikes.\n\nThe prices UK households pay are subject to a cap, but it is adjusted every six months — a period about to be cut to three — meaning bills rise more quickly in line with wholesale costs.\n\n“There’s a transitional arrangement between now and when we move to that full quarterly model that’s pushing up prices a little bit more,” Sanjay Raja, Deutsche Bank’s chief UK economist, told CNN Business. “Suppliers are able to pass on the increases in wholesale gas prices a lot more quickly than they were in the past,” he added.\n\nLack of storage\n\nThe United Kingdom has faced a “perfect storm” of events which have bumped up energy bills, according to Raja.\n\nMost homes are supplied with natural gas, he said, whereas electricity, nuclear energy and renewable sources make up a bigger share of the energy mix across the European Union.\n\nThe country also relies on gas to generate 40% of its electricity, compared to less than one fifth for the bloc as a whole, according to Deutsche Bank.\n\n“It’s a double whammy effect and the UK’s overdependence on gas is a big reason why gas prices I think in the UK are a little bit more elevated than elsewhere,” he said.\n\nHigh voltage power lines and cooling towers at the Dampierre-en-Burly nuclear power plant, operated by Electricite de France SA (EDF), in Dampierre-en-Burly, France, on Tuesday, May 3, 2022.

Anita Pouchard Serra/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nWhile the United Kingdom produces about half of its gas, North Sea output last year fell to its lowest level on record due to maintenance work, according to the government’s business department.\n\nA lack of storage has exacerbated the situation. Centrica (CPYYF), a UK energy company, closed the largest gas storage facility in the country in 2017, though it is in discussions with the government to reopen the site this winter. Europe has more storage capacity, and has been rapidly filling it ahead of winter — and a feared total cut off of Russian gas.\n\nUK natural gas contracts for next year’s first quarter are nearly 7% more expensive than European benchmark contract prices, according to analysis by Auxilione. That’s because Europe has now built a buffer for the winter months.\n\nThe lack of storage forces the the United Kingdom to rely on “real-time flows” of gas from the North Sea, Norway, Belgium, as well as liquefied natural gas imports, Tony Jordan, director at Auxilione, told CNN Business.\n\n“We’re much more reliant on the here and now when it gets to winter,” he said.\n\nEurope’s gas is still eye-wateringly expensive. It was trading at €242 ($244) per megawatt hour on Friday, an all-time high, according to Auxilione. That’s much higher than the spot price for UK gas, which is trading at an equivalent of €160 ($161) per megawatt hour, but the differential is driven mostly by greater demand in Europe as it fills up its tanks for winter.\n\nGermany declared a gas crisis in June after Russia cut flows through the vital Nord Stream 1 pipeline by two-thirds, bringing the country one step closer to rationing gas to industry.\n\nMinimal government support\n\nFaced with soaring bills, governments across Europe have stepped in to help ease the financial pressure on households.\n\nBut the “elephant in the room,” said Raja, is that none of the support offered by the UK government so far has directly subsidized consumer energy prices. Earlier this year, the government announced a £150 rebate on a local tax for millions of households to help ease the pain.\n\nMore help is coming soon, but it won’t be anywhere near enough, according to anti-poverty campaigners.\n\nAn electricity transmission tower near residential houses in Upminster, UK, on Monday, July 4, 2022. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nIn May, the government announced a £15 billion ($18 billion) package of support, including a £400 ($482) credit to 29 million households from October, which will be spread over six months.\n\nBy comparison, France has capped electricity price increases to 4% until the end of the year.\n\nOther countries “have had more direct intervention when it comes to energy prices, so comparatively UK gas and electricity prices are running a little bit higher,” Raja added.\n\nOn Thursday, Germany announced plans to slash a sales tax on gas to 7% from 19% until March 2024, which is designed to more than offset new levies introduced to pay for gas storage. The government has asked companies to pass the reduction onto their customers, according to a report by German broadcaster ZDF.\n\nLiz Truss, the favorite to succeed Boris Johnson as the UK’s next prime minister next month, has not said how she would provide further help to households beyond cutting taxes.\n\nThe opposition Labour Party is calling for a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to be extended to help fund a freeze on energy bills this winter.\n\n— Mark Thompson contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/08/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/12/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html", "title": "Premarket stocks: Betting on a market bounce?

It’s simply impossible to predict what will happen over the next 365 days and how that might impact markets: At the end of last year, Goldman Sachs analysts predicted that the S&P 500 would close out 2022 at 5,100 points. Morgan Stanley predicted a more bearish 4,400. The S&P 500 closed on Friday at 3,934.\n\nMarket analysts aren’t alone. As International Monetary Fund economist Prakash Loungani concluded in a report on the accuracy of economic forecasts, “the record of failure to predict recessions is virtually unblemished.”\n\nStill, that doesn’t stop experts from trying. Here are some of the major themes emerging as analysts peer into their crystal balls.\n\nMild recessions: Will the US fall into recession in 2023? Analysts are avoiding or hedging their use of the ‘R’ word but widely see a slowdown in growth, softening of the economy and even “rolling recessions.”\n\nTruist’s base case is for a US recession in 2023 “even though economic growth in the US is expected to remain stronger relative to global peers.” Wells Fargo calls for a “moderate recession in 2023,” based on “a resilient labor market, slowing inflation, and lower interest rates.”\n\nJPMorgan Asset Management’s report says that “while a 2023 recession is quite possible, it should be a mild one if it occurs.” Bank of America Global Research and Citi Global Wealth also forecast “mild recessions.”\n\nLiz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab, writes in her 2023 preview, with Kevin Gordon, that a recession will roll through different parts of the economy, but not all at once. “Although the pain in different segments of the economy gets extended over a longer period of time, you have positive offsets relative to the areas where there’s weakness,” she says.\n\nThat will lead to a bumpy market. “US equity returns will be driven by earnings against a backdrop characterized by elevated market volatility,” write JPMorgan analysts.\n\nInflation will fall… A bit: Analysts seem to believe that a moderate recession in the first half of the year will finally cool sky-high inflation, though it will remain above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target level. Still, most economists think it will be enough for the central bank to ease away from its painful interest rate hikes.\n\n“We believe that a recession and unwinding inflationary shocks of the past 18 months will allow inflation to decline to under 3% on a year-over-year basis by year-end 2023,” write Wells Fargo analysts.\n\nJPMorgan analysts think the Fed will conclude its rate hike regimen by the second quarter of the year. “With inflation continuing to fade and fiscal policy likely on hold, the Fed is likely to end its tightening cycle early in the new year and inflation could begin to ease before the end of 2023,” they write.\n\nMarkets make a modest recovery: All of this will lead to a more stable and prosperous second half of the year for markets, analysts believe, and a strong 2024.\n\nBy the start of 2024, write JPMorgan analysts, the US economy could be back to where it was in the late 2010s; slow growth, low inflation, moderate interest rates and strong corporate margins. “While this may not represent an exciting prospect for the average American worker or consumer,” they write, “it is an environment that could be very positive for financial markets.”\n\n“In sum,” says Sonders, “worse before better.”\n\nAmericans’ wealth slips further after massive loss in the spring\n\nAmericans’ wealth continued to slide in the third quarter as stock prices plunged over the summer — but many Americans still have a healthy financial cushion, compared to pre-pandemic times, reports my colleague Tami Luhby.\n\nThe net worth of households and nonprofit organizations dropped by $400 billion to $143.3 trillion in the third quarter. The value of households’ stocks declined by $1.9 trillion, while their real estate holdings increased in value by $700 billion, according to data from the Federal Reserve released Friday.\n\nThe decline comes after their wealth plummeted more than $6 trillion in the second quarter, which was also driven primarily by a drop in stock prices. Federal Reserve data is not adjusted for inflation.\n\nThe third quarter was brutal for stocks. The S&P 500 index fell 5.3% during the period, though it has rebounded since then.\n\nHouse prices, meanwhile, inched up by just 0.1% in the third quarter, compared to the prior quarter, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency House Price Index.\n\nHousehold debt grew by 6.3% in the third quarter at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, slower than in the prior quarter. Home mortgage debt increased 6.6%, while non-mortgage consumer credit jumped by 7.0% — a slower pace for both compared to the second quarter.\n\nThe bottom line: Americans are not happy about their financial situation. About half said it’s worse than it was a year ago, while around a third said they’re in about the same financial shape, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS found. Only 16% said they are now better off.\n\nIn CNN’s December 2021 poll, only a third said their finances had worsened over the course of the previous year.\n\nThe UK just had a major market scare. Now it wants to relax financial rules\n\nJust two months after UK markets suffered their worst meltdown since the global financial crisis, the British government is promising a major relaxation of financial regulation in a bid to shore up the country’s banking and insurance industries against growing competition from cities such as Amsterdam and Paris, reports my colleague Julia Horowitz.\n\nThe UK Treasury unveiled more than 30 measures Friday, dubbed the “Edinburgh Reforms.” These include an effort to make it easier for companies to list shares in London, a rethink of short-selling regulations and a mandate for regulators to take account of growth and UK competitiveness when setting rules.\n\n“We are committed to securing the UK’s status as one of the most open, dynamic and competitive financial services hubs in the world,” Jeremy Hunt, the UK finance minister, said in a statement.\n\nThe effort was initially touted as a “Big Bang 2.0” — a nod to the rapid deregulation of UK financial markets under former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1986. But ministers have moved away from that language, since the reforms are expected to be more gradual.\n\nThe changes are a bid to maintain London’s role as a global financial hub after Brexit, which, alongside political turmoil, has boosted uncertainty for companies thinking about where to invest.", "authors": ["Nicole Goodkind"], "publish_date": "2022/12/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/12/homes/buying-a-home-high-rates/index.html", "title": "It's a terrible time to buy a house. Here's what to know if you have to ...", "text": "There is no sugarcoating it: This is a terrible time to buy a home.\n\nMortgage rates for a 30-year fixed rate loan are now hovering above 7%, more than 4 percentage points higher than a year ago. That has slashed a typical buyer’s purchasing power by 14%, according to Black Knight, a mortgage data company.\n\nWith fewer people able or interested in buying now, home sales have been falling. Just 16% of people say now is a good time to buy a home, a record low, according to a monthly survey conducted by Fannie Mae in October.\n\nStill, that’s barely made a dent in home prices, which soared to new heights during the pandemic and are now just easing off of all-time highs.\n\nAnother thing tamping down sales is stubbornly low inventory of available homes for sale, said Jackie Lafferty, a real estate agent with Baird & Warner Real Estate in Chicago.\n\n“It is something I’ve never seen a combination of, this lack of inventory and higher interest rates,” Lafferty said. “There is no motivation for people to move unless they have to.”\n\nBut whether people need to move because of a new job, a divorce, an addition to the family or they simply don’t want to give up after years of trying to buy a home, there are still buyers out there.\n\n“Even if sales slow down, real estate doesn’t stop,” said Lafferty. “People need a place to live.”\n\nFor those who are pressing on, here are a few ways you can take some of the sting out of buying a home.\n\nTake a loan now and refinance later\n\nBuyers taking out a mortgage now are doing so with the hope that within a couple years, rates might meaningfully drop and they can refinance to a lower rate.\n\n“Yes, rates have gone up much farther and faster than anyone expected them to,” said Melissa Cohn, regional vice president at William Raveis Mortgage. “But if you can afford to buy today and want and need to, you shouldn’t let the higher rate environment stop you, knowing that at some point in the next year, two years at the most, rates are likely to be significantly lower.”\n\nThe downside: You’ll still have to stomach the higher rate for the time being. There is some risk that interest rates may not fall, or at least not by much. And if mortgage rates don’t go down, you could be stuck with it for a while, said Delyse Berry, CEO and principal broker at Upstate Down in Rhinebeck, New York.\n\n“There could be a decrease in rates in the middle of 2023,” she said. “If that comes to pass, you can do a refinance and secure a lower interest rate and lower payments. But these rates could now be the new cost of doing business.”\n\nPlus, refinancing can be extremely costly. Typically, closing costs run between 2% and 5% of the loan’s principal amount.\n\nAnd unexpected events may prevent you from refinancing, like losing your job or losing value in your home.\n\nGet an adjustable rate loan\n\nMore home buyers are exploring options outside of the standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. For example, adjustable rate mortgages, or ARMs, now make up 12% of mortgage applications, up from 3% a year ago, according to Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\nWhile the average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan was 7.08% last week, the rate for the 5-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable rate mortgage was a full percentage point lower at 6.06%, according to Freddie Mac. Though they are still 30-year loans, ARMs offer a fixed rate for a set period – typically 5, 7 or 10 years – after which the interest rate resets to current market rates.\n\n“Buying today is about figuring out what can you do to bridge this high-rate environment to get yourself comfortable with your acquisition,” said Cohn. “When rates drop, it is time to see what your more permanent solution will be.”\n\nFor buyers who may be moving out of the home in 5 to 7 years anyway, an ARM may be a way to boost purchasing power.\n\n“For the first 5 or 7 years of an adjustable rate mortgage, it walks, talks and acts just like a fixed-rate mortgage,” said Cohn. “It has a lower rate and lower payment because the bank is only guaranteeing it for a shorter period of time.”\n\nIf rates come down, an ARM could reset to a better rate.\n\nThe downside: Borrowers must also accept the risk that rates could be even higher when the loan resets, or any time over the life of the loan. After the fixed period, ARMs can reset every year or every six months.\n\nHowever, most do have caps on how much a rate can go up or down during each reset period and over the life of the loan, so it’s important to understand how your loan works.\n\nBuy down your interest rate with points\n\nBorrowers can lower their payments by paying more upfront to buy down their mortgage rate. This will lower the loan’s interest rate, either permanently or temporarily.\n\nWhile a permanent buydown changes your rate for the life of a loan, a temporary buydown provides lower rates for a period of time.\n\nIn a temporary buydown, typically borrowers get two percentage points off the loan’s rate for the first year, one percentage point off for the second year, and by the third year, the loan returns to its original rate for the remainder of its term. By then, many borrowers expect there to be lower interest rates, which leaves open the possibility of refinancing.\n\n“That is a meaningful difference for the first year of the loan, lowering your rate from 7% to 5%,” said Cohn.\n\nThe downside: While getting a lower interest rate is very appealing, it means shelling out more money up front. That might not make financial sense if you don’t plan to stay in the house for a long time.\n\n“It takes about five years to break even on paying down one point,” said Cohn. “Knowing that rates are likely to be meaningfully lower by then, you might be better off taking the money you’d use to pay for points to pay for refinancing later.”\n\nRequest a seller’s credit to buy down your rate\n\nIn some housing markets, competition among buyers has softened, and sellers are being forced to be more flexible on offers.\n\nOne way a buyer can reduce their payments is to ask for a seller’s credit, or a seller’s concession, as part of the deal. Buyers can then use that money to buy down the interest rate on their mortgage and reduce their monthly payments.\n\n“Sellers are willing to negotiate more now than they have in the past,” said Trudy Kelly, a senior home loan specialist at Churchill Mortgage in Oregon.\n\nIn September, when mortgage rates were around 5.75%, Kelly worked with borrowers who were buying a $590,000 house. Rather than offering $15,000 or $20,000 below the asking price to reduce the cost of the monthly payments, the buyers asked for a $15,000 seller’s concession.\n\nIf the buyers had made the lower offer and got the home for $575,000, their monthly savings would be $78, said Kelly. But by paying down the interest rate by one percentage point, their payments dropped by $340 a month.\n\n“That is a huge difference,” she said. “Ultimately, what that did for them was expand their budget. It lowered their debt-to-income ratio giving them more purchase power. It puts them in a time machine and takes them back to April or May [when rates were lower].”\n\nThe downside: In many areas, it’s still a seller’s market. Asking for a credit or concession might be less appealing to a seller if they have other offers.\n\nBuy in cash or increase your down payment\n\nIf you’ve got the cash to buy a home, now is a good time to do it. Not only will you avoid paying a high rate on a mortgage, you’ll likely be able to negotiate for a better price.\n\nBut not many people can pay in cash: 97% of homebuyers over the past year needed to finance their home, according to a recent report from the National Association of Realtors.\n\nEven if you don’t have enough for an all-cash deal, throwing more at the down payment will reduce the amount of your mortgage, lower your monthly payments, and mean paying less interest over the life of the loan. If you own your current home, you can leverage some of the cash from your sale or possibly even tap the equity to boost your down payment.\n\nBy making a larger down payment you will not only reduce your loan balance but also increase your home equity, money you can recoup when you sell – assuming the property appreciates.\n\nThe downside: Using cash toward a real estate purchase is always a trade-off, as you’ll have to forgo other potential investments. And for most buyers, coughing up more cash just isn’t an option. The typical down payment for first-time buyers was 6%, while it was 17% for repeat buyers. according to the National Association of Realtors.", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/economy/bank-of-england-interest-rates/index.html", "title": "Bank of England sets biggest rate hike in 33 years and warns of a ...", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nThe Bank of England raised interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point on Thursday, the biggest hike in 33 years, as it tries to contain soaring inflation even as the UK economy slides towards a recession that could last two years.\n\nThe central bank made its eighth interest rate hike in less than a year, taking its benchmark rate to 3%, the highest it has been since November 2008.\n\nThe huge hike matches moves made by the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the European Central Bank last week.\n\n“Inflation is too high, and it’s the bank’s job to bring it down,” Governor Andrew Bailey said at a press conference after the announcement. “If we do not act forcefully now it will be worse later on.”\n\nAs the Bank of England raises borrowing costs to cap rising prices, Britain’s economy is expected to suffer.\n\nThe central bank believes economic output is already contracting, and its latest projection is for the recession to continue through the first half of 2024 “as high energy prices and materially tighter financial conditions weigh on spending.”\n\nCompared to past UK recessions, gross domestic product is forecast to remain weak compared to pre-recession levels for a “prolonged” period, Bailey said.\n\nA two-year recession would be longer than the one that followed the 2008 global financial crisis, though the Bank of England said that any declines in GDP heading into 2024 would likely be relatively small.\n\nThe British pound fell sharply after the announcement, dropping 2% against the US dollar to $1.117. It also dropped 1.2% against the euro.\n\nSince the Bank of England’s last meeting, UK financial markets have been through a period of unprecedented turbulence and the outlook for the economy has deteriorated.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Liz Truss’ “mini” budget in late September — with its promise of £45 billion ($51.6 billion) of unfunded tax cuts — crashed the pound, collapsed bond prices, sparked mayhem in mortgage markets and prompted an emergency intervention by the Bank of England to rescue strained pension funds.\n\nWhile Truss’ tax-cutting plans have since largely been ditched, restoring calm to markets and easing expectations for inflation in the medium term, rising food and energy costs are keeping prices high. The annual rate of inflation climbed to 10.1% in September, from 9.9% in August, returning to the 40-year high hit in July.\n\nBailey acknowledged the “tough road ahead.”\n\nThe central bank doesn’t think inflation will start to fall back until next year. That will require more interest rate hikes in the coming months, though Bailey said market expectations appeared to be too aggressive.\n\nThose remarks contrasted with those Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who said rates may need to rise higher than previously expected.\n\nCentral bank policymakers are now waiting for the government’s budget announcement on November 17 for more details on spending plans and tax policies, which could influence what happens to inflation next year.\n\nDespite recent turmoil in the bond market, the Bank of England pushed ahead this week with plans to shrink its balance sheet, selling £750 million ($859 million) of short-term government debt on Tuesday.

That would have added £201 ($217) to a typical homeowner’s monthly payment on an outstanding fixed-rate mortgage of £146,000 ($157,000), Laura Suter, head of personal finance at investment firm AJ Bell, told CNN Business. Now borrowers face an even bigger cliff edge.\n\nThere are 9 million outstanding residential mortgages in the United Kingdom, according to UK Finance, an association of banks and financial services firms. About 20% of those loans are tracker, or variable rate products, that typically become more expensive when the central bank hikes rates. The rest are fixed-rate loans.\n\nBut as many as 1.8 million borrowers will have to refinance next year, according to the Resolution Foundation. Neal Hudson, a housing market analyst at research firm BuiltPlace, estimates that about 300,000 fixed-rate deals will come to an end between October and December. Those borrowers face a sudden increase in their monthly payments should they refinance.\n\nIf the base rate rises to 6%, a person refinancing a 20-year fixed-rate mortgage of £146,000 ($157,000) will have to pay an extra £309 ($333) per month, according to Suter. That’s £108 ($116) more than estimated before the pound’s crash.\n\nMany borrowers won’t be able to cope. Samuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a Tuesday report that a 6% mortgage rate would “lead to a sharp rise in mortgage defaults.”\n\nHe calculates that the average household refinancing a 2-year fixed rate mortgage in the first half of next year would see its monthly repayment jump by a whopping 73% to £1,490 ($1,607), an increase equivalent to about 14% of disposable income.\n\n“Mortgage arrears and default would rise just as house prices likely would be tumbling, placing huge strain on banks’ balance sheets,” he said in the report.\n\nSome mortgages have been withdrawn and rates are already rising\n\nBanks are already becoming more risk-averse as they struggle to reprice their mortgages in such volatile markets.\n\nSince Friday, lenders have withdrawn more than 350 mortgage products in response to the turmoil, according to Moneyfacts, a financial product comparison website.\n\nHalifax, owned by Lloyds Bank (LLDTF), removed some of its mortgage products, while Virgin Money stopped taking mortgage applications from new customers until later this week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Santander (SAN) said it would remove mortgages worth 60% and 85% of a property’s value for new UK customers, and increase rates for “new and existing customers from 10 p.m. this evening.”\n\n“Customers who have already applied by this time will not be impacted,” a company spokesperson told CNN Business in a statement.\n\nBorrowers are worried. Online searches for “remortgage” more than doubled in the United Kingdom on Monday, according to analysis of Google search data by Loan Corp, a mortgage broker.\n\nSome may now struggle to find any deals at all.\n\n“Those with smaller deposits or who are trying to borrow at their maximum affordability might find it harder to get a mortgage deal or that they are paying even higher rates to do so,” Suter said.\n\n— Julia Horowitz contributed reporting.", "authors": ["Anna Cooban"], "publish_date": "2022/09/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/07/homes/mortgage-rates-july-7/index.html", "title": "Mortgage rates see largest decline since 2008 | CNN Business", "text": "Mortgage rates dropped for the second week in a row, notching the largest decline since December, 2008.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.30% in the week ending July 7, down from 5.70% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. That is still significantly higher than this time last year when it was 2.90%\n\nRates rose sharply at the start of the year, hitting a high of 5.81% in mid-June. But since then, economic concerns have pushed them lower. The 40 basis point fall offset some of the significant rate increases of May and June.\n\n“Over the last two weeks, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped by half a percent, as concerns about a potential recession continue to rise,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist.\n\nBut affording a home still remains a challenge. Mortgage rates are at their highest levels since the late 2000’s and listing prices have grown by more than 8.5% year-over-year for 24 consecutive months, said Joel Berner, Realtor.com’s senior economic research analyst.\n\nIf there’s any silver lining for homebuyers, it’s that more homes are hitting the market, he said. In June, active listings increased by the largest annual growth in the history of Realtor.com’s data.\n\n“With more homes on the market, sellers are being forced to compete on prices,” he said. “Though the cost of financing a home remains high relative to recent years, buyers will have more chances to find homes in their price range as the undersupplied and overheated housing market starts to cool.”\n\nHigher rates are also tamping down demand among prospective buyers. Mortgage applications dropped 5.4% in the week ending July 1 from the week before, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n\n“Rates are still significantly higher than they were a year ago, which is why applications for home purchases and refinances remain depressed,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s associate vice president of economic and industry forecasting. “Purchase activity is hamstrung by ongoing affordability challenges and low inventory, and homeowners still have reduced incentive to apply for a refinance.”\n\nBuyers are finding it harder to buy homes as inflation takes a larger chunk of their income and the cost of borrowing has reduced their purchasing power.\n\nA year ago, a buyer who put 20% down on a median priced $390,000 home and financed the rest with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at an average rate of 2.90% had a monthly mortgage payment of $1,299, according to calculations from Freddie Mac.\n\nToday, a homeowner buying the same priced house with an average rate of 5.30% would pay $1,733 a month in principal and interest. That’s $434 more each month.\n\nThe decline in mortgage rates this week follows recent volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, which dropped below 2.8% in the first week of July after spending most of June above 3%.\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly, its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track 10-year US Treasury bonds. As investors see or anticipate rate hikes, they often sell government bonds, which sends yields higher and with it, mortgage rates.\n\nIn addition, continued fears that we are heading into a bear market have driven investors into safer, longer-term bonds, said Berner.\n\n“This inversion might sound ominous, especially in the midst of sustained inflation that both markets and the Fed agree will likely require more fed funds rate hikes to tame, but it remains to be seen whether these market conditions will lead to increases in the unemployment rate or decreases in production that characterize a recession,” he said.", "authors": ["Anna Bahney"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/19/business/uk-inflation-40-year-high/index.html", "title": "UK inflation back at 40-year high as food prices soar | CNN Business", "text": "London CNN Business —\n\nRising food and energy costs drove UK inflation back to a 40-year high in September, but it could be nearing a peak as cash-strapped households pull back on spending amid broader economic turmoil.\n\nThe annual rate of inflation rose to 10.1% in September, up from 9.9% in the 12 months to August, the Office for National Statistics said on Wednesday. That returns it to July’s recent high.\n\nSoaring food prices were the largest single contributor to the acceleration in inflation, jumping 14.6% year-on-year, the ONS said.\n\nThe return to double-digit inflation will be worrying for the Bank of England, which meets on November 3 to set interest rates. Governor Andrew Bailey has said that a “stronger response” may be needed to get a handle on price rises.\n\nThe central bank will evaluate rising price pressures against the government’s recent U-turns on unfunded tax cuts, which could help ease inflation in the coming months.\n\n“The dramatic scaling back of fiscal support by the new Chancellor will be seen as lowering medium-term inflation, and that’s what [Bank of England] policymakers will be more interested in,” James Smith, developed markets economist at Dutch bank ING, said in a note on Wednesday.\n\nThe bank now expects policymakers to hike interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point next month, instead of by a full percentage point. ING economists think inflation is likely to peak this month and begin to ease in 2023, as supply chain bottlenecks improve and consumer demand flags.\n\nEnergy prices remain a big unknown, however, after Hunt said Monday that the government will universally cap prices only until April. More targeted support after that could trigger a fresh spike in energy bills for many households, fanning inflation once again in the spring.\n\nGoldman Sachs warned that inflation could leap to 11.9% year-over-year in April from its current forecast of 7.1% and “stay higher throughout 2023,” depending on what the government decides to do.\n\nRising prices come as wage growth continues to decline in Britain. Between June and August, average pay fell by 2.9% once inflation is taken into account, according to the ONS. That followed a decline of 3% between April and June, which was the biggest drop in real wages since records began more than 20 years ago.\n\nThe UK government, meanwhile, is debating cuts to public spending in order to get a handle on its growing debt load, piling more pain on households at a difficult moment.\n\nResponding to the latest inflation figures, Hunt said the government “will prioritize help for the most vulnerable while delivering wider economic stability and driving long-term growth that will help everyone.”\n\nAccording to the ONS, price increases in September were partially offset by a fall in the cost of gasoline and airline tickets. “While still at a historically high rate, the costs facing businesses are beginning to rise more slowly, with crude oil prices actually falling in September,” director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said.\n\nInflation is a growing headache for policymakers across Europe, which is grappling with an energy crisis following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Soaring energy costs and rising food prices drove the eurozone’s annual rate of inflation to 9.9% in September, up from 9.1% in August, Eurostat said Wednesday.\n\n— Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/10/19"}]}

The paper-wrapped bars have gone on sale at 500 Tesco stores. If the trial goes well, the wrappers will be rolled out to all retailers, and to other Mars treats, such as Snickers. Mars said it had been difficult to find a paper wrapping that kept the chocolate fresh.

Flt Sgt Peter Brown, who died aged 96 with no known relatives, was born in Jamaica, enlisted in the RAF Volunteer Reserve in 1943, and flew Lancaster bombers. His funeral had been due to take place in April in a small chapel, but was rescheduled when a search for relatives sparked public interest.

And this eco-friendly energy bar company with roots in Iowa has seen a lot happen during that time.\n\nEver since Iowa natives Reed McIntyre, 29, of Indianola and Tom Miner, 30, of Davenport, launched their nutrition bar company, Unwrapp'd, the \"you-bake\" nutrition bar dough packaged in recyclable containers has grown quickly. It's now available in 200 Hy-Vee stores across eight states.\n\nA third partner, Maria Capecelatro, 30, acts as the chief nutritionist for Unwrapp'd and helps with nutrition information as well as dough development.\n\nInterested in Iowa food news? Follow @briantaylorcarlson on Facebook, @BriinDSM on Twitter and @briindsm on Instagram.\n\nOn Monday, Jan. 21, Unwrapp'd is launching its new 3-ounce jars made with post-consumer recycled material. Miner said these smaller jars hold two servings and fit perfectly in car cup holders, gym bags and even pockets for ultimate on-the-go snacking while still holding true to our core value of eliminating single-use disposable packaging.\n\nMore:Iowa college rivals unite to unleash eco-conscious energy bars at Ankeny Hy-Vee store\n\nSeven months ago, Unwrapp'd first launched in Ankeny. \"Some people were walking in and asking the managers if they carried the healthy product from the Iowa guys,\" Miner said. \"It also goes to show how much of a voice we have as customers to bring eco-conscious alternatives to life.\"\n\nUnwrapp'd Energy Bar Dough is the first nutrition bar dough on the market that's packaged in recyclable tubs. These tubs help reduce waste from protein and nutrition bar wrappers that are usually made from plastic, foil or plastic-infused paper.\n\nAvailable in five flavors — cookie dough, peanut butter chocolate chip, mint chocolate, cinnamon roll and chocolate sea salt — each refrigerated container includes enough dough for 20 1/2-ounce portions or seven bars for $9.99.\n\nThe all-natural dough is made with mostly dates and nuts like cashews, almonds, walnuts, peanuts, pumpkin seeds and coconut flour. Each container stays fresh for around five months in the fridge. It only takes 10-15 minutes to bake into bars, but eating it at room temperature is just fine.\n\nBe sure to bookmark these frequently-updated special dining features:\n\nAfter launching in Ankeny in July 2018, Miner said Des Moines-area residents began asking other local Hy-Vee stores to carry Unwrapp'd energy bar dough.\n\nBy the end of the month, Unwrapp'd was stocked in six Hy-Vee stores in the metro and its phone and online orders increased through its own website and on Amazon. By the end of August, it was in 10 Hy-Vee stores.\n\nIn the same month, a Hy-Vee dietician moved to Iowa City and placed orders for Unwrapp'd at her new store, which then led to stores in Iowa City, Coralville and North Liberty carrying Unwrapp'd energy bar dough.\n\nFrom there, a Davenport Hy-Vee manager in Davenport discovered Unwrapp'd, and the product found itself on shelves in the Quad Cities.\n\nWhen September rolled around, the Unwrapp'd owner trio took a trip back to Iowa to visit more Hy-Vee stores in Waukee, Urbandale and West Des Moines, which landed even more customers.\n\nIn November, Miner met with PDI (Perishable Distributors of Iowa) in Ankeny to present Unwrapp'd while on his way home to see family for Thanksgiving.\n\nBecause of the success in getting into so many Hy-Vee stores so quickly, the meeting went really well, Miner said. \"We are now launching into 175 Hy-Vee stores across eight states this month in partnership with PDI.\"\n\n\"It has been absolutely incredible to witness the tight bond that we Iowans share, no matter how far apart we are,\" Miner said. \"This rapid growth has only been made possible by the support from our fellow Iowans.\"\n\nFollow the Des Moines Register on Facebook | Download the Des Moines Register app", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/11/18/gwyneth-paltrow-goop-gift-guide-2019/4227936002/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow: Goop gift guide has $34 toilet paper, $189 chocolate", "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow is back with her latest holiday gift guide for Goop, and some of the items might burn a hole in your wallet.\n\nFor starters, she's taking going to the bathroom to an entirely new level.

Our eight-part guide shows you a delicious expert-backed eating lifestyle that will boost your health for life.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhen most of us read the words “plant-based diet,” we tend to think of foods such as kale salads and grain bowls or trendy meat replacements. But there is one nonmeat option that’s gaining traction as the newest superfood: seaweed.\n\nSeaweed – yes, the brownish-green ribbons and bundles of oceanic plantlike matter that wash up on beaches – is in fact edible. Nori, the papery sheets used to wrap sushi rolls and as a ramen bowl garnish, is likely the most well-known and enjoyed seaweed, but these large, leafy algae come in hundreds of colorful varieties, including wakame, kombu, red dulse and sugar kelp.\n\nSeaweed helps to support other marine life and to clean the water surrounding it. When out of the water, it can bring more nutrition and minerals to our diets.\n\n“Even though we try to eat healthy, we’re relying on land-based, soil-based agriculture for the most part,” said Sarah Redmond, founder and owner of Springtide Seaweed in Gouldsboro, Maine. “Seaweed is a really interesting alternative because it provides those nutrients that are really hard to find in other land plants.”\n\nWith several companies bringing seaweed-based foods to the market, it’s getting easier than ever to taste the sea. Here’s why we all can benefit from seaweed.\n\nGood for humans and the environment\n\nFor humans, seaweed is a one-stop shop for our crucial nutrient needs. “Seaweed is an excellent source of dietary fiber and minerals,” said Mary Ellen Camire, professor of food science and human nutrition at the University of Maine.\n\nThough nutritional profiles vary slightly between green, brown and red varieties, across the board seaweed contains a number of vitamins, including B, C, E and K, omega-3 fatty acids, protein, amino acids, polyphenols and 10 times more minerals than land-based plants, according to a recent study. These essential minerals include iron, calcium and iodine.\n\n“Seaweeds have this ability to concentrate all the trace minerals in the ocean that we cannot access,” Redmond said. “They are sort of this balancing food that we can return some of those trace elements back into our bodies and into our diets.”\n\nAnd when used as a fertilizer for land-based farming, seaweed can add those essential nutrients back into the soil, improving its health.\n\nSeaweed is a one-stop shop for crucial nutrient needs. Wakame seaweed also adds flavor to miso soup. Adobe Stock\n\nHowever, you don’t need to pile your plate high with seaweed because it can absorb high amounts of minerals. “Some brown kelps, such as the sugar kelp grown in New England, are very high in iodine,” Camire said. “They have so much iodine that consumers are advised to eat it no more than three times per week.”\n\nSince the concentration of specific nutrients in seaweed can interact with various medications, check with your doctor if you have a thyroid condition or take blood thinners before going all in.\n\nSeaweed is just as beneficial to water systems as it is to our personal health. Carbon capture might be the buzzword of the moment in the fight to mitigate the climate crisis, but seaweed has been doing it naturally all this time. “Seaweed pulls carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and uses it to make more carbohydrates,” Camire said. “We are not sure how much seaweed farming it would take to have a significant effect on global warming, but it helps.”\n\nSeaweed also works as a component of regenerative aquaculture by consuming nitrogen and phosphorus, two elements that can harm the ocean when found in large quantities. “Seaweed also provides a place for smaller sea creatures to hide from predators,” establishing refuge environments that can help restore diverse marine life in overfished habitats, Camire said.\n\nEven better: Seaweed requires no fertilizer or pesticides to grow in the ocean, whether it’s farmed there or harvested wild.\n\nHow to add seaweed to your everyday meals\n\nOK, now you may be convinced that seaweed is worth sampling. But there’s no need to forage for it – not that you’d want to. Make sure the seaweed products you’re getting are certified organic or tested for heavy metal content, Camire said, because “some types of seaweed are more likely to have heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and arsenic.”\n\nOther than eating lots of temaki rolls and packaged seaweed snacks or adding more nori sheets to your ramen, there are several ways to incorporate edible seaweed into your meal routine.\n\nSushi rolls are wrapped in papery sheets called nori. Here, wakame garnishes the top of sushi rolls. Adobe Stock\n\nSpringtide Seaweed air-dries kelp and mills it into powder for seasonings such as Italian kelp and Red Bay seasoning, which can be sprinkled on everything from popcorn to garlic bread. Add dried kelp ribbons to soups, stews or any dish where you’d sauté kale and other leafy greens. “We try to put seaweed in a form that’s easy for people to use and incorporate into their diet,” Redmond said.\n\nWant your kelp for breakfast? Atlantic Sea Farms, another Maine seaweed producer, incorporates kelp into frozen smoothie cubes alongside antioxidant-rich fruits such as cranberries and blueberries. If you’re feeling spicy, try some of their kelp-based kimchi. To turn up the heat, add some kelp hot sauce from Alaska’s Barnacle Foods.\n\nOr if you prefer your seaweed on the grill, Akua makes kelp burgers and ground kelp, which can be transformed into meatballs, used in tacos or anywhere else ground meat usually makes an appearance on the menu.\n\nYou can even have seaweed that satisfies a sweet tooth in the form of kelp chocolate bars (plain or with potato chips) or by making your own chocolate chip cookies that sneak powdered kelp into the mix.", "authors": ["Casey Barber"], "publish_date": "2022/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/reviewed/2021/12/01/holiday-gifts-that-support-ethical-online-shopping/49398205/", "title": "These holiday gifts support ethical online shopping", "text": "Elizabeth Kocan\n\nReviewed\n\n— Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed’s editors.

Available from the early 1900s, plastic was an absolute hit by the 1960s. It’s hard to imagine what the modern world would look like without plastic. But it turned out too good to be true.\n\nDifferent kinds of plastic take anywhere between 400 and 1,000 years to degrade in a landfill. About 91% of it isn’t recycled. This means that most of the more than 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic products that have ended up as trash is still around. So much plastic is thrown away every year that it’s enough to circle the Earth four times.\n\nWe are not only hurting the environment by using so much plastic, we are damaging our own bodies and sea life. Chemicals in plastics interact with hormones and may lead to numerous health problems, including heart disease and diabetes. Plastic fragments from bags, bottles and other items that are laced with chemicals can be ingested by marine animals and poison them.\n\nAs the negative environmental effects become known, the world is beginning to reconsider plastic’s usefulness. Many countries and cities are trying to deal with modern life’s dependency on the material by banning single-use plastics.\n\nSeveral big companies are also trying to reduce their environmental footprint. Starbucks, for example, is selling reusable mugs for $1, which you can use to get a 10% discount off your drink.\n\nOh, yuck! You're eating about a credit card's worth of plastic every week\n\nIn addition to governments and companies, individuals are thinking of ways to reduce the need for plastics. They are coming up with sustainable products — from straws to bins, bottles and even dishwashers — that change the world one piece of plastic at a time.\n\nTo compile a list of eco-friendly inventions that can replace plastics, 24/7 Tempo reviewed news stories about biodegradable products, as well as articles on sustainable inventions by nonprofit organizations known for their work to protect the environment.\n\nStainless steel straws\n\nPlastic straws are everywhere. Up to 8.3 billion plastic straws are lying on shores all over the world, often ending up in the digestive systems of marine life. These items have become such a huge problem, more and more countries and cities are banning them altogether or restricting their use. Reusable metal straws could help replace disposable plastic ones.\n\nCassava ponchos\n\nVinyl ponchos are arguably a lot more comfortable to wear on a rainy day than carrying an umbrella. The problem is that most of these ponchos will be thrown away after a few uses, but will not decompose for millions of years. So one man with a biology degree from Indonesia created ponchos, bags and food packaging from cassava, a common vegetable found across the country.\n\nSilicone food bags\n\nJust imagine how much trash you would avoid accumulating if you didn't have to throw out plastic sandwich bags. Made from 100% pure platinum silicone, these storage food bags are fully functional, self-sealing, and, most importantly, non-plastic. They are airtight as well as leakproof.\n\nEdible water bottles\n\nAt first glance, this is not intuitive. Eating the packaging of the product? It's possible. After all, it's made from plant-based materials. Ooho is made from seaweed-extract. The material degrades in a natural environment in six weeks on average — as opposed to 450 years for plastic bottles — unless you eat it.\n\nEdible forks, spoons, and chopsticks\n\nAnother type of popular plastic product you no longer have to worry about — because you can eat the alternative — is cutlery. Bakeys spoons, forks, and even chopsticks are made of sorghum, rice, and wheat flour. They are baked in moulds and sometimes flavors are added, too. You basically don't have to buy dessert anymore — it's already in your hands.\n\nBamboo toothbrushes\n\nConsidering that a person is supposed to use a new toothbrush every three to four months, it's disheartening to think how much plastic waste we add to landfill sites from toothbrushes alone. Plant-based toothbrushes have been around for several years. All components, even the box and packaging, are made from bamboo or compostable castor bean nylon.\n\nStore bags made of starch\n\nBags that can become food for animals after use and thus serve a double purpose? This may sound too good to be true but it's a reality. EnviGreen is an Indian company that, as a result of many cities banning plastic bags, has found an alternative. Its solution is bags made of starch and vegetable oil derivatives. If animals don't eat them in the end, the company says the eco-friendly bags will dissolve within a day.\n\nCotton produce bags\n\nEvery different vegetable or fruit you get at the store is usually packed in a separate plastic bag. So people sometimes end up going home with 10-15 plastic bags after just one shopping trip. And the bags, sadly, will often simply end up in the trash bin without being reused again. There are many kinds of affordable and reusable bags made from 100% cotton mesh biodegradable material.\n\nSilicone stretch lids\n\nSilicone stretch lids are an elegant alternative to aluminum foil or stretch wraps that are so common. Just think of all the money you'll save from not having to buy tupperware in all kinds of sizes. With silicone lids you don't even have to worry about starting a fire by putting them in the microwave. They are made of silicone, so they can go there, as well as in the freezer and regular oven.\n\nEco-friendly conditioner bars\n\nJust one Ethique eco-friendly solid shampoo bar is equivalent to five bottles of the liquid version. The bars are also available as conditioners, lotions, and face washes. The beauty company, whose name means ethics in French and which is based in New Zealand, was named the country's most sustainable business. The bars are made of coconut oil, cocoa butter, kiwifruit seed oil and essential oils.\n\nPlant-based sanitary napkins\n\nThe conversation about women's hygiene is usually limited to where women lack the basics, such as sanitary napkins and pads. The impact of these products on the environment, a much less discussed topic, is enormous. A single pad, which is about 90% plastic, takes between 500 and 800 years to decompose, and millions of pads are used every day all over the world. Heyday makes sanitary napkins and pads from corn and bamboo fiber. They start decomposing just six months after disposal.\n\nNatural scrub sponges\n\nSponges are among the dirtiest items in the kitchen. People use them multiple times a day, but how often do they really clean them in boiling water or in a microwave to kill the bacteria? The solution might seem to be for sponges, which are mostly made from oil-based plastic, to be replaced frequently, which means a lot of trash. A better idea is to use sponges made from plants, which last longer and are 100% compostable.\n\nPlastic-free gum\n\nDid you know that most chewing gum contains plastic and other materials, such as rubbers and waxes, that aren't edible? The plastic is non-digestible which means it simply doesn't break down in your body and you just carry it with you. It only seems logical then that a plastic-free gum would hit the market eventually. Simply Gum's base is made of harvested chicle (tree sap) instead of plastic and it contains no artificial ingredients.\n\nBeeswax food wraps\n\nBeeswax food wraps are another alternative to the ever-present plastic bags for food storage. You can buy them online or you can make them yourself. All you need is beeswax beads, some kind of fabric, baking sheets, and parchment paper.\n\nSoap nuts\n\nThe name is a bit deceiving because they don't contain any soap; they just act like they do. Soap nuts are a berry shell that work like a regular detergent but contain no chemical additives. They grow in the Himalayas. These nuts clean the clothes thanks to saponin, a natural cleaning agent. It gets deep into the clothes fibers, removing stains and dirt that are later rinsed away. Imagine the amount of plastic laundry jugs you'd be sparing the environment from.\n\nCompostable trash bags\n\nDespite all the talk about plastics and saving the environment, not a lot of focus is put on trash bags, which are made of plastic. Usage of plastic garbage bags has increased steadily over the last few years. Compostable trash bags can be made from potato starch, with no plasticizers whatsoever.\n\nLiquid wood\n\nLiquid wood, or arboform, is a bioplastic composed of wood pulp-based lignin, hemp or flax, and wax. When mixed with other materials, it creates a non-toxic alternative to petroleum-based plastics. Liquid wood is already used to make certain car parts, boats, decks, and other items.\n\nDog waste bags\n\nMore than 43 million households in the United States own one or more dogs. Each has to be walked at least twice a day. People usually clean up after them with plastic bags. That is at least 86 million plastic bags a day thrown out and left to decompose in landfills or oceans for decades to come. This could easily be avoided if people used a single waste bag over and over again, one that can be washed and dried quickly. Luckily, it's already on the market.\n\nMenstrual cup\n\nWomen have to change pads or tampons every few hours. And a menstrual cycle usually lasts 4-5 days, and even a week. Do the math and you'll get a very big number for pads and tampons, which can contain up to 90% plastic, filling up landfills every year. Menstrual cups that women can use again and again have gotten popular over the last few years. The cups can even hold up to three times as much liquid as a tampon.\n\n24/7 Wall Street is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Phil Murphy almost 18 months ago covers a lot of ground and is not exactly straightforward.\n\nThere are several carve-outs and exemptions strewn throughout the measure's 4,412 words after legislators, business lobbyists and environmental groups spent years arguing and compromising over different sections.\n\nHere is a guide to a law that will affect every New Jersey consumer:\n\nWhy is New Jersey banning bags?\n\nPlastic pollution is a big problem in New Jersey.\n\nIt spreads easily and everywhere, because New Jersey is surrounded on three sides by water — with dozens of tidal rivers flowing inland.\n\nFor decades, the majority of litter picked up at annual beach cleanups by volunteers for Clean Ocean Action has been plastic. In recent years, plastic has accounted for more than 80% of the litter, with bags, foam and straws among the top items found.\n\nPlastic doesn't biodegrade. It just breaks down into smaller pieces. A 2016 report by NY/NJ Baykeeper estimated that there were almost 166 million pieces of microscopic plastic — which can easily enter the lungs and bloodstream — floating in the waterways of New Jersey and New York.\n\nScientists have even found these microplastic particles in some of the state's most pristine waterways, including the upper Raritan and Passaic rivers.\n\nBusiness groups, on the other hand, have criticized the ban as needless government intervention that would force consumers to buy other plastic products.\n\nMore answers to your questions:New Jersey's new plastic bag ban is coming, and readers have questions\n\nWhat's being banned?\n\nAlmost all plastic carryout bags.\n\nPaper bags — but only in larger supermarkets or big box stores that have large grocery sections.\n\nMost plastic foam food containers and cups.\n\n(See below for details.)\n\nWhen does the plastic bag ban and others start?\n\nAlmost all of them begin Wednesday, May 4.\n\nMore:Environmentalists take Murphy to court to speed up efforts to combat climate change\n\nWhat kinds of plastic bags are banned?\n\nThe law targets plastic carryout bags — the kind that have been given for generations to consumers for free in nearly every kind of retail establishment.\n\nThe ban covers all stores, not just supermarkets and restaurants.\n\nThe ban covers all carryout plastic bags regardless of thickness.\n\nWhat plastic bags are exempt from the ban?\n\nWoven plastic tote bags with stitched handles that many establishments, including supermarkets and big-box retailers, sell at checkout lines for about $1 to $2.\n\nMeat department bags that wrap uncooked beef, fish, poultry, etc.\n\nProduce bags to hold fruits and vegetables along with others to hold loose items such as nuts, coffee, grains, baked goods, candy and flowers.\n\nPet store bags used to hold live animals, such as fish.\n\nDeli bags that contain sliced or prepared food.\n\nDry cleaning bags\n\nPharmacy bags to carry prescription drugs\n\nNewspaper bags\n\nWhat are alternatives to plastic bags?\n\nThe law essentially wants shoppers to bring their own bags, and they can be made of anything.\n\nStores are stocking up on woven plastic tote bags to sell, along with those made of canvas, hemp and other materials.\n\nAlthough environmentalists and regulators often refer to thin plastic grocery store bags as \"single-use,\" many people have reused them for other purposes, from picking up dog droppings to lining small trash cans.\n\nMost New Jerseyans will now have to buy bags, refrain from using them at all or use free bags that are exempt from the law (see above).\n\nMore on environment:Montclair proposes 'one-of-a-kind' law to slow the alarming decline of pollinator insects\n\nAre plastic garbage bags still available?\n\nYes.\n\nTrash can liners, heavy-duty contractor disposal bags and other plastic garbage bags will still be available for sale.\n\nAre paper bags banned everywhere?\n\nNo.\n\nThe bill bans paper bags only at larger grocery stores.\n\nThis also includes big-box stores such as Costco, Target and Walmart if they have large grocery sections of at least 2,500 square feet.\n\nAny other store — from a restaurant filling takeout orders to a boutique selling clothes — can still use paper bags.\n\nYou can also still buy paper lawn and leaf bags.\n\nThe ban on paper bags did not come from the environmental lobby but from the supermarket lobby.\n\nAs the bill was being debated in Trenton, representatives for the New Jersey Food Council pushed hard for a paper bag ban in return for supporting the plastic bag ban. Supermarkets did not want the additional expense of providing more costly paper bags.\n\nWhat plastic containers are banned?\n\nThe new law bans most food and beverage containers made from polystyrene, commonly referred to as Styrofoam.\n\nThe most common of these are the white and black clamshell containers used at buffets and for hot-food takeout orders.\n\nThe ban also includes:\n\nFoam cups for hot and cold drinks.\n\nVegetable trays.\n\nEgg cartons.\n\nSmall businesses that have less than $500,000 in annual revenue can apply for an exemption for one year if they find no \"reasonably affordable\" alternative.\n\nMore:NJ to receive $15M in federal money to build electric vehicle charging stations\n\nWhat containers are exempt?\n\nOther foam products are not slated to be banned until May 4, 2024. They include:\n\nTrays for raw meat, poultry or fish.\n\nPrepackaged foam containers such as for ramen noodles or macaroni and cheese.\n\nSmall cups of 2 ounces or less used for hot foods.\n\nLong-handled spoons used for milkshakes and smoothies.\n\nAre plastic straws banned?\n\nNo.\n\nBut plastic straws can be given out now only when requested, under a provision in the law that took effect in November.\n\nEarly versions of the bill had an outright ban on plastic straws, but advocates said those with physical disabilities should still be allowed to request them when dining out. No proof of a disability is required.\n\nStill, six months into the new regulation, many restaurants and other businesses still supply plastic straws unsolicited with every drink order.\n\nAre packing peanuts banned?\n\nNot yet.\n\nThose lightweight, easily blown-away pieces of polystyrene will be banned in New Jersey in early 2024.\n\nThey were covered under a separate law signed by Murphy in January.\n\nMy town already has a plastic ban. What happens to it?\n\nIt's done, kaput, gone, adios.\n\nThe state law preempts and nullifies any municipal or county regulations on plastic bags, foam containers and plastic straws.\n\nWho enforces all of this, and what are the penalties?\n\nThe state Department of Environmental Protection delegates enforcement authority to local health departments.\n\nFirst offense is a warning. Second offense is a fine of up to $1,000. Third and subsequent offenses carry fines of up to $5,000.\n\nIf you have more questions about New Jersey's plastic bans, reach out to Scott Fallon at fallon@northjersey.com.

Excessive calorie consumption, consumer spending and a superfluity of trash and pollution.\n\nBetween Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, The National Environmental Education Foundation reports Americans will throw away 25% more trash than usual.\n\nThink wrapping paper, plastic packaging, cardboard shipping boxes and various other holiday trash. Combined that's a million extra tons of garbage each week. Additionally, the increase in online shopping with fast delivery options results in more carbon emissions during the holidays.\n\n\"The environmental and sustainability issues of everyday life don’t go away during the holiday season, though it is easy to get caught up in the excitement of it all,\" said Raegan Stremel, marketing manager at Rainbow Blossom Natural Market and Wellness Center in Louisville.\n\nThe good news is a few simple choices can help reframe our collective excessive holiday habits. Stremel says eco-friendly merrymaking means a time of good cheer with less waste and more positive consumer outcomes.\n\n\"If every person makes one small change, whether it’s buying a local product that reduces transit time and fuel consumption, buying more organically grown or raised food items for your holiday meal to signal the importance of clean waterways and healthy land, or making a DIY gift instead of buying something heavily packaged to reduce waste, the accumulative effect will make a big difference,\" she said.\n\nJoan Frisz, executive director of Just Creations, 2722 Frankfort Ave., says we can all start making more environmental and ethical decisions when we slow down this holiday season and ask ourselves some questions before purchasing gifts, decor for your home or gift wrapping supplies.\n\nYou may like:Shop local: Here are 5 gifts of experience for everyone on your holiday shopping list\n\n\"Ask yourself, will my purchase benefit others?\" said Frisz. \"Also, can I buy locally so my money goes back into my community? And is this purchase something that is an impulse buy or is it truly needed?\"\n\nWhen we mindfully buy, decorate and give during the holiday season, you'll likely find it's not just easier on the environment, it's easier on you.\n\nHere are 10 small eco-friendly holiday ideas to help you begin to reduce your environmental footprint this holiday season while also benefiting others.\n\nThink before you buy\n\nThis holiday season, try to buy some of your gifts from a local businesses that follow social and environmental practices or supports local artists, craftspeople or farmers.\n\nFor example, Just Creations, a staple of the Crescent Hill neighborhood shopping corridor for 30 years, is a not-for-profit Fair Trade gift boutique that provides support to artisans and farmers in more than 40 countries around the world. With the income the artisans receive, they are able to pay for the basic necessities of life.\n\nBased in the Portland neighborhood, Anchal Project is another local example of a nonprofit social enterprise. Sisters Colleen and Maggie Clines launched Anchal Project to work hand in hand with female artisans from around the world by employing them to create home decor textiles, scarves, apparel and more.\n\nWorried about shopping in person> During the pandemic, it's nice to know that even small businesses are offering plenty of online shopping and some are even offering curbside pickup. Check with each local shop before you go.\n\nYou may like:Shop local: Here are 5 gift ideas for the family to help you celebrate the holiday indoors\n\nKeep Mother Nature in mind\n\nPeople may know Rainbow Blossom for its healthy food and vitamins but the natural foods and wellness center also carries Fair Trade and eco-friendly gifts in its five Louisville and Southern Indiana stores.\n\n\"When you shop locally, you also help the environment by reducing the amount of fuel consumption and emissions required to transport goods across the country,\" said Stremel. \"Try to select products that come in minimal packaging, are made from sustainable materials, and can be easily recycled. You could also choose gifts that help people live more sustainably, like a compost bin or a reusable water bottle.\"\n\nRainbow Blossom sells Pangea Organic soap packaged in a box made of seeds and 100% recyclable paper. You can plant the packaging and it will sprout into flowers or plants.\n\nThe store also sells seed packet cards that the recipient can sow in the spring.\n\nYou may like:Shop local: Here are 6 Kentucky-made gift ideas for the holiday shopping season\n\nRethink your Christmas cards\n\nHundreds of thousands of trees will be harvested in order to supply the 1.3 billion holiday cards that are expected to be sent in the U.S. this year alone, according to a Household Diary Study, a national research effort sponsored by USPS. How about giving the trees a break this year and consider using holiday e-cards from websites like americangreetings.com, evite.com or greenvelope.com.\n\nIf you must send holiday greetings through the mail, be sure to choose cards made from 100% recycled paper that can easily be recycled. That means choosing cards without any non-paper embellishments like foil or ribbon.\n\nFind a better way to wrap\n\nOK, you've made the effort to buy some socially and environmentally responsible gifts —now be sure to wrap them that way, too.\n\nMost mass-produced wrapping paper you find in drug stores and big box stores is not recyclable because of the shiny coatings, foils and colors, and therefore ends up in landfills.\n\nInstead, here’s a great chance to get creative. Wrap presents with old maps, newspapers, paper grocery bags or children’s artwork. Or use a scarf, attractive dish towel, bandana, or some other useful cloth item that is a gift itself.\n\nAccessorize your gifts with reusable cloth ribbon or twine and tuck in a sprig of evergreen, holly or from a boxwood shrub. An ornament you no longer use is also a great way to re-purpose and accessorize. Old or unused cards cut into gift tags and attached to each gift is another way to re-purpose, too.\n\nYou can also wrap gifts in renewable paper and ribbon from eco-friendly businesses like Wrappily. Milled, printed, and packaged in the U.S. visit wrappily.com for details.\n\nYou may like:Shop local: Here are 5 holiday gift ideas from Black-owned businesses in Louisville\n\nTransform old holiday decor\n\nBefore you run out to the store to buy more decorations, consider what you already have in storage. Last year's wreath, wrapping paper and ribbons, garlands and tree decorations can often be transformed by pulling them apart and using it to fluff up and fill in other decor around your home.\n\nRemember, it's OK to use the same decorations year after year. Things like family heirlooms make the best decorations and are automatically sustainable.\n\nUse live trees and plant after the holiday\n\nFrank Otte Nursery and Garden Center, 2930 Bardstown Road, stocks a wide variety of live Christmas trees including White Pines Canadian Hemlock, Norway Spruce and Colorado Blue Spruce. Sizes range from 4- to 8-feet and depending on the type cost between $130 and $299. Frank Otte staff can give you lots of tips on growing and planting for after the holiday season, too.\n\nGarden centers are also a prime spot to pick up greenery for garlands, wreaths and table arrangements. If you do buy a cut tree, be sure to recycle. Metro Louisville residents with city curbside yard waste pick-up may set their Christmas trees and greenery out on their regular collection day. Free drop-off sites will also be provided with locations and dates to be determined. Check louisvilleky.gov for details.\n\nYou may like:Shop local: 5 unique kid-friendly gift ideas from Louisville stores for the holiday season\n\nThink outside the 'gift' box\n\nThere are many ways to reduce your consumption impact when giving holiday gifts. Consider buying herbs and other edible items in bulk to make gifts like homemade vanilla extract and savory or sweet popcorn.\n\n\"We sell herbs in bulk, which can make a wonderful tea you can mix up and gift in a mason jar,\" said Stremel. \"Rainbow Blossom also sells bulk walnuts which can be candied and put into a reusable canister, jar or bowl and which is also becomes part of the gift.\"\n\nBy giving gifts that can be experienced, you can minimize wrapping and shopping, and the recipient will have a memory that will last. A gift of an experience can also be fun like a trip to the Louisville Mega Cavern, a museum membership or a musical experience.\n\nBuy energy-saving LED holiday lights\n\nAccording to Consumer Reports, energy-efficient LED light strings are a good choice if you are decorating for the holidays.\n\nIt's true LEDs that are more expensive than regular incandescent holiday lights but they are cooler, reducing the risk of holiday tree fires. They also last longer and use less power, and the energy savings over time will offset the slightly higher initial purchase price. LED bulbs use 1 to 3-kilowatt hours of energy, while incandescent bulbs use 12 to 105 KWh, translating into annual savings of $1 to $11.\n\nIn a side by side comparison, Consumer Reports found LED bulbs were working after 4,000 hours of use, while each string of incandescent lights had one or more bulbs burn out before 2,000 hours of use.\n\nAs an added bonus, when one LED bulb goes out, the rest of the lights keep on glowing.\n\nYou may like:Need to navigate tricky conversations at the holiday dinner table? Check out these tips\n\nConsider rechargeable batteries\n\nSwitch to rechargeable batteries. Batteries are not recyclable and are often thrown away after just one use. Replacing alkaline batteries with rechargeable ones (newer models can charge in as little as 15 minutes) can really help the environment, especially during the holidays when about 40% of battery sales occur in the U.S.\n\nRemember, alkaline batteries contain toxic materials and should not be thrown into the trash. Visit Louisvilleky.gov to find an authorized recycling facility near you.\n\nAdd organic, local food to your holiday feast\n\nSupport local family farmers who grow sustainable meat and produce. Not only is local, organic food tasty, you’ll also be doing your part for your community and the planet too, by cutting down on transportation and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nVisit your local farmers market or health food grocery to find an organic turkey or humane ham and local vegetables for that perfect holiday dinner.\n\nDuring these uncertain times, controlling what you can in your life can enhance your personal happiness. So go 'green' this holiday season and gain back some of that peace of mind 2020 has stolen from us all.\n\nReach Kirby Adams at kadams@courier-journal.com or Twitter @kirbylouisville.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/23"}]}

Ryan Kryska/AP\n\nAn online posting with antisemitic comments in a forum frequented by extremists prompted an FBI alert Thursday night, CNN reported.\n\nAuthorities were alarmed because the posting was written as if an attack had already occurred, the sources explained. Similar writings have been posted by “active shooters” in incidents across the country just before their attacks.\n\nThat factored significantly into the urgency of locating him and also releasing the broad warning to the Jewish community, the sources said.\n\nThe online threat arrived at a moment of rising antisemitism in the US, as public incidents of bigotry have surfaced around the nation, from Florida to California.\n\n“Each and every law enforcement agency in New Jersey stood up yesterday to protect and communicate with our Jewish neighbors against hate,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement Friday. “From direct contact to synagogue leadership, to uniformed and non-uniformed police presences at places of worship, our State Police, federal partners, county prosecutor’s officers, local police departments, sheriffs and other law enforcement moved swiftly to protect synagogues and Jewish centers.”\n\n“While this immediate threat has been mitigated, we know that others may follow and we know that hate continues to fester,” the attorney general added.\n\nIt’s unclear at this time what, if any, charges the individual connected to the New Jersey synagogues threat will face.\n\nCNN has contacted the FBI for comment.\n\n‘Credible information of a broad threat’\n\nOn Thursday, the FBI in Newark tweeted it had received “credible information of a broad threat to synagogues” in the state.\n\n“We ask at this time that you take all security precautions to protect your community and facility. We will share more information as soon as we can. Stay alert. In case of emergency call police,” the post said.\n\nIn a second tweet, the agency said it was taking a “proactive measure” with that warning, while “investigative processes are carried out.”\n\nWhile no specific target, timing or plan was mentioned, the nature of the post created enough concern that the FBI decided to put a general warning out of an abundance of caution, the law enforcement sources said.\n\nPart of that concern, the sources added, comes because of previous mass killings involving extremists who posted on social media, including the 2018 Pittsburgh synagogue killings, the deadliest attack on Jewish people on US soil; the 2019 mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, the deadliest attack on Latinos in modern US history; and the May massacre at a Buffalo supermarket, an attack which officials said was racially motivated.\n\nThursday evening, the FBI said it takes all threats seriously and was working with law enforcement to investigate the threat and was also “engaged with our faith based partners in the affected community.”\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday, “This remains a tense time for our Jewish communities who are facing a wave of anti-Semitic activity.”\n\nMurphy said he was grateful to the FBI and other law enforcement partners “for their tireless efforts in mitigating the immediate threat to our Jewish synagogues.”\n\n“We will remain vigilant. We will take any and every threat with the utmost seriousness and we will stand up and stand shoulder to shoulder with our Jewish congregations.”\n\nAdvice from a security company\n\nThe president of a company that provides security for hundreds of Jewish houses of worship and schools in the New Jersey and New York area has sent out guidance to clients to ask for additional security from law enforcement, he told CNN.\n\nSynagogues should contact local law enforcement and “request not just increased patrols but actual manpower during prayers and other activities,” said Joshua Gleis, of Gleis Security Consulting.\n\nGleis also advised synagogues not to conduct outdoor activities until further notice and to pull down exterior shades.\n\nHe also advised Jewish schools in the area to take similar actions until more information is available, as “any credible threat to a Jewish synagogue can become one to a Jewish school or community center.”\n\nThe NYPD also said Thursday its Intelligence and Counterterrorism Bureaus were working with the Joint Terrorism Task Force and the FBI to “ensure the safety and well-being of every area that encompasses our Jewish citizens and synagogues here in New York City and the tri-state area.”\n\nAntisemitic comments across the country\n\nOver the past few years, the US has seen a rise in antisemitic incidents, with 941 incidents in 2015 jumping to 2,717 tracked in 2021 by the Anti-Defamation League. On Thursday, the ADL said it was working with the FBI to address the credible threat and advised synagogues and Jewish organizations to “remain calm and in heightened state of alert.”\n\nThe FBI’s warning on Thursday comes amid continued reports across the country of anti-Jewish bigotry, including multiple antisemitic messages that appeared in public spaces in Jacksonville, Florida, over the weekend, and a group of demonstrators who hung banners over a Los Angeles freeway earlier in October showing support for antisemitic comments that were made by Kanye West. Photos also showed the group with their arms raised in what appeared to be the Nazi salute. Los Angeles officials condemned the incident.\n\nWest previously made a series of antisemitic outbursts, notably on October 8, when he tweeted he was “going death con 3 [sic] On JEWISH PEOPLE,” and also that, “You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda,” without specifying what group he was addressing, according to the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine records pulled by CNN.\n\nHis tweet was removed and Twitter locked his account. In an interview conducted after the controversial tweet, West told Piers Morgan that he was sorry for the people that he hurt but said he didn’t regret making the remark.", "authors": ["John Miller Rob Frehse Christina Maxouris", "John Miller", "Rob Frehse", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/metro-government/2020/03/17/coronavirus-louisville-police-wont-go-some-traffic-accidents/5068835002/", "title": "Coronavirus in Louisville: Police won't go to some traffic accidents", "text": "Louisville Metro Police have limited the types of calls officers will respond to in an attempt to limit COVID-19 exposure to officers and to the public, officials announced Tuesday.\n\nUnder a special order issued Monday by Chief Steve Conrad, the department will no longer respond to \"most non-violent criminal incidents requiring a police report\" or to low-level calls for service where no one is in \"immediate danger.\"\n\nThe agency hasn't seen an increase in illnesses or absences from COVID-19, but Conrad said in a call with reporters Tuesday that the department's steps are meant to keep officers and the community safe.\n\n\"We could have a situation where an infected officer that we're not aware of ends up interacting with people in a non-emergency situation and making those folks sick,\" Conrad said. \"This is about keeping our first responders safe, so they're in a position to respond to emergencies, and also about keeping our citizens safe.\"\n\nLive updates:Get the latest information on the coronavirus in Kentucky\n\nConrad's order says the following calls for service won't lead to an officer dispatch:\n\nLoitering\n\nTrespass\n\nBurglar alarms\n\nDisorderly persons\n\nDrinking in public or intoxicated persons\n\nLoud music or noise complaints\n\nAnnoying or obscene phone calls\n\nReckless driving\n\nNeighborhood complaints\n\nIllegal parking\n\nSpeeding\n\nReports of other incidents — theft, noninjury accidents, hit-and-run accidents, criminal mischief, burglary in the second and third degree (with no items stolen, no suspects or other connected crimes) and missing persons — will be directed to LMPD's service center to make a telephone report or lead to a request to fill out a state form.\n\n[This story is being provided for free to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak.

One patient, a man from Bourbon County, has died.\n\nConrad said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday that the police changes are in line with the agency's pandemic response plan, which has been recently updated and includes protocols for monitoring employee health, best practices for avoiding illness and use of personal protective equipment.\n\nThe department is also conducting roll calls by radio, canceling training for current officers and suspending vacation requests until further notice, according to Conrad's orders, which were shared with The Courier Journal.\n\nMayor Greg Fischer praised the steps being taken by Conrad, adding that it's \"smart\" for the chief and the department to think about contingency planning for the future.\n\nCoronavirus tracker:How many cases are in Kentucky? Where are they?\n\nA document detailing different plans for calls for service limitations notes that the step can be taken in response to severe weather, personnel shortages or unexpected incidents.\n\nThe department is currently operating under \"Plan B,\" the second-highest level, according to the special order.\n\nFischer pointed out earlier Tuesday that the response protocols are similar to those that can be put in place during bad weather, when an officer may not respond to a noninjury accident, for example.\n\n\"For a crime, unless it's a violent crime, we're asking you just to call the details of the crime into the office,\" he said, adding that the police would still be \"attending to all violent crime taking place.\"\n\nDarcy Costello: 502-582-4834; dcostello@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @dctello.

Instead of dialing 911 residents should call the 311 nonemergency line or go to iReportAustin.com, to report an incident where there is \"no immediate threat to life or property; when a crime is no longer in progress and when the suspect(s) are no longer at the scene or in sight.\"\n\nThis change also is a result of a review of recommendations by the department's Reimagining Public Safety Task Force and recent staffing shortages, Chacon said. This move will allow patrol officers to respond more quickly to 911 calls where there is \"a threat to life and property.\"\n\nThe new policy also aligns with the department's COVID-19 protocols aimed at reducing patrol officer contact with the public \"while still providing essential services,\" he said.\n\nChacon did not say whether the department has enough employees to handle the 311 nonemergency calls and reports.\n\n\"I am going to be asking for your patience,\" said Chacon, who was officially appointed as the city's new police chief Thursday. \"We're just going to be working to do the best that we can, given the circumstances that we have regarding staffing, to still be timely in our response and make sure that people have an opportunity to report crimes.\"\n\nAmy Mok, a decadeslong advocate of Austin's Asian American community said the move was done with Austin's most vulnerable communities — the older, immigrant, non-English speaking— as an afterthought.\n\n\"This just wasn't very thoughtful,\" Mok said. \"And it adds an extra level of anxiety, confusion and mistrust that was already there.\"\n\nAsian Americans across the country, as well as in Texas and Austin, became the target of racial aggression in the past year, triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. In recent months, the Police Department had made significant efforts to reach out and build trust in Austin's Asian American community through workshops and community forums, but those facing language and technological barriers were not considered when this policy change was announced, Mok said.\n\n\"How are people supposed to assess each emergency, each situation, which is already stressful enough,\" she said. \"They need to come up with a comprehensive introduction about this policy. Are 311 responders going to be able to help non-English speakers? Are they properly trained? Who are they?\"\n\nIn a series about police reform, the American-Statesman reported that by June more than 130 officers had left the force in the past year. City Council members last year also canceled three cadet classes to give officials time to modify the police academy's training, which left no rookies in the department to replace them. A group of about 70 cadets is set to begin patrols early next year.\n\nSome Austin residents fear the rerouting of nonemergency calls will increase crimes.\n\nJill Ramirez, owns Coronado Print Studio in Southeast Austin. In the past year, her business has been broken into at least four times, she said. Ramirez opted to board up her building's windows, and she once paid for security to watch her property at night.\n\nShe said police patrols are not as visible as they were in previous years in the neighborhood near Vargas Road and Felix Avenue. She worries the burglaries in the area won't stop.\n\n\"I'm sad. Not having police officers come out is probably going to make it worse. People are going to know that officers won't be coming out, and it'll make it worse,\" Ramirez said. \"This just makes me feel more unsafe. There's more uncertainty. I already don't go out to my studio when it gets dark, but I should be able to. I should be able to feel safe in my neighborhood, in any neighborhood.\"\n\nThe announcement on the Austin Police Department's Facebook page on Wednesday garnered more than 500 comments from the public, many of them opposed to the move and saying the department is in immediate need of more staff.\n\nSome community advocates said the change in emergency response by the department is a reaction to criticism and a political move.\n\nNelson Linder, NAACP Austin chapter president and who opposed Chacon's appointment as police chief, was among community leaders who demanded a significant change in the Police Department's leadership after concerns about officer training, the way sexual assaults are investigated and how the department treats people of color.\n\nHe said this move doesn't prioritize rebuilding trust with Austin's disenfranchised communities.\n\n\"It's concerning,\" Linder said. \"There needs to be a cultural reset to understand the communities that don't fully trust the police. There's work that needs to be done that has not been done out in the streets.

But the Support Team Assistance Response (STAR) pilot program created a third track for directing emergency calls to a two-person team: a medic and a clinician, staffed in a van from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays.\n\nThe STAR program, which launched in June, reported promising results in its six-month progress report. The program aims to provide a \"person-centric mobile crisis response\" to community members who are experiencing problems related to mental health, depression, poverty, homelessness, or substance abuse issues.\n\nDenver is among several U.S. cities working to develop an alternative emergency responder model for people who are experiencing mental health crises, as police officers fatally shoot hundreds of people experiencing mental health crises every year, according to a Washington Post database of fatal shootings by on-duty police officers. Since 2015, police have fatally shot nearly 1,400 people with mental illnesses, according to the database.\n\nOver the first six months of the pilot, Denver received more than 2,500 emergency calls that fell into the STAR program's purview, and the STAR team was able to respond to 748 calls. No calls required the assistance of police, and no one was arrested.\n\nDenver police responded to nearly 95,000 incidents over the same period, suggesting that an expanded STAR program could reduce police calls by nearly 3%, according to the report.\n\n\"Overall, the first six months has kind of been a proof of concept of what we wanted,\" said Vinnie Cervantes, a member of Denver Alliance for Street Health Response, one of the organizations involved with the STAR program. \"We've continued to try to work to make it something that is truly a community-city partnership.\"\n\nData collected during the pilot program found that STAR calls were focused in certain areas of the city, and most were calls for trespassing and welfare checks. Approximately 68% of people contacted were experiencing homelessness, and there were mental health concerns in 61% of cases – largely schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder – with 33% of people having co-occurring conditions, according to the report.\n\nCarleigh Sailon, a social worker with the Mental Health Center of Denver who works out of the STAR van, said she takes a \"non-judgmental, client-centered, supportive\" approach to assisting people in crisis.\n\n\"The intent of STAR is to send the right response, not a one-size fit all response. People call 911 for an array of reasons and it’s not always something that involves risk or a criminal element,\" Sailon said in a statement. \"If the STAR van can handle someone in crisis and that frees up police to handle a robbery or domestic violence call, then that’s an incredible success.\"\n\nThe report comes on the heels of a year that saw thousands of protests nationwide in response to the killings of several Black men and women, as well as a series of high-profile police killings of people experiencing mental health crises, including Daniel Prude in Rochester, New York, and Walter Wallace, Jr. in Philadelphia. Many protesters called on their local governments to redirect funding away from police departments.\n\nIn recent years, some police departments, such as in Los Angeles and San Antonio, have partnered with mental health professionals to work as \"co-responders,\" assisting street cops responding to incidents involving a mental health crisis. In the wake of Breonna Taylor's killing in Louisville last year, the city increased its police budget and put money toward exploring co-responder models. And Chicago is expected to begin piloting a co-responder program this year.\n\nBut other cities rely on emergency response models that do not involve police. The Denver program is modeled after the Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets (CAHOOTS) in Eugene, Oregon. White Bird Clinic, a health care center in the city, launched the program as a community policing initiative in 1989.\n\nLike the Denver program, CAHOOTS responds to a range of mental health-related crises and relies on techniques that are focused on harm reduction. With a budget of about $2.1 million annually, CAHOOTS answered 17% of the Eugene Police Department's overall call volume in 2017, according to the program.\n\nIn 2019, Cervantes traveled with a group from Denver to Eugene to study the CAHOOTS model. Cervantes said his organization, the Denver Alliance for Street Health Response, is working with about ten other cities in Colorado to draft co-responder models. Aurora – where 23-year-old Elijah McClain died after officers stopped him on the street in 2019 – is expected to launch its pilot in about a month, Cervantes said.\n\nJan. 15:Family of man fatally shot by Texas officer responding to mental health call want arrest\n\nOn the East Coast, New York City announced plans in November to launch a similar pilot program in two neighborhoods.\n\nFor the coming year, Denver has allocated $1.4 million in the city's budget to continue the STAR program, according to the report. The funding would be enough to purchase four additional vans and fund six new two-person teams, as well as a full-time supervisor, the report said. The program is also transitioning from the city's safety department to its public health department.\n\nCervantes said that, as the program goes forward, he hopes to see more complete data on who the program is serving. Current data does not list race or ethnicity for a third of people served by the program, Cervantes said.\n\n\"That's something that surprises me,\" Cervantes said. \"How do we really understand the impact of the most marginalized communities in Denver if we don’t have the data there?\"\n\nCervantes said the STAR program set out to connect residents in crisis with social services in the city, as well as identify the gaps in many of the services. When the coronavirus pandemic shut down many of the existing services, it made STAR's task more difficult.\n\n\"With COVID, some of the services that would typically be available weren’t quite in full service. That’s something the STAR program had to adapt to,\" he said.\n\nThe STAR program is organized through a coalition of city agencies and organizations, including the Denver Police Department, Denver Health Paramedic Division, Denver 911, the Caring for Denver Foundation, the Mental Health Center of Denver and community supporters.\n\nFollow breaking news reporter Grace Hauck on Twitter @grace_hauck.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/04/us/power-outage-moore-county-criminal-investigation/index.html", "title": "NC county announces curfew as nearly 40,000 customers remain ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAuthorities have announced a mandatory curfew in a North Carolina county where around 40,000 customers lost power after two power substations were damaged by gunfire Saturday night.\n\nThe county will implement a mandatory curfew from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m., starting Sunday night, Moore County Sheriff Ronnie Fields said at a news conference Sunday.\n\nMunicipality and county officials “have formed a plan for the night and the next few nights that we may be out of power. It’s a very serious situation,” Fields said. “So we’ve come to an agreement to best protect our citizens and to protect the businesses of our county, we’re going to implement a curfew tonight.”\n\nA state of emergency went into effect at 4 p.m. Sunday as law enforcement, city and energy officials are investigating the incident and working to restore the two substations, authorities said. Law enforcement has also been providing security for the stations, according to the sheriff.\n\nThe power outage is being investigated as a “criminal occurrence” after crews found signs of potential vandalism at several locations, CNN previously reported.\n\nFields said multiple rounds were fired at the two substations. “It was targeted, it wasn’t random,” he said.\n\nNo suspects have been identified in connection with the incident.

Parents, some in tears, watched anxiously from behind police lines, eager to embrace their kids.\n\nJust hours prior, students and parents feared Hopewell may be the latest school to endure an active shooter incident. Police ultimately determined the report was fake — part of a spate of “swatting” calls made to elicit a large police presence and stir chaos — but the community's terror in those moments was real.\n\n“It was scary sitting at home and not knowing if my friends and peers were safe, or even alive,” said senior Gillian Morse, who had gone home sick earlier that day. “I know I bear a very light load of trauma, but I was absolutely terrified. It's not easy thinking about having to go to your friends’ funerals at 18.”\n\nWhen Aliquippa police received reports of an armed gunman and casualties at Hopewell Senior High School Wednesday morning, first responders were on the scene within minutes.\n\nOther incidents reported:Hoax swatting calls bring police, lockdowns to schools throughout Pennsylvania. What we know\n\nPolice soon learned the school was one of many in Pennsylvania targeted by “swatting” calls falsely reporting an active shooter inside the building. Several districts in western Pennsylvania, including New Castle Junior-Senior High School, treated these threats as credible and told students to shelter in place or evacuate when possible.\n\n“It was the most terrified I have ever been,” Denise Pascia, whose daughter attends Hopewell High School\n\n“It truly sickens me that this is a situation kids my age and younger have to fear every single day,” said Bella Leseiko, a senior from Hopewell Township. “We as a society should feel safe in our school systems. It was easily one of the worst situations I’ve ever been in and I wouldn’t wish this on absolutely anybody.”\n\nFalse threats cause panic among families\n\nThe out-of-state, computer-generated hoax calls, now under investigation by Pennsylvania State Police, alarmed staff, students and families.\n\nAt Hopewell, students and staff were placed on lockdown just before 10:30 a.m. with little information. As a result, families outside the school assumed the worst as reports from police scanners indicated a potential shooter in the building.\n\nStudents said they were \"terrified,\" but some still asked their family members to avoid the area to stay safe. As students evacuated the building, many could be seen holding each other close.\n\nMore:Police sent to Erie High on bogus school shooting report as hoaxes hit other Pa. schools\n\n\"People are having such different responses to the whole situation,\" said Giovanni Krebs, a senior at Hopewell High School. \"Even though it was extremely stressful, I am more than glad no one was injured. All I could think about the entire time was if my sister was safe. When a classmate showed me a text saying there were 'six shot' I prayed it wasn't her. To find out it was all a hoax, nobody was injured and that we all had to go through that for a prank call honestly makes me angry more than anything.\"\n\nFor parents, it was a gut-wrenching morning.\n\n“It was the most terrified I have ever been,” said Denise Pascia, a Moon Township preschool assistant whose daughter attends Hopewell High School. “I can’t even explain the feeling of that.”\n\nParents unable to be at the scene Wednesday scrambled for credible information early on. Charissa Yoko-Schwartz, a Hopewell Township parent and employee at UPMC Children's Hospital, first received word about reports of a shooter at Central Catholic High School in Pittsburgh before hearing about the incident in Hopewell Township.\n\n\"When a coworker said Hopewell was 'under attack,' too, I thought it was odd for two schools in the area to have active shooters,\" Yoko-Schwartz said.\n\n\"However, my emotions ran high until I heard from my son and knew he was safe. Not knowing was difficult, and waiting to hear from the school was frustrating, but the logical side of me kept saying the authorities needed time to sweep the building, and the longer it took the more likely it was a hoax. If there were casualties, there would have been more chatter, more reporting, more online posts.\"\n\nUPMC Children's Hospital staff remained ready for a potential emergency situation, but no calls came to the medical center.\n\nJust days after an active shooter killed six people, including three children, at a Nashville, Tenn., private school, Hopewell students and their parents said Wednesday marked \"one of the scariest days\" of their lives.\n\n\"I've never been so afraid,\" said Ambridge resident Brittany Williams, who waited outside the school Wednesday for information about her daughter who attends Hopewell Junior High. \"I felt like I couldn't take a full breath, I was just in terror. I'm just glad everyone is OK.\"\n\nPhotos from Hopewell lockdown:Hopewell High school locked down by hoax active shooter call\n\nFirst responders address false reports and 'swatting'\n\nHopewell Area Superintendent Jeff Beltz said Aliquippa police received a call from someone claiming to be “locked down in a bathroom” at the high school Wednesday morning. The school was locked down and cleared by police.\n\nSenior high students had initially evacuated to Hopewell Junior High, but were later moved to Margaret Ross Elementary as the junior high was cleared. Once both schools were cleared by early Wednesday afternoon, remaining students were moved to the Hopewell Shopping Center to be transported home following an early dismissal as police continued to investigate the scene.\n\nThe New Castle City Police Department received a call from a “male threatening to shoot up New Castle High School” around the same time Hopewell responded to the threats, but upon further investigation found many other schools received fake threats involving active shooters or potential bombs. New Castle High was immediately put on lockdown following the threats, with police officers clearing the school within minutes, officers said.\n\n“Swatting” is a term used to describe false reports made to law enforcement to elicit a heavy police response. Often, those who facilitate swatting hoaxes use technology to make it appear as if the call is coming from a victim’s phone.\n\nBeaver County District Attorney David Lozier said Hopewell was the only district in the county to receive the call, which falsely reported \"six casualties\" in the building. Officers received the call around 10:20 a.m., Lozier said, with Beaver County SWAT and local police responding “very fast.”\n\n“Within 15 minutes, it was pretty clear there were no reports of an actual event or casualties,” Lozier said.\n\nNearby school districts, including Rochester, Aliquippa, Blackhawk, Ambridge and Riverside went on lockdown as police investigated the scene at Hopewell.\n\nCentral Catholic High School and Oakland Catholic in Pittsburgh were also targeted by the “computer-generated swatting calls,” according to Allegheny County Emergency Services. Allegheny County received calls reporting an active shooter in three separate schools. Farrell Area School District in Mercer County was targeted, too.\n\nStudents call for action\n\nFor many families, the incident and recent events in national news continue to prompt questions about student safety and school shootings in the United States. As over 89 gun-related incidents have occurred on school campus in 2023, those scared by Wednesday's events want to see some form of change to prevent a serious incident from happening.\n\nMass shootings database:Mass killing database: Revealing trends, details and anguish of every US event since 2006\n\n“I’m angry that there isn’t more being done to mitigate incidents like these,” Morse, the Hopewell senior, said. “Mass shootings have been a problem for years and so many lawmakers don’t seem to care enough. I, a high school senior, shouldn’t have to walk into school every day worrying if I’m going to make it to the end of the school year because someone decides to take other people's lives.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/03/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/04/asia/itaewon-seoul-korea-halloween-crush-timeline-intl-hnk-dst/index.html", "title": "Seoul Halloween crush: How the disaster in Itaewon unfolded | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nA fresh graduate in her first full-time job; a teenager who helped raise her siblings after their father’s death; a foreign exchange student excited for his first trip to Asia.\n\nIn the seven days since 156 people were killed in a Halloween crush in the South Korean capital, the names and stories of those who died have emerged, along with details of missed warnings and desperate calls for help.\n\nAccording to police emergency call logs, multiple calls were made as early as four hours before the tragedy unfolded, as the crowd in Seoul’s buzzy nightlife district Itaewon became so packed that partygoers were unable to move or breathe.\n\nVideos taken over the course of that night show revelers realizing, at first slowly then in a rush of panic, that what was supposed to be a fun night out was spiraling dangerously out of control.\n\nPolice ultimately sent four police dispatches to the site that evening, but too few and too late to prevent the disaster.\n\nFamilies are mourning the loss of their loved ones, with most victims in their teens and 20s.

Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images In pictures: Seoul Halloween crowd surge Prev Next\n\nCrowds growing and early warnings\n\nHalloween in Itaewon isn’t a single event held by an organizer – rather, it’s a popular place for young people, often dressed in elaborate costumes, to go bar hopping and clubbing.\n\nFrom the Itaewon subway station, the main nightlife strip can be accessed via a sloping alleyway less than 4 meters wide (13 feet), that runs between the brick wall of the Hamilton Hotel and some stores. On weekends, the alley becomes a busy thoroughfare for people coming and going, giving it a convivial atmosphere where friends meet up and party.\n\nBy 4 p.m. on October 29, crowds had become “significantly big,” said Park Chang-ki, a parking attendant who worked across the road from the alley where most of the crush took place.\n\nBy 5 p.m., the alley was so packed it was completely blocked off, according to the owner of a restaurant facing the alley.\n\nAt 6:34 p.m., police received an emergency call – the first of 11 increasingly urgent calls that first pleaded for crowd control, then for rescuers.\n\n“That alley doesn’t look safe … It feels like (people) can be crushed to death,” the caller said. “I barely escaped, I think you need to control this, there are simply too many people.”\n\n“Police will come out and check that out,” the officer responded.\n\nBy 7 p.m., people in the alley were spilling out onto the adjacent main road, said Park, the parking attendant.\n\nAccording to police logs, the second emergency call came just after 8 p.m., with the caller saying people were being pushed, falling and getting hurt. “It’s chaotic … I think it needs to be controlled somehow,” the caller said.\n\nSimilar warnings, growing more dire, soon followed.\n\nJust after 8:30 p.m., a caller warned police the situation was “really serious.” Twenty minutes later, another caller said it felt like a “madhouse.”\n\n“It’s not a joke. It’s not a prank call,” they said, adding: “I beg you.”\n\nThings rapidly escalated between 8 p.m. to 9 p.m, with footage showing the Itaewon streets – lined with clubs and bars blasting music – packed with revelers standing shoulder to shoulder, some pushing forward in a slow-moving wave.\n\nCrowds aren’t unusual for Seoul, or for the Itaewon area, which is often full of partygoers on weekends. Some experts have said this may have contributed to the disaster, with residents unaware of the danger because they were used to being in tightly packed crowds.\n\nIn a selfie video taken at 8:41 p.m., 22-year-old French exchange student Anne-Lou Chevalier and her friends laugh about the number of people as they wait in the middle of an unmoving crowd.\n\n“At the beginning we thought it was funny,” said Chevalier. “We heard Halloween in Itaewon was amazing.”\n\nCrowds began growing from the afternoon of October 29, and quickly swelled beyond control as night fell. Courtesy Song Sehyun\n\nBut unease soon set in. In a video taken just minutes later, the group’s laughter has taken on a nervous edge as one girl says, “Just try not to fall.” Another responds, “I’m scared.” Shortly after, Chevalier says, they began to feel crushed; she passed out and was evacuated, with a photo taken at 8:58 p.m. that shows her being lifted away from the crowd by two men.\n\nBy 9 p.m., an emergency caller urged police to “make an emergency dispatch now,” saying a “big accident could occur at any moment.”\n\nSeveral other callers around this time warned that people were being trampled on, describing the situation as “horrible.”\n\nOne caller, at 9:02 p.m., put it more bluntly: “Somebody is going to die.”\n\nFirst reports of death, as panic rises\n\nBy 9:30 p.m., the streets were crammed full; some people reported not even being able to exit the nearby subway station, with new partygoers still arriving in the area.\n\nBy now, the danger was apparent. Ian Chang, a 21-year-old university student from Florida, arrived in Itaewon around 9:40 p.m., planning to meet his friend Steven Blesi, another American exchange student – but the crowds were so severe he messaged Blesi at 10:17 p.m., urging him to avoid the area.\n\nIt’s not clear if his warning ever reached Blesi – one of the two American victims who died that night, the other being 20-year-old Anne Gieske from Kentucky.\n\nSometime before 10 p.m., Emily Farmer, a 27-year-old English teacher in Seoul, escaped into a bar after being “overwhelmed” by the crowds. Shortly after, she said, rumors began spreading that somebody had died and patrons were not allowed to leave.\n\nBy 10:21 p.m., some began taking desperate measures; a photo shows a man scaling a wall to escape, cheered on by bystanders unaware of what was happening.\n\nA man is seen scaling a building to escape the crowd below in Itaewon, Seoul, on October 29. Courtesy Yurim\n\nMinutes later, police began receiving reports of people being “buried” in the crowd.\n\n“At 10:23 p.m. we received more than five reports that people fell, and they could either get hurt or die,” a first responder told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.\n\nAuthorities rushed to the scene, where they saw up to “10 rows of faces – we couldn’t even see their legs,” said the first responder. They said workers pulled out the people in the bottom row first – but “when we laid them (on the ground), most of them were unconscious.”\n\nThe sheer volume of people also made it difficult for police to reach those who needed help. Video posted to social media showed people performing compressions on other partygoers lying on the ground as they waited for medical attention.\n\nSophia Akhiyat, an American doctor in Itaewon that night, was whisked to a side street after telling an officer she could possibly help.\n\n“I was completely overwhelmed but I started CPR on the first body I saw,” she said. “It was so chaotic because there were so many victims on the floor, along with foot traffic and partygoers and music blasting from surrounding restaurants and clubs that had no idea what was going on.”\n\nAdding to the confusion was the fact that most people were in costume that night – meaning some mistook police officers for fellow partygoers.\n\nOne 20-year-old eyewitness, who requested anonymity because she did not feel comfortable having her name published, said when an officer tried to direct the crowds, she heard someone ask: “Is he a real policeman?”\n\nBy 11:46 p.m., South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency had reported that dozens of people were receiving medical assistance after suffering from “cardiac arrest,” citing fire authorities. Photos show the road full of police cars, with officers cordoning off the area.\n\nAmbulances flood the scene, bodies retrieved\n\nAt 11:55 p.m., the Seoul metropolitan government sent an emergency alert to residents in the Itaewon area, requesting vehicles to turn away due to “an emergency accident near Hamilton Hotel.”\n\n“Citizens, please return home as soon as possible,” it read – which would be repeated in several more alerts in the following hours.\n\nThis was more than five hours after the first emergency call had come in, with reports of the disaster beginning to circulate widely on social media.\n\nAround 12:14 a.m., the country’s National Police Agency made its first report to agency chief Yoon Hee-keun, according to Yonhap.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol dispatched a disaster medical assistance team to Itaewon, ordering hospitals to prepare emergency beds.\n\nBy 12:30 a.m., the scale of the tragedy was becoming clear, with photos showing a line of blue body bags on the street, as first responders rushed the wounded onto stretchers and into ambulances.\n\nJust after 1 a.m., authorities released the first death toll of 59 killed as they worked frantically to transfer injured people to nearby hospitals, and bodies to multiple mortuaries.\n\nDuring those early hours, the city government began receiving a flood of missing persons reports, and launched the days-long effort to identify victims.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol holds an emergency meeting in the early hours of October 30. South Korean Presidential Office\n\nBy 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, as families across South Korea woke up to the news and began the agonizing search for their loved ones, the death toll had risen to 149.\n\nThat toll slowly ticked up over the following days as more people succumbed to their injuries, reaching the current figure of 156.\n\nNow, the initial panic and terror of that night has transformed into nationwide devastation and calls for accountability.\n\nOn Monday, authorities said they had no protocols in place for dealing with massive crowds without a specific organizer.\n\nAfterward, the prime minister said the disaster revealed South Korea’s “lack of deep institutional knowledge and consideration for crowd management.”\n\nA mourner pays tribute at a makeshift memorial near the site of the crush in Seoul on October 30. Kim Hong-ji/Reuters\n\nOn Tuesday, the national police chief admitted the police response to the emergency calls had been “inadequate.”\n\n“Through this incident, I feel deep responsibility for public safety and we will do our best to make sure such a tragedy as this does not occur again,” he said, announcing a special investigative team and promising transparency.\n\nThe investigation will include examining why police only made four dispatches ahead of the incident despite the high number of calls.\n\nBy Wednesday, that investigative unit raided local police stations across Seoul, seizing internal reports and documents relating to the emergency calls made that night.\n\nMeanwhile, the chief of the Yongsan police station – responsible for the district where Itaewon is located – was suspended and replaced.

Gramaglia said Wednesday. He told CNN’s Pamela Brown that it was a “tremendous” effort that also resulted in the recovery of a “substantial” number of bodies. The task included requests for welfare checks.\n\nGramaglia said he expects rising temperatures in the coming days will melt the snow and uncover more storm victims.\n\nAmid the frigid, whiteout conditions, “people … got stranded in their vehicles and passed away in their cars. We have people that were walking during blizzard conditions and passed away on the street, passed away in snowbanks,” Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said. “And we have people that were found that passed away in their homes.”\n\nNational Guard members check on Buffalo residents on Wednesday, December 28, 2022. Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n\nCrews continued to dig out roads across the Buffalo area as officials begged residents to stay off the road so they could coordinate deliveries of fuel to emergency crews and grocery supplies to markets.\n\nOfficials announced Wednesday evening they would lift a driving ban at 12:01 a.m. Thursday and replace it with a travel advisory.\n\nAnd a two-day effort that aims to clear at least one lane on every street for emergency responders remains hampered by hundreds of vehicles abandoned in the snow, hazardous driving conditions and snow-covered lanes, Poloncarz spokesperson Peter Anderson said Tuesday.\n\nThe county brought in 100 military police, plus New York State Police, to manage traffic control because too many people were ignoring the ban, Poloncarz said previously.\n\n3 deaths due to EMS delays\n\nThree reported deaths in Erie County were attributed to EMS delays, Poloncarz said Wednesday. In one of those cases, emergency responders could not get to the person because of the snow, he told CNN a day earlier.\n\n“They were blocked, and by the time they got there it was too late,” Poloncarz said.\n\nOne Buffalo EMT told CNN she was stuck in her ambulance for hours Friday after trying to respond to an emergency call during the snowstorm.\n\n“The main reason we were getting stuck is because there were cars in the way,” said Joycelyn Benton, an advanced EMT at American Medical Response of Western New York. The city of Buffalo contracts with the provider for ambulance services, an Erie County spokesperson told CNN.\n\nSnow blankets buildings in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday, December 28.

Two-thirds of the equipment dispatched to help clear winter snow during the height of the storm also got stuck, he said.\n\nPoloncarz was asked Wednesday about the timing of the driving ban, which went into effect Friday at 9:30 a.m. as the storm hit, and whether there had been discussion among officials about issuing such a ban earlier.\n\nOfficials started discussing a potential ban last Thursday, Poloncarz said, but they initially believed the snow band wouldn’t reach the Erie County until 10 a.m. the next morning. They opted to wait, in part, because officials wanted workers to be able to get home before temperatures dropped below freezing, he said.\n\nOn Friday morning, temperatures “dropped dramatically,” going from rain to sleet to snow within five minutes around 8:40 a.m., he said. Whiteout conditions didn’t occur until about 10 a.m., he noted, after the ban was issued.\n\n“But we have to take a lot into consideration,” Poloncarz said. “If anyone is to be blamed, you can blame me. I’m the one who has to make the final call on behalf of the county.”\n\nCity faces criticism over cleanup; mayor says city working hard\n\nPoloncarz, the county executive, on Wednesday criticized how Buffalo’s mayor has handled storm cleanup efforts, saying Brown has not been on daily coordination calls with other municipalities and that the city has been slow to reopen.\n\n“I am a city resident myself, I live in the city of Buffalo, and it pains me to see the other 25 towns and two small cities opened in times when the city isn’t,” Poloncarz said, adding that the county should take over cleanup efforts so the city can fully reopen.\n\nWhen asked about those remarks, the mayor dismissed the criticism, telling CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday evening, “I’m not concerned about those comments, my concern is for the residents of the city of Buffalo.”\n\n“I’ve just completed hours of touring neighborhoods throughout the city, watching the plowing operations,” Brown said, adding there were agencies from the city, county and state working in recovery efforts who have been doing a “great job working together, working around the clock.”\n\n“We believe that by tonight, we’ll have 100% of streets opened up in the city of Buffalo and it’s my hope to be able to lift the … driving ban before the start of business tomorrow,” Brown added.\n\nOther local leaders have urged a review of how the storm was handled.\n\nA person clears snow along a Buffalo road on Wednesday, December 28. Jeffrey T. Barnes/AP\n\nDozens of people rescued by National Guard\n\nThere were 580 New York National Guard soldiers and airmen on the ground Wednesday in the Buffalo area, according to the force’s public affairs office.\n\nThey have two separate missions: Teams of four soldiers go door-to-door to see if residents have power, heat and food – and distributing ready-to-eat meals, or MREs, and water as needed; and teams of two soldiers and two medical providers conduct wellness checks, spokesperson Eric Durr told CNN.\n\nAs of Tuesday, they had rescued at least 86 people “from hazardous situations,” according to a news release, including a woman taken to a hospital just before giving birth.\n\nSeparately, a member of the 105th Military Police Company “learned from his mother that a pregnant woman he was close to had gone into labor,” the release said.\n\n“He went to her home,” it said, “helped deliver the baby, then reported for duty.”\n\nPreparations for flooding\n\nMeantime, Buffalo faces a small risk of flooding as rising temperatures begin to melt the massive amount of snow and 2 inches of rain is forecast through the weekend, the National Weather Service said.\n\nBut “it should take around an inch of rain from this system before flooding becomes a concern,” the weather service said.\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced she directed state agencies to help support the affected communities with flood response resources.\n\nResources including generators, pumps and more than 700,000 sandbags were available for deployment from state stockpiles in Erie and Monroe counties, the release said.\n\nNationwide death toll rises\n\nIn Erie County, 29 who died were in the city of Buffalo, while seven were located in the suburbs, Poloncarz said Wednesday, adding he did not know where one person was found. Multiple bodies remain unidentified, Poloncarz added.\n\nHe has asked that anyone with a missing family member to call local police to help with the ID process.\n\nAmong the storm’s victims is Anndel Taylor, 22, whose family said she was found dead in Buffalo over the holiday weekend after getting trapped in her car by the blizzard.\n\nAfter losing contact with her, the family posted her location to a private Facebook page related to the storm to ask for help, and a man called to say he had found her without a pulse, her sister said.\n\nThe winter storm’s grim effects have been widespread, with at least 62 storm-related deaths reported across several states:\n\n• New York: In addition to the 37 deaths in Erie County, one fatal carbon monoxide poisoning was reported in Niagara County. The preliminary investigation indicates snow “covered the external furnace causing carbon monoxide to enter the residence,” the Niagara County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Wednesday, identifying the victim as 27-year-old Timothy M. Murphy of Lockport.\n\n• Colorado: Police in Colorado Springs reported two deaths related to the cold since Thursday, with one man found near a building’s power transformer, possibly seeking warmth, and another in a camp in an alleyway.\n\n• Kansas: Three people died in weather-related traffic accidents, the Highway Patrol said Friday.\n\n• Kentucky: Three people died, officials have said, including one involved in a vehicle crash in Montgomery County.\n\n• Missouri: One person died after a van slid off an icy road and into a frozen creek, Kansas City police said.\n\n• New Hampshire: A hiker was found dead in Franconia on Christmas morning, said Lt. James Kneeland, a spokesperson for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department.\n\n• Ohio: Nine people died as a result of weather-related auto crashes, including four in a Saturday morning crash on Interstate 75 when a tractor-trailer crossed the median and collided with an SUV and a pickup, authorities said.\n\n• South Carolina: Two men – including a 91-year-old who went outside on Christmas Day to fix a broken water pipe – died due to the storm in Anderson County, the coroner’s office there said. The other victim died on Christmas Eve after his home lost power.\n\n• Tennessee: The Department of Health on Friday confirmed one storm-related fatality.\n\n• Vermont: One woman in Castleton died after a tree fell on her home, according to the police chief.\n\n• Wisconsin: The State Patrol on Thursday reported one fatal crash due to winter weather.", "authors": ["Dakin Andone Nouran Salahieh Christina Maxouris", "Dakin Andone", "Nouran Salahieh", "Christina Maxouris"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}]}
